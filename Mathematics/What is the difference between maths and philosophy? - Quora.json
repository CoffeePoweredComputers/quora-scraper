            "answer_text": "There is a joke that goes as follows: Math Departments are cheap because all a mathematician needs is a pencil, paper and a wastebasket. Philosophy departments are even cheaper because you can skip the wastebasket. Although I think there is a grain of truth in this joke, I also feel it portrays philosophy in a far harsher light than it deserves. Post-modern deconstructionism, after all, constitutes only a very small portion of philosophy. Consider first what many mathematicians and philosophers do have in common: A love for knowledge, truth and reasonA dedication to clarity of thoughtA field of research which requires a lot of abstract thought, and a kind of abstract creativityAn appreciation for well-reasoned argumentsA commitment to question and especially identify hidden assumptions in argumentsIn some areas like formal philosophy, philosophy of physics, foundations of probability and philosophy mathematics, the activities of philosophers become increasingly mathematical, although the formal or mathematical methods are usually in the service of a goal that is primarily philosophical, rather than mathematical, in nature. To give a concrete example, I recently ran into this paper by the well-known philosopher of physics, David Malament, who published it in the Journal of Mathematical Physics and which is essentially indistinguishable from a work a mathematician might have written: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.523436 However, most areas of philosophy are far less mathematical, presenting arguments in the form of natural language. If I had to pin down the difference between philosophy and mathematics to one thing it would be this: Mathematicians work towards the goal of finding true answers to certain questions, while for philosophers that is (often) not the primary goal. The high degree of formalism and rigor in mathematics is not an end to itself, it is a means to ensure that the definite answer one reaches is correct. More than in any other field, it is possible in mathematics to unequivocally determine whether certain definite statements are true or false. Other fields, even the sciences, can only dream of this power of mathematics. For philosophers, it would be nice to find an unequivocally true definite answer to some philosophical problem, but it is in the nature of many philosophical conundra that they do not lend themselves to the kind of methods which yield definite and true answers. It should therefore not be surprising that many philosophical problems have been around for as long as millenia. Consider, for instance, a question that is actually part of my research: What, concretely, do we mean by \u201cexistence\u201d? How can one even begin to apply mathematical methods to something as open-ended as this? Clearly, one has to start with some basic assumptions, and already here disagreement (sometimes of the wild kind!) rears its head. Some philosophers think \u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d are the same, many do not; Some think \u201cexistence\u201d can be considered a predicate, others do not, some think \u201cpossible worlds\u201d different from ours \u201cexist\u201d on an equal footing as ours, others do not, and so on. In addition, the arguments may often involve nuances which are finer than what is possible to express in the language of mathematics. So, even if you just consider a particular philosophical theory and want to follow the mathematical path, you still have to translate it into that language, which can be another source of vehement disagreement because inevitably there is more than one way to formalize a highly nuanced concept. Even if you manage to get your philosophical theory through these stages, you may find that it gives you definite answers, but ones which are completely counter to common intuitions. See, for example, section 4 of this article on Deontic Logic which discusses some \u201cparadoxes\u201d which arise from formalizing some seemingly reasonable assumptions. Because intuitions are often the basic \u201cdata\u201d of philosophy, especially in ethics, that is a problem. In contrast, the basic assumptions, or axioms, of a mathematical field are widely agreed upon by mathematicians, as are the basic definitions, and if an answer contradicts our intuitions, so much the worse for our intuitions (see Banach\u2013Tarski paradox ). So these kind of difficulties that philosophers face don\u2019t even come up and one can focus just on the chains of deductive or mathematical reasoning. This power of mathematics does come at a price, however, and that is that the scope of the questions it can answer is far, far more restricted than the scope of philosophical questions. You are not going to see a theory which attempts to determine the truth or falsity of a proposition like \u201caction x is immoral\u201d as a piece of mathematics because the very notion of morality is far richer and nuanced than can be handled just with mathematics. As with many things, there is a tradeoff here: you can increase your power in unequivocally finding the truth only at the expense of restricting yourself to subjects which make doing so feasible. Consequently, the goals of philosophers, as well as their subjects of investigation, are much more varied than those of mathematicians. Some philosophers may develop and defend a theory or ocasionally solve a problem in a way that the solution is universally agreed to be right, but more often their activities boil down to clarifying assumptions, identifying mistakes in reasoning or hidden assumptions in an argument, presenting counterexamples, framing a problem in a new way, identifying new aspects of a problem or simply just pose new problems. While mathematicians may do any of the above in the course of their work, their primary goal is to prove theorems. ",

Here is my added 2\u00a2: It was often remarked about earlier times (100\u2019s of years ago) that there were only two major pursuits in the university: math and philosophy (both most often pursued together \u2026think Pythagoras or much later, Descartes). I taught math in high school (US) and have a degree in Scholastic Philosophy. As a HS math teacher, I made it a point to also teach philosophy\u2026even mysticism! I found ample points in all math, but especially geometry, to bring up philosophical questions. For instance, geometry is pretty much a system of definitions and provable theorems built upon undefinable terms and unprovable postulates or axioms. That alone gives one pause for philosophical thought. One of the undefined terms in geometry, the main one, is point. While we cannot define a point, be can describe it. One of the main descriptions of a point is that it does not take up space. Now, space is one of those terms that is definable. It is defined as the set of all points. We can easily gather from this that space is the set of all those things that do not take up space. WTF?! Space, as a not-so-mathematical concept, is what we all think of when we look at how much room a sofa will take up in our living room or where all the stars and galaxies reside. But, if we try to imagine space ending or not ending, we cannot, yet it seems it ought to be one or the other. If it is unending, it is inconceivable just as all infinities are. If it ends, well I will just stick my arm out and extend it by golly. Hmmm\u2026 One can hardly have a deeper thought than trying to conceive of these inconceivables - even if they get you nowhere. But, thinking deeply about things is what philosophy is all about. Not all efforts at deep or analytical thought get us nowhere. Math and philosophy each invite the other to share space. Their intersection will always be there. \u2026oh, the question: what is the difference? I guess that might be up to each to answer. Here\u2019s mine: since math can be purely conceptual in nature, pure mathematics or applied, applied mathematics. I would say that math is a part of philosophy as the philosophy of number. As it becomes applied, it becomes more its own branch of study. To understand this in a simple way, think of the number 2. No one has ever seen, heard, touched, tasted or heard the number two. But, we all have seen two people standing together. We have all seen it represented in written form, but that is only a representation, a symbol for the number 2. ",

            "answer_text": "A: They both deal with the same essential subject matter. But, only Philosophy puts value on Human Life \u2014 Maths does not.  Both - paradoxically - deal with the (very many) \u2018non-objects\u2019 that seem to \u2018exist\u2019 in the \u2018objective world.\u2019 Philosophy, however, distinctly asserts \u201cthe positive value of the human being\u201d as an undeniable axiom at the start. Maths, however, remains resolutely unconcerned with the \u201chuman being\u201d in-itself. Math only seems to care about how many of these supposedly \u201cimportant\u201d human beings there are.  Ironically enough, it is through Maths that we (human beings) discovered that many different things can be meant by \u201chuman being.\u201d Among other things, Math has revealed to us, for example, that you could mean \u201cone human being\u201d or you could mean \u201call human beings.\u201d (Or, frankly, you could even mean \u201csomewhere in the middle.\u201d) In other words, Maths helped Philosophy discover that one of its essential axioms has been left ill-defined. Are all human beings important? Are some human beings important? Or, is it that only one human being is important? And, most importantly, why?  P.S., It\u2019s also possible that (what Rebecca Goldstein calls) \u2018Philosophy-Jeerers\u2019 are right. These might be those people who (initially) reject the undeniable axiom of philosophy \u2014 thus, deeming it \u2018meaningless.\u2019 They might skeptically ask: \u201care \u2018human beings\u2019 \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 important?\u201d Since they do not \u201cknow\u201d this themselves, they might look out at the world to uncover the answer. However, they might (somewhere down the line) \u201cuncover an answer\u201d from an external force; and, therefore, be ruled by an external force. One that is (by their own definition) not \u201cobjective;\u201d but, rather, one that originates from a value-judgement that is not of their own (or, one of their own kind, to be frank). Viz., they might adopt the view that no human being \u2014 including themselves \u2014 is important. According to Math, this is merely a possible \u2018truth.\u2019 Philosophy, however, seems to elicit much (much) more emotional responses regarding the \u2018truth\u2019 of this claim. (Hint: Philosophy seems to elicit much (much) more human responses regarding the \u2018truth\u2019 of this claim.) ",

Every culture in every age deals with the same questions again and again; Penrose is doing again now as what Plato was doing in his period. Every human being is doing philosophy in a fundamental sense. Mathematics : Primarily mathematics is arithmetic and geometry. This is the basic source of human activity. It has been repeatedly investigated in all levels leading to a definite body of knowledge and methods. Compare the kind of mathematical knowledge of Greek in Plato's time and current knowledge. Even a high school student may have more mathematical knowledge than Plato even in geometry and arithmetic. But if I compare Penrose and Plato as philosophers I will consider Penrose to fall short.

You can have philosophy without maths, but you cannot have maths without philosophy. Philosophy is more fundamental than maths. The most fundamental type of philosophy is metaphysics which is concerned with what exists and how we are able to know what exists. What this means in practice is defining the relationship between consciousness and reality. Defining this relationship is a substantial undertaking involving profound philosophical assumptions. But this definition is done using natural language and not using maths. Only when you have decided whether or not reality exists independently of consciousness, can you start using mathematics to describe it. You cannot do maths, until you have done some philosophy\u2026 ",

Consequently, math is a system where the rules can be learned and where applications can be taught. Machines can be created to do math, and they are cranking out some fabulous results. Some have tried to correlate math with language and have thereby taught us more about the way we use language. Philosophers pay attention to such excursions. But language has subtleties that systems and machines cannot reproduce. So they are two different kinds of languages. Both worth learning. ",

In short, mathematics is about modeling phenomena and is used as an aid to scientific pursuit. It quantifies things in a descriptive way, but not just physical phenomena, it also has forms used in social modeling and even language studies themselves. Philosophy is also about modeling, and so often uses mathematics, but philosophy is all about the meaning behind the models, whereas mathematics is a tool used to structure the models. A high level of skill in mathematics and other languages is essential to the toolkit of the philosopher. ",
