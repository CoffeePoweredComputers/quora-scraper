X = 16-Y ................ equation 1 And total value of these items is 2X + 5Y = 50 From equation 1 putting value of X 2(16-Y) + 5Y = 50 32-2Y+5Y = 50 32+3Y = 50 3Y = 50-32=18 3Y = 18 Y = 6 Put this value in equation 1 X = 16-6= 10 I.e. he will buy 10 items worth $2 each and 6 items with worth $5 each.
