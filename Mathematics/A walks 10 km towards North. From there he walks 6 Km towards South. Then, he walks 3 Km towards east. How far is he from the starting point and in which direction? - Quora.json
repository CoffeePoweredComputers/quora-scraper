            "answer_text": "Hi ! I always prefer making a diagram for all such questions based on direction sense. Here you go:  The starting point here is A, then the path is A -> B -> C -> D (end point). Now as depicted in the question, AB = 10km, BC = 6km and CD = 3 km. By geometry, AC = AB - BC = 10 - 6 = 4 km. Now, AD is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ACD. Hence, AD\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 OR AD\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 OR AD\u00b2 = 25 Taking square roots, AD = 5 km. Thus, the end point D is 5km North east of the starting point. Hope this helps! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Let the starting point be \u2018O\u2019 (origin). He walks 10 km towards North and walks back by 6 km towards South. Let him reach the point \u2018A\u2019. Distance (OA) = 10\u20136=4 km. Further, he moves towards East by 3 km. Let this point be \u2018B\u2019. Thus, AB=3 km. Points O, A and B form a right angled triangle. OB being hypotenuse. OB = sqrt (OA^2+AB^2) =sqrt (4^2+3^2) = 5 . Thus, he is 5 km far from starting point in North-East direction. ",
