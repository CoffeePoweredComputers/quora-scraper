            "answer_text": "Most likely the ACT. There\u2019s only one math test, and the questions are relatively easy, but you have to do them quickly (60 questions in 60 minutes). The rest is reading and English grammar (again, you have to answer questions very quickly compared to how fast you have to on the SAT), and the science is mostly data interpretation (i.e., can you read a graph and think logically?). But you\u2019ll have to memorize the basic formulas the SAT gives you in a box at the beginning of each math section, since the ACT assumes you know them. On the plus side, the ACT will give you the more complex formulas in the question - indeed, many of those \u201cformula\u201d questions really test only your ability to plug the right number in for each variable, then do the arithmetic. In any event, PRACTICE. The ACT\u2019s curve has gotten steeper in recent years, probably because more/a higher percentage of college applicants are taking it than in the past, when compared to the SAT. So a performance that would have gotten you a certain score in the past may get you a lower score these days. I\u2019ve seen reading questions that were very hard (the distinction between two answers was very subtle - so kids who picked the second-best answer lost a point for what I see as no good reason). Make sure you practice the reading as well as the math, and also brush up on your grammar, logic and graph-reading skills. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "By far the best way to know for sure if the SAT or ACT is best for you is to get off of Quora and take one practice timed test of each format at home & score them. Then use a comparison chart from online to see which test you scored higher on. This is because it really depends HOW you are \u201cbad\u201d at math. My youngest is way stronger in English than math, and actually found the SAT was better for her. The ACT tends to have more Geometry on the math portion and gives you less time per question to answer than the SAT. The SAT is more Algebra based and gives you more time per question to answer than the ACT, but it does have a no calculator section. For her, she found the extra time on the SAT math section was valuable to double check her answers & she is also stronger in Algebra & Computation than Geometry. Finally, the Science section of the ACT has a somewhat misleading name. It should really be called the \u201creading charts and graphs\u201d section as it has very little to do with any actual science knowledge. You really need to take a look at this section to see if it would play into your strengths or not. My older college student who is majoring in science did submit the ACT for admissions and was pretty disappointed this section was not more science based and found she needed the most practice to get her timing/score where she wanted on this portion of the test. For my stronger English student, while she did fine on this section it only served to \u201cwater down\u201d her much higher scores on the English portions of the exam\u2026again, why she wound up utilizing the SAT format. Best of luck! ",
