            "answer_text": "Given 3x-2y=12 Assuming there are same number of scores in both x and y we can take means for the hole equation and taking expectation throughout the equation. Expectation is a linear operator so expectation of an expression is sum of expectations. E(3x-2y)=E(12) E(3x)-E(2y)=12 3E(x)-2E(y)=12 Here expectation and arithmetic means are similar terms. So, E(x)=6 On substituting, 3*6\u20132E(y)=12 18\u20132E(y)=12 2E(y)=18\u201312 2E(y)=6 E(y)=6/2 E(y)=3 ",
