            "answer_text": "Hey, The answer is 60. Method 1: To arrive at the answer, we can either list down all the multiples of 4 between 10 and 250 and count them. This however is a little time consuming. So, lets move onto the other alternatives. Method 2: First let us find the number of multiples of 4 between 1 and 10 which would be [math]10/4 = 2.5[/math] Number of multiples of 4 between 1 and 250 =[math] 250/4 = 62.5[/math] So, the number of multiples of 4 between 10 and 250 would be (Number of multiples of 4 between 1 and 250) - (Number of multiples of 4 between 1 and 10) [math]62.5 - 2.5 = 60[/math] Method 3: We need to find the number of multiples of 4 between 10 and 250. The list of numbers would be as follows: [math]12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40,........248.[/math] The above list is an arithmetic series/arithmetic progression where the first number is 12, the last number is 248 and the common difference between the numbers is 4. The nth term in an arithmetic sequence = a + (n-1)*d where a is the first term, d is the common difference. In the arithmetic series above, a =12, d = 4 and let us assume there are n terms and we need to find the value of n. We know that the value of the last term i.e. nth term is 248. So, [math]248 = 12 + (n-1)*4[/math] [math]248 = 12+ 4n - 4[/math] [math]248 = 4n+8[/math] [math]248\u20138 = 4n[/math] [math]240 = 4n[/math] [math]n = 240/4 = 60[/math] Thus, 248 is the 60th term in the series and hence there are 60 terms in the series. Therefore number of multiples of 4 between 10 and 250 is 60. Hope this helps. ",

(n-1).4= 248\u201312=236 n-1=236/4=59 n=59+1=60. so 60 multiples of 4 lie between 10 and 250. ",
