            "answer_text": "To quote Alf van der Poorten (1996) \u201cOne of the difficulties of mature mathematics is its immense vocabulary\u201d. Simple algebraic symbols enable the production of proofs much more readily than can words in English, French, German, Latin etc. Try to write the distributive law a*(b+c) =a*b + a*c in English and then prove (a + b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2 without using any mathematical notation! Mathematical \tsymbols, when learned, can provide a powerful basis for solving \tmathematical problems. Learning how to understand equations and \trelated symbols are essential, but need not be joyless. For example, try the following puzzle. \u201cThe sum of two numbers is \teight and their difference is six. What are the numbers?\u201d Now try to solve x + y = 8 and x \u2013 y = 6, from which x = 7 and y = 1. \tSimple given the (very) basic knowledge base. The language of mathematics tends to be more challenging than those of the sciences. Science tends to introduce new words such as \u201cdark matter\u201d, for example or words that have well known initial meanings to the layman that can be built upon. Not only is there a specialist scientific vocabulary consisting of words which are recognizably unfamiliar but there are familiar words such as \u2018energy\u2019, \u2018power\u2019 and \u2018force\u2019 which must acquire new meanings. For example, young students are already very familiar with the term \u2018gas\u2019 and are ready to build on that familiarity by acquiring scientific uses of the word. In scientific writing, unnecessarily confusing words are often labelled as \u201cjargon\u201d in the pejorative use of the word. The argument by scientific writing scholars is that scientific language need not be obscure. For some audiences, the jargon can be eliminated entirely and replaced with simpler language, while preserving most of the meaning, though a revised version will tend to be longer than an original. In contrast to science, mathematical language can be much more demanding and removed from the everyday meanings of words. Phrases such as \u201celliptic curves\u201d, \u201cmodular forms\u201d, \u201ccommutative rings\u201d, \u201cNoetherian rings\u201d, \u201ca \ufb01nite extension of Q\u201d, surjective\u201d etc. None of which will mean much to an intelligent, new reader, without prior preparation. Such preparation, however, can open up the new worlds of higher mathematics Paradoxically, when mastered, mathematical language can really efficiently express complex concepts, when compared with natural languages. (See above for the use of algebra to enhance problem solving.) The conclusion is that mathematical language can be significantly more demanding than comparable scientific languages. But it is not just mathematical language that can be demanding, but also the growing growth of more and more complex concepts that need to be assimilated by a student of any topic within mathematics. As Barry Mazur (2006) has commented: \u201cOn theorems having been proved, more further reaching problems come to prominence.\u201d As Alf van der Poorten observed (1996) \u201cOne of the difficulties of reading mature mathematics is the volume of notions that seems to be required. No one can readily discover the meaning of the more popular ideas because all too often they are defined in terms of yet more obscure words. . . few \u2013 perhaps none \u2013 of us know all the definitions.\u201d So, whilst earlier scientific concepts are replaced by later scientific concepts that may or may not seem more complex, earlier mathematical proofs are augmented by later and even more complex proofs that might also cast light on our understanding of these earlier proofs. In physics, important theories can be described in either mathematical terms or in language or both. A particularly striking demonstration of this point is provided by the field equations of Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity. The mathematics may look terrifying but the cosmological solutions, expressed in words, are relatively simple. I think I\u2019ll stop here. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a deep question. Some basic concepts in both seem to be wired deep in the brain, and not in the same places. Ordinary language contains some primitive mathematical concepts but they are very difficult to use for analysis. Similarly mathematics stripped of ordinary language is hard to explain or understand. Even the densest mathematics texts have lots of words in them. This is one of the barriers to artificial intelligence. It\u2019s easy to teach computers math, hard to teach them ordinary language. I\u2019m not sure there is a connection at the base of things, they may be parallel systems. Of course you can model language mathematically and get great insight that way, also people can write great literature about mathematics. But these are synergies, not connections. The major difference I can see is that mathematics built up from the basic concepts mostly by logic. It feels as if \u201cGod is a mathematician,\u201d in the sense that results that seem elegant from a pure mathematical point of view seem to describe the universe and anticipate empirical discoveries. We seem to be discovering mathematics, not inventing it. Language is built up using a system we only dimly grasp. It feels more like we are inventing it rather than discovering it. No one has ever anticipated a physical discovery, as far as I know, because it sounded good when spoken. If mathematics is our bridge to understanding the universe, language may be the bridge to understanding ourselves. ",

You have symbols with meaning\u2026 things like \u201c+\u201d (addition), \u201c*\u201d (multiplication or \u2018product\u2019), \u2026 or also \u201cfor all\u201d, \u201cbelongs to\u201d, \u201cintersection\u201d, \u201cunion\u201d, \u201cintegral\u201d, \u201cderivative\u201d or \u201cequal\u201d. Any mathematical expression is a sequence of symbols, like written language is a sequence of letters and punctuation\u2026 Encoding of symbols. Any written or spoken language use symbols that can be translated to numbers\u2026 That\u2019s what computers do, your question is transmitted using Internet, a digital network, which sends digital information. And \u201cdigital\u201d comes from \u201cdigit\u201d, that is, numbers. As a matter of fact, in french language, the word \u201cdigital\u201d is said \u201cnum\u00e9rique\u201d, and that means numerical\u2026 so french speakers say numerical networks or numerical devices\u2026 to refer to digital networks or digital devices (like computers or GSM phones). All the letters in your Quora question are just coded with numbers and treated as numbers\u2026 Logic. The language we humans use has logical elements\u2026 things like \u201cimplies\u201d or \u201cthen\u201d or \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, \u201cnot\u201d \u2026 and that\u2019s basically equivalent to pure math: Boolean Algebra. Natural Language Processing. This is an Artificial Intelligence area, and it mostly uses maths, but it uses maths to process human language, natural language. For example, Gmail detects wether an email (text) is SPAM or not\u2026 using maths. Another example: digital assistants like Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant use voice recognition techniques and that is based on maths\u2026 maths used to process language.

            "answer_text": "It is impossible to answer this question comprehensively, as it is extremely broad, but I'll offer some insights: SyntaxSyntax is the study of the structure of language, and the constraints .  Nearly all modern syntactic theories are \"mathematical\" in nature.  Noam Chomsky's transformational-generative grammar formalizes language in terms of recursive trees, for example.  Recursive approaches such as this are foundational in many areas of computer science, such as automata and programming language theory. SemanticsSemantics is the study of meaning.  It attempts to describe the ways in which one derives meaning from a string of signals (words, phrases, etc.).  Logical semantics uses logic to do this.  Logic and mathematics are obviously very closely related. Statistical ApproachesIn the past two decades, computational linguists have largely transitioned to statistical approaches to processing language.  Let's say that you want to automatically build a bilingual dictionary between English in German.  One way of doing this is the simply accumulate a large number of sentences that appear both in English and in German and match the words and phrases and occur together the most often.  This would be a statistical approach to word alignment. Mathematical LanguageWriting mathematics itself requires a set of symbols that can combine in certain ways (syntax) to build meaning (semantics) I haven't even scratched the surface, but these are a few anecdotal ways in which mathematics and language are related.

Knowing all the words\u2019 meaning and pronunciations don\u2019t make you a speaker while learning all the axioms and theorems don\u2019t make you a mathematician because both are a system. You must learn and review examples ,movies\u2019 dialogues and etc. For math you must review and learn axioms and theorems through problems. \u2022\tLearning words\u2019 meaning and pronunciation requires repetition until listening a word have the same meaning to you to listening it\u2019s translation.

In math if you be drowned in calculations you will loose right track of thinking. \u2022\tBut about creativity: you may say learning a language is all about memorization but math is logic.

Proposition: If x is an odd integer thenx2x2 is odd. Proof: Suposse x is odd. Then x=2a+1x=2a+1, for some integer a, by definition of an odd integer. (2a+1)2=4a2+4a+1=2(2a2+2a)+1.(2a+1)2=4a2+4a+1=2(2a2+2a)+1. Since (2a2+2a)(2a2+2a) is an integer, (2a+1)2=x2(2a+1)2=x2 is odd by definition of an odd integer. The proof is complete. The language used in the proof establishes a direction (from proposition to conclusion), supplies definitions for terms, and lays out a logical sequence of steps that supports the conclusion. ",
