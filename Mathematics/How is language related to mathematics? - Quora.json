            "answer_text": "To quote Alf van der Poorten (1996) \u201cOne of the difficulties of mature mathematics is its immense vocabulary\u201d. Simple algebraic symbols enable the production of proofs much more readily than can words in English, French, German, Latin etc. Try to write the distributive law a*(b+c) =a*b + a*c in English and then prove (a + b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2 without using any mathematical notation! Mathematical \tsymbols, when learned, can provide a powerful basis for solving \tmathematical problems. Learning how to understand equations and \trelated symbols are essential, but need not be joyless. For example, try the following puzzle. \u201cThe sum of two numbers is \teight and their difference is six. What are the numbers?\u201d Now try to solve x + y = 8 and x \u2013 y = 6, from which x = 7 and y = 1. \tSimple given the (very) basic knowledge base. The language of mathematics tends to be more challenging than those of the sciences. Science tends to introduce new words such as \u201cdark matter\u201d, for example or words that have well known initial meanings to the layman that can be built upon. Not only is there a specialist scientific vocabulary consisting of words which are recognizably unfamiliar but there are familiar words such as \u2018energy\u2019, \u2018power\u2019 and \u2018force\u2019 which must acquire new meanings. For example, young students are already very familiar with the term \u2018gas\u2019 and are ready to build on that familiarity by acquiring scientific uses of the word. In scientific writing, unnecessarily confusing words are often labelled as \u201cjargon\u201d in the pejorative use of the word. The argument by scientific writing scholars is that scientific language need not be obscure. For some audiences, the jargon can be eliminated entirely and replaced with simpler language, while preserving most of the meaning, though a revised version will tend to be longer than an original. In contrast to science, mathematical language can be much more demanding and removed from the everyday meanings of words. Phrases such as \u201celliptic curves\u201d, \u201cmodular forms\u201d, \u201ccommutative rings\u201d, \u201cNoetherian rings\u201d, \u201ca \ufb01nite extension of Q\u201d, surjective\u201d etc. None of which will mean much to an intelligent, new reader, without prior preparation. Such preparation, however, can open up the new worlds of higher mathematics Paradoxically, when mastered, mathematical language can really efficiently express complex concepts, when compared with natural languages. (See above for the use of algebra to enhance problem solving.) The conclusion is that mathematical language can be significantly more demanding than comparable scientific languages. But it is not just mathematical language that can be demanding, but also the growing growth of more and more complex concepts that need to be assimilated by a student of any topic within mathematics. As Barry Mazur (2006) has commented: \u201cOn theorems having been proved, more further reaching problems come to prominence.\u201d As Alf van der Poorten observed (1996) \u201cOne of the difficulties of reading mature mathematics is the volume of notions that seems to be required. No one can readily discover the meaning of the more popular ideas because all too often they are defined in terms of yet more obscure words. . . few \u2013 perhaps none \u2013 of us know all the definitions.\u201d So, whilst earlier scientific concepts are replaced by later scientific concepts that may or may not seem more complex, earlier mathematical proofs are augmented by later and even more complex proofs that might also cast light on our understanding of these earlier proofs. In physics, important theories can be described in either mathematical terms or in language or both. A particularly striking demonstration of this point is provided by the field equations of Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity. The mathematics may look terrifying but the cosmological solutions, expressed in words, are relatively simple. I think I\u2019ll stop here. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a deep question. Some basic concepts in both seem to be wired deep in the brain, and not in the same places. Ordinary language contains some primitive mathematical concepts but they are very difficult to use for analysis. Similarly mathematics stripped of ordinary language is hard to explain or understand. Even the densest mathematics texts have lots of words in them. This is one of the barriers to artificial intelligence. It\u2019s easy to teach computers math, hard to teach them ordinary language. I\u2019m not sure there is a connection at the base of things, they may be parallel systems. Of course you can model language mathematically and get great insight that way, also people can write great literature about mathematics. But these are synergies, not connections. The major difference I can see is that mathematics built up from the basic concepts mostly by logic. It feels as if \u201cGod is a mathematician,\u201d in the sense that results that seem elegant from a pure mathematical point of view seem to describe the universe and anticipate empirical discoveries. We seem to be discovering mathematics, not inventing it. Language is built up using a system we only dimly grasp. It feels more like we are inventing it rather than discovering it. No one has ever anticipated a physical discovery, as far as I know, because it sounded good when spoken. If mathematics is our bridge to understanding the universe, language may be the bridge to understanding ourselves. ",
