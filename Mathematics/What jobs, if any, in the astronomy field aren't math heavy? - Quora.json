            "answer_text": "Hate to tell you, but most physical science fields require mucho mathematics. I would have loved to have been an astronomer, MD or physicist if I could have gotten past the math which you will mostly never use because you have computers and math majors to figure it out for you. Do you think Stephen Hawking did his own math? He didn\u2019t. However, he must know at a minimum how to do the math to prove his theories. Even a doctor must know and use algebra to figure out the time between the size of the cervix opening verses the time between contractions to determine the time of birth of a baby. However, he does not do the math. He just inputs the factors and waits for an answer from a computer. Conversely, not all mathematicians can connect the math to the theory. They may be masters of numbers and formulas who may have difficulty applying it to theory. So, is there a place for you, a non math major in astronomy? I doubt it. I welcome opinions of people better equipped to answer your question. I would also like to know the answer myself. Addendum: At 8 years old I learned about the structure of an atom being mostly space than mass and I told my uncle that \u201cspace is like an atom because it too is mostly space\u201d He was amazed at the implication of my analogy from an 8 yr old. I further went on to tell him that perhaps our universe is an atom of another universe. Perhaps the atoms in our universe are universes within universes\u2026. Infinitely macro and micro. That notion was later a discussion by physicists years later. He thought I should go to MIT. I tried, but I could not get past the math requirements. In a way, I had a lazy brain. I hated the mental work of math. It was like mental push ups. As I became a teenager I was introduced to marijuana which made it worst. Young people, THC and math don't mix. It destroys short term abstract and complex thinking. I still became successful in life, but I had not reached my best. Perhaps I wasn\u2019t meant to. ",

            "answer_text": "Astronomers don\u2019t spend much time looking through telescopes anymore - most of them probably never get near a telescope. They are analysing data that comes back from the telescopes - and that is software - and math. Sadly, without a strong background in mathematics - you\u2019re not going to make much of an astronomer. Even if you could somehow find a role where you didn\u2019t have to do math - you\u2019d need to read and understand journals about astronomy that are PACKED with heavy math. When people here said \u201cJanitor\u201d\u2026well, that might not be far from the truth. ",

Anything dealing with astronomy requires a high level of math skill. One needn\u2019t be an expert, but knowing the math is really one of the only ways to understand what the field is saying. It gives one a firm grasp of the discipline and a perspective that are otherwise not possible. ",
