            "answer_text": "Yeah it\u2019s pretty close \u2026 close enough to pass as 5\u20329\u2033, or at least according to me. If you were to grow 1 more centimeter then that would make you 175 cm which is just a smidge under 5\u20329\u2033 \u2026 175.26 centimeters is 5\u20329\u2033 so you'd have to grow another 1.26 centimeters to reach 5\u20329\u2033. However, if you are 16 years old and you are a girl then you most likely have stopped growing. So yeah, your height now is most likely you final adult height. But to get back to the point, yes, 5\u20328 1/2\u2033 (174 cm) is pretty close to 5\u20329\u2033 (175.26 cm). ",

Both would be rather short for adult males, but are somewhat kind-of tall for females. You said you are a 16 year old girl, so you are considered somewhat tall (though unlikely to grow much more at your current age). Congrats! ",
