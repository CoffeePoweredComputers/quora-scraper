            "answer_text": "Firstly, the question is not clear. Because I am in confusion wheather the price of each orange is Rs 30 or the whole lot of 32 oranges are sold in Rs 30. I am solving the above question by considering selling price of indivisual orange is Rs 30. So total revenue from 32 oranges will be 32*30 = 960(In which he is incurring a loss of 25%) So Rs 960 will be 75% of total cost Total cost = (100/75)* 960 = 1280 If the seller wants to make a benefit of 20%, his total revenue should be 20% more than total cost. Total revenue= 1280 + (20/100) * 1280 = 1536 If he sells orange Rs 24 each, The number of orange he needs to sell is 1536/24 = 64 So, answer is 64. Hope the answer will be satisfactory. Thank you ",
