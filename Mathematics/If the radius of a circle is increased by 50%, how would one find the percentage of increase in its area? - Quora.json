            "answer_text": "If the radius of a circle is increased by 50%, how would one find the percentage of increase in its area? Increasing the radius by 50% gives a new radius of 150/100 compared to the old radius. This simplifies to 3/2. As you are working with squared numbers when you deal with area, you should used the fraction (3/2)^2, which is 9/4. If you multiply the numerator and denominator by 25 (so that the denominator is 100), you arrive at 225/100, an increase of 125% ",
