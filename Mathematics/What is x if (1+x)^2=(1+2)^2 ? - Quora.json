We get, 4x-2x is the term (4*2=8, 4\u20132=2) Now we rewrite the equation by replacing 2x by 4x-2x This=> x^2+4x-2x-8=0 Taking out common factors, x(x+4)-2(x+4)=0 Now, distinguishing the two roots. we get, (x-2)(x+4)=0 => either x-2=0 or x+4=0 => x=+2 or x=-4. Therefore, x=2,-4. ",

Take the square root of both sides to leave 1+x = 1+2.Subtract 1 from both sides.x=2.Alternatively, you could tell this by induction; the right side is the same in form as the left, with just one number missing on said left. Therefore, it\u2019s likely that the missing variable is its comparable integer on the other side.",
