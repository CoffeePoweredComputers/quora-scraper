            "answer_text": "Rational numbers can be made arbitrarily small lets take 1/n as an example. Imaging there is a least rational number greater than sqrt(3). That means there is a non zero difference between them. I can always find an n such that 1/n is smaller than that difference. Now i get a smaller rational number by subtracting 1/n. Since difference between two rationals is another rational. This is greater than sqrt(3) which is a contradiction ",

            "answer_text": "The rationals are dense in any non-empty interval. Since sqrt(3) is irrational, given any rational q1, the interval (sqrt(3), q1) is non empty. Then there is a rational q2 such that sqrt(3)<q2<q1. So there is no least rational Q greater than sqrt(3) because given one rational greater than sqrt(3) you can always find a smaller one also greater than sqrt(3). ",
