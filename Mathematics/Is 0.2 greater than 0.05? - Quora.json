            "answer_text": "I will tell you a simple way to figure out which number is greater. You have to make the given decimal number into whole number by multiplying and dividing with multiple of 10. Then we can compare the whole number which is greater and which is less. In above question the numbers are 0.2 & 0.05 First multiply and divide with 100 to make numerator part free from decimal point. Next, since the denominator part is equal, compare the numerator. 0.2 * 100 / 100 =0.05 * 100 / 100 20 / 100 = 5 / 100 Compare numerator 20 is greater than 5 Therefore 0.2 is greater than 0.05.

            "answer_text": "Yes. To know this, you should give the decimals the same amount of numbers after the decimal point. To make this the case, make 0.2 become 0.20. Don't worry, they have exactly the same value. This is one of the reasons why decimals are so different to integers, decimal numbers can have 2 million digits after the decimal point, but it could be smaller than a decimal number with 1 digit after the decimal point. ANYWAY, now 0.2 and 0.05 will be easier to compare. 20 is bigger than 5 so here you go\u2026. 0.2\u2019s value is bigger than 0.05\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "The two simple methods to guess the answer are, First:- Consider You wana check if LHS > RHS or not. Put 0.2 on LHS nand 0.05 on RHS. Now multiply 100 on both the sides. Since we are doing multiplication on both the side, it's fine to do so. 0.2*100 =20=LHS 0.05*100 = 5=RHS So this shows LHS is greater than RHS. It means 0.2 is greater than 0.05. Second:- We can easily do this by using number line.  You can see number in the photo. The more you move on thr RHS side, greater the number will become. The more you move on the LSH side, smaller the number become. So 0.2 comes after the 0.05 on the RHS side. This also proves that 0.2 is greater than 0.05. Thanks! ",

You can omit the decimel in both number by putting the digits below them .Here it becomes 02/10 and 005/100 Now you can self evaluate it If we divide 2 into 10 parts and divide 5 into 100 parts Which will be greater? Oviously 2/10 So in this way 0.2 is greater than 0.05. Hope you understand! ",

Now I think one can understand that it means in 1st case we get 5 pieces from one Apple whereas in 2nd case we get 20 pieces of a Apple. Now, just think that the Apple which has been cut into 5 pieces has a greater piece than the Apple which has been cut into 20 pieces. Therefore, 0.2 is greater than 0.05 Thanks. ",
