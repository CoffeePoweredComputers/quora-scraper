            "answer_text": "Hello ! The situation can be described as below :  The starting point is S, from which the man walks 8 km in the north direction uptp B. Then he turn 60 degrees in the clockwise direction to north and travels for 5 km to reach the end point E. The required distance between starting and ending points is denoted by SE. Let us first observe that by the geometry of the figure ASBE (which is clearly a rectangle), AS = BC and BS = AC = 8 km. Now, In triangle EBC, sin30 = EC/EB OR EC = EB*sin30 = 5*(1/2) = 2.5 km. Also, cos30 = BC/EB OR BC = AS = (\u221a3/2)*5 = 5\u221a3/2 = 4.33 km. AE = AC + EC = 8 + 2.5 = 10.5 km. Required value ES can now be found by using Pythagoras theorem. ES\u00b2 = AS\u00b2 + AE\u00b2 OR ES\u00b2 = (10.5\u00b2) + (4.33\u00b2) OR ES\u00b2 = 129 OR ES = 11.35 km. Thus, the distance from the start point = 11.35 in the North East direction. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on the given datas, an obtuse triangle was formed having interior angles of 22.4degrees, 37.6 degrees and 120 degrees and the length of 3 sides are a=5km, b=8km and the longest side is c=11.36km. Side a opposite interior angle is 22.4 degrees, b whose opposite interior angle of 37.6 degrees and c whose opposite interior angle of 120 degrees Therefore the distance from the starting point is side C which is 11.36 km. Using sine law: C/sine 120=5/sine 22.4 C/.866=5/.3810 0.3810C=5x0.866=4.33 C=4.33/0.3810=11.36km ",
