            "answer_text": "Calculate [math]f(2)[/math], by substituting the value 2 into the polynomial everywhere that [math]x[/math] occurs. Do the same for [math]f(3)[/math]. You will find that one value is negative, and the other is positive. Because polynomials are all continuous, the intermediate value theorem tells you that somewhere in between, the value of the polynomial must reach zero. You\u2019re not required to find it, just show that it must exist; that\u2019s what the theorem guarantees. The steps above are satisfying the conditions of the IVT. ",
