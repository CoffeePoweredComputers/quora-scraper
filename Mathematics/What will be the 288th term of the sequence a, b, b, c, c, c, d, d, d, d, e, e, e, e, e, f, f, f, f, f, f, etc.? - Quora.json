By observation, 1 ends at 1st term, 2 ends at 3rd term, 3 ends at 6th term, 4 ends at 10th term and 5 ends at 15th term. So we see that a number \u2019n\u2019 ends at \u2018n(n+1)/2\u2019th term. Calculating, \u2019n\u2019 turns out to be 24 in this case which ends at 300th term. 24th alphabet = x ",
