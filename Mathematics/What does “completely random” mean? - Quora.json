            "answer_text": "Completely random, in this case, means impossible to predict. I am not sure about every lottery, but one popular method is to have a large number of balls, each identical except for a number, in a rotating container. Then balls are picked out. Could this system be rigged? Sure. You could weight the balls differently, for instance. But, if it done correctly, this is completely random. ",

If you knew all the variables, you could predict the outcome. But no one on earth knows all the variables, so no one could predict them. Of course I could come up with a very predictable lottery: it would use a deterministic pseudorandom algorithm to come up with the numbers. If you knew the algorithm and the seed, you'd know the numbers. ",
