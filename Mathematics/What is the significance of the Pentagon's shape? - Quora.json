            "answer_text": "The original plot of land the Pentagon was supposed to be built on was roughly pentagonal in shape. To maximize the use of the land, the building as designed as an irregular pentagon. The site was moved on the orders of President Roosevelt. Since the building was already designed, the simply modified the design to be a regular pentagon. The name simply is derived from the shape. Before the Pentagon was built, the United States Department of Warwas headquartered in the Munitions Building, a temporary structure erected during World War I along Constitution Avenue on the National Mall. The War Department, which was a civilian agency created to administer the U.S. Army, was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. In the late 1930s a new War Department Building was constructed at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem and ended up being used by the Department of State. [10] When World War II broke out in Europe, the War Department rapidly expanded in anticipation that the United States would be drawn into the conflict. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimsonfound the situation unacceptable, with the Munitions Building overcrowded and the department spread out. [11] [12] Stimson told U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in May 1941 that the War Department needed additional space. On July 17, 1941, a congressional hearing took place, organized by Virginia congressman Clifton Woodrum, regarding proposals for new War Department buildings. Woodrum pressed Brigadier General Eugene Reybold, who was representing the War Department at the hearing, for an \"overall solution\" to the department's \"space problem\" rather than building yet more temporary buildings. Reybold agreed to report back to the congressman within five days. The War Department called upon its construction chief, General Brehon Somervell, to come up with a plan. [13]  Main Navy Building (foreground) and the Munitions Building were temporary structures built during World War I on the National Mall. The Munitions Building served as the Department of War headquarters for several years before moving into the Pentagon.  Southwesterly view of the Pentagon in 1998, with the Potomac Riverand Washington Monument in background. Government officials agreed that the War Department building, officially designated Federal Office Building No 1, should be constructed across the Potomac River, in Arlington County, Virginia. Requirements for the new building were that it be no more than four stories tall, and that it use a minimal amount of steel. The requirements meant that, instead of rising vertically, the building would be sprawling over a large area. Possible sites for the building included the Department of Agriculture's Arlington Experimental Farm, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and the obsolete Hoover Field site. [14] The site originally chosen was Arlington Farms which had a roughly pentagonal shape, so the building was planned accordingly as an irregular pentagon. [15] Concerned that the new building could obstruct the view of Washington, D.C., from Arlington Cemetery, President Roosevelt ended up selecting the Hoover Airport site instead. [16] The building retained its pentagonal layout because a major redesign at that stage would have been costly, and Roosevelt liked the design. Freed of the constraints of the asymmetric Arlington Farms site, it was modified into a regular pentagon which resembled the star forts of the gunpowder age.

            "answer_text": "If you're referring to the US Department of Defense headquarters, They wanted a massive building, but not a tall one, since steel was critically needed for the war effort. They couldn't build it in DC since there wasn't enough space, so they found an area in Arlington, VA, just across the Potomac river from DC.  In order to get all the space they needed, a square or rectangle would've proven too unyeildly.  Drawing inspiration from the bodies of water that bound the area that they planned to build it, they decided on an irregular pentagon for the shape. How the Pentagon Got Its Shape The Pentagon is the largest Office building, at least in the US, with at least 20,000 people coming in and out on a daily basis. ",
