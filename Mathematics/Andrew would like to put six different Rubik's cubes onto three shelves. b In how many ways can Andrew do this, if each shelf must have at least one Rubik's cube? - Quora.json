            "answer_text": "This can be treated as a \u201cstars and bars\" problem. We have 6 stars (rubik's cubes) and we need to place 2 bars in between them, so as to split them into 3 groups - top shelf, middle shelf and bottom shelf. Examples: *|**|*** = 1 top, 2 middle, 3 bottom **|***|* = 2 top, 3 middle, 1 bottom We require at least 1 on each shelf, so there are 5 possible positions for placing the first bar, any of: *|*|*|*|*|* After we place the first bar, there will be 4 positions where we can place the second bar. So that's 5x4 = 20 possibilities. However, we can pick the same pattern 2 different ways, depending on which of the bars we place first. So allowing for that, there are 5x4/2 = 10 patterns. So there are 10 different ways to arrange them on 3 shelves with at least one cube on each shelf. ",
