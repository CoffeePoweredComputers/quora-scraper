            "answer_text": "So this may be a tad overly simplistic of a way to look at it but - combinatorics is essentially \u201chow to count things that work in predictable ways\u201d and graph theory has lots of constructions that operate in predictable ways and that need to be counted. A lot of graph theory is also probabilities, but this sort of probability is essentially the number of ways a certain construction can happen divided by the number of total possible constructions of that size - both numbers which are usually arrived at through combinatorial counting techniques.
