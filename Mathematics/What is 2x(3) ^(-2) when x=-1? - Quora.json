            "answer_text": "What is 2x(3) ^(-2) when x=-1? This one looks fiddly because under the order of operations, brackets are meant to be resolved first, then exponents. So I guess that 3^-2 ought to be calculated first. That is actually 1/9. Then you have 2x*(1/9) which would be -2*(1/9) which would be -(2/9) However, it\u2019s easy to read it as -2*3=-6, then -6^-2 which I think is 1/36 (even though my calculator says -(1/36). Depending on how it\u2019s done, I reckon it could be -(2/9) or 1/36. Feedback appreciated, please. ",
