            "answer_text": "In a layman terms A and 10 would be higher as A is considered as the highest card.. But also there is a game known as 2 PATTI in which there are 2 cards distributed and 3rd one has to be assumed so in this case if we compare the question that would be:- A and 10 if they are of same color and pattern preferably one would choose a king of same pattern and color so as to make it a proper Color collection. As there is nothing much possible to make a sequence or a pair of 3. J and Q the person would automatically choose K and make it a sequence preferably a color sequence hence in this game the latter would win. So in the nutshell normally the A is the highest card until the opponent has some kind of a color, pair or a sequence\u2026 THANKS FOR A2A\u263a\ufe0f:,-) ",
