            "answer_text": "With foci at (0,-1) and (0,1), which means c=1, we also know that the center is at the origin and that the ellipse lies with the axis of symmetry along the y-axis. This means that the vertices are at (0,-4) and (0,4), and a=4. The equation of an ellipse is  for an ellipse lying along the y-axis. For an ellipse, , so , which means b^2=15.  is the equation you seek. ",
