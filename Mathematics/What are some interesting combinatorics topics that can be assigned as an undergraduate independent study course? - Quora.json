            "answer_text": "Generating functions are a good thing to learn since they're used in other fields as well as combinatorics. Wilf writes well and you can almost hear him talk as you read the book.  He really enjoys combinatorics and looks for the perfect way to understand how to count things.  I'm not up on the other topic you mentioned, automatic discovery and proof of combinatorial identities, but it certainly sounds interesting.  Automatic proof generation has ties to logic and artificial intelligence that you may find interesting. I don't think that you could go wrong with either one of them, but you might want to take advantage of your professor's specialty.  If he's doing work in one of those topics now, choose that one. ",
