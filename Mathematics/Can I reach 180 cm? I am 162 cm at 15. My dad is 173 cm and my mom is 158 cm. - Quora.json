            "answer_text": "No one can tell you how tall you will be. What I can tell you is that statistically the average boy in the USA who had parents with those heights would end up 172 cm. (EBMcalc Medical Calculator) What that means is that 50% would be 172 cm or taller and 50% would be 172 cm or shorter. About 3% would be taller than 180.5 cm and 3% would be shorter than 163.5 cm. The distribution of heights follows a bell shaped curve (Frank Butera's post in Height & Puberty ). So, from a statistical point of view, you have about a 5% chance of reaching 180 cm. You might get some idea how much growth you have left by figuring out where you are in your pubertal development. (Tanner Stages of Puberty) Growth stops when puberty is complete, as the hormones play a large role in closing the bone\u2019s growth plates. The final stage of puberty is called Tanner Stage 5. The average age boys reach Tanner 5 is 15 - 17 years old and the average boy has reached his final adult height by age 16 or 17. Boys who start puberty earlier than average (11.5 years) will stop growing sooner and boys who start puberty later than average will grow until an older age. Height growth stops about 5 years from the start of puberty, so if you can remember when you noticed your first pubic hairs, you can estimate how old you will be when you stop growing. If your pubic hair extends from the crotch area to include the medial (inside) aspects of your thighs, this is Tanner 5. There is typically a year or two of growth left once Tanner 5 begins. Hair along the linea alba, the line that \u201cconnects\u201d your pubic hair to your belly button generally means that growth is over. For males, if you need to shave everyday to avoid a 5 o\u2019clock shadow look, you are finished growing taller. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe? Maybe not? There\u2019s no way to figure out how tall you are going to be exactly. It is, however, possible to make an approximation. Using the standard formula, your expected height is 175 cm (5\u20328.9\u2033). However, this may be inaccurate as you may have started puberty earlier or later.  You are currently in the 14th percentile (-1.08 SD). If you remain in the 14th percentile, you will be 5\u20326.75\u2033 (170 cm) by the time you are 18. Without knowing more, I\u2019d say your final will be between 5\u20325\u2033 (165 cm) and 5\u203211\u2033 (180 cm). ",
