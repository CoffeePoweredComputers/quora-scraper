            "answer_text": "Fix the Canon PIXMA printer error code B200. 1. Remove all ink cartridges and re install new ones. 2. Remove Print Head and thoroughly clean all of the gold contacts on the print head itself. When re installing the print head make sure that the ribbon cable connector is firmly plugged in to the print head itself (this usually applies to older models). 3. When the print head is out thoroughly clean it by flushing all ink out under the hot water tap. This video may help - Print head Cleaning 4. Next method to try is to reload the printers drivers as the B200 error code can be caused in some cases by a corrupted Driver. 5. Try turning the printer off and unplugging it at the wall for at least 2 hours. Sometimes this can work. 6. If all else fails please follow the instructions on this video. 7. Purchase a new Print Head from canon and install it yourself. (this is not recommended as it is usually not much more expensive to buy a new printer). ",
