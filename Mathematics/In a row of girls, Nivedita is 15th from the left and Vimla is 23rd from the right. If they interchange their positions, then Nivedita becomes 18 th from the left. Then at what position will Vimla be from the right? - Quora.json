            "answer_text": "We know that after the exchange 23rd place from right(Vimla\u2019s initial position) is equivalent to 18th from the left(Nivedita\u2019s position after exchange). Now if we take positioning from left as convention ,we have 18=x-23 , where x is the total number of girls in the row ,thus giving 41 girls. Now what remains is to find the equivalent of Nivedita\u2019s initial position which is now the position of Vimla from right. Thus we say 15 th from left is (41\u201315) from right. Vimla\u2019s position is 26th from right. ",
