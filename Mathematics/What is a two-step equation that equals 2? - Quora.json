            "answer_text": "Rather than my usual Perimetrical Roots example that always boils down to 4a/2a=2, I will give you a real tough Equation that always persists as 2 by a Specific Condition met. Figure A [math]\\frac {x+cx/y}{y+c}[/math] Condition [math]y=c=\\frac x 2[/math] Figure B [math]\\frac {x-cx/y}{y-c}[/math] Condition [math]y=c=\\frac x 2[/math] Figure C [math]\\frac {x}{y}[/math] Condition [math]y=c=\\frac x 2[/math] Steps to get Figure A to a more resonating and indisputable 2: Multiply by [math]\\frac x x[/math] to get the following result of: [math]\\frac {x^2+cx^2/y}{yx+cx}[/math]Multiply that by [math]\\frac {y/x^2}{y/x^2}[/math] to get the result of [math]\\frac {y+cy/y}{y^2x/x^2+cxy/x^2}[/math]You can bet that with y=c=x/2 you will always find that the last denominator in Step #2 is also decimally equal y=c=x/2 and must due to the Numerator of Step #2 is equal to x=y+c Thus because [math]\\frac {x}{x/2}=2[/math] also Figure A=2 Do note however, because All Three Figures A, B and C are decimally equal too, you can use the same two steps to Overcomplicate the 2 in those two too. The really fine example of this is not with 2 but rather instead a Quick Resolve of [math]2^e[/math] where you hand that to a PhD and say: Doctor, I think this equals ____ (whatever [math]2^e[/math] is: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc 131072 at e=17) by y=c=x/2 but I may be guessing wrong. Can you maybe figure out if my guess is Right in your spare time? ",
