All you need is: Good quality minced beef and one that still has some fat in it \u2014 never go for the ones with all the fat taken out, then a good frying pan, i use rapeseed oil as it can withstand higher temperatures than olive oil, and then some salt and ground black pepper. Just get a bowl and mix all of that together, then shape it into a patty and do it for as long as you like \u2014 i like mine medium rare so for me its about 4 minutes each side. Do not make them too thick. Good luck. ",

I just use good beef with at least 15\u201320% fat (or so I\u2019m lead to believe), and don\u2019t overcook- anything more than medium will be too dry in my opinion. I do like the egg addition method, and also sometimes with bread crumb and Worcestershire sauce method, I just don\u2019t bother. It\u2019s a nice change of pace though. They are more like small meatloaves rather than burgers. Bon Appetit ",
