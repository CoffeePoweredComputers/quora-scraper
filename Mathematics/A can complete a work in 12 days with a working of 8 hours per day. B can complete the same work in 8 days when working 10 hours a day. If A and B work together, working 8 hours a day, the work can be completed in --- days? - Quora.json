So both can complete the work in= (96 x 80) /(96 + 80 )= 43.6363 hours.Since they work 8- hours a day number of days taken to by Aand B to finish the work is= 43.6363/8= 5.4545 days.\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206=\u2206",

A and B, together do (1/96)+(1/80) = (80+96)/(96*80) = 176/(96*80)th of the work in 1 hour. So A and B will do the whole work in (96*80)/176 = 43.64 hours. Thus if A and B work for 8 hours a day the two of them will complete the same work in 43.64/8 = 5.45 days. ",
