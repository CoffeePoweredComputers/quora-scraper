            "answer_text": "Mathematical logic is a subset of human language. People use language for various purposes: to express emotion, to provoke emotion, to compel action, to motivate action, etc. They also use it to prove to themselves which assertions are valid and which not; the rules of logic that have developed over 2500 years in philosophy are used for such latter purpose. Rational discourse depends on an agreement about such rules, so that in addition to convincing yourself you can use reason to convince others now and in the future. Mathematics is a logic system, a type of formal logic using symbols that is compatible with the history of logic in philosophy. Many logical assertions have been converted to a more symbolic form (\u201cif p then q\u201d) for analysis. When we converse, if I am not being my emotional self in whole or in part I am often using logic: if I turn left on 3rd Street I will save 20 minutes on my route to work today. This is a testable assertion. If I say \u201cWhen it rains I win the lottery. It rained today. I will win the lottery today\u201d it, too, is testable, but you can figure out it is defective because it contains a logical error: there is no causal connection between rain and your winning the lottery, sorry. Likewise you can create math statements that are logical or illogical (and which, like human speech, require some pre-existing agreement on axioms before spinning out logic from them, akin to what Euclid did with geometry). If a=b, and b=c, then a=c. Logical. ",
