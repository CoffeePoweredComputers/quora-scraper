            "answer_text": "Suppose the price of an object is 100 . After discount of 10% ,the price will be 90. Now,again a discount of 20% on 90 ,the price will be 90-(90\u00d720)\u00f7100= 72 . Again a discount of 30% on 72, the price of that object will be 72-(72\u00d730)\u00f7100= 50.4 .So total discount should be 49.6% , to get that object at a price of 50.4. So, correct answer is 49.6%.
