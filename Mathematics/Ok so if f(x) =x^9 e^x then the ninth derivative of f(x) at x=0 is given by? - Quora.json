Since you only need the value at x=0, you can focus directly on the term where the power becomes 0 (i.e. the constant). All other terms include an x with power of at least 1, so they will equate to 0 when you include it. You don\u2019t actually need to calculate the final derivative (which is very laborious). All you need is to see the pattern and extrapolate. The final term with power of 0 would be [math]n(n-1)(n-2)\u2026(n-(k-1)) = k! \\binom{n}{k} = 9![/math] (where n = 9 and k=9) Or alternatively note when you differentiate once you get a 9, differentiate twice, 9 x 8, three times 9 x 8 x 7, etc. This is [math]\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}[/math] Differentiate 9 times and you get [math]\\frac{9!}{(9\u20139)!} = 9![/math] ",
