            "answer_text": "The question as written has flaws. One has to use brackets to clarify the question. As written it leads to different solutions and may or may not lead to the same answer. Right to left ((16\u00f78)\u00f74)\u00f72=((8)\u00f74)\u00f72=4\u00f72=2 Left to right 16\u00f7(8\u00f7(4\u00f72))=16\u00f7(8\u00f72)=16\u00f74=4. Other options (16\u00f78)\u00f7(4\u00f72)=8\u00f72=4 16\u00f7((8\u00f74)\u00f72)=16\u00f7((4)\u00f72)=16\u00f72=8 One cannot reach to a correct answer unless the question itself is made clear using universally accepted BODMAS principle ie. Sequence of Brackets of Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction to be followed in that order in any arithmetic problems. ",

            "answer_text": "Friends\u2026! This type of problem to be solved as per BODMAS rule. According to BODMAS rule, if an expression contains brackets ((), {}, []) we have to first solve or simplify the bracket followed by of (powers and roots etc.), then division, multiplication, addition and subtraction from left to right. Solving the problem in the wrong order will result in a wrong answer. Accordingly 16 \u00f7 8 \u00f7 4 \u00f7 2 16/8 \u00f7 4 \u00f7 2 2 / 4 \u00f7 2 0.5 / 2 =0.25 Answer is 0.25 ",
