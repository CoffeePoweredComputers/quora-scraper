            "answer_text": "Historically, game theory started with the analysis of two-player, zero-sum games. (These are games where one player\u2019s gain is equivalent to another player\u2019s loss.) The first major work in the field (Theory of Games and Economic Behavior) was published in 1944, and that same year Allied forces used the principles of game theory to construct a search pattern for German submarines in the Straits of Malacca. This, I suspect, is the first direct \u201capplication\u201d of game theory. It should be noted, of course, that some economic models which predate \u201cgame theory\u201d feel very much like game theory. I am thinking in particular of Cournot competition, an important economic insight that dates to 1838. In 1950, the famous Prisoner's dilemma was \u201cinvented;\u201d this was influential at the time because it showed that while Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cInvisible hand\u201d may apply to competitive markets, (see Fundamental theorems of welfare economics), in other situations individuals acting in their self interest may not lead to socially optimal outcomes. As others have mentioned, game theory would go on to revolutionize political science and economics. (I\u2019m not sure whether evolutionary game theory has \u201crevolutionized\u201d biology, but it is definitely a notable subfield.) It has direct applications in multiagent systems in computer science, but there are also computer scientists who are interested in studying how the theory of algorithms applies to games. If I think of anything that\u2019s been missed, I\u2019ll edit this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Evolutionary game theory provides an analytic basis for explaining the emergence of subtle behaviors in animals over an evolutionary timescale.Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is the application of game theory to evolving populations in biology. It defines a framework of contests, strategies, and analytics into which Darwinian competition can be modeled. Evolutionary game theory has helped to explain the basis of altruistic behaviors in Darwinian evolution. It has in turn become of interest to economists, sociologists, anthropologists, and philosophers. 2) In network designs, there is the issue of fairness as network clients compete for access to resources. In some instances game theory can insure that no client has the incentive to push ahead of other clients to gain unfair access to the resource (server, processors, etc) Survey of Game Theory and Future Trends for Applications in Emerging Wireless Data Communication Networks  The authors of [N. Kumar, J. J. P. C. Rodrigues, and N. Chilamkurti, \u201cBayesian Coalition Game as-a-Service for Content Distribution in Internet of Vehicles,\u201d IEEE Internet Things J., vol. 1, no. 6, pp. 544\u2013555, Dec. 2014.] proposed a cooperative Bayesian Coalition Game (BCG) as-a-service for content distribution amongst vehicles. This work is complemented in [N. Kumar, S. Misra, J. J. P. C. Rodrigues, and M. S. Obaidat, \u201cCoalition Games for Spatio-Temporal Big Data in Internet of Vehicles Environment: A Comparative Analysis,\u201d IEEE Internet Things J., vol. 2, no. 4, pp. 310\u2013320, Aug. 2015] by proposing a NC Bayesian CG. The last two contributions [ibid] could have convergence time issues due to a exponentially increasing complexity in the algorithm to form the coalitions of vehicles when the number of vehicles attached to the network is relatively high. 3) Global politics involves high stakes but most game theory analyses lack specificity in defining the best course of action in confrontations. My answer to What type of game theory game is the US and North Korea engaged in specifically when it comes to cyber? Using Game Theory To Handle North Korea: If Kim Jong-Un is, in fact, suicidal, we should make him show that card now, rather than later so we can destroy him and his military at least cost to ourselves and our allies. If he is not suicidal, we should make his further development and testing of ballistic missiles the sure cause of his death. In this case, he will stop their development and testing ",
