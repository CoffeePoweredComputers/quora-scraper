            "answer_text": "Whats the difference? Here's the answer. Go ahead and read. SAT Reasoning Test:- The SAT reasoning test basically tests your reasoning power in core English and mathematics. The two sections are elaborated below. English Section:- the English section is divided into two parts, reading section and writing section.the writting section test's whether are you able to point out grammer mistakes, Mistakes in paragraph construction, reconstructing the paragraph in better way etc. The reading section will test whether are you able to understand main idea of paragraph etc. Mathematics Section:- The math section also include two section allowed use of calculator and not allowed use of calculator. It will test your other mathematical skills. I am linking a sample paper of SAT reasoning so that you will get brief idea. SAT Subject Test:- This test basically tests your knowledge in particular subjects namely phisics, chemistry, humanities etc. SAT Subject Tests are 20 multiple-choice standardized tests given by The College Board on individual subjects. They are usually taken to improve a student's credentials for admission to colleges in the United States. Many colleges use the SAT Subject Tests for admission, course placement, and to advise students about course selection. Some colleges specify the SAT Subject Tests that they require for admission or placement. Conclusion:- The SAT reasoning, tests your reasoning power and SAT subject, tests your knowledge in certain subjects. But mainly SAT reasoning is required for applying universities in USA.

            "answer_text": "My caveat in answering this question is that I am not from the College Board; I am just an avid reader, with a teen who has been through the process and another that is going through it. The SAT reasoning test might have a question that tests your reasoning ability, such as only one of four answers ends in a 5, and your question is 1,894,675 x 375. In other words, you do not need to perform the full calculation to get the answer, and if you do take the time to do that, you will not finish the exam and will thus get other questions wrong. A reading section question might have four possible vocabulary words that could fit in the blank of a sentence. You are to pick the correct one, given the context of the sentence. There may be only two answers that fit grammatically and only two answers that make sense contextually, but only one answer that is both things. These kinds of questions can show that a student thinks well, that a student uses logic to eliminate certain answers, and other such indicia of utilizing one\u2019s intelligence. (Obviously, these tests require a certain level of pure knowledge: to be able to multiply, to know correct grammar, to have read enough in life that the context is understood. The tests cannot avoid this, because there is always substance to a question.) The Subject Tests are knowledge/proficiency tests, and I\u2019ve read that they are used as a gauge to be able to make apples-to-apples comparisons between, let\u2019s say, two all-A students, but who took different courses and came from different high schools of differing caliber. On an absolute basis, the Subject Tests tell the college whether you have enough knowledge of subjects compared to already-admitted students, because they don\u2019t want to admit people that will fail, and they do want to admit people who have a certain level of knowledge in order to likely contribute meaningfully to the classroom dialogue.
