            "answer_text": "I have ever disassembled an Apple Pencil. Its function implementation principle may be so complicated that scare you. There are too many parts to hide inside the small pencil. Positioning accuracy Apple Pencil is actually not a \"capacitor pen\", it is the initiative to launch \"electromagnetic wave\" at the tip of the pen! The iPad's pencil-enabled touch chip is also custom-made. It scans the normal touch signal and accepts the special frequency band of the Pencil (for this, you can scan it with the spectrum probe). Capacitive Touch Screen is insulated for DC, but is weakly conductive for AC signals. Surprisingly, its nib is not to launch a \"fixed frequency band\", but to simultaneously transmit signals in multiple frequency bands, using \"overlap scan\" and \"mathematical analysis\" to improve positioning accuracy. Even more amazing is that they have been calibrated for each different iPad band. It is used to avoid the \u201cweak electromagnetic noise\u201d of different LCD panels to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. So the result is that Apple Pencil can achieve near-pixel-level positioning accuracy, at least 10 times the capacitance pen! If you consider that Apple has always insisted on a higher grade than the industry in \"Touch Density\" and \"Scan Frequency\"... Then think Apple Pencil has 240Hz scanning frequency. . . Such high precision is matched with such high speed, invincible! Sensor Because the iPad screen does not support force touch, its nib is a pressure-sensor to feel the press you give. In addition, Apple Pencil also has 9-axis gyroscopes, which is used to calculate \"the tilt angle of the pen tip\" from the difference between \"the gyroscope of the iPad\". It achieve a more advanced stroke effect such as a brush. Even more amazing is that it installed two gyroscopes in different locations. What's there to be excited over two little gyroscopes? Yes, this allows for more complex functions in hardware product design. For example, Apple even considers the situation of \"you writing with a pen when you stand up-side down\". It can also achieve the function of \"turning the pen over and using the cap to for the eraser\"! Algorithm The latest iOS 13 has a humble update - It reduces the delay from 20ms to 9ms, which is equivalent to a delay of 1 frame at 120fps. (Recall that the old iPad pro once reduced the 40ms delay to 18ms, which is exactly 1 frame delayed by 60fps.) 20ms is already the top level in the industry,iPad Pro 120Hz display + Apple Pencil 240Hz scanning frequency,CPU speed is fast enough,16ms (1 frame) operation display delay.But 9ms = 0.5 frames? Does this mean that it has violated Information Theory? The touch data has not been scanned yet but has it been sent to display? Why is this? Because they used machine learning to predict handwriting. For such a high-tech pencil, it is difficult to be plagiarized. This is consistent with Apple's style of work - put so many parts sensors in a pen! ",

            "answer_text": "I have written and illustrated (by classic ink tracing) a graphic novel for kids, and it took me 3 years (2014\u20132017) to finish the included 230 illustrations. I was determined to come up with a second volume of this book, but I really wasn\u2019t planning to waste 3 more years for that. I decided to switch to digital sketching (vector, greyscale, in my case). Not a very easy decision for me, as I have been in the sketching business for >30 years and I got pretty conservative\u2026First, I tried my luck on an Adonit (Jot Touch Pixelpoint) on an iPad. It didn\u2019t do the trick, it was frustrating me and I was feeling like things are going even slower. Returned it in a week.The second choice was a Lenovo Yoga Book tablet / laptop, with an included digital drawing tablet and a fine point digital pen (included). It was a lot better, but it still didn\u2019t make feel like I can fully take the plunge. Time was running out, and I knew I must go for the more expensive solutions left \u2014 i.e. the iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil, or a professional Cintiq with a Wacom pen. I went for the Pencil and the iPad, \u2019cause I wanted to catch more birds with one stone and also use the tablet for games and stuff. I was prepared to return it (made sure to have it bought from a store with a good return policy :) ) but \u2014 surprise! This time I was suddenly forgetting I wasn\u2019t using a \u201creal pen\u201d! It quickly grew on me, and in less than 1 year I had all my >220 vector drawings ready\u2026 I guess I\u2019m entitled to say that you WILL get good results with the Pencil. It\u2019s not perfect (the iPad surface is too glossy and a little slippery) but it\u2019s really good, the experience is satisfying, and there\u2019s (nearly) zero frustration. ",
