            "answer_text": "Say both goats are bought for Rs.100 each. Goat 1 is sold for 20% profit, hence selling price of goat 1 is 120/100* 100 = 120. Goat 2 is sold for 20% loss, hence selling price of goat 2 is 80/100 * 100 = 80. Total costs = 200 Total revenue = 200. So net net there is no effect. If however, there is a different price for each goat, then there is a difference. Simply plug in the numbers above and do the math. You may also need to account for age of goat, color, weight etc. ",

The overall gain is 200\u2013100 = 100. If you interchange the cost prices, then the overall loss is 100\u2013200 = -100. If the cost price is same for both the goats, then there is no gain or loss.
