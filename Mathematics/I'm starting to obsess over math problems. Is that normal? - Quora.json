            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s normal and OK if its a positive kind of obsession: the math problems fascinate and intrigue you, challenge you to solve them, and you find thinking about them and solving them stimulating; aka, if it makes you happy. It\u2019s important though to NOT let your obsession take over your whole life and stop you from getting sufficient sleep, stop you from getting enough healthy physical exercise, stop you from eating enough nutritious foods, stop you from socializing with friends and family, or stop you from spending sufficient time studying your other subjects at school, etc. ",
