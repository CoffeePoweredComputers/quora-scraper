            "answer_text": "Vikas Saxena's answer to When do you use Yamane formula to determine sample size? First of all you should be working with a finite population and if the population size is known, the Yamane formula for determining the sample size is given by: [math] n=\\frac{N}{(1+N e^2)}[/math] Where n= corrected sample size, N = population size, and e = Margin of error (MoE), e = 0.05 based on the research condition. Let\u2019s assume that the population is 10,000. At 5% MoE., the sample size would be: [math]\\frac{10000}{(1+10000 (.05^2)}[/math] [math] \\dfrac{10000}{26}[/math] = 384.61 ~ 385 In a finite population, when the original sample collected is more than 5% of the population size, the corrected sample size is determined by using the Yamane\u2019s formula. In the example above, 5% of 10,000 is 500 and hence the corrected size is 385 although for research purposes, even 385 is a big number (for handling and collection point of view) and the researcher has to make a decision to collect even smaller number in order of ease of handling, costing but he has to ensure that the sample is representative. Hope this helps. Update: Kawu Hassan Ahmed I have two populations with sizes 593 and 10,000, and using this formula a got the following result 239 and 385 respectively. consider the population sizes and the sample obtained don\u2019t you thing there is something wrong? Vikas Saxena I suppose by your question, \u201cconsider the population sizes and the sample obtained don\u2019t you thing there is something wrong?\u201d, you mean to ask that the sample size of 239 for a population of 500 seems too large as compared to a sample size of 385 for a population of 10K, right? If yes, then you are right, it looks large. But the calculation (as per the formula) is correct. If you calculate sample size for a population of 100K, you would get a figure of 398 which is just 13 more as compared to a population of 10K. In your case, a sample of 239 /593 is too big. If you have to investigate 239 data points out of 593, you might as well do the whole 593\u2026!! So, here you may take 30\u201340 and do your analysis. It also depends upon what kind of research are you doing. That is what we get from the formula.But, let me share my views as a business consultant... A lot of times, we have to use our own judgement in practical situations like these. I have my interest in the fields of Statistics and Probability but I don\u2019t depend on them too much because I need to look at the business scenario as a whole and not from a Statisticians view point. I approach a business problem as a businessman and then use Statistics to help me make a decision but many a time, I bypass the theory and the book. Thanks for the comment! I liked your observation and the question! ",
