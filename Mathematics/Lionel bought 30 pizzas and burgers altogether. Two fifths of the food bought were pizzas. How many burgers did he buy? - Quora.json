            "answer_text": "If two fifths are pizzas then out of 5, 3 are burgers. Divide 30 by 5, since we're counting in fifths. We get 6. Now multiply 6 by the 3 burgers. So we have 18 burgers and 12 pizzas. Pizzas= 2/5th, burgers= 3/5th. Total food products= 30. Parts the products are divided into= 30/5=6 parts. Out of the 5 parts 3 are burgers, since they are divided into 6 parts, no. Of burgers= 3\u00d76=18 No. Of pizzas= total product- no. Of burgers= 30\u201318=12 ,or 2\u00d76=12 pizzas. Therefore, Lionel bought 18 burgers. ",
