            "answer_text": "No! Each of us as individuals and humanity as a whole did plenty of mathematics without even knowing what set theory is. I conclude that plenty of mathematics is not fundamentally based on set theory. Whether it can all be expressed in terms of set theory is a different question. As I recall, I learned to count, \"do my sums\", and recited my \"times-tables\", well before coming across sets. I was rather gifted at maths as a child: as a 10-year old my primary school teacher told my parents they should be checking out which Oxbridge college I should attend. One of my memories is the difficulty I had when that teacher asked me to come up with some sets with only one member. It seemed like a weird concept to me. All I could come up with was the \"set of Eiffel Towers\". \"How could that be useful?\" I thought! Mathematicians did mathematics for thousands of years without Set Theory. In particular Arithmetic, Geometry, and Number Theory were all done and even formalised without reference to sets. Peano Arithmetic is an axiomatic formalisation of arithmetic that makes no direct reference to sets. It can be expressed in terms of sets, and I have used the model in other of my answers on Quora, but I don't think that means it is really based on set theory. To say maths is based on set theory would be akin to saying paintings are based on pixels simply because any picture can be faithfully digitised to any degree of accuracy. Oils and water colours are different expressions of painting whether we can express both on our computer screen or not. Similarly we can construct Fermat's Last Theorem or Trisecting the Angle without reference to sets whether we can rewrite them as expressions in set theory or not. If you want to formalise all of mathematics as David Hilbert did early in the twentieth century, you would want to start from some fairly simple and flexible primitive notions. Sets seem to fill this r\u00f4le remarkably well, although they do have their issues as the paradoxes in Naive Set Theory indicate, but there are other approaches that could work. With advances in computing you might want to construct all of mathematics in terms of Finite-State Machines (FSMs). Given the work already done in Set Theory, however, you would probably want to show an equivalence between an FSM* and some entity constructed from sets. It then becomes moot whether the foundation is really sets or FSMs. * Any confusion between FSM and the Flying Spaghetti Monster is coincidental and entirely deliberate [math]\\ddot\\smallsmile[/math] ",

            "answer_text": "You ask if all mathematics is based on set theory. Historically, no. Thousands of years of mathematics didn't depend on set theory because it hadn't been invented yet. Logically, no.  Set theory is just one of many first-order theories. Other theories can be defined independently of set theory. For example, Euclidean geometry and group theory are two first-order theories that can be defined without any mention of sets. Practically, yes. The rest of mathematics is usually described in terms of sets. It's a convenience. It's nice to be able to put aside foundations and get on to the meat of the subject, and one way to do that is by assuming everything under discussion can be described in terms of sets. ",
