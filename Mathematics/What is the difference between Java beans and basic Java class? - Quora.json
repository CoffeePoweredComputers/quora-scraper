            "answer_text": "A JavaBean is basically a Java class which satisfies a few simple rules (it must have a public no-arg constructor, no public instance variables, properties have getters and setters; actually, you can get around the last rule by supplying a BeanInfo object for your bean). JavaBeans were originally conceived for graphical application builder tools, but that emphasis has shifted considerably and they're now used almost everywhere. A Bean can have associated support classes: a BeanInfo class providing information about the bean, its properties and its events, and also property editors and a graphical customizer. A Bean is a Java class, but a Java class does not have to be a bean. In other words a bean in a specific Java class and has rules that have to be followed before you have a bean. ",

            "answer_text": "JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). They are serializable, have a zero-argument constructor, and allow access to properties using getter and setter methods. A class is nothing but a blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors. Java class objects exhibit the properties and behaviors defined by its class. A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object. ",
