            "answer_text": "K = 15 First of all check,What are the conditions for a linear equation of two variables to be inconsistent?Inconsistent means that you have no solution in x and y for the given two equations. For the 2 equations linear equation of two variables to be inconsistent, their graph must be parallel, but not coincident.Coincident means having same graph. Now, when will their graph be coincident, when two equations signify same line. First equation is 2x + 3y =5Next equation is 6x + 9y = kHere, a2/a1 = 3b1/b2 = 3 c2/c1 = k/5 Here comes the simple rule of checking consistency of linear equation which is given in NCERT BOOK OF CLASS 10, 1. When a2/a1 = b1/b2 = c2/c1, the equations are consistent 2.When a2/a1 = b1/b2 not equal to c2/c1, the equations are inconsistent. So, for equations to be not inconsistent or consistent, we must have  a2/a1 = b2/b1 = c2/c1=> k/5 =3 Therefore, K =15. Hence, For K = 15, the equations are not inconsistent and rest for all K, they are inconsistent. Hope that helps. :) ",

            "answer_text": "The above equations will be in consistent state for k=15.Because 2x+3y=5 and 6x+9y=15 will form parallel lines.You can also get the same result by forming an augmented matrix and then reduce it to row echelon form.In case you are not aware about this method, it is easily visible for these two equations you will get multiple solutions of values x and y. Such as (0,5/3) , (1,1) etc.So the system is in consistent state for k=15 and gives infinitely many solutions for the same.For any value of k where k is not 15, it is in inconsistent state.Hope this answers your question.
