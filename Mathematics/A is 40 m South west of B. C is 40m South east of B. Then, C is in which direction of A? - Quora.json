            "answer_text": " Let the divine B be at the origin (0,0) of the cartesian co-ordinate plane. So, Mr.A is 40m south-west of B. The direction south-west suggests that Mr. A is in the 3rd Quadrant of the cartesian system. And as we know, both abscissa & ordinate are negative in the 3rd Quadrant. Therefore, the point where A is standing at (-40Cos45\u00b0,-40Sin45\u00b0). Mind you, this point is with respect to B\u2019s position and (-40Cos45\u00b0, -40Sin45\u00b0) are the projections of A\u2019s position on X and Y axes respectively. Now, coming to Mr.C. C is 40m south-east of B. Hence C is in the 4th Quadrant of the x-y plane. And it is known to you that x is positive and y is negative in the 4th Quadrant. Hence, co-ordinate of Mr.C\u2019s position is (40Cos45\u00b0, -40Sin45\u00b0). Where these trigonometric terms hold the same meaning as mentioned above. And We can notice from here that positions of A and C are images of one another in the y-axis. Therefore, A must move EASTWARDS in order to reach C. And to be precise, C is in east direction to that of A. Hope, I answered correctly! ;-) Also, I\u2019m Sorry for the late reply as my school exams were on. ",

C is 40 m South East of B. A and C being in two opposite directions are forming equilateral triangle from B, with A and C as base. Thus C is in East direction from A. Answer: C is in East direction from A. ",
