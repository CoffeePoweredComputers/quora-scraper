            "answer_text": "My guess is that this refers to the Russell Paradox, where should the null set exist, it is automatically a member of the universal set. By membership, it cannot be a complement of the universal set, though that being said, all complements of the universal set must also be members of the null set, leading it to be a set contained in the universal set. This is clarified in the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory: where there simply is no universal set, and only relative complements exist (Given Sets A and B, A - B creates a complement set of elements not present in B), thereby avoiding the paradox. The null set exists regardless of the existance of the universal set. Yes, the paradox is a result of informal set theory (or na\u00efve set theory), though canonically it is accepted that the universal set does not exist, allowing for extensionality among other things.

            "answer_text": "In modern mathematics an absolute universal set does not exist. You can have all elements of the domain of discourse in question be the elements of some set, but that's not the same thing and doesn't lead to the sort of paradox you're talking about. To put it another way, you can have some set U for whatever domain of discourse. If U is the complement of null, then we would call U the universal set, but that just means that U is all elements in the domain of discourse, minus null. As an asside, you can try playing with a domain of discourse that does not include null, but that will lead to weird results and probably not be useful, since you have to throw out a number of comon axioms (or however you construct your set theory) to avoid the empty set.
