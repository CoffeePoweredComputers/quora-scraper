            "answer_text": "Using binomial Theorem Using Pascal's triangle coefficients are 1 , 4 ,6,4,1 [(a + b) + (c + d)] \u2074 = (a + b) \u2074 + 4 (a + b) \u00b3 (c + d) + 6 (a + b) \u00b2(c+ d) \u00b2 + 4 (a + b)(c + d) \u00b3 +( c+ d) \u2074 Again applying binomial theorem in (a + b) \u2074,(a + b) \u00b3,(c + d) \u00b3 & ( c+ d) \u2074and multiplying and collecting the terms you can have answer. But this is a long procedure and going to take lots of time. I hope this will help you. ",
