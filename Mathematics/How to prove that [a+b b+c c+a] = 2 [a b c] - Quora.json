            "answer_text": "Note: in the following explanation a, b, c are vectors, . is dot product and \u00d7 is cross product.I believe that they are not in a matrix. [ ] is a vector operation called box product or scalar triple product. It must have 3 vector as operands and the result is a scalar.The basic rules of box product are:1. [ a b c ] is the volume of the parallelopide with a, b, c as adjacent sides.2. [ a b c ] = (a\u00d7b).c =(a.b)\u00d7c.3. [ a b b ] = 0 i.e. if same vectors are in the box product it's value is zero.4. [ a b c ]=[ b c a ]=[ c a b ] i.e. if the order is changed in a cyclic manner.Coming back to the original question, [ a+b b+c c+a ] = ((a+b). (b+c))\u00d7(c+a) expanding = ((a.b)+(a.c)+(b.b)+(b.c))\u00d7(c+a) expanding = ((a.b)\u00d7c)+((a.c)\u00d7c+((b.b)\u00d7c)+((b.c)\u00d7c) + ((a.b)\u00d7a)+((a.c)\u00d7a)+((b.b)\u00d7a)+((b.c)\u00d7a) = [ a b c ]+[ a c c ]+[ b b c ]+[ a c c ] + [ a b a ]+[ a c a ]+[ b b a ]+[ b c a ]  = [ a b c ] + [ b c a ] by rule 3 = [ a b c ]+[ a b c ] by rule 4 = 2[ a b c ] Hence proved.Please let me know if there is any mistake.Hope this helps you.Thank you for reading.
