            "answer_text": "I think I'm pretty dumb because I'm bad at math. Is there any way to become smarter? First off, just because you aren\u2019t good at something doesn\u2019t mean you are dumb. Don\u2019t think that way. It\u2019s self-defeating. Intelligence can be measured in different ways. My i.q. leans towards language. Math was never an easy subject for me. But as an adult, I\u2019m proud that I\u2019ve been able to master it. Take an online i.q. test, just to get a sense of where you do best. It might make you feel better and know that you aren\u2019t \u201cdumb\u201d. Secondly, if you want to increase your intelligence there are practical steps to take. Read. Read books you like, articles that catch your attention, the back of the cereal box at breakfast. It\u2019s the best way to learn something new. And don\u2019t feel like has to whatever you think \u201csmart\u201d people read. You can even learn something from a romance novel.Get help with math. That\u2019s what \u201csmart\u201d people do. They get help. They know when they can\u2019t do it on their own.Apply yourself to your school work (if you are in school, your question seems young to me).Don\u2019t stress about it. As you get older, you might find you are more confident with you math skills. Happened to me.",

            "answer_text": "Sorry to tell you this but you're not likely dumb. I thought I was dumb but it turns out that there are over 100 different ways to learn, untold different types of intelligence, many areas of expertize that only certain people can figure out and then there are things like Emotional Intelligence too. I used to compare myself to my older brother but that sucked because he is literally a genius and I am not. I would compare myself to me Father too but he had experience, I would compare myself to my Grandpa but he had wisdom. I finally stopped comparing myself to everyone and discovered that I had expertise and I could get more anytime that I wanted. I just needed to be interested, self motivated and have a goal and the rest just fell together. Now I not the smartest man that ever walked the earth but I am an expert and finding out what he knew, what he was about and who he thought was brilliant. Figure out how you like to learn and apply that to everything that you need to learn so if you're good at video games, figure how you learned to do it. If you know more than the average person about Star Wars, Spiders, Vampires or horses, just figure out how you got that knowledge and do it again! Good luck and keep trying you will find your way as long as you try. Sincerely ",
