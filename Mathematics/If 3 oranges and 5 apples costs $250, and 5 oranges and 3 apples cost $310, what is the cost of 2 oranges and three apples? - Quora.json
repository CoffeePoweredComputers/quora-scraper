            "answer_text": "If 3 oranges and 5 apples costs $250, and 5 oranges and 3 apples cost $310, what is the cost of 2 oranges and three apples? More than I could afford by the look of it, but this is a maths question, so here goes: Let oranges be r (because o might be confusing) and apples be a. 3r + 5a = 250 (equation 1) 5r + 3a = 310 (equation 2) Multiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 2 by 5 9r + 15a = 750 (new equation 1)and25r + 15a = 1550 (new equation 2) Subtract new equation 1 from new equation 2: 16r = 800, so r = 50. Plug r = 50 into the original equations 150 + 5a = 250and250 + 3a = 310 In both equations it can be seen that a = 20. As r = 50 and a = 20, 2r + 3a = 160 Two oranges plus three apples would be $160. You\u2019ve been ripped off. ",

            "answer_text": "Let cost of each orange be x & that of apple be y. Given 3x+5y = 2505x+3y = 310 or 5x+3y-60=250From points 1 & 2, we can equate left hand side. 3x+5y = 5x+3y-60 5y-3y+60 = 5x-3x 2y+60 = 2x [math]y+30 = x[/math]. Hence an orange(x) is expensive by $30 to an apple(y). Now substuite x in point 1. 3(y+30) + 5y = 250 8y = 250\u201390 = 160, [math]hence apple(y) = 20 [/math] [math]therefore orange(x) = 50.[/math] Answer for 2 oranges & 3 apples is:- 2x + 3y = 100+60 = $160 ",
