            "answer_text": "Where to begin depends on your background. Astronomy and Astrophysics (to me, synonymous) is foremost a branch of physics. It requires an understanding of the physical laws of nature. This, then, also requires some substantial mathematical knowledge. And having some computer science doesn\u2019t hurt too (we use programming and computers extensively). When people write me with your exact question, I always respond to them telling them that they should consider majoring in physics if they are serious about becoming an astronomer. So if you look at your favorite university and the requirements for a physics major, that will give you an idea of the background you would need. If you hated taking physics in high school, then you will have to think long and hard if astronomy is the right field for you. If calculus was a disaster your freshman year and you don't want to spend the time to improve your understanding of calculus, some reconsideration might be in order. Unfortunately, many people get the impression that astronomy is an easy profession to pick up, perhaps mislead by how simple we appear to make our work appear on TV shows and how typical Astro101 courses are taught (e.g., courses that use books like this one). Courses like these typically present astronomy as a collection of nearly disparate facts to be memorized (and forgotten), which is not at all what astronomy is about. BUT, if you are just interested in learning more about astronomy as a hobby, a book like that is a great place to start. They work really well for people serious about learning the subject matter, but not so great for conveying astronomy to an random individual that needs to, say, satisfy a broader education requirement at their university. (Some of my pedagogy biases are leaking in here, obviously. Also, though I'm referencing Alex Filippenko's book here, this is not an insult to Alex. I consider him a good colleague and friend, and he wrote a fine textbook. I just don't believe this approach to teaching introductory astronomy--which is ubiquitous across the United States--is the most effective way of teaching the subject. End of aside.) I can summarize the sort of courses I took as an undergrad and have found useful in my career (with some typical textbooks): Math Calculus, obviously (Stewart's book is a classic)Differential EquationsLinear AlgebraStatistics (there are books that do stats for physical science)Physics First-year physics (One of these big guys)Classical Mechanics (Taylor)Electrodyamics (Griffiths!)Quantum Mechanics (Griffiths!)I don't research cosmology or theories of dark matter and exotic particles, which might benefit from a Particle Physics course (Griffiths!)Error Analysis (Taylor)Astronomy (besides the first one, you can pick and choose, they are all upper-level undergraduate books) Introduction to Astrophysics (the Big Orange Book: Caroll and Ostlie)Stellar Structure (how stars work)Cosmology (theories of the Universe; the Big Bang, etc.)Galaxies (... galaxies)Star Formation (honestly not a huge fan of this book, but this is my field of research and I'm biased) Now if you just wanted to learn more about astrophysics because you appreciate that it's awesome, popular science books are a great way to go. Stephen Hawking's books are great for absolute beginners, but I really recommend anything by Brian Greene, Sean Carroll, and Kip Thorne. Their books are aimed for non-specialists but still require some mulling and thinking (effort that is worth it). Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Welcome to the most fascinating realm! I have a great interest in this domain of science so I guess I am eligible to answer this question. Since you asked this question here on quora, its safe to assume that you have access to internet. You said you have a great a great interest and want to clear the basics of physics. I have some suggestions of tools that you should use in the order I am telling you because science is a step by step understanding of nature. For clearing your basics my suggestions are. 1). Microsoft encarta. This is an encyclopedia available for P.C. that has seperate sections for various topics that includes astronomy and astrophysics. It starts from the basic concepts and ends up explaining concepts like planets, stars( their formation and life), black holes, quasars, galaxies, auroras, through lucid videos, slides and texts. This was of great help to me in creating a strong base.   2). Khan academy. Equally helpful in understanding mathematics and science beginning from elementary school to graduation. Of great help to build good concepts through videos. App is available on playstore.  After building a strong base time to nurture your interest and keep yourself updated. 1). Cosmos, a space time odyssey. Astrophysicist Neil degrasse Tyson shall take tak you to the most beautiful journey of your life from microscopic to macroscopic level through this award winning television series.  2). Grand design by Stephen Hawkings. No description needed. The works of Stephen Hawkings , one of the greatest scientists alive.  3). Through the wormhole. Morgan Freeman guides us through some of the greatest mysteries of universe and advancements in them. This show will be one of the most fascinating one.  Learning is a never ending process and astrophysics is a deep sea with no bottom. I strongly recommend you to go through learning in a step by step manner. Keep learning and have a great day.
