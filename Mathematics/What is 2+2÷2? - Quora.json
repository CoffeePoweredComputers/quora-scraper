            "answer_text": "Well\u2026It depends on how you were taught in school. There are 2 methods PPMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Powers, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction and are the order of operations\u2026Meaning do all you parentheses first, followed by your powers and so on\u2026The second method is to do the equation from left to right, straight across. Sometimes you will arrive at the same answer with these two methods\u2026Sometimes you will get two completely different answers\u2026Let\u2019s see what happens with this problem. Method 1: PPMDAS Skip the first two p\u2019s, since you have neither of these\u2026Also skip the m to start with the d\u2026Division\u2026 2/2 which is 1 so now your equation reads: 2 + 1 which is 3 The second method Straight across 2 + 2 = 4 Now 4 / 2 = 2 As you can see\u2026Two very different answers\u2026 ",
