            "answer_text": "There were 200 tickets sold for a college basketball game. Tickets for students were $5.00 and for adults were $7.50. The total amount collected was $1325. How many of each type of ticket were sold? Let x = number of student tickets and y = number of adult tickets sold for the game. The number of tickets is [math]x+y=200[/math] and the amount collected is [math]$5.00x+$7.50y=$1325.00[/math] So, there are two equations to solve together. Rewrite the second equation as [math]5x+7.5y=1325[/math] [math]\\text{Let}\\space\\text{}x=100+c\\space[/math] [math]\\text{and}\\space\\text{}y=100-c[/math] where c is a number. Then [math]x+y=100+c+100-c=200[/math] as required by the first equation. Substitute these into the second equation: [math]5(100+c)+7.5(100-c)=1325\\text{.} [/math] Multiply by 10 to get out the decimal points: [math]50(100+c)+75(100-c)=13250\\text{.}[/math] Remove parentheses: [math]5000+50c+7500-75c=13250\\text{,}[/math] [math]12500-25c=13250\\text{.}[/math] Divide by 25 to reduce the coefficients: [math]\\dfrac{12500}{25}-\\dfrac{25}{25}c=\\dfrac{13250}{25}\\text{,}[/math] [math]500-c=530\\text{.}[/math] Solve for c: [math]500-530=c\\text{,}[/math] [math]-30=c\\text{.}[/math] [math]\\text{Then}\\text{ }x=100+c[/math] [math]=100-30=70\\space[/math] [math]\\text{and}\\text{ }y=100-c[/math] [math]=100-(-30)[/math] [math]=100+30=130\\text{.} [/math] Thus, 70 student tickets and 130 adult tickets were sold.
