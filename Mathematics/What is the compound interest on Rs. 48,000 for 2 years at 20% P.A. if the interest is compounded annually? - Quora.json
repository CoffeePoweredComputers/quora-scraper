            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Ms. Anindita Choudhury Friends\u2026! What is the compound interest on Rs. 48,000 for 2 years at 20% P.A. if the interest is compounded annually The formula used in the compound interest calculator is A = P (1+r/n)^(nt) A = the future value of the investment. P = the principal investment amount. r = the interest rate (decimal) n = the number of times that interest is compounded per period. Accordingly A = 48000 (1 + 0.20\u00d71)^2 A = 48000 (1.20)^2 A = 48000 \u00d7 1.20 \u00d7 1.20 A = \u20b969120 The amount with compound interest after 2 year will he \u20b969120 Compound interest = \u20b969120 - \u20b948000 = \u20b921120 Answer the compound interest on \u20b948,000 for 2 years at 20% P. A. will be \u20b921120 ",
