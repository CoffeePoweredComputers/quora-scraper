            "answer_text": "Gauss Law states that electric flux through any surface that encloses a charge is equal to the value of the net charge inside the surface divided by epsilon. This is also equal to the dot product of electric field E through each small area dA, integrate over the entire surface being considered (called the Gaussian surface. Also see the red ring around the integral sign. It just means integration over the entire surface)  Example: A Gaussian surface (big pink one) encloses charge +q and \u2013q. The net flux through the surface is zero since the net charge is zero (+q -q = 0). We could also have said that the number of field lines going out of this surface due to charge +q is same as the number of field lines coming into the surface due to charge \u2013q and hence the net flux is zero. If we were to consider the Gaussian surface around +q only, we would say that the net flux through this surface is +q/e because this surface encloses charge +q only. If we take the Gaussian surface around -q, the flux would be -q/ e because this surface encloses charge -q. Finally if we take the shape in green as the Gaussian surface\u2026what would you think should be the flux value through this surface\u2026.well, it will be zero simply because it has no charge inside the surface.  In case you still need more clarity, head on to this video from The Science Cube that illustrates the above points in a video- https://youtu.be/O1whNWa6-KA  ",

            "answer_text": "We know that there is always a static electric field around a positive or negative electrical charge and in that static electric field there is a flow of energy tube or flux. Actually this flux is radiated/emanated from the electric charge. Now amount of this flow of flux depends upon the quantity of charge it is emanating from. To find out this relation, the Gauss's theorem was introduced. This theorem can be considered as one of the most powerful and most useful theorem in the field of electrical science. We can find out the amount of flux radiated through the surface area surrounding the charge from this theorem.This theorem states that the total electric flux through any closed surface surrounding a charge, is equal to the net positive charge enclosed by that surface.
