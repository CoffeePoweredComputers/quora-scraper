            "answer_text": "Distance traveled, elapsed time and average speed are always involved in uniform motion problems. their forms are distance traveled = speed * elapsed time, speed = distance traveled / elapsed time and elapsed time = distance traveled / speed. The given data are d = 250 km, v = 50 km/h and t = ???. Solving for the elapsed time elapsed time = distance traveled / speed elapsed time = 250 km / 50 km/h elapsed time = ??? hours, I know you can do the designated division. ",
