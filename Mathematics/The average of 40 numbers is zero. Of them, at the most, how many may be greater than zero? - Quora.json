            "answer_text": "As we know that, Average = sum of all n(given) numbers / n(no. Of given terms) Since it's average is 0 it's only occured if 0/n, bcz any number divides by 0 gives 0 So, their sum should be equals to 0 Now, there are many possibilities for 40 numbers to be sum upto 0 but since question is asking for maximum numbers greater than 0, so maximum numbers which can be add to give 0 has only one possibility of any of the 39 numbers sum upto the value of negative of the fortieth number, So, let the sum of 39 numbers be k so, sum of all the 40 numbers will be 0 only when the fortieth number will be -k. So, maximum 39 numbers can be greater than 0 Thank you Hope you'll get answer and find it easy to understand. ",
