            "answer_text": "A2A It entirely matter what type of astronomy you plan to study. At the bare minimum you need a very solid high-school-level math education for the study in any physical science. Especially statistics, calculus, trigonometry, and algebra. However some areas of study heavily rely on specific mathematical machinery, which you must then know at a more advanced level. And if you hope to become a successful researcher, and not just a practitioner, you\u2019ll need to have a more well-rounded education (i.e. be good at many areas). A few examples: If you want to study orbital mechanics, you will need to study up on the analytic mechanics in general, and that of the two-body problem in particular. You should also know perturbation theory, and be fluent in numerical methods for N-body simulations. If you want to study radio astronomy, you will need to master advanced Fourier analysis, including the implementation of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and other signal processing algorithms. You will also need to know advanced topics in statistics and information theory. If you want to study compact objects, such as Black holes and Neutron stars, or gravitational waves, you will need to master general relativity, which relies on differential geometry and tensor fields. You will also need to know advanced topics in numerical methods and multivariable calculus. If you want to study early cosmology, you will paradoxically, need to study up on a large host of math topics needed to understand physics at the smallest scales - the Standard Model and String theory (see this list of mathematical topics in quantum theory).

Another way that astronomers use maths is when we are forming and testing theories for the physical laws that govern the objects in the sky. Although most of the mathematics needed to understand the information acquired through astronomical observation comes from physics, there are special needs from situations that intertwine mathematics with phenomena that may not yet have sufficient physics to explain the observations. These two uses of mathematics make mathematical astronomy a continuing challenge. Astronomers use math all the time. One way it is used is when we look at objects in the sky with a telescope. The camera, specifically its charge-coupled device (CCD) detector, that is attached to the telescope basically converts or counts photons or electrons and records a series of numbers (the counts) - those numbers might correspond to how much light different objects in the sky are emitting, what type of light, etc. In order to be able to understand the information that these numbers contain, we need to use math and statistics to interpret them.

            "answer_text": "My father worked in the astronomy/optics/computer science field for many years. He worked for the Harvard Observatory and has built a research grade telescope, as well as many smaller devices, and has been the president of an astronomical society. From his experience, my impression is you can't really work in astronomy at any significant level without a great deal of math and physics. However, your question said you don't have a \"passion\" for these subjects. If you can get through them somehow, in spite of not loving them, then it is possible. However to advance without the study of these topics is virtually impossible. If you can't bring yourself to study advanced math and physics (and these topics are HARD!), you might want to consider other ways you could contribute to the field. If you are gifted at management or fundraising, you could create a center that encourages new development in the industry. If you can understand the subject to some degree, you may be able to write about it or edit books or articles on astronomy. Maybe your passion could be used to introduce kids to astronomy to spart interest for the future. Don't limit involvement in a subject you love just because you can't practice it at the highest levels--figure out other ways to become involved.  My advice is to try the advanced coursework first before giving up on it. You might find a professor or study group that completely changes your perspective on these subjects and allows you to continue in the way you envisioned. I had to take calculus when I went back to school years after achieving a BA in dance. My father helped me through the course (my phone bill was more than the tuition!), and I got an A minus. He taught me some neat tricks, and I discovered along the way that I love differential equations. Who knew?! Best of luck to you--it's a fascinating field! ",

Astrophysics that deal with General Relativity requires more, like tensor analysis. But after you learn it and use it every day it\u2019s not bad at all. I was terrible in math in high school. Then one night at 2:00 am, delivering the Los Angeles Times, I decided I wanted to be an astronomer. That was it for me. Went to Santa Monica College (2 year program), studied hard (and I mean HARD). Got an AA in math with a minor in astronomy, transferred to the University of Arizona, double majored in physics and astronomy and got my BS. At that time there were zero jobs in astronomy. So I decided to enter through the back door via optical sciences. I love light, telescopes and glass. Got my PhD in optics and was hired by JPL. All it takes is a decision to do something. Then you MAKE it happen. ",

When I started in college I asked the head of UC Berkeley\u2019s Astronomy department, Joe Silk, what to take. He said Physics, because you will need it in Astronomy. And if you love Astronomy you will pick it up on the fly as you study Physics. In lower division Physics courses we were typically a couple of weeks ahead of the Calculus courses we took in the Math department. Physics make the world go round, but Astronomy opens the Universe. And math is the key to it all. ",

I had never taken a physics class, and although I was good at math I didn\u2019t enjoy it. I decided to try other subjects and shop around for a major and leave astronomy as a hobby. Four years later I\u2019m a physics and astronomy double degree senior and I love math. I\u2019ve found a new appreciation for it amongst all the physics problems I\u2019ve solved. It just makes everything work. At my college, the core of the astronomy major/degree is many, many physics classes. In practice, I\u2019ve actually had to do more high level programming for astronomy and astronomy related research than math or physics. The important thing, I think, is to stay open-minded. After two years of trying less technicial subjects like design, computer science, and environmental science, I came back to astronomy in the end, because I wanted it to be more than a hobby--it was my passion. Now, I'm proud of my knowledge in physics and math and it has provided a core understanding of astronomy. Try those more technical classes. If you really love astronomy and you can tolerate the math and physics, it will all fall into place. One day you'll be sitting in an observatory and looking at the objects you've just imaged, and it will be one of the best days of your life.

            "answer_text": "Oh yes! Firstly, Astronomy builds upon a lot of fundamental concepts from multiple fields of physics. Depending on what exactly you're studying, you would need knowledge of general relativity, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and more. And needless to say, all of these require a lot of experience (and a lot of patience!) in mathematics. Some aspects of astronomy also require concepts of chemistry, geology, electrical engineering, optics, etc., which again require a good amount of mathematics. Lastly, astronomy would be toothless, without the strong support of statistics, data analytics and coding. Every pretty picture of a celestial object that you see requires these 3, and all of them have their roots in mathematics. To best understand them, and use them to their fullest capacities, an awareness of their core concepts is certainly important. So yes, astronomy does require mathematics, and it requires it plentifully. Without mathematics, astronomy cannot exist. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "The general answer is that astronomy is an applied branch of physics, and that means you need a lot of math. If you are just taking an astronomy undergrad as second major, you can probably get out with just a few semesters of calculus, and possibly differential equations. However, you can't do anything in astronomy with that. If you want to study astronomy for a living, then you are going to be getting a Ph.D. in something like Astrophysics and for that you probably want to have an amount of math that is roughly half way between a math minor and a math major. For the program that I did, it was helpful to have the minor plus partial differential equations and complex analysis. ",
