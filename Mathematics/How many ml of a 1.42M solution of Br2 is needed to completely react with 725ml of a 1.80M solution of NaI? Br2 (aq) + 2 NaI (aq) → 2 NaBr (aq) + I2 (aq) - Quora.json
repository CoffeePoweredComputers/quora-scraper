            "answer_text": "The reaction between the bromine (Br2) and sodium iodide (NaI) is provided in the question and is: Br2 (aq) + 2 NaI (aq) \u2192 2 NaBr (aq) + I2 (aq) Key, here, is to note that the Br2 to NaI ratio is 1:2. OK, so how much NaI do we have to react: 0.725 L x 1.8 moles/L = 1.305 mole Now, for every 2 moles of NaI, you need 1 mole of Br2. So, you will need 1.305 x 0.5 = 0.6525 moles of Br2. So, you will need: 0.6525 mole / 1.42 mole/L = 0.4595 L = 459.5 mL ",
