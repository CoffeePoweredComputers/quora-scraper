            "answer_text": "If I get you correctly, you generate all the distinct arrangements of the word \u2018permutation\u2019, and then sort these arrangements lexicographically. You want to know the position of the word \u2018permutation\u2019 starting from the first place. For e.g. assuming that I am not too wrong the first arrangement of the word should be: \u2018aeimnoprttu\u2019. Did I get you correctly? Just in case, I did, we\u2019ll look at the letters from left to right. We note that there are a total of [math]11[/math] letters, where the letter t appears [math]2[/math] times. Before p is the first letter, we should have all the arrangements starting with the letters: a, e, i, m, n, o ([math]6[/math] letters). In order to calculate the number of arrangements where any of these letters are the first, we note that The first place can be filled in [math]6[/math] ways.Once that is done, we have the other [math]10[/math] places that can be filled by the other [math]10[/math] letters, noting that t is repeated twice. Hence, this can be done in [math]\\frac{10!}{2!}[/math] waysTherefore, the total number of arrangements that appear before the first letter is p [math]= 6 \\times \\dfrac{10!}{2!}\\tag{1}[/math] Now that the first letter is p and is fixed, we can remove that letter from consideration. Hence, we are now restricted to the remaining [math]10[/math] letters: a, e, i, m, n, o, r, t, t, u. Before e can be the first letter of this group of letters, we need to consider all the arrangements that start with a ([math]1[/math] way) The first place can be filled in [math]1[/math] wayOnce, that is done, we can fill the remaining [math]9[/math] places using the remaining [math]9[/math] letters, noting that t is repeated twice. Hence, this can be done in [math]\\frac{9!}{2!}[/math]Therefore, the number of arrangements before the first two letters are pe [math]= 6 \\times \\dfrac{10!}{2!} + 1 \\times \\dfrac{9!}{2!}\\tag{2}[/math] Now, that the first two places are fixed, the remaining [math]9[/math] letters are a, i, m, n, o, r, t, t, u Before r can be the first letter of this group of letters, we need to consider all the arrangements that start with a, i, m, n, o ([math]5[/math] letters). In order to calculate the number of arrangements in this case The first place can be filled in [math]5[/math] waysOnce done, the remaining [math]8[/math] places can be filled up with the [math]8[/math] remaining letters, (t is repeated twice) in [math]\\frac{8!}{2!}[/math] waysTherefore the number of arrangements before the first three letters are per [math]= 6 \\times \\dfrac{10!}{2!} + 1 \\times \\dfrac{9!}{2!} + 5 \\times \\dfrac{8!}{2!}\\tag{3}[/math] Now, we have to place m in the first position, while we have the letters a, i, m, n, o, t, t, u. The number of arrangements before m can be the first letter The first place can be filled in [math]2[/math] waysThe remaining places can be filled in [math]\\frac{7!}{2!}[/math]Therefore the number of arrangements before the first four letters are perm [math]= 6 \\times \\dfrac{10!}{2!} + 1 \\times \\dfrac{9!}{2!} + 5 \\times \\dfrac{8!}{2!} + 2 \\times \\dfrac{7!}{2!} \\tag{4}[/math] Now, we are left with a, i, n, o, t, t, u Before u can be first of this group, we have to count the arrangements starting with a, i, n, o, t, t The number of arrangements The first place can be filled in [math]5[/math] ways (a, i, n, o, t)When the first place is filled with t, the remaining letters can be arranged in [math]5![/math] waysWhen the first place is not filled with t, we can fill the first place in [math]4[/math] ways, and then arrange the remaining [math]5[/math] in [math]\\frac{5!}{2!}[/math]Therefore the number of arrangements before u can be the first letter [math]= 6 \\times \\dfrac{10!}{2!} + 1 \\times \\dfrac{9!}{2!} + 5 \\times \\dfrac{8!}{2!} + 2 \\times \\dfrac{7!}{2!} + 5! + 4 \\times \\dfrac{5!}{2!}\\tag{5}[/math] Now, we have placed permu, and we are left with a, i, n, o, t, t Before t can be the first in this group, we have to count the arrangements starting with a, i, n, o The first place can be occupied in [math]4[/math] waysThe remaining letters then can be arranged in [math]\\frac{4!}{2!}[/math]Therefore the number of arrangements before t can be the first letter [math]= 6 \\times \\dfrac{10!}{2!} + 1 \\times \\dfrac{9!}{2!} + 5 \\times \\dfrac{8!}{2!} + 2 \\times \\dfrac{7!}{2!} + 5! + 4 \\times \\dfrac{5!}{2!} + 4 \\times \\frac{4!}{2!}\\tag{6}[/math] Now, we have placed permut and we are left with a, i, n, o, t (only a single t) Since we now have to place the a, and no other letter is lexicographically ahead of a, hence after placing the a, the count doesn\u2019t change Now, we have placed permuta, and we are left with i, n, o, t. Before t can be placed, we have to count the arrangements starting with i, n, o. The first place can be filled in [math]3[/math] waysThe remaining places can be filled in [math]3![/math] waysTherefore, the number of arrangements before the remaining t can be the first letter [math]= 6 \\times \\dfrac{10!}{2!} + 1 \\times \\dfrac{9!}{2!} + 5 \\times \\dfrac{8!}{2!} + 2 \\times \\dfrac{7!}{2!} + 5! + 4 \\times \\dfrac{5!}{2!} + 4 \\times \\frac{4!}{2!} + 3 \\times 3!\\tag{7}[/math] Now, we are left with i, n, o. Since there is no other letter that is lexicographically ahead of i, the count doesn\u2019t change Then we are left with n, o. We have to place o, but before that we need to place all the n before that is lexicographically ahead of o. This can be done in [math]1[/math] way Therefore, the number of arrangements where before the word permutation [math]= 6 \\times \\dfrac{10!}{2!} + 1 \\times \\dfrac{9!}{2!} + 5 \\times \\dfrac{8!}{2!} + 2 \\times \\dfrac{7!}{2!} + 5! + 4 \\times \\dfrac{5!}{2!} + 4 \\times \\frac{4!}{2!} + 3 \\times 3! + 1[/math] [math]= 10886400 + 181440 + 100800 + 5040 + 120 + 240 + 48 + 18 + 1[/math] [math]= 11174107[/math] Hence the rank of \u2018permutation\u2019 is [math]11174108[/math] ",
