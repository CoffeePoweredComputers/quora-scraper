            "answer_text": "No. A function is bijective if and only if it is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective). The sine function is onto \u2014 for every element in the range of the function, [math]y[/math], there exists an element in the domain, [math]x[/math], such that [math]y=f(x)[/math]. However, the sine function is not one-to-one. A function is one-to-one if for two elements of the domain, [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math], [math]f(x_1)=f(x_2)[/math] implies that [math]x_1=x_2[/math]. We can easily show that this isn\u2019t true of the sine function: [math]0[/math] and [math]\\pi[/math] are both elements of the domain of [math]\\sin(x)[/math] and [math]0\\neq\\pi[/math], but [math]sin(0)=0=\\sin(\\pi)[/math]. Every trigonometric function is periodic \u2014 it repeats every [math]\\pi[/math] or [math]2\\pi[/math] units, depending on the function \u2014 so no trigonometric function is one-to-one, and thus none are bijective.

            "answer_text": "No, certainly not. Sine function is not bijective function. A function is bijective if and only if it is onto and one-to-one. Let us first check, whether it is injective(one-to-one) According to horizontal line test, a curve is injective(one-to - one) only if a horizontal line cuts the curve only once.  But as it is clear from above image, horizontal line cuts Sine wave in more than one points, so it is not inijective. And not bijective. But there is special type of Sine function, called, principal Sine function, which is a inijective function. When domain of Sine function is restricted to [math][-\\frac{\\pi} {2}, \\frac{\\pi} {2}][/math], it is calld principal Sine function(curve) . The Sine function is inijective therein, as a horizontal line cuts principal Sine function only once. Also it is onto function therein. So principal sine function is bijective. Inverse of principal Sine function can be found and is called inverse Sine function.  So general Sine function is not bijective, but principal Sine function is bijective. ",
