            "answer_text": "Let me think of the transaction this way. In transaction A he buys at Rs 12 each, sells at Rs 10 each and incurs a loss of 2 \u00f7 12 = -16.67%. In transaction B he buys at Rs 8 each and sells at Rs 10 each and gains a profit of 2 \u00f7 8 = +25%. That is the end of business story. Hence net gain is +25% - 16.67% = +8.33% on cost. Let us verify the statistics. Assuming the quantity of fruits bought and sold in each case is 1000 pcs: In one case principal is Rs 12000 and loss is 2000. In the 2nd case principal is Rs 8000 and profit is 2000. As the investment varies between the two cases, the profit / loss also varies as a per cent on investment in each case. Done. ",
