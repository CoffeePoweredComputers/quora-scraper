            "answer_text": "Pipe A can fill the tank in 40 min so in one minute Pipe A fills 1/40th of the tank Similarly Pipe B can fill 1/60th of the tank in one minute So Pipes A and B together fill in one minute 1/40+1/60 of the tank which is same as 5/120 Pipe C empties the tank say x min Pipe C will empty 1/x of the tank in one minute So in one minute (5/120 - 1/x) of the tank will be filled if Pipes A and B are filling along with Pipe C emptying. This should be same as 1/30 because we want the tank to be full in 30 mi 5/120 - 1/x = 1/30 rearranging 1/x = 5/120 - 1/30 =. 5/120. - 4/120 =1/120 Pipe C could empty the full tank in 120 min. answer is 120 min ",
