            "answer_text": "Loss=15% i.e 15/100 or 3/20 Loss and profit always occurs on COST PRICE (CP). Hence loss=3/20 means 3 is loss and 20 is CP. SP=CP-Loss i. e 20-3=17 But according to question SP is 136 So equate both SP 17=136 You will get 1=136/17=8. SP 1=8 From this we get CP=20*8=160 NOW we want Gain=15% CP=160 15% again 3/20 ie profit=3 & CP=20, SP=CP+profit =20+3=23. But actual CP is 160 i.e 8 times(20*8) Hence SP is also 8 times i.e 23*8=====184. ",

To make the loss of 15%, he should sell the cow at the price, 15% lesser than it\u2019s original price. so price he sold the cow is ((100\u201315)/100)*X = 136 ==> 85/100*X=136 Therefore, X=136*100/85= Rs. 160/-( actual price) Now, To make 15% profit on its original price he should sell the cow at a 15% higher rate therefore, S.P= 160*115/100 ==>Rs. 184/- (ANS)(price at which he will get 15% profit) ",
