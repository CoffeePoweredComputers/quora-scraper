Of course, the easy answer would be just to say there are 2\u2075 or 32 different ways to answer a 5 question true or false test. Edit: You asked about combinations. In discrete mathematics, there are combinations and permutations. With combinations, the order doesn\u2019t matter. With permutations the order does matter. In my answer above, the order does matter, so it\u2019s a permutation. For combinations the answer is simpler: 5 true, 0 false; 4 true, 1 false; 3 true, 2 false; 2 true, 3 false; 1 true, 4 false; 0 true, 5 false. So there are 6 combinations. ",
