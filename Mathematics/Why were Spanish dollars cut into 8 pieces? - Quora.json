            "answer_text": "Until 1857, coins of other countries were accepted as legal tender in the US. The one most often seen was the Spanish colonial 8 reales. To facilitate making small change, each dollar sized 8 real was cut into eight pieces valued at 12 1/2 cents each. Each piece was called a \u201cbit.\u201d 2 bits equaled 25 cents, 4 bits a half dollar and 6 bits 75 cents. The slang terms 2 bits and 4 bits are still used today to describe a quarter or a half dollar. ",
