            "answer_text": "Simple math I suppose. Let us take a number say Y. 20 % of Y = 0.2 Y A decrease of 20% in Y means the new number will be = Y - 0.2 Y = 0.8 Y But 0.8 Y must be obtained by multiplying a number to Y. let's take the number to be multiplied as M. We have M x Y = 0.8 Y Therefore M = 0.8 = 4/5. General result: The general formula for finding the number to be multiplied to decrease another number by X % = (1-X/100). ",

Hence we have y=80100y=80100 Or, y=0.8y=0.8 Hope that helps :) ",
