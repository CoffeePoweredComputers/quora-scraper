After first discount of 20%, Discount = 20% of x = 0.2x Price = 80% of x = 0.8 x After 2nd discount of 10%, Discount = 10% of 0.8x = 0.08x Price = 90% of 0.8x = 0.72x Effective discount = 0.2x + 0.08x = 0.28x = 28% OR Simpler way to calculate: Effective discount percentage = [math][{20 \\over 100} + {10 \\over 100} \\times (1-{20 \\over 100})] \\times 100[/math] [math]= {{0.2} + 0.1 (1 -0.2)} \\times 100[/math] [math]= {0.2 + 0.1 (0.8)} \\times 100[/math] [math]= 28%[/math] ",
