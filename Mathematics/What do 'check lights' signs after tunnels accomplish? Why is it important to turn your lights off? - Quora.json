            "answer_text": "Because lots of cars have headlights that can be turned on and stay on even when the vehicle is turned off. If you went through the tunnel, you need the lights on. But when you exit the tunnel into daylight, there is no obvious way you can tell the headlights are still on. You stop at the office, turn the car off, and you won\u2019t notice the headlights are still on as you leave the car- the sun is thousands of times brighter than your headlights. After work, you find your battery dead. Now you are mad, and get your elected representative to have the \u201ccheck lights\u201d sign put up. ",
