            "answer_text": "A sequence is an ordered list of elements from some set \u2014 the list may include repetitions. For example the word \"repetition\" is a sequence of letters from the alphabet (a set of letters) that repeats the letters 'e', 't', and 'i'. Formally a sequence is a function from (an initial segment of) [math]\\N[/math], the set of Natural numbers, to the set in question, [math]f\\colon\\N\\to S[/math]. The word \"repetition\" could therefore be represented as the following set of ordered pairs: [math]\\bigl\\{(1,e),(3,e),(5,i),(7,i),(9,n),(8,o),(2,p),(0,r),(4,t),(6,t)\\bigr\\}\\tag*{}[/math] which would be easier to read if I listed them in numeric order rather than alphabetic order [math]\\ddot\\smallsmile[/math] Sequences are often written with the function name in bold in parenthesis and using subscripts rather than functional notation to refer to elements. Hence the sequence [math](\\mathbf{a})[/math] would have elements [math]a_0,a_1,a_2[/math], and so on. For the sequence \"repetition\" both [math]a_5[/math] and [math]a_7[/math] would be the letter 'i'. An infinite sequence is simply a sequence that maps every element of [math]\\N[/math] to the set. For example the function [math]f(n)=\\frac1n[/math] gives an infinite sequence of Rational numbers whose limit is zero. Such a sequence has a first, second, third, and so on element, but no last element. Occasionally it is useful to allow \"doubly infinite\" sequences, indexed by Integers (both positive and negative) rather than Natural numbers (only non-negative). Such sequences may have neither a beginning nor end, just like the doubly infinite sequence of Integers. ",

For example, name all integers from 1 through 1,000,000,000,000,000. In a finite sequence, the last number would be 1,000,000,000,000,000. It is large, but it is finite. In an infinite sequence, the sequence would not end. After 1,000,000,000,000,000 comes 1,000,000,000,000,001 and then 1,000,000,000,000,002, etc. in an infinite sequence there is no largest number. In a finite sequence. there is. ",
