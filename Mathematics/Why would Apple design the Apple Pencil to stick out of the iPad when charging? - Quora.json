            "answer_text": " Apple\u2019s simply offering a way to charge your Apple Pencil from the iPad when you\u2019re away from other means of charging the Apple Pencil. It\u2019s basically a better-than-nothing situation. They didn\u2019t want to compromise the design of the iPad to accommodate an accessory that\u2019s not widely used in a mode that\u2019s also not widely used in dangerous situations. And yes, I agree that as-is, this looks like a terribly bad idea. It would be a very trivial thing to break that Apple Pencil with charging just by accidentally hitting it. In fact, in researching this article, I found a \u201cletter\u201d online from a repair technician, thanking Apple for doing this, because he saw so much money coming his way. But Apple\u2019s also the company that had made an artform out of phones that practically jump from your fingers, and phones encased entirely in glass with the highest breakability ratings in the industry. Apple is never one to let function get in the way of a beautiful form. And it\u2019s not as if that\u2019s hurting Apple.  This one\u2019s actually pretty easy to work around. If you find yourself charging the Apple Pencil from the iPad away from save havens, get a cable. Breakage problem solved.  And the more recent iPads Pro did fix this. The newer tablets magnetically mount and wirelessly charge the Apple Pencil on the side of the tablet.  It\u2019s more interesting to ask Apple why they need to charge the Pencil in the first place. After all, Samsung\u2019s been offering their \u201cS-Pen\u201d on their Note and S Tab series for nearly 8 years, they work better than Apple\u2019s Pencil, and they never need charging. Why is Apple so primitive? The reason they don\u2019t need charging is also the reason they work better \u2014 Samsung embeds a second digitizer, separate from the touch screen, based on Wacom graphic tablet technology, in every S-Pen compatible device. This means there is absolutely no issue with palm detection or any other input than the pen, it makes the pens themselves pretty cheap, we get out 4096 levels of pressure sensing, but it does make the tablet more expensive. Samsung includes the pen -- they can't get another $100 out of your pocket. My Galaxy Tab S4 was a bit pricey for a 10.5\u2033 Android tablet these days, because of this. Exactly the same, in fact, as a 10.5\u2033 iPad Pro with the same storage and a lower quality screen, but expensive for an Android. ",

            "answer_text": "I presume you\u2019re referring to the old Apple Pencil, because the new Apple Pencil charges wirelessly. Everything about the old Apple Pencil seemed like a rushed design. In fact, the entirety of the old iPad Pro package (tablet + pen + keyboard cover) seemed really rushed. It\u2019s almost as if some higher-up at Apple said, \u201cWe need a direct competitor to the Surface Pro, ASAP!\u201d, and Apple haphazardly threw together a bunch of components in the shortest time possible. I\u2019m certain that if Apple had spent some more time to really think through the iPad Pro package, they would\u2019ve released the 2018 iPad Pro (and Apple Pencil) in 2015. ",
