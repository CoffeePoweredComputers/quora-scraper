            "answer_text": "Whenever the linear scale of a shape is increased, areas increase in proportion to the square of the linear scale. What is not clear to me is what \u201cincreased by 200%\u201d is intended to mean. If the radius [math]r[/math] is increased to [math]2r[/math] (that is, it is increased TO 200% of its previous value, an increase OF 100%), then the area [math]a[/math] increases to [math]4a[/math] (that is, it is increased to 400% of its previous value, an increase of 300%). If the radius [math]r[/math] is increased to [math]3r[/math] (that is, it is increased BY 200% to become 300% of its previous value), then the area [math]a[/math] increases to [math]9a[/math] (that is, it is increased by 800% to become 900% of its previous value). I hope the answer you need is in there somewhere. Percentage increases are often not the clearest way to express these kinds of things, and you may wish to adopt a more precise terminology to avoid confusion. ",

            "answer_text": "If the radius of a circle is increased by 200%, by what percentage does the area increase? If you triple along one plane (x3), the amount you increase the area by is x3^2, so x9. This indicates that tripling the radius will result in the area increasing ninefold - an 800% increase. Let\u2019s prove it: So we go from pi*r^2 to pi*3r^2 Plug in a couple of numbers: r=4. Pi*4^2 = 16pi Increasing radius by 200% to 12 gives pi*12^2 = 144*pi 144/16=9, an increase of 800%. ",
