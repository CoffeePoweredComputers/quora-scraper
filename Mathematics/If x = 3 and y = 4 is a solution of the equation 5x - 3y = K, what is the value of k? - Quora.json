            "answer_text": "Here x = 3 and y = 4 is a solution of the given equation 5x - 3y = K. This implies that, when we substitute values of x and y in the given equation, Right hand side of given equation becomes equal to right hand side of the given equation. Therefore, substituting values of x and y in given equation, we get, 5*(3) - 3*(4) = K 15 - 12 = K Therefore, required value of K is 3 ",
