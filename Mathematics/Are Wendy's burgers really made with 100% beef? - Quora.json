            "answer_text": "This is no reflection on the quality of a burger at Wendy\u2019s because I know they are of very good quality but you should be careful using the term \u201cmade with\u201d. Take 1/2 lb of good quality ground beef (100% beef). Mix it with 1/4 lb of sawdust. Blend in 1/4 lb water. Press it out into four 1/4 lb \u201cburgers\u201d. The burgers are certainly \u201cmade WITH 100% beef\u201d but they are also \u201cmade WITH 100% saw dust\u201d and made WITH 100% water. To be just as tricky, you can say \u201cCONTAINS 100% beef\u201d allowing for other ingredients. Thanks to trump\u2019s deregulation of the food industry, sawdust can be represented in so many different ways in the ingredient list. A good quality burger will be \u201cmade OF 100% beef\u201d and beef is the only ingredient allowable. \u201cMade using only 100% beef\u201d is also valid. ",

            "answer_text": "Wendy\u2019s uses some of the best beef in the industry. First their hamburger meat is never frozen, it is always fresh and it is 100% beef. Some people used to the taste of frozen beef may find Wendy\u2019s not to their liking. Fresh beef has a different flavor from frozen beef and some (much to my surprise) don\u2019t like it.Years ago, beef was delivered to each Wendy\u2019s in 20lb bags and each restaurant made its own patties. This was a process that involved a rather large machine and a very coordinated worker. The machine was not supposed to run continuously and this was a lot harder than it sounds.Nowadays the beef arrives already formed in patties but is still fresh as it can be.By the way American stores get only American beef.
