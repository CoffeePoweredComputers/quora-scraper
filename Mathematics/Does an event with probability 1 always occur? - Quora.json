            "answer_text": "Yes, that is the definition of \u201cprobability 1\u201d - it always occurs. It\u2019s the same thing as saying \u201cprobability 100%\u201d. This is most accurate when \u201cpredicting\u201d something that has already happened. Before the U.S. Presidential election, tipsters gave Hillary Clinton a 0.75 probability of winning. After the election, Donald Trump won with probability 1.0. (Technically, it might have been something like 0.9999 as something could have invalidated the election after the fact.) The only exception is if the probability was incorrectly calculated. For example, based on 10,000 trials, let\u2019s say a coin flip always came up either heads or tails. It would be correct to say that the coin has always had either a heads or tails result with probability 1. But that historical data does not guarantee that the next flip will come up heads or tails. Maybe there is a 1 in a million chance that the coin will land on edge. Or you flip the coin into something like honey, where it becomes suspended and never lands. Or on a beach, and it lands on edge supported by sand. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. The very definition of probability P is some real number between the CLOSED set of real numbers [0,1], (or that number expressed in odds  One of the things I learned about risk - in the context of liquidity & insurance - (earthquake insurance, home & contents, car, life, etc.) was risks with a probability of 100% , i.e P = 1 WILL happen. There are risks with 100 percent probability of occurrence. This is because they are either happening now ,or they are 100% certain to happen in the future. This makes people skeptical because they think Risk itself involves some level of uncertainty- risk involves a number of carefully calculated measures by analyzing large amounts of data, and crunching the numbers to juggle a delicate balancing act between profitability, pricing, and payouts. - but that is because many don\u2019t see that risk comes in different flavors; Strategic Risk.Compliance Risk.Operational Risk.Financial Risk.Reputational Risk.",
