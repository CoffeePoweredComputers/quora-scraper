            "answer_text": "I think the other answers are good summaries of \"why people find elementary and high school-math difficult\".  Some people are bad at this type of math (which is not really math at all, but is actually just \"calculation\" or \"numeracy\").  Some people can do this type of math, but then find out that they are actually bad at REAL math when they have to learn it in university. School Maths: \"Maths\" in school is a discipline in which you learn a detailed set of protocols (step by step instructions) and then apply these protocols to a variety of situations.  This isn't *really* math: it is calculation!  I was bad at this type of math.  You can be bad at this type of math by being imprecise/not detail-oriented, having a hard time memorizing things that are structured as step-by-step instructions, having a hard time concentrating on repetitive tasks, having a hard time doing mental arithmetic, finding the subject too boring to invest any time in, having a sense of fear when studying math/expectation of failure.  I fit 100% of the above descriptions.  If you are also like me: don't be disheartened!!!  This is NOTHING like any math you would do above linear algebra or multivariable calculus!!!  Take a class in discrete mathematics (probably the easiest proof-based class, at least at my university) to test the waters and see if you are bad at mathematics or just bad at calculation!  I'm doing a PhD in applied mathematics-ish field now, so there you go! Real Maths:Real maths are much cooler than calculation!  You have to think creatively to solve problems.  In a lot of cases you need to think about how one problem \"maps\" onto another. Answers are often clever or elegant.  (There is some essay about how if schools taught music like they taught math, then you would spend 12 years learning how to transcribe musical scores and draw all the notes correctly before ever playing a single song.)  People fail at this level when they realize they aren't creative enough to come up with solutions to problems or if they struggle thinking about abstract things.  There are usually many many ways of approaching the problem, and some people can't think beyond the next few steps and often go off on a futile path.  Also, these fields tend to be poorly taught, so you have to be self motivated.  Finally, a lot of people who were the best of their class when they were taught calculation give up when they find themselves in the bottom half of the class, because they never had to work hard in math before and feel disheartened. Engineering Maths:In applied math fields, you don't need to solve any equations by hand (or at least very rarely).  You usually just let the computer do the calculation.  Instead, the important part is being able to have an intuition about equations.  This takes skills like mental estimation (guessing, not calculating), being able to understand how to describe the behavior of a system in terms of a category of equation, being able to mentally approximate the results of a model, and being able to reason about cases where your model would fail.  As a basic example: say you have a line y=ax+b.  You need to have the intuition to know that 'a' determines how fast the graph goes up and 'b' determines where the line will intersect with the axis.  People who struggle with this type of math are people who operate too mechanically, instead of taking a step back and thinking \"does this make sense\". People who are not good at visualizing graphs in their head might also struggle.   Therefore, there are different skills involved in different types of math.  If you are bad at \"school maths\" don't get disheartened!  You might still be able to become a mathematician or at least use math in your field!  Don't let calculation scare you! ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics requires an ability to study in complete isolation without getting lonely and without getting discouraged or distracted. There is a self-esteem issue, when you read something and don't understand, you feel worthless and stupid, and these blows to the ego must be shrugged off, and you just try again. It's catastrophic to the ego, because the set of stuff you can prove and other people can't is empty nearly all of the time. So irrationally inflated ego is psychologically useful, because you are going to be constantly confronting your own undeniable, quantifiable, stupidity. Irrationally inflated ego is generally associated with young males. Mathematics is also anti-rewarded by society, in that the more you study it, past a certain point, the less competent you will be at social stuff, like getting a date, because your brain will just keep getting rewired by the math, and you just get objectively smarter, and pretty soon you can't talk to anybody except other math people, because people don't understand you or find you boring, except for a small contingent of mostly young males. So by studying math, you are basically making the decision to work very hard to earn less money and be more socially awkward. So all the people who want political power just don't study it. But why would anyone study it? It's because with mathematics, there is permanent and irreversible progress--- it's been a long continuous punctuated revolution since the 1350s with no equal, except perhaps in the sciences. So you see that progress is possible in an objective way--- it is now easy to prove things that were hard or impossible even 50 years ago, and there's nothing people did 100 years ago that we don't find ridiculously easy to do today. This will go on forever. There is something else that is hard about the mathematics, which is that the pedagogy is terrible. You just can't learn it well in school, because the folks teaching you don't know the history of the field so well. There are also sticking points where mathematics contradicts intuition, and there are exactly two of these, both related: * Godel's theorem: people get discouraged by the idea that there are \"unprovable theorems\". The resolution to this is to understand the theorem, and know that it isn't saying that there are objectively \"unprovable theorems\", rather it is giving you a procedure to make axiom systems stronger, and it is perfectly reasonable to assume that all reasonable theorems become provable at some point. This is mathematician's theology--- all arithmetic conjectures will be resolved by a sufficiently large ordinal.* Continuum issues: these are the continuum hypothesis, and well-ordering the reals, and the non-measurable sets. These things are resolved by learning forcing, and by understanding the computational perspective that denies these questions having objective meaning, unlike arithmetic statements. These things were the critical issues for me. There was also some resistance to categories, but the theory there is sufficiently straightforward that you can learn it even if you hate it, and after you learn it you stop hating it. There is another issue of nonuniqueness. There are always many ways to prove something, and people have their own favorite way. So you try to prove things your own way, and you might fail, and someone else does it another way. Maybe your way is better. But sometimes people lose their own creative spark by reading too much about other people's ways. But sometimes people lose their focus by not reading other people's proofs. So who knows what's best here. Generally it's easier to learn mathematics than it has ever been, and it is much better today than 20 years ago, thanks to plentiful internet resources. In a little while it should be easy enough to make mathematical literacy (like understanding everything up to the 1950s) a reasonably universal adult skill. That will make certain progress in society, since there are certain logical fallacies, like gambling, that mathematically trained people don't make. ",

            "answer_text": "People find maths difficult because it is inherently difficult. Or- the time to realize one doesn't understand Math is much lesser than any other discipline.  I've graduated with degree in Mathematics & Computing alongside completing various courses in humanities- economics, literature, sociology. Nevertheless I'd prefer encountering a new topic/academic work in the latter for one in maths requires much more endurance and struggle. Why? Because Mathematics is too difficult to relate to. (I mean advanced mathematics, not basic arithmetic) Comparing to a subject like music, history, literature- we tend to have some ideas or opinions regarding them. Although it may bias our reading, it eases as well for it helps in association. Contrarily when we sit with Maths, we're dealing with something entirely new whose practical implications in our daily life are hard to imagine. If we draw a hierarchy tree, Maths would sit atop as it's concepts get used in 'applied fields'. The farther anything moves from reality, the more difficult it becomes to comprehend.  Even after studying advanced maths for 5 years, I'd struggle to define topology, while I can voice opinions on state-of-law, events in history and implications, intent of writers through protagonists primarily due to the subjective nature of these subjects. If I state \"World War 2 was won by Germany\" then I am wrong, but any further discussions on the topic \"Was US right in bombing Japan?\" to even the most extreme question considered \"Was Hitler doing the right thing\" can have diverse opinions. Although these views maybe kiddish, there is a place for them motivating students to pursue further for they can connect with it. Contrarily the objectivity of Maths makes it much tougher. Everything has a definite answer. Is \"Hausdorff space compact?\", \"Is this system deterministic or probable? If the latter, what is the probability?\" There's no \"maybe it's probabilistic system\". There's no place for 'opinions' and those who missed the basics of the subject would fail to understand the successive things entirely. So if one can't understand compactness of spaces, how would one answer if Hausdorff spaces are compact? (When I say difficult, I mean the concepts not the computation-which follows a methodical approach). Burden of proof increases the difficulty- no statement can be accepted without conclusive, irrefutable proof.These follow a sequence of arguments (theorems or axioms). In each step, one may find themselves drifting further from reality.   Any signs of reality? Most of my comparisons have been based against social sciences. However if we compare against sciences like physics, chemistry, medicine- still maths stands as more abstract and incomprehensible. We maybe able to relate to pulleys and resistance circuits more easily than epsilons & deltas primarily because we can see the former with our eyes. Similarly- flora, fauna, our human body- their tangible nature makes it more intuitive than maths. In the end, media-coverage also affects our subconscious understanding. This makes social sciences easier- basic level familiarity with it. If we'd more coverage on science-issues we'd have found them relatively easier. If media focused on proofs and abstraction more, maybe we'd found Math easier- but of course we want a life closer to reality, not away! ",

            "answer_text": "It is merely my humble opinion, but one I\u2019ll back up with an article showing that there is at least one other with the same opinion. Mathematics (and, by extension, science) has become difficult because we are not explaining the philosophy behind mathematics and science when we learn. Furthermore, we are trying to explain something which another author here (please help me find the quote) says something along the lines of it being a big upfront investment that takes a long time before the payoff can be seen. Now, we can show small examples of payoff immediately (calculating a pocketbook), but with the big payoffs (descriptions of scientific concepts and computing) being so far removed, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of why someone should learn it, and therefore, the demotivation some may get, makes it appear more difficult. And the demotivation part is important. Many kids are interested in learning things, but somewhere down the line they feel that they are not smart enough, or they have an experience that leaves them frustrated with an authority, or something is taught to them in such a way that it gives them no hope that they are learning anything beneficial. So, I\u2019d like to get further into the root, and the philosophical and psychological reasons for this. First of all, logic may seem intuitive and obvious at first, but the application of logic (which mathematics ultimately is) actually requires a lot of thought. Sometimes the results of applying logic give us things that are intuitive, sometimes things that aren\u2019t immediately intuitive, and sometimes things that are paradoxical by appearance. However, we don\u2019t teach philosophy. We don\u2019t teach formally logic the same way we do math, and then expect them to use such logic in mathematics. We don\u2019t really get into what differentiates the formal sciences from the natural/social sciences. We expect students to believe that mathematics is the study of numbers (it\u2019s isn\u2019t - or rather, the if it is, it\u2019s because the concept of numbers is FAR LARGER than anything they can imagine, but we don\u2019t have a clear definition for that word). We have ways that they can put math in action, but we expect students to: accept they are learning it for the sake of math itself (which, the analytical reasoning skills ARE extremely important)accept that they may or may not use it in their daily lives (even though many will use things they don\u2019t think they will, and won\u2019t use things they think they will)accept that there are valid use cases for almost all mathematics they will encounter, up through the undergraduate level, but we either make the stories too unbelievable, or don\u2019t bother to find a diverse set of uses for ithave an intuition of the subject without seeing such a use caseYou can see that items #1 and #3 conflict with #4. PS. (this was edited in) I wanted to add that many students tend to get stuck on existence. Philosophically, ontology (the study of what is meant by existence) is a difficult subject. When we learn about negative number, and numbers like 0, and imaginary numbers, some students get stuck on existence. We can and should always provide physical interpretations of any concept where we can, but should always be clear that using mathematics is always about the interpretation, not the ontology (which I think is probably a much clearer difference between applied and pure math). Existence has a meaning in mathematics (it\u2019s a quantifier), and we have now seemed to taken the route that if it can exist, then it probably does, and we should stop focusing so much on the ontology in order to study it. The ontology is a great philosophical discussion, but it isn\u2019t required by mathematics to find uses. (Richard Muller's answer to Do imaginary numbers actually exist, and is there any physical quantity that is actually complex?)  Ultimately, I\u2019d like to say this: mathematics is the subject that is the most rigorous (matter-of-fact and exact in speech). It requires precise definitions, precise explanations, and doesn\u2019t take anything for granted. Not everyone teaching mathematics has been taught properly, and we expect them to teach students properly and without demotivating the students. However, it\u2019s not difficult, it\u2019s just foreign at first, and anything foreign can be learned with effort and experience. If you are having problems learning from a teacher, supplement your learning online. If it is not the teacher, maybe you should sit down and ask for other ways of seeing the problems you are having (new views and interpretations on things are a big part of mathematics). If it is some trauma that has turned you off, unfortunately \u201cgetting back on the horse\u201d is the best and only option (probably after discussing the event with a counselor, or another math teacher you can trust). Ultimately, get help!!! Mathematics is not done in isolation, and learning mathematics should not be done in isolation either. Start a joint study group. Get a (non-judgmental) tutor. Also, don\u2019t treat mathematics or science skill as if it\u2019s some measure of your intelligence. Sometimes people mature in these skills at different rates, and sometimes they go through spurts. Sometimes, the children that did the best in high school do the worst in college, and vice versa. Sometimes the subjects you failed become your favorite subjects.  I\u2019ll reiterate here. Early mathematics is more difficult to teach than it is to learn. We have to give definitions, but too intuitive, and people get lost thinking that the intuition is what matters. If it\u2019s too rigorous (precise), it\u2019s boring and turns the students off of the subject. It requires patience and persistence on the part of the teacher, and is especially more so when there is a diverse group with cliques that understand quickly, and those that take more time. It requires understanding how students think, and refining that understanding as generations change. It requires appealing to things that make them laugh, things that make them think, and things that make them motivated. It requires positive critique that doesn\u2019t demotivate the students. It requires doing all of this while ensuring that the students understand the subject well enough to make high marks on the tests that will ultimately be the judge of the teachers themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "I've struggled with this my whole life. I'm one of those who gets it. But as a math teacher, I have to figure out why people don't get it. Here are some of the conclusions I've found though both anecdote and looking at research. Math is cumulative. Students are often used to learn and dump. Learn it, test it, forget it. Math doesn't allow you to do this. This is also a nightmare for students who have been absent for a long time or have a crisis, like parents who divorce, a relationship gone bad, or a long medical problem. Not to mention what happens if they get a horrible teacher one year. If this happens in any other subject, you can have success the following year. With math, you really have to fill in those gaps before moving on, but most students don't, and with one-size-fits-all curriculum, it's hard to get those gaps filled. (As a side note: If your kid struggles in math, or missed a bunch of school, I recommend intervention early, rather than late.) It is, by nature, abstract. Math is intentionally abstract. The idea is to create abstract tools that can be used in a wide variety of contexts, but this abstraction trips a lot of people up. When you give some people specific hands-on problems, they can solve them. When you confront these same learners with abstract ideas, they can't see the trees for the forest. They can't make the connection between an abstract idea and the specific scenarios they would apply this abstract idea in. Good teaching can get around this, to a degree, by building an abstract idea through a series of specific examples rather than the other way around. Concepts are sometimes introduced at inappropriate times. Different minds develop at different rates. There are milestones that have to be reached before some concepts can be fully understood. One of the reasons that people hate fractions is that some have to learn and use them before their proportional reasoning is fully developed. One reason people hate Algebra is that they have to learn it before their abstract thinking is well developed. Some minds are ill-equipped to do math. Some have better spatial reasoning, some have better logical reasoning. Some have non-math related issues like dyslexia which can be a barrier to learning it. It's really best to avoid this kind of thinking though, because again, development happens at different rates, and just because you don't have as much ability doesn't mean you can't develop a lot. Just because I'll never be an Olympic marathoner doesn't mean I can't increase my endurance considerably by running more. It's hard to do under emotional strain. Any task is hard to do under emotional strain, but whenever you're hyper-emotional, it's near impossible to think logically. This is why test anxiety is multiplied when applied to math. I also have students all the time who just broke up with their boyfriend or girlfriend, or just found out their dad has cancer. Those folks have a hard time doing logical tasks, even if they want to. Math can't be faked. In liberal arts, there aren't as many objective standards as there are in math. If you don't believe me, look at the quantity of liberal arts degrees versus the quantity of STEM degrees. STEM degrees are hard, because you have to know what you're doing, and if you don't it becomes immediately obvious. There are objective standards in other fields, but they aren't always as binary (you know it, or you don't) as they are in math classes. ",

            "answer_text": "Anything can be difficult if it's boring. There are certainly a lot of reasons, but I think these lie at the core:  For most sane human beings, math is an incomprehensibly mind-numbing and entirely fruitless exercise in cerebral fitness; nothing more.Math teachers tend to be complete nerds who are great with numbers and terrible at connecting with people.Math teachers are typically inept at associating math lessons with reality.Math is completely unemotional for most people. It doesn't engage you on any personal level. Without any spark of feeling to drive a student's interest, they will never become captivated by the subject.I always managed top grades in math studies and took most of the advanced courses up until college. Honestly it bored me to death, but it was pretty easy for me so I could score well without much effort. The only time I was ever really excited about math is when I was at home, programming my 8086. I got a 486 when I was around 12-13 and started coding 3D transformation algorithms for a simple rendering engine I was building. I had to teach myself the math, and I actually found it pretty intuitive because it fit into a greater purpose; it had context in a project that I was really passionate about completing. It didn't dawn on me how little I actually cared about math for the sake of math until I started taking advanced courses as a freshman in college. The professor sucked. He wrote his own course book and it was almost completely illegible (it didn't help that I hate sloppy handwriting). He was everything you would expect in a stereotypical mathematician: impersonal, disconnected from his students, and obsessed with numbers. Not once did we get out of our seats and put our theories and knowledge to the test in any real life circumstances. Not once did he approach students individually to discover their innate talents or interests. He might has well have been a talking textbook. It was an absolute bore, and it permanently threw a wet blanket on any interest I had in the subject for many years. The sad thing is that I absolutely love physics. If I hadn't pursued a career in computers, it probably would have been physics (or neurology, but I didn't quite discover my passion for the subject until much later in life). Unfortunately physics has extreme demands for mathematical ability. If only I had somehow brought the two together years ago, it probably would have given me some passion for the subject. It seems to me that once you get beyond the basics, math studies really need to have a place in the bigger picture. Teaching advanced concepts & math history without any thought to application is possibly the most effective way to drive students away from the subject. ",

            "answer_text": "Math is abstract and the more abstract it gets, the more difficult it gets. What is 1/3? If you visualize a pie, then 1/3 is one out of three slices of pie, all three of which make up the whole pie. What does it mean for a metric space to be compact? You can appeal to your knowledge of Euclidean space and closed sets to help understand the concept of metric spaces and compactness, but there isn't much freedom for relying on real world experience anymore (if you disagree, then substitute compact metric space with something appropriately abstract) and you are instead forced to appeal to previous mathematical knowledge. Math is rigorous. This applies mainly to higher level math and can hinder both mathematical understanding and mathematical doing. If math is presented in a very rigorous manner, it can be difficult to translate this into something more intuitive. Compare the intuitive explanation of a limit to the epsilon-delta definition for a good example of this. Reading proofs can be especially difficult because they not only require you to be able to comprehend mathematical gibberish but to be able to do so continuously while following a mathematical train of thought for several lines, paragraphs, or even pages. Additionally, having to translate the other way can make actually producing rigorous mathematical work (e.g. doing proofs) very difficult. Math can be counter-intuitive which can make it confusing. Any area of math involving infinity gives a good example of this. A good portion of any undergraduate level linear algebra textbook is going to have the disclaimer \"for finite vector spaces\" somewhere in almost every theorem because the friendly, intuitive theorems of finite dimensional linear algebra fall apart in infinite dimensions. Math has prerequisites. If you don't understand the prerequisites well, then topics that build on them will be very difficult to comprehend. Some people have an easier time with hardcore logic and abstractions than other people. I'd like to think I'm good at math but I am very bad at art and so an equally valid question from my perspective might be \"Why is drawing so hard?\" Really, I mean I do notice when some people have slightly taller heads than other people or slightly bigger/smaller ears, etc., but how on earth can people look at someone's face and not only be able to comprehend all the details but also be able to translate them into a portrait that looks exactly like that person? How do they even create continuous shading with only one pencil? When I try to do that I can only get 2-3 shades: light, dark, and maybe some sort of in between. ",

            "answer_text": "Math is hard because it is important enough to study the hard parts of it. Everything can be difficult or easy depending on how deep you go in. Can you calculate 1+2? Did you get 3? Good. Was that hard? Of course not. If the only math anyone expected you to do was things like 1+2, would you think that math is hard? No. Likewise, if people expected you to run a marathon each day, you would ask why is running so hard. If people expected you to beat chess grandmasters, you'd be asking why is chess so hard. They don't expect this of you. Why? Because it's not important. If you're not a professional athlete, running marathons is not important, you can stay healthy with much milder exercise. Chess is a fun and beneficial hobby but ultimately it's not very important - so society doesn't force you to play chess, you do it if you feel like it. But math is important. The more math you know, the better you'll be equipped to handle a variety of situations in your professional and personal life. Society realizes this and requires that everyone studies math. And not just the easy parts - people are challenged to study a relatively high level of math, because of all its benefits. By definition the math studied will be hard, because if it was easy, people would be required to study even harder math! It's not only the average college student that studies much math. Professional academics advance the frontiers of mathematical research - and here again, because math is so important, a lot of smart people put a lot of effort in it, so the math they come up with is much, much harder than what the average person can handle. I've mentioned the \"required\" math to be relatively high - it's relative only to the aptitude of the average person, it's a drop in the ocean compared to all the math that is out there. There is another aspect - while society is right about teaching math to everyone, it is often very wrong about which parts of math to teach, and how. Anything can seem hard if it is taught poorly. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of reasons why people claim that mathematics is difficult: mathematics has a very low tolerance level for errors. In many subjects, you can get by with reasonable approximations of an answer. In mathematics, you usually don't get away with approximations. Your answer has to be exact. I would argue that most subjects are in fact harder than mathematics, but since you can get away with approximations in most fields (which often leads to a lot of B.S.), many people feel that these fields are easier, while they're in fact just getting away with an incorrect or incomplete answer. In mathematics, if you're wrong, you will know it immediately.;people tell each other that mathematics is difficult, which reinforces their view that mathematics is difficult. If you constantly tell yourself and are told by others that mathematics is difficult, then you'll find it difficult, regardless of whether it's actually difficult;many people haven't even mastered very basic concepts before moving on to more difficult ideas in mathematics. You really shouldn't be doing calculus if you aren't even comfortable with basic algebra, yet many people are doing exactly that. You never should move on to a more advanced topic if the foundation on which that topic is built isn't as obvious to you as '1+1=2';mathematics is dense. People, especially in this era, are used to skimming, and they mostly get away with it, since most authors don't refrain from taking up ten pages to explain an idea that you could explain on just one page. In mathematics, it's the complete opposite. You may have a very thin 50-page textbook that has a wealth of information and requires more time and practice than a 500-page textbook in, say, psychology. Yet many people try to get through this very dense textbook in the same way as they would get through a not-so-dense humanities textbook, which is a recipe for disaster. Or they will feel that they are slower and then think that they're doing poorly because it takes so much time, while that's in fact just because the book is dense rather than because of their lack of understanding.mathematics simply requires a lot of practice. If you don't practice, and many people who find mathematics hard don't, then you simply won't get it. Too many students read a mathematics textbook as if it's a novel, and this simply doesn't work. You have to sit down with your textbook on your left side and plenty of empty sheets of paper on your right and just do tons of exercises.",

            "answer_text": "1. Anyone who reads what college students write will quickly realize that many students find writing difficult. 2. In addition, what we call \"math\" is really three different subjects. 1) Arithmetic. We know what that is. 2) What I call quantitative reasoning, this is the ability to know what answers are ridiculous. 3) Then there's math. Arithmetic is to math as spelling is to creative writing - maybe nice to have, but by no means essential. Most people never learn ANY math.  Math is not about adding and subtracting, or even differentiating and integrating. Math is about the search for structured beauty. It is more akin, in some ways, to sculpture or poetry (especially in highly structured forms) than to engineering. 3. In elementary school, we are usually taught by people who don't like math and who never do any.  If you wanted to take music lessons, you would demand that the teacher know how to play (and probably that he/she listen to music). If you wanted to learn how to cook, dance, write or anything else.... It would be similar. Why is math different? 4. Math is taught all wrong. We teach math (mostly) in one of two ways. I will draw analogies to learning to play the piano. Method 1: At the first lesson, the student taps middle c repeatedly. At the second lesson the d next to the c. And so on for 88 lessons before even starting to learn a song.  Method 2: At the first lesson, the student watches a video of Vladimir Horowitz. At the next lesson, Art Tatum. And so on. The student is not permitted to touch a piano. 5. We teach math as if it were easy, when it is, in fact, hard.  One huge steppingstone for many is negative numbers. Do you know how long it took the smartest mathematicians to learn to deal properly with them? Thousands of years! We teach kids that they are supposed to get the right answer, probably on the first attempt at each problem. Why should they? 6. Culturally, we permit badness at math in ways we do not permit badness at other subjects.  \"Oh, I'm no good at math!\" is fine to say. \"Oh, I never learned to read!\" - not so much.  7. Math is formal. It is the most formal subject, and most people have little or no practice dealing with formal subjects. ",

            "answer_text": "Alright, this is a topic that\u2019s pretty close to my heart, and I\u2019m gonna have to disagree with most of the other answers for this topic. I would posit that mathematics isn\u2019tnearly as hard as most people think it is. However, it is so heavily stigmatized that people begin to have the wrong ideas when going into math, which only hurts them in the end. So, why is math perceived as such a hard thing? I\u2019ll list the reasons: Bad beginnings \u2013 Math is highly foundation-based, and it is something that continues to build upon itself as you go higher up in education. People\u2019s main foundation of mathematical knowledge, which begins at the elementary school level, isn\u2019t as good as it needs to be. Why? Because elementary school teachers often don\u2019t like teaching math.[1] [2] When a teacher doesn\u2019t enjoy what they\u2019re teaching, the student is almost definitely not going to enjoy it, either.Media stigma \u2013 Math gets a bad reputation with virtually every reference made to it in the media. When cartoons are constantly perpetuating the idea that math is boring, or math is difficult, or math is something no one wants to do, it\u2019s not difficult to see why children would hate it. Even if they don\u2019t hate it, it will almost definitely make them approach math much more apprehensively, and that is arguably the worst attitude to have when trying to learn something. When\u2019s the last time you went into something thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to understand this, it seems like it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d and came out of it thinking ,\u201cWow, that concept was easier to grasp than I expected!\u201d It\u2019s really not a common sequence of events.Excuses \u2013 If you were to ask how many times a math teacher gets the question, \u201cWhen am I going to use this in real life?\u201d, you would probably get a ridiculous eye-roll and a long lecture. The thing is, you won\u2019t use most of it in real life. But that\u2019s not exactly a problem. You seldom quote Hamlet or Catcher in the Rye in real life. NFL players aren\u2019t expected to do pushups or lift weights in the middle of the playing field. However, these things are still important to do, because they help us grow in different ways. Mathematics is no different. But people are so eager to use this excuse when they can\u2019t do something the first time, and get discouraged from trying it any further.So, to answer your question, I don\u2019t buy the narrative that mathematics is inherently any more difficult than, say, analyzing sociopolitical structures. You have to realize that there are things you know now that are so ingrained in your brain that they seem like common sense, and you can\u2019t imagine not knowing them. But there was a time when you didn\u2019t know these things. By that logic, what is really outside of the grasp of human comprehension? The things you could be thinking are absolutely impossible to understand now could very well be common sense to you in a year. If you don\u2019t go into something thinking it\u2019s going to be hard, and really internalize the concept that, hey, this is understood by a lot of people, so there\u2019s got to be some sense behind it, you\u2019ll be surprised by what you\u2019re able to learn.

            "answer_text": "Most people consider math hard, because they have weak foundations in the subject material. Then when they try to do something in math, they struggle with it. That difficulty leads many persons to give up prematurely and accept that they aren\u2019t good at math and that math is hard because our society has developed an acceptability in declaring that math is hard and that we may suck at it. There is a shame associated with not being good at reading or writing, but when it comes to math, we often brag \u201cI suck at math.\u201d and wear that statement proudly. It\u2019s strange. Then there is the reality that math is hard. If I told you to prove numbers existed, could you do it? The idea of numbers is arbitrary and abstract. It\u2019s representative of an idea of value and nothing more. Sure, the word apple is arbitrary in that it is applied to a fruit, but you can at least pick that apple up to build up that association. You really can\u2019t pick up -1 or pi. You have to trust that it is what it is. Once we\u2019ve gotten past that association, we take the numbers away and still teach you it is mathematics. The abstract becomes even more abstract. The only foundation left is pretty much logic and logic doesn\u2019t make intuitive sense to a lot of people, because it follows rigid rules that don\u2019t seem to always make sense. For instance, what\u2019s the difference between or and or? Most people would say they are the same and they would be both right and wrong. That doesn\u2019t seem like it can make sense to people. What about the difference between + and \u2295? They are the same question and yet, one inherently looks harder than the other simply because it\u2019s difficult to sense what the distinction being made is in the former question. Part of that is the abstract nature of mathematics and logic. Part of that is the limitation of the English language for describing logic operations. All of these issues compound to make math less accessible to people who do not have a solid foundation in the why of mathematics. Understanding that why really solidifies the ability to do mathematics, because you can understand when all of these symbols are meant to work together. That\u2019s crucial and is often overlooked when we teach students through rote memorization. I mean, if I told you + means inclusive or, then asked you to solve 1 + 2, what would you tell me the answer is? At least, when tutoring and teaching math, these appeared to be the primary things I noticed causing my students problems. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with math, versus other talents like writing\u2014it requires at least 10-12 years just to grasp until calculus level, and if you fall behind one, two years\u2014with bad teachers-- it may be hard to catch up to that level of math that's needed.  Many people(including me!) had bad experiences of one, two years, of bad teachers, fell behind\u2014and while you're already behind, problems get more and more challenging, then you get frustrated you're behind\u2014and by that time you can't  catch up to the brilliant students there. And get this, till 10th grade, that's considered basic. That's ten years just to grasp basic math.   Unlike writing\u2014other things\u2014that yes, require practice, and hard work\u2014but you don't necessarily need formal training, and constant discipline to first of all, like it, and to secondly, to be good at it. (You can pick up writing, any time\u2014there's no exact set of from addition-->to calculus like math does)  It's quite difficult to effectively teach math, which is the  foundation of so many things, and I found that the k-12 school system severely lacks good teachers that effectively teach math, and as such, very frequently it's required from the parents to be involved and make sure kids do homework and get it. I had a brilliant father at home who taught well, but was too busy, and missed the cue signs when I started getting way worse in math.  Many in the high achieving schools(including my brother), have involved parents who help them after school, take extra classes, etc\u2014because effective teaching of math on average, in the US, does not exist.  It's a terrible problem, and this was written by the way, by a person who hates and sucks at math(<---Me). It's a serious problem the fact that the world is moving only more towards math and data extraction direction, and yet,  teaching math, making it an urgent priority that kids get a basic, good, grasp of math only seriously exists in highly motivated families that the parents make it their business to make sure kids  grasp and get the fundamental skills of math.

            "answer_text": "Math isn't difficult. The way it's taught is difficult. In math class, you'd be told there are 8 kids and 4 cookies. Your task would be to divide them up equally. The answer would be 1/2 a cookie each. In real life, there would be multiple solutions. Maybe not all kids like ginger cookies. Maybe there would be other snacks. Maybe you wouldn't bring out the cookies because they don't break neatly into halves. That's all mathematical reasoning. In math class, you'd be told apples are 3 for $5. How many apples can you buy for $8? But that's not a realistic problem. In real life, you might decide the oranges are a better deal. Or you'd have $10 to spend on apples for apple bobbing at the church fundraiser. Since your store is normal they sell apples by the pound. So you'd pick out the smallest. Or you'd ask the produce manager if there were some imperfect apples that she might donate to the church then use the $10 on something else. In math class, 90% of the time the numbers have no context so you're just manipulating them for no purpose. The answers won't solve world peace. Whether they're right or wrong they'll end up in the trash. Math is using numbers as an aid in decision making. When making decisions, the context is important. You know why the numbers are what they are. You know also how flexible the situation is. In math class, there is no context. Or the context is made up, unrealistic and inflexible. As an unschooled child, my daughter learned mathematical thinking from the decisions she made. One of the best sources was video games. Just ordinary games like Mario Brothers and Pokemon. She figured out how to use the numbers in the games to make choices. By the time she was 14, she decided to take her father's college statistics course for fun. She did better than 90% of the students who had 12+ years of school math. From that, it seems school math hinders learning math. Since my husband teaches remedial Algebra and pre-Algebra to incoming college students, he'd agree. ",

            "answer_text": "First, because it is cumulative. Everything builds on what came before. So, if you fail to learn/understand one piece, then it is almost impossible to make sense of later parts of mathematics that depend on that piece. Second, it is taught poorly, especially in early grades. People who become elementary school teachers often (know that they) don't really understand mathematics, and think it is less important for them to fully understand mathematics. Combining this with the first point, you can see why many people will, at some point, find mathematics to be hard Third, over time, math textbooks get worse. To convince yourself of this, go find a copy of Courant\u2019s 1937 book on calculus. In my opinion, this is the best calculus book ever written. It explains all of the key ideas and illustrates them with real applications. It teaches people how to solve hard problems. The \u201cnew math\u201d of the 1960's replaced this approach with an emphasis on abstract theory (possibly inspired by the efforts of Bourbaki to do the same thing to math at the highest level of cutting edge research). This might have been appropriate for the miniscule fraction of people who would go on to become professional mathematicians. But it was a disaster for most students. The over-reaction was to remove most of the theoretical aspects, and replace them with \u2026 effectively nothing. This resulted in textbooks without adequate theory and without real applications. Instead, students got (and still get) drill-and-kill based on pattern recognition rather than understanding. And they got obviously artificial problems like \u201cthe melting snowman walking past the lamppost\u201d that encouraged students to believe that calculus had nothing useful to offer. ",

            "answer_text": "Math is difficult because everything is difficult. Writing stories is difficult. Dancing is difficult.   Acting is difficult.   A few years ago I heard a section on the radio where they brought people in off the street and asked them to read the weather report. They were appalling. Really, really bad. Reading the weather on the radio is difficult. Writing good answers on Quora is difficult.  A very few people are good at any of these. But with most things, it's hard to know just how bad you are. Watch the early American Idols. Most of those people are dross. But they are really, truly horribly disappointed when they are booted off.   I think I could read the weather on the radio, just as well as the person who reads it now. I will probably be shocked when I find out how bad I am at it. Go to any restaurant or cafe in Los Angeles - most of the wait staff moved to LA because they wanted to be actors. They really thought they have a chance of being a famous (or even working) actor.  But most of them don't, because it's really difficult to be a good actor. Your job is probably difficult. I probably couldn't do it. When I tell people what my job is, they start talking to me about it, because they think they have something interesting to tell me about my job. (I'm a psychologist.) But I think I have it bad? I should probably try being Mikka Luster - \"You're a cook. I cook in my kitchen. Let me tell you about your job\".   But if you're not good at math, you know it. It hits you in the face.  Straight away. Hard.  There's no pretending or fooling yourself. I can throw a steak on a grill, or make a pasta sauce and pretend I know how to cook.*  But I can't, ever, integrate that equation. Obligatory XKCD comic:  *A friend of mine used to like baking cakes. Their friends were polite and said \"Yum! Delicious cakes!\" The friend thought they knew how to bake. They sold cakes to a place that did 'Farmhouse Teas'. On more than one occasion, a customer returned the cake, because it was inedible. ",

            "answer_text": "Learning math is often likened to learning a foreign language. Both subjects involve the building up of basic knowledge before advancing to a higher level of study. Let\u2019s say, when we study trigonometry or calculus for example, we need to have a stable and concrete algebra foundations in order to solve more complex problems. But can we be definitely sure that most students have mastered all their basic concepts before progressing to a higher level of mathematics? First, we should take a look at our current education system. Many schools, which I have studied at or visited to gain experience, etc., adopt a similar education style, particularly when it comes to teaching mathematics. Teachers will run through a set of pre-prepared notes, which consist of many different types of math questions. These examples are done and after the lessons are completed, students will proceed on to do their tutorials. Then, the module is considered finished and here goes the next topic. How can we be sure that students have successful mastered the basic concepts? The truth is that they don\u2019t. How many of your classmates have lamented about their woes of trigonometry? This stems from the way we teach math. Rather than teaching students the reasoning and proof behind formulas and rules, we tend to slant our emphasis on the applications of these formulas. The main reason why many people find mathematics so hard come from the situation of them not fully grasping a concept and then getting lost going forward as the foundation for that string of knowledge is missing. Shifting our focus to the reasoning behind mathematics principles will make students understand the purpose of the formulas. of course, learning something foreign blindly will make it so hard. P.S. I recently read the potato paradox, it is very interesting. Go read more about it! From the Universal Book of Mathematics: Fred brings home 100 pounds of potatoes, which (being purely mathematical potatoes) consist of 99 percent water. He then leaves them outside overnight so that they consist of 98 percent water. What is their new weight? The surprising answer is 50 pounds. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it is highly cumulative and mastery is required at every level before advancing on to the next level. More than any other subject, math builds from one section to another. You can\u2019t do multiplication if you don\u2019t have an excellent understanding of addition. You can try, but it will probably eat you alive. Similarly, you can\u2019t do algebra if you don\u2019t understand arithmetic that well. And you won\u2019t be able to do calculus if you\u2019re struggling with algebra. You can\u2019t just get through one level and move onto the next, you have to have full understanding, because at the next level, the previous level will be considered \u2018grunt work\u2019, and will be assumed automatic. My college calculus book, for example, went through complicated sections of Algebra, Algebra 2 level concepts at least, in one or two steps in a problem, assuming that it would be no problem for a calculus student to be able to quickly execute this algebra. Unfortunately, this is too often not the case, and students struggle with the basic material that they supposedly mastered. When I was in algebra 2, we were learning about solving 3-D systems (by substitution and elimination, not matrices). For whatever reason, I could not get the problems right. I did so many 3-D systems that semester, looked at worksheets on the internet, went to the extra problems in the back of the book, did anything that would help me get the right answer. By the end of the semester, after many, many hours of extra practice, I might have been getting the right answer half the time. Keep in mind that this was well after our class moved on from the single day we spent learning about 3-D systems, well after I got the 3-D systems on the test wrong, right up until the final exam. My algebra skills improved significantly that semester, and a lot of the improvement came after I started diligently circling my negative signs, because in a lot of cases, I was writing them scrappily and not paying attention to them. Why didn\u2019t I figure this out earlier in math career, rather than spending many, many hours struggling through 3-D systems? Because, for the rest of the algebra that I had learned, it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. I might not pay attention to the negatives in a couple of problems, and lose a few points on the test because of it. Big deal. But suddenly, when you can\u2019t get any problems right because of it, it is a big deal. I remember another instance in high school, where I was helping a student in intermediate algebra (basically Algebra 1.5, for students who are not ready for Algebra 2). It was April and the student was a senior, one month from graduation. The math problems were 2-D systems, to be solved using elimination. We had a situation where one of the equations had a -2x and other equation had a +2x, obviously to be eliminated so the rest of the system could be solved. I asked him what -2+2 was, and he had no idea. He was trying to do algebra without a basic understanding of negative numbers. And this is what I think happens a lot. Somewhere, a basic principle is missed, or misunderstood. The student is passed through because they know the material \u2018well enough\u2019. But then they go on to the next level, and suddenly this small concept that they struggled with a little bit is assumed knowledge in the next level. My Algebra 2 teacher once threatened that if we were made a common mistake on our tests (I don\u2019t remember what the mistake was) he would give us a zero on the test. I\u2019m almost positive he never did it, and I don\u2019t agree with the approach. However, he is right in that small mistakes and misunderstandings like this should not simply be allowed to slip through the system. They should be taken notice of, and corrected as quickly as possible, because down the road, even the small gaps in math can make a difference. Additionally, I think there are some issues in the way some topics are approached. Fractions are pounded in way too much detail in elementary and middle school. In algebra, they are rarely used, and being able to manipulate them is not that important. They are more common in calculus, specifically in integral calculus, but most students have already forgotten everything they learned in middle school by this point, and a calculus student shouldn\u2019t have a problem refreshing themselves on fraction operations. There should be much more emphasis on exponentiation, because that is much more integral to being able to do high school algebra successfully. In other words, emphasis should be placed on the topics most required in the next level, because is that what students will need to be successfully. However, I would say the crux of the problem is not the teaching, but students being passed through without full understanding. ",

            "answer_text": "I have studied math throughout my life. I almost became a mathematician, but I quit my PhD program partly because I found math too hard. I switched into philosophy, which is no easier but is hard for different reasons. One reason math can be hard is that something can work without anyone understanding why it works. This cannot happen in philosophy. A reason learning math that others have done can be hard is that when you are learning something new, you often have to take on faith a bunch of definitions and facts that you can\u2019t yet make sense of. Why is the person defining this concept or setting up this construction in exactly this way rather than all of the other ways they could have done it? Often my first reaction to a new piece of math has been revulsion at technical complexities, and learning involved breaking down my natural resistance and going with the flow. Some but not all of this problem can be blamed on suboptimal presentations of new material. A reason doing math yourself can be hard is that it often involves a long series of steps. You can make a mistake along the way that will vitiate everything that follows. Or you can fail to make some inference that would be easy for someone else. This issue can be helped by doing math with other people, but often that is not possible. (Obviously doing math yourself is also hard, relative to learning math that others have done, because you have to think stuff up.) Doing a kind of math depends on intuition that you only get by doing that kind of math (at multiple levels of particularity). Not having that intuition is more blocking than it is for learning other skills. (Being bad at piano doesn\u2019t prevent you from practicing.) Learning math is like solving an endless complex of chicken-and-egg problems. At lower levels of math education, often the explanations provided to students are incoherent, and the things they are being taught could never have been discovered by the greatest genius in the way and order they are taught. Students may even come up with alternative but equally valid ways of thinking about problems and be told that they are wrong. At least telling students they are wrong when they are clever and right often does not harm them. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me suggest you first read this essay called \u201cLockharts Lament\u201d\u2026 https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf Simplified, the essay points out that if we applied how we teach math to music, then students would spend 12 grades learning music notation, recognizing and reading music, reading gaps, chords, arpeggio\u2019s, etc\u2026 And we\u2019d leave actually playing music until college - as an advanced endeavor. There is tremendous truth in this analogy. Mathematics education is focused on the least important and least useful parts of mathematics - all designed around a requirement for pretty advanced symbolical Alegebra in order to graduate high school. However, very few people (less than 1%) use algebra extensively in college OR in their careers - it simply isn\u2019t that critical. If, instead, we focused education on practical math - math that made sense in terms of our lives - then I don\u2019t believe people would find math nearly as difficult. For example, my son on the autism spectrum struggles badly with math - even simple addition. But, put him in a store wanting to buy two things and then ask him what they cost together? His math is hundreds of times better and his mind far faster - because that MEANS something. For a second reading recommendation: The Math Myth | The New Press by Andrew Hacker. Or his NYTimes OpEd piece Is Algebra Necessary? . NOTE: I answer this as a mathematician (MS- Applied Math, UC-San Diego, worked on rockets and the Space Shuttle) who is also a father of 2, an advertising executive with highly measured advertising, and have taught in business schools.

            "answer_text": "Few reasons why Mathematics is so hard can be: Exposure - Mathematical skills aren\u2019t usually given a lot of attention outside of the classroom. As one quote I saw many years ago said, \"We play with what we love\". Play with numbers, patterns and words from the very beginning and many learning problems will never develop. Logical Skills-Maths requires logic, and many kids are not trained on logical skills at an early age. It helps to decide which problem-solving skill to try first. Support-Children need regular support in order to recognize the mathematics in the world around them, and parents are often the best people to provide this support. Many children don\u2019t receive support or guidance to finish Maths homework. It makes learning tougher for them. Maths Basics \u2013 Basics about Mathematics need to be developed among students from elementary level. Maths is highly foundation-based, and it is something that continues to build upon itself as you go higher up in education. Weak basics make students feel Maths as a hard subject. Tips to develop better Mathematical skills: 1.Maths Foundation \u2013 Calculations become easier if your child understands the Mathematical concepts. Rather than just doing drills or memorizing rules, help them visualize what\u2019s taking place. Practice can help children master the facts and solve problems faster, so use Maths games, flash cards, join Maths Foundation classes to help them learn. 2.Treat Maths as a Game \u2013 Too many of us think of Maths as work, something we do because we have to. If instead we were taught to think of it as a game, we\u2019d probably look at it differently. Maths games can help them learn Mathematical skills while at play. 3. Make Mathematics Real \u2013 Let your child see how important Maths is in life while paying bills, cooking, or making a grocery list. Practical, real-life applications of basic Mathematical concepts can help them learn faster, so take them shopping with you, let them help with measuring ingredients, setting the table, counting fruit and vegetables in the refrigerator, etc. 4.Do Maths Every Day \u2013 Make sure that your child spends time doing calculations every single day. Spend at least 10 minutes with quick Maths activities such as counting, adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, or give them problems to solve on their own. Sit with them while they work on puzzles or assignments. 5.Try New Techniques \u2013 Don\u2019t repeat the same activities over and over till your child gets bored with them. Instead, switch it up to keep things interesting. Try Maths-based story books, videos or educational shows on TV, party games that involve Maths challenges, and more. 6. Abacus and Brain Gym-Learning Abacus can help your child improve his Mathematical skills, calculations speed, concentration etc. Doing brain gym exercises regularly will develop left and right brains. 7.Competition and Rewards \u2013 Your child will be more interested in Maths if they feel a sense of achievement when they master certain concepts or skills. Reward them when they solve problems or find solutions on their own, especially when they do calculations in their head. Along with other students, set up group quizzes or competitions with rewards for the winners. ",

            "answer_text": "The way math is taught is not entirely correct. Mathematics is a way of thinking, not a number-crunching tool. Here is an example of the wrong way to teach mathematics: What is (a+b)3(a+b)3 ? At school, they merely do this: (a+b)(a+b)(a+b)(a+b)(a+b)(a+b) Then: a(a+b)(a+b)+b(a+b)(a+b)a(a+b)(a+b)+b(a+b)(a+b) Then: a(a2+2ab+b2)+b(a2+2ab+b2)a(a2+2ab+b2)+b(a2+2ab+b2) Then: a3+2a2b+ab2+a2b+2ab2+b3a3+2a2b+ab2+a2b+2ab2+b3 Combining similar things: a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3  But what is the right way? The right way is to ask, what does it mean? What is the pattern here? Not only do we need to see the pattern, but also one step before and after it: Here is the pattern:(illustration credit) [1] which is the \u201cwhy\u201d part.  Here is how to think about the pattern, the \u201cwhat is going on\u201d part. I will keep the examples in this part within the power of 2 or (a+b)2(a+b)2 , to keep the topic accessible to all readers: A kind grandma has many grandchildren and loves to give candies to those grandchildren of hers who visit her. She gives even more candies if more children visit her together, like so: if a child went there alone, he\u2019d get aa candy, whereas if he went there with another child, they\u2019d both get a2a2. So on Monday, aa girls went there together, and together they got a2a2 candies. After the girls left, bb boys went there together and got b2b2 candies from the friendly grandma. The total candies for that day, when boys visited separately from girls was a2+b2a2+b2. Then they realized they could get even more candies if they all went there together. So when the boys and girls went there at the same time, each of the a+ba+b children got a+ba+b more candies and all the children got a total of (a+b)2(a+b)2 candies. That is, each of the bb boys got aa more candies (because of aa girls), and each of the aa girls got bb more candies( because of bb boys). Thus the boys got baba more candies than before, and the girls got abab candies more than before: ba+ab=2abba+ab=2ab. So (a+b)2(a+b)2 is 2ab2ab more than a2+b2.a2+b2. Although simple, this is a powerful way of thinking. Suppose I ask you to solve 992992 without paper and pen. How would you do it now that you know grandma\u2019s story? We factor them apart: (90+9)2=902+2\u221790\u22179+92=8100+2\u2217810+81=(90+9)2=902+2\u221790\u22179+92=8100+2\u2217810+81= 8100+(810+40)+(810+41)=8100+1701=9801.8100+(810+40)+(810+41)=8100+1701=9801. Now try solving 99829982 without paper and pen (it is easier than you think! For solution, please see Appendix A at the far end of this answer). And the fun does not stop there. We can use (a+b)2(a+b)2 as a shortcut for multiplication. Suppose I asked you to take two integers which differ by 22: say 55 and 33. Multiply them: 5\u22173=155\u22173=15 Add 11 to their product = 15+1=1615+1=16 A perfect square! (a perfect square is the square of an integer, here 42=1642=16). And of course, we can prove this for any nn: The smaller number is nn. Then the other number must be n+2n+2. Their product: n(n+2)=n2+2nn(n+2)=n2+2n Adding 11 to it: n2+2n+1n2+2n+1 Since 12=112=1 then we get: n2+2n+12n2+2n+12. This is equal to (n+1)2(n+1)2 which is the same structure as our earlier (a+b)2(a+b)2. Cool right? The excellent n2+2n+12n2+2n+12 is interlinked to yet another idea, the arithmetic progression (an arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers where the difference between one number and the next is a constant.) Take the most common sequence 1,2,3,4\u2026.n1,2,3,4\u2026.n and square them: 1,4,9,16\u2026.n21,4,9,16\u2026.n2 Now write the difference of the squared numbers under them: 1,4,9,16,25,36,491,4,9,16,25,36,49 3,5,7,9,11,133,5,7,9,11,13 The second row of numbers is an arithmetic progression where the numbers vary by a constant of 2. (Note that 1,2,3,4\u2026.n1,2,3,4\u2026.n is also an arithmetic progression, increasing by a constant of 1). But why does the second arithmetic progression differ by 22? Because the consecutive numbers (in 1,2,3,4\u2026.n1,2,3,4\u2026.n) where each nn becomes n+1n+1 has this square: (n+1)2(n+1)2 which is expanded as: n2+2n+12.n2+2n+12. Now let\u2019s break it up into several pieces; the first piece is n2n2 which is the same idea as taking 1,2,3,4\u2026.n1,2,3,4\u2026.nand turning it into 1,4,9,16,25,36,491,4,9,16,25,36,49. The second piece is 2n+12=2n+1.2n+12=2n+1. What is the significance of 2n+12n+1 ? Consider now that sequence of the difference of the squares\u2014our second arithmetic progression: 3,5,7,9,11,133,5,7,9,11,13--differs by exactly2n+122n+12 or 2n+1.2n+1. This is saying when you add 11 to nn (as with 1,2,3,4\u2026n)1,2,3,4\u2026n), the square of this sequence grows by 2n+12n+1: that is,11 becomes 2\u22171+1=32\u22171+1=3, 22 becomes 2\u22172+1=52\u22172+1=5, 33 becomes 2\u22173+1=72\u22173+1=7, and so on. If you\u2019re not impressed already with the powerful (n+1)2(n+1)2 I have something else for you: using (n+1)2(n+1)2 any two-digit number ending in 5 can be quickly squared, like so: Let\u2019s say we have 4545. Drop the 55, and you get a 44. Let\u2019s call 44, nn. Now do n+1:4+1=5n+1:4+1=5. With me so far? Good. Now multiply nnto n+1n+1, just like we did earlier: n(n+1)n(n+1). In our case here: 4\u22175=204\u22175=20. Now, to the end of 2020, concatenate a 22 and the earlier-dropped55 back to it. (recall that the 22 that you concatenated and the +1+1 that you added to nn in this example are linked because of what happens to n+1n+1, when nn becomes n2n2): 20252025 Let\u2019s try this again with 852852. Calculator says: 72257225. Our method says: 8+1=98+1=9, then 8\u22179=728\u22179=72, then concat the 22 and the 55: 72257225. Neat! The excellent (a+b)2(a+b)2 still has more wonders to amaze you with. Suppose you want to solve a slightly tedious problem like this: (a2\u22122ab+b2)\u2217(a2+2ab+b2)(a2\u22122ab+b2)\u2217(a2+2ab+b2) Since we know the backstory and how (a+b)2(a+b)2 expands, we can use it as a short-cut to solve this: (a\u2212b)2\u2217(a+b)2(a\u2212b)2\u2217(a+b)2 The two terms have an exponential in common, so we recast them as: ((a\u2212b)\u2217(a+b))2((a\u2212b)\u2217(a+b))2 Multiply a to a and b to b, without changing the external exponent: ((a2\u2212b2))2((a2\u2212b2))2 That is, (a+b)\u2217(a\u2212b)=a2\u2212ab+ba\u2212b2(a+b)\u2217(a\u2212b)=a2\u2212ab+ba\u2212b2 and \u2212ab\u2212ab cancels baba, so all that is left is a2\u2212b2.a2\u2212b2. Now ((a2\u2212b2))2((a2\u2212b2))2 is merely the same thing as (a+b)2(a+b)2, only now aa and bb have been raised to the power of 22 and the sign has reversed. Thus, we expand like we did with (a+b)2:(a+b)2: a4\u22122a2b2+b4a4\u22122a2b2+b4 For this next part, let\u2019s jump up one step and try examples with the powers of 3. I am also going to use the wonderful Julia programming language (you can treat it as a calculator) to demonstrate a new link to the Binomial Triangle, aka Pascal\u2019s Triangle, even though it was discovered several times before Pascal. If you are new to programming and Julia, you could either just look at the results, or spend 30 minutes on my other answer which contains just the right amount of Julia and programming to understand what is going on here; in any case, the explanation is intuitive: # importing a special package in Julia\u00a0\u00a0using DSP\u00a0Now we can use convolution (I\u2019ll explain soon): # define a base to start from\u00a0baze = [1];        \u00a0\u00a0# define a kernel that is to be convoluted\u00a0kernel = [1 1];   \u00a0\u00a0# repeat one time:\u00a0baze = conv(baze, kernel)\u00a0\u00a0# result\u00a0>  1  1\u00a0Now let\u2019s see what that was all about: an ordered list of numbers is called a vector. In the above example, our kernel is a vector, but so is the base. Multiplying two vectors is also called a dot product of two vectors: # vector a\u00a0\u00a0a = [4 9]\u00a0\u00a0# vector b\u00a0\u00a0b = [8 5]\u00a0\u00a0# dot product a.b:\u00a0a\u22c5b=ax\u00d7bx+ay\u00d7bya\u00b7b=ax\u00d7bx+ay\u00d7by Multiply x elements of a and b, then y elements of a and b, then add them all up. In Julia: # define two vectors at the same time\u00a0a , b = [4 9] , [ 5 8]\u00a0\u00a0# simple one verb command to get their dot product:\u00a0dot(a,b)\u00a0\u00a0# output\u00a0> 92\u00a0Feel free to double-check this: 4 * 5 + 9 * 8 = 92 Now, convolution is like a moving dot product: 1 1\u00a0  1 1\u00a0-------\u00a00 1 0  = 1\u00a0\u00a0  1 1\u00a0  1 1\u00a0------\u00a0  1 1 = 2\u00a0\u00a0  1 1\u00a01 1 \u00a0------\u00a00 1 0 = 1\u00a0Imagine a machine that goes from right to left, multiplies the top and the bottom numbers, adds them up, and repeats this. Returning to our convolution example in Julia, the first convolution is: using DSP\u00a0baze = [1];        \u00a0kernel = [1 1];   \u00a0\u00a0baze = conv(baze, kernel)\u00a0\u00a0> 1 1\u00a0\u00a0# note: we write baze so that it does not conflict \u00a0# with built-in Julia keyword: base.\u00a0Note the pattern in the second and third and fourth and the nth: using DSP\u00a0baze = [1];        \u00a0kernel = [1 1];   \u00a0\u00a0# taking the previous base and producing a new one:\u00a0\u00a0base1 = conv(baze, kernel)\u00a0base2 = conv(base1, kernel)\u00a0base3 = conv(base2, kernel)\u00a0base4 = conv(base3, kernel)\u00a0base5 = conv(base4, kernel)\u00a0base6 = conv(base5, kernel)\u00a0base7 = conv(base6, kernel)\u00a0\u00a0# printing to the result to screen. \"\\n\" stands for a new line.\u00a0\u00a0println(base1, \"\\n\", \u00a0\t\tbase2, \"\\n\",\u00a0\t\tbase3, \"\\n\", \u00a0\t\tbase4, \"\\n\", \u00a0\t\tbase5, \"\\n\", \u00a0\t\tbase6, \"\\n\", \u00a0\t\tbase7)\u00a0\u00a0# resulting in:\u00a0\u00a0        [1 1]\u00a0       [1 2 1]\u00a0      [1 3 3 1]\u00a0     [1 4 6 4 1]\u00a0    [1 5 10 10 5 1]\u00a0   [1 6 15 20 15 6 1]\u00a0 [1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1]\u00a0Cool! The machine analogy applies here; see how our Julia convolution produced the Binomial Triangle by going right-left right-left\u2014like a printing machine\u2014(as described in the definition of convolution). Now look at the third row: the pattern is 1 3 3 1. Is it relevant to: a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3 ? Look at the coefficients of each term: a3a3 coefficient is 1. (a * 1 = a) 3a2b3a2b coefficient is 3. (a^2 * 3 = 3a^2) 3ab23ab2 coefficient is 3. (a * 3 = 3a) b3b3 coefficient is 1. (b * 1 = b) We established a pattern, so we are halfway through predicting this for any (a+b)n.(a+b)n. But don\u2019t just stop there. The Binomial Triangle can also be found as powers of 11. :) row1, row2, row3, row4 = 11^1, 11^2, 11^3, 11^4\u00a0\u00a0println(row1,\"\\n\", \u00a0\t\trow2,\"\\n\", \u00a0\t\trow3,\"\\n\",\u00a0\t\trow4  )\u00a0\u00a0# result:\u00a0\u00a011\u00a0121\u00a01331\u00a014641\u00a0Neat! But why do we need convolution if we can do this so simply? You\u2019ll see later why. We have come a long way from a mere: (a+b)3(a+b)3 Haven\u2019t we? This is how mathematics should be taught\u2014everything is inter-related. But frequently they\u2019re teaching everything in isolation\u2014which means they don\u2019t really know it. So now pay attention to the powers/exponents: a is to the power of 3 in the first term, while b is to the power of 0: a3\u2217b0=a3\u22171=a3a3\u2217b0=a3\u22171=a3 a is to the power of 2 in the second term: a2\u2217b1=a2\u2217ba2\u2217b1=a2\u2217b b\u2019s exponent is rising by 1, as a\u2019s is falling by 1: a1\u2217b2=a\u2217b2a1\u2217b2=a\u2217b2 and finally: a0\u2217b3=1\u2217b3=b3a0\u2217b3=1\u2217b3=b3 We have a new pattern, also called the combinatorics pattern: (30),(31),(32),\u2026,(33)(30),(31),(32),\u2026,(33) Each tall bracket can be written as nCknCk, or n choose k. So the first one can be re-writen as 3C03C0 to mean that we have 3 cards; how many ways exist there to draw exactly 0 different cards? Newton wrote a neat formula for it (although the theorem was independently discovered by Cardano, and before Cardano, by Al-Karaji who is said to be the original discoverer):  By this convention, there is only one way to choose 0 items from n items. Newton\u2019s formula is based on the idea of a factorial (another inter-link to our previous topics). A factorial is simply a sum of consecutive products: #   n! if n= 3\u00a0\u00a03 * 2 * 1 \u00a0> 6\u00a0\u00a0# short-cut in Julia:\u00a0\u00a0factorial(3)\u00a0> 6\u00a0What about 2 items out of 3? How many different ways of choosing this is possible? Using the factorial method: n = 3\u00a0k = 2\u00a0\u00a0factorial(3)/ (factorial(2)* (factorial(3-2)))\u00a0\u00a0# output\u00a0> 3\u00a0Three exact ways to choose 2 items out of 3. Let\u2019s see this in practice and what it exactly means: You have a choice of 3 ice-cream flavours. Out of 3, how many unique combinations are possible when you choose only 2 ice-creams each time? # import a special library for combinatorics:\u00a0\u00a0using Combinatorics\u00a0\u00a0# create an ice-cream vector of three flavours\u00a0# chosen two at a time, counted using combinations:\u00a0\u00a0collect(combinations([\"chocolate\" \"vanilla\" \"raspberry\"], 2))\u00a0\u00a0# result:\u00a0\u00a0 [\"chocolate\", \"vanilla\"]  \u00a0 [\"chocolate\", \"raspberry\"]\u00a0 [\"vanilla\", \"raspberry\"]  \u00a0Getting interesting right? Who would\u2019ve thought that boring-looking (a+b)3(a+b)3 had such an interesting connection? The connection is this: For 3C2, we have 3 combinations possible, or for nCk we have q combinations: When a is to the power of 3, and b is to the power of 2\u2014aka 3C2\u2014the result is 3, which is the coefficient for the 2nd term in the expansion. (Very soon you will see exactly what I mean by the 2nd term.) Accordingly, let\u2019s see coefficients computed for each of the terms in: a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3 0th term is where there is no b since b^0 = 1 and b^0 * a3=a3a3=a3 : n = 3\u00a0k = 0\u00a0\u00a0factorial(n)/ (factorial(k)* (factorial(n-k)))\u00a0> 1\u00a0So 1 is the coefficient for a3a3 Note, the 1st term is decided by the fact that b1b1 So what is the coefficient for 1st term? n = 3\u00a0k = 1\u00a0\u00a0factorial(n)/ (factorial(k)* (factorial(n-k)))\u00a0\u00a0> 3\u00a0Nice! It matches the coefficient in the first term : 3a2b3a2b What about the second term (as I mentioned earlier I\u2019d explain)? n = 3\u00a0k = 2\u00a0\u00a0factorial(n)/ (factorial(k)* (factorial(n-k)))\u00a0\u00a0> 3\u00a0Which matches: 3ab2.3ab2. And finally, the last term: n = 3\u00a0k = 3\u00a0\u00a0factorial(n)/ (factorial(k)* (factorial(n-k)))\u00a0\u00a0> 1\u00a0Matching: 1\u2217b3=b31\u2217b3=b3  Given all this inter-linked ideas, we can predict and solve a binomial expansion under any reasonable n, by using the heuristics developed above. Solve: (t+u)5(t+u)5 Well, from powers of 11 we know:   11^5\u00a0> 161051\u00a0The coefficients are: 1 then 6 then 10 then \u2026wait what? Why did I say what? because the Binomial Triangle is symmetric. Whatever aa can have, so can bb. Here, we expected the next number to be 6, but we don\u2019t have symmetricity. Perhaps using 11^n is not such a good idea. (Although, it can still be used with a minor modification, but I digress). Let\u2019s go back to our convolution result and check the 5th base: base5 \u00a0[1 5 10 10 5 1]\u00a0There! So the first coefficient is 1, then 5 then 10 then 10 then 5 then 1 Giving us a symmetric skeleton: a+5ab+10ab+10ba+5ba+ba+5ab+10ab+10ba+5ba+b Now let\u2019s see what kinds of powers we can raise aa and bb to. We know aa starts with the highest power and descends to 00, and bb does exactly the opposite: That is: a5a5 then a4a4 then a3a3 then a2a2 then a1a1 then a0a0 and: b0b0 then b1b1 then b2b2 then b3b3 then b4b4 then b5b5 Since b0=1b0=1 then the first term which is a5b0a5b0 can be written as simply a5.a5. (1\u2217a5=a51\u2217a5=a5). Ditto for the last term: a0b5=b5a0b5=b5. Now our output looks like this: a5+5a4b+10a3b2+10b3a2+5b4a+b5a5+5a4b+10a3b2+10b3a2+5b4a+b5 Let\u2019s test it in Julia: # import SymPy library from Python\u00a0using SymPy\u00a0\u00a0# define symbolic variables\u00a0@vars a b \u00a0\u00a0# solve\u00a0expand((a+b)^5)\u00a0Result: a5+5a4b+10a3b2+10b3a2+5b4a+b5a5+5a4b+10a3b2+10b3a2+5b4a+b5 Okay so what happens if you don\u2019t have Julia to compute for you? You see the pattern in the Binomial Triangle:         [1 1]\u00a0       [1 2 1]\u00a0      [1 3 3 1]\u00a0     [1 4 6 4 1]\u00a0    [1 5 10 10 5 1]\u00a0   [1 6 15 20 15 6 1]\u00a0 [1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1]\u00a0Look at the 4th row. How did we get the 5 in the 5th row? By adding 1+4 in the 4th row! 10? by adding the left 4 to central 6 and another 10 by adding central 6 to the right 4. (On both sides, the triangle is flanked by 1 btw). Notice that each row tells us what the next row is, just like a linked list[2]! This is how mathematics should be taught. Understand and you don\u2019t need to memorize. Enjoy it. Mathematics is beautiful! All the best, Jan __Update__ PS: It\u2019s worth mentioning that when I was teaching mathematics at top-ranked universities in China, my students would often suggest that I compile and revise my lecture materials into books. In fact, on the strength of the anonymous student evaluations that you can see below (5 different cohorts, spanning 5 years), a well-known publisher offered to publish my books, but I did not like the payment terms in their contract and therefore declined as a matter of principle. The first screenshot is the evaluation rubric (to view, please click on the image). And the scores: 5 is excellent, 4 is good, 3 is acceptable, 2 is meh, and 1 is bad. You will also notice that in the last two years I had perfect scores from every student on every item. :))       All the best!

            "answer_text": "I will briefly discuss about some particular groups of people and their reasons to find mathematics difficult. Each group can have different reasons.  Most of what follows is based on personal experience and what I have read in different articles. Of course, in an answer like this there will be many generalisations: Mathematicians (or theoretical computer scientists) find it difficult because there are several easily stated but extremely difficult problems in maths which may take months/years/centuries to solve. And also because there are things like Inter-universal Teichm\u00fcller theory developed by fellow mathematician(s) which many professional mathematicians would not be able to understand. PhD students in mathematics find it difficult because they are going through a very difficult process of building a particular area of specialisation and learning how to generate new mathematics in that area. They face failure again and again before something good comes out in the narrowly focussed field they are working on.  Sometimes, even after 4-7 years of school nothing \"good\" comes out of it.  Other students in mathematics/theoretical computer science/physics find it difficult because, well some of the stuff in abstract maths is quite difficult! It takes time to get used to things like Topology and Category theory but many students are not fortunate enough to have good teachers guiding them well through the process of learning these things. They have to grasp the basics of a wide spectrum of areas in mathematics which can be a difficult task.  Students and professionals in other fields that use mathematics as a tool find it difficult because they may have some idea about the abstractness of mathematics but they haven't been exposed to it properly to be able to work out all the proofs of things that they are using (many wouldn't even see the necessity of proving that those tools work). If they are good at using the particular tools then they may not even find \"mathematics\" difficult.   Others (discussed in detail in some of the answers here) usually find it difficult because of the  difficult school experience they had in something which was disguised as mathematics but which was mostly just algebraic manipulations. You had to learn and practice certain algorithms (example: how to find an integral) on which you were graded. There were absolute markers set by the system which would tell you if you were good at \"maths\" or not. And due to some reasons like low IQ and lack of early childhood training, many would not do well in those things.  I believe most of them would not find maths difficult for those particular reasons if they were taught maths properly. ",

            "answer_text": "There is kind of a vicious circle about math, In my opinion. First for every human being there exists a point at which they stop understanding at least some part of mathematics. Even the most brilliant mathematician can't know the entire field, because the field has become too large like a tree with infinite branches each with infinite numbers of twigs.  Unfortunately, many of the people who choose to teach elementary school run into the point where they stop understanding mathematics a bit too early. This is often because the people who taught them mathematics in elementary school also had a less than complete understanding of what they were teaching. So many of our elementary school teachers then turn around and teach mathematics the way they were taught, through repetition and memorization of procedures. It's very hard to memorize math, but if it's taught well it should make sense. Some kids are able to see the patterns in mathematics and build a strong understanding, in spite of the quality of instruction. But most of those kids, if they stay with mathematics, tend to choose a more lucrative profession than teaching. If they do teach it's usually at the university level, where they teach highly motivated students like themselves. This leaves the less motivated students who have already bumped up against limit of their understanding in math to become elementary school teachers, where they are more likely make math difficult to understand. There are many many exceptions to this pattern, but I think it does explain why many kids find math difficult to learn - it's not inherently difficult if it's taught in a developmentally appropriate way by teachers who understand and like it.

            "answer_text": "I think I can answer this question because I myself found Mathematics to be a tough subject at one point of time. I was good in Mathematics upto 5th grade, when Math was all about addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. I was a little slow but still I managed to get above average marks. Suddenly after 6th grade, my performance started deteriorating. I was flooded with so many concepts: basic algebra, geometry etc. and by the time I had reached the end of 8th grade, I had gotten 36/100 in my annual exams, which was the worst Math performance of my life. I couldn't understand what had gone wrong in the past three years. In fact, I had studied more in the 8th grade than I had in 7th grade but still the performance kept going down. My father thought this was a serious issue, so he got me a personal math tuitor at home. The teacher used to come to my house at a particular time slot and used to teach me alone daily for 1 hour. The tuitor realised in the first week itself that my basics were really messed up. He first focussed on getting my basics right i.e. the concepts that were taught in 6th grade, then gradually when I had understood those, he switched to concepts that were taught in the 7th grade and eventually we caught up with the 9th grade questions. My whole summer vacations plus an extra month were spent in catching up with the concepts of previous classes. It was then that I realised why I couldn't do better in Math earlier. In 8th grade, I had assumed that even if I don't understand concepts of 6th and 7th grade, I will be able to master class 8th Math just by studying hard. But what makes Math tough is that it is a purely heirarchical subject. When I was in 6th class, I hadn't understood 20\u201330 % of Math but I moved on to 7th grade without understanding that part. The same happened in 7th grade and that 30% gap moved up to 50% and the missing gaps kept piling up until 8th grade when I found the subject gibberish. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't understand the topics. I couldn't even understand the solutions properly. It took a lot of patience and hard work both from my tuitor and myself to finally fill those gaps that I had left in the previous classes. I finally started improving. In fact, once I had started understanding the concepts, Math became an addiction. The subject which I feared the most, became my favorite. I scored 73/80 in my annual exam in 9th grade and scored 80/80 in pre-board exams in 10th grade. Since then, Math has been my favorite subject. There's an excellent video by Khan Academy's Founder on this exact thing that I talked above: Do give it a watch:  ",

            "answer_text": "Let's agree to accept the premise that most people's entire exposure to mathematics occurs in school. Now, if you consider something a \"school subject,\" you'll generally judge your ability at it by the grades you got and the amount of effort you had to put in to achieve them.  Saying \"I'm bad at history,\" most of the time, means \"I can't memorize lists of dates\" rather than \"I can't synthesize information about the chain of events leading up to an outcome and then abstract a general principle from the evidence.\"   So let's look at where those grades come from. When grading a math assignment, we generally examine whether a student solved the problem correctly, or at least made good progress towards solving the problem.  If so, the student receives credit; if not, well, there's not much way to award points. Imagine what would happen if essays were graded this way.  \"Did you do a reasonable job of advancing the argument you made, so that a reader would have a good reason to agree with you?  No?  Well, then, I guess you got that essay wrong.  Can't really give you any points for just writing a bunch of words.  Sorry.\" But of course that's not how essays are graded.  The essay grading process is something more like this:  Are there as many words here as I asked for?Are they actual words which form actual sentences, according to established rules of spelling and grammar?Does the essay appear to be related to the prompt in some way?And the reason essays are graded this way is that, if they were graded on the basis of whether the student had actually done a good job of writing an essay, then we'd see 30% of students failing Freshman Composition and Intro to Western History and so forth, and the number of people graduating high school and college would drop precipitously. As it stands, the 30% of people who fail Freshman Calculus find mathematics unapproachable, whereas the 30% of people who by all rights ought to have failed Freshman Anthropology merely find that subject dull. And that is why many people find mathematics difficult. --- Postscript: Throughout my entire time in school the only other courses I saw evaluated in such an honest way were the ones for the various athletic teams.  In fact, they were a bit more extreme: you couldn't even enroll in those classes if you weren't good enough to pass their entrance exams.  (If I recall correctly, I think that by the time I was about eleven years old I had already been permanently rejected from all of them.)  That's probably one reason you'll actually hear people admit they're bad at sports, when they'd be loathe to admit being bad at almost anything else.  Except, of course, for math. ",

            "answer_text": "James Gay's answer is very good, i just want to combine it with User-10267358060907795720's answer and add a bit of explanation. I personally hated math and found it incredibly difficult for years- all the way through Calc 2 courses in an undergraduate degree. I just figured I wasn't a math person- something i'd known for a long time and just dealt with. But in the last few years I've begun teaching myself some particular mathematics in order to express ideas which, i feel, are worth making precise. I've discovered that I don't find maths difficult- i found how maths are taught impossible, and could only rarely ignore the lesson plans well enough to learn the math.  Being in a school class with timeframes and pressures makes it very difficult to take the time to play with a math concept until you understand what it means and how the parts work together- unless you're ahead of your class level, in which case it's ridiculously easy to do the lesson plans and you can spend your spare time getting even farther ahead. Once you know the math, the lessons are easy-but without personally understanding the underlying processes taken for granted by whomever made the lesson plan, the exercises are often incomprehensible. Why is this? I can't answer definitively, but i think that the famous article Lockhart's Lament [1] (which is definitely worth a read for anyone interested in this question) has some excellent metaphors. Here is what painting would look like if it had gone through the same process that led to mathematics education.  I was surprised to find myself in a regular school classroom\u2014 no easels, no tubes of paint. \u201cOh we don\u2019t actually apply paint until high school,\u201d I was told by the students. \u201cIn seventh grade we mostly study colors and applicators.\u201d They showed me a worksheet. On one side were swatches of color with blank spaces next to them. They were told to write in the names. \u201cI like painting,\u201d one of them remarked, \u201cthey tell me what to do and I do it. It\u2019s easy!\u201d After class I spoke with the teacher. \u201cSo your students don\u2019t actually do any painting?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, next year they take Pre-Paint-by-Numbers. That prepares them for the main Paint-by-Numbers sequence in high school. So they\u2019ll get to use what they\u2019ve learned here and apply it to real-life painting situations\u2014 dipping the brush into paint, wiping it off, stuff like that.Of course we track our students by ability. The really excellent painters\u2014 the ones who know their colors and brushes backwards and forwards\u2014 they get to the actual painting a little sooner, and some of them even take the Advanced Placement classes for college credit. But mostly we\u2019re just trying to give these kids a good foundation in what painting is all about, so when they get out there in the real world and paint their kitchen they don\u2019t make a total mess of it.  The point here is that painting is an art, and that reducing it to its tiny component steps and then to paint-by-numbers changes it from a fundamentally creative activity to a fundamentally bureaucratic activity. Math, he argues, is also a fundamentally creative art, and has undergone this process. The math taught in schools is so difficult for students because it is a mind-numbing exercise in memorization and application of rote knowledge, instead of the creative activity which practicing mathematicians use on a daily basis and which was used to create the math techniques taught in school.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not hard. It just doesn\u2019t forgive if you can\u2019t think for yourself. The better question is why school system/society doesn\u2019t care. The school is supposed to teach you how to think, how to analyse, how to discover the new knowledge. It fails. Big time. So they give you no tools to study math. As for the reasons of why people are not taught how to think\u2026 don\u2019t get me started. I\u2019ll try to keep it short. Most of the people work for somebody. These \u201csomebody\u201d have money. They somehow figured a schema how to keep everybody stupid and not asking too many questions. They created a system of education that teaches you roughly speaking to copy-cat what is told, to follow orders. There are two French words for \u201cmathematician\u201d. One means \u201csomebody who can play in instrument strictly following the notes and direction\u201d, another means \u201ccomposer\u201d. Pay attention to this interesting fact: whoever actually \u201cgets\u201d the math (the composers) are portrayed as evil egomaniacs and ostracized by the society. It seems like there can only be a small percentage of people, like necessary evil who can think on their own. So, math is not hard. The same as quantum physics. It\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s just somebody (politics) doesn\u2019t spend money to teach people properly about these subjects as I am guessing it\u2019s \u201ctoo dangerous\u201d. People can stop working 60 hours/week and start asking questions such as \u201cwhy I have to work these 45 extra hours just to sponsor this war in the Middle East?\u201d. That kind. ",

            "answer_text": "First things first, even mathematicians think math is hard. Don\u2019t let them tell you otherwise. Math is a problem solving endeavor and you will encounter obstacles. These obstacles can be frustrating, but it is important to push through them. Mathematics is hard for several reasons. The first reason is that there is a lot of vocabulary to learn. Some words in math can have definitions that contains several paragraphs or more worth of information encoded in them. When in math someone uses a definition dense word it is to save time and thinking space. Another problem is that math often requires you to be logical and imaginative at the same time. If you don\u2019t understand the concept of symbolism then that will make math even harder. Some people when they first start learning algebra will say, \u201cMath has letters now? I thought math was about numbers.\u201d. The idea of symbolism is at play here. Those letters can \u201crepresent\u201d numbers. You could also use pictures as variables though, but that takes more time and energy. Symbolism is a hard concept for many people to grasp. If you struggle with it, then don\u2019t feel bad. Lots of people find symbolism hard to grasp, especially when it goes beyond the realm of textbook literary symbolism. One thing that could be done to help students who struggle with math would be for schools to offer a mathematical terminology class. I know many people with think that this is silly, but I am serious. Many colleges will medical terminology classes because of the amount of vocabulary used in medicine. I think that people, especially those majoring in a STEM field could potentially benefit from such a class. After all, how are you supposed to solve a math problem when you don\u2019t know what the words mean. If I asked you a question about idempotents in a ring and you didn\u2019t know what idempotents were, you would likely have a difficult time solving the problem. As far as the symbolism part goes, I have no idea as to how to help people feel more comfortable with that idea as it pertains to mathematical concepts. If anyone has any ideas on that one, please feel free to let me know. Another reason why math is difficult is because solving any kind of high level problem often requires a certain level of background knowledge as well as experience with that kind of problem That is why when even the best mathematician encounter a problem, the likes of which they have never seen, it is normal to struggle and to feel intimidated by it. I have been there and I have done that. Generally speaking though, math is hard because it requires a lot of mental resources. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd have to say that, much like has been mentioned already, the way it is taught has more of an effect than anything else. Math is undeniably a \"hard\" subject to learn because, unlike many others, there usually IS a right or wrong answer. I think a lot of students look at math, look at their liberal arts courses, and realize that in one you have a hard set of rules that must be learned and followed, whereas in the other you have the freedom to experiment or discover things. And I think that that discover part, learning something that keeps you interested, is what's missing. Without it, the drive to really succeed and learn starts to dissipate.  Personally, I hated math up until I graduated high school. I would say throughout middle school and even into high school I struggled a lot with it and was possibly one of the worst in my class. It's hard to say what changed, but I think realizing all the amazing things that can be accomplished with math went a long ways towards me enjoying math and, by extension, learning it. There's such an inane focus on \"math for math's sake\" throughout your academic career. You get the fundamentals drilled into you until they become meaningless. Sure, a third grader learning arithmetic (or whatever age that is...) doesn't have the experience and means to apply it outside their classroom. But even when you first learn calculus, there seems to be such a focus on plugging and chugging that WHY you want to learn this in the first place is lost. In my case, and many others, this lost its interest. My entire high school career I considered imaginary numbers pointless because I didn't know what they were for. Sure, I knew how to manipulate complex numbers, but I never appreciate it and truly understood them because their use outside of my homework was never made clear.  Now that I'm studying engineering those integrals, those laplace transforms, those vectors actually have meaning. When I first learned them I used them as a means to finish my homework. I think introducing students at a younger age to the usefulness of math in many fields would help tremendously in garnering interest at a younger age, and helping them succeed down the line. ",

I am taking AP Calc BC this year, and over the course of the last year I was able to progress through the 3 years of high school math (Geometry, Algebra II, and Precalc), mind you I am someone who literally failed math (got F\u2019s) in 8th grade. I worked super hard outside of school even though I (was) kind of a lazy person who didn\u2019t like to learn outside of school. But what I am saying is math isn't hard, when you are learning math don't think of it as an chore, think of it as learning something really cool and useful. When you learn a topic don\u2019t just memorize the steps and move on think about and understand how the math actually works. One of the best things you can do is to write proffs of each equation or solution process to really make sure you know the topic. Motivation is often an problem one of things that motivated me was the shear fact that you write some numbers down and solve real world problems, that is just so cool. Here are some resources: Khan Academy (very good for specific topics)Check EDX/Cousera for courses that cover your subjectOr maybe a good old fashioned TextbookIf you are really not a self study person get tutor or check at a nearby by college during the summerGood luck :) ",

Being good at very basic maths doesn't mean you can say maths is easy. That's the equivalent of playing \u201cTwinkle twinkle, little star\u201d on piano and saying that piano is easy. Mathematics is a very complex and beautiful world of sets of relationships between objects. When you're in grade school all the way through your first/second year of college, you're barely scraping what maths is. You're only studying relationships between functions and numbers, nothing more. No one in the world understand all of maths, and no one ever will. By those standards, it is far from easy. 2+1 is easy. Evaluating a line integral is easy, still. Using Galois Theory to solve problems? Considerably harder. Anything is \u201ceasy\u201d once you understand it fully, but very few people understand what they're doing in the universe of mathematics, and it requires several years of advanced study to even get a grasp of what's really going on.

            "answer_text": "Maths is not hard in school. The actual content is pretty easy to grasp in school. But students all over the world still struggle to do well. The reason is the way mathematics is taught in school. It is the single most dry subject a kid will come across in the school. With no context and motivation for the topic, solving equations for just the sake of solving wears out students faster than one can say \u201cMaths\u201d!! What do I think should be done to deal with this? Well, you see, very few people have actually figured out how to make maths more intuitive and interesting to school kids. Game based learning comes to mind. Perhaps, we can give more context to the learning of maths. Raise the stakes. Rather than bullying students by saying \u201cYou learn this or you get zero\u201d, we can try incorporate maths and the related mathematical ideas into the everyday lives of students. Where do we use quadratic equations in everyday life you ask? Check out What are some examples of real life uses of quadratic equations? Where do we even use trigonometry in real life? What good will knowing congruence of triangles be in daily life? These are the questions that educators need to ask. However, it has to be dealt very carefully. Students should not come to expect that all of mathematics exists to improve our daily life. That is simply not true. Its a bad practice to get into if one chooses to study pure mathematics in college. So, while its perfectly fine to try to contextualize maths by incorporating real life applications, one should make it clear that mathematics can also be pursued like an art form as well, without any reality binding it down. Sufficient training has to be imparted on logical thinking from a very young age. Mathematics is the pinnacle of logical thinking. So, the activities in classroom have to be devised in such a way that they do not compromise the actual problem solving for entertainment. ",

That\u2019s new life forming. That\u2019s new life forming from existing life. Trees grown over thousands of years, yielding new greenery from within what already exists. The lower you get along the spine of the tree the less sunlight some of these bushes and branches get. They\u2019re covered in other bushes growing out on top of them. They\u2019re hidden. They\u2019re equally important, of course. They gave life to the newer things.The sunlight doesn\u2019t touch the old ones anymore. Their day in the sun is traded for new growth. Thousands of years, the trunk pulsating nutrients into its million arms. Lengthening itself freely over a plane that spans an infinite space. Heightening itself to no limits. Growing. Widening. Heightening. At the bottom, you would see roots. These roots are covered. Thousands of years of rocks and tiny material has compacted to form dirt and sand. The roots are essential. Our eyes can\u2019t see it. The nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium that the tree needs it feeds through these roots. Water pumps into the tree from underneath. It survives out of something of a miracle. The ecosystem that has grown this gigantic tree is completely invisible to our eyes. Mathematics is much like a gargantuan tree. Not only is it so massive it gives you a headache, but the roots are so securely fastened into the ground that you didn\u2019t notice at what point the trunk of the tree went underground to form roots. Thousands of years of people developing logic and forming arguments. Some might think we have always been doing that throughout time. Mathematics, however, is different. Its reasoning is more than logic incarnate. It is infallible. When something in mathematics is proven, it is proven forever. The result of the math we have woven, we can see. The technology you hold in your hands was built on the edifice of mathematical rules and thoughts. The technology we interact with on a daily basis uses encryption developed in the last one hundred years. Think about the things that require mathematics to be 100% correct always: BiologyPhysicsChemistryPsychologyTechnologyElectronicsThe complete list is far too long. The difficulty of mathematics yields the integrity and reliability of the things we interact with today. We know that underneath the systems we see we have a highly complex system of rules and parameters that makes them. We have systems within systems within systems. The lower we get\u2014closer to the ground\u2014the easier it gets to lose track of what was actually being understood. Imagine mathematics being 1,000 of these large trees being grown at the same time in the place of one tree. They are connected within one another underground. A whole ecosystem of beauty exists underneath it all. At the roots. But a thousand trees and thousands of years of growth often leaves us with little time to actually grasp complexity. Some of us are lucky to grasp some of its beauty. To maybe follow even one of those roots. ",

Math is difficult for many people because it requires a way of logical and abstract reasoning that doesn\u2019t mesh with the way people\u2019s brains naturally operate. We are pre-programmed by evolution to be good at breaking things open with rocks and recognizing scary predators, not calculating Fourier transforms. So we recognize math as being difficult.

I\u2019m a physics grad student, not a mathematician - there are many areas of math with which I\u2019m completely unfamiliar, and even the ones which I use on a daily basis can be difficult for me. I don\u2019t understand high level mathematics like some of the fantastic Quora writers here. But I also don\u2019t understand cooking like Jacques P\u00e9pin. There are a near-infinity of things that he knows that I don\u2019t, and many many things that he does that I can\u2019t do - high-level cooking is impossibly hard, just like high-level anything. If your goal is to learn just enough to make a living, then math is among the more difficult disciplines, for sure. But if you are passionate about something - for real - and want to take it as far as you can, then before long you\u2019ll be beating your head against the desk(/cutting board/bookshelf/lab table) just like the rest of us. May we all find something that we love so much ;) ",

            "answer_text": "To paraphrase the alleged dying words of Edmund Kean, the great 19th century Shakespearean actor, \"Math is easy. Comedy is hard.\" (He actually said \"dying\" rather than \"math.\") I think that's relevant in the sense that you can generally find something that for you and perhaps many others is harder than something most people fear.  Some of the other answers here exhibit an example of something that is difficult for many people: clear written communication. As someone who has a master's degree in literature and another in mathematics education, I find writing relatively effortless, while abstract mathematics is constantly ramping up the abstraction and difficulty level, relative to my \"talents\" (I should add that I'm 65 and any mathematics I pursue at this point is strictly for my own interest. There's no outside, professional pressure on me to know more than I've already mastered as a math teacher, teacher-educator, and teacher-coach).  Some of the better answers make clear that there are many factors that make mathematics challenging (probably a better word than \"hard\"), and how those factors become increasingly problematic for students - including professionals - as they try to move up the mathematical \"tree\" and further out onto smaller and smaller branches and twigs. As Einstein said, \"Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.\u201d  While some people see that as arrogant and self-important, I believe Einstein meant, among other things, that the more math you learn, the more you realize how much more this is to learn, and even the best will discover places where they struggle mightily to understand.  There's a mathematician at the University of Michigan named Andreas Blass who is rumored to be able to walk into anyone's mathematics lecture and make meaningful contributions, no matter how advanced or esoteric (or far afield from Blass' own areas of research). If this isn't apocryphal, I'd say that makes him the exception, rather than the rule. I think most people, even top-notch mathematicians, are bound to find areas of ignorance and difficulty if they keep exploring the expanding mathematical universe.  ",

            "answer_text": "Why Is Math So Hard? There are two causes that may be leading to students lack of interest. The first one is purely genetic. We\u2019ve all heard about students who are left brain or right brain; right brain people are creative and artsy while left brainers tend to be more analytical. Which side of your brain is more dominant can certainly contribute to your feelings regarding math, but a new study has shown that there might be something even deeper impacting a student\u2019s mathematical output. Basically, all animals are born with the ability to differentiate between numbers. An infant, for example, can tell the difference between one to two toys. As we grow up, however, our brain should be able to differentiate between larger ratios. A grown human being can easily tell the difference between 11 objects versus 12, a child would not.  some students have deficits in this area, and when we add in symbols for these numbers, or later integers, this deficit worsens. In other words, students have a difficult time processing the numerical worth of the information in front of them. Math Is Cumulative The second issue is usually tacked onto the first one. Math is a cumulative subject \u2013 more so than any of the other core content areas. If you don\u2019t learn the fundamentals of fractions, then it\u2019s highly unlikely that you will be able to fully grasp algebra or calculus later on. If a student becomes discouraged at an early age and it is not remediated quickly, then it is probably that the student will become disillusioned with the subject entirely. So, what can we do? The first thing is to remediate. For students who may have a numerical deficit, it is going to take them more time to learn the content and grasp ideas than many of their peers. It is important that if you notice your child is falling behind to get help as soon as possible. Bring it to the teacher\u2019s attention and consider hiring a private tutor to work with your student. Many students become disenchanted with math around the time they take Algebra I. This is a great time to purchase a middle school level curriculum (or pre-algebra) workbook and either work with your student individually or have him or her work with a tutor. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is hard because it requires exact thinking, and you start out in life with unruly imaginative thinking that fights hard not to be tamed, think comic books. But you eventually have to let go of childhood thinking and grow up because you are inheriting the world. If you know a mathematical fact, you really know something that is eternal and will still be true long after humanity is extinct. It\u2019s the closest one can get to eternity. Not really :) It\u2019s the study of abstract structures, and after one gets through the classic structures it soon becomes an endless and tedious waste of time. The subject has grown so huge that nobody can hope to keep track of it all anymore, even the titles and abstracts of all the new papers being published, and what\u2019s worse, there\u2019s surely a ton of duplication going on, but nobody can get on top of the field and unify it. Still, to a certain point it teaches mental discipline, which can carry over into many other fields. Today, mastering calculus inducts one into the ranks of the engineers, because that\u2019s their language. Everybody needs to know algebra and trigonometry to be considered educated or even to attend college. Boolean algebra would also be nice in the computer age, along with computer programming theory and algorithms. There\u2019s a sad trend for physicists to try to hijack every new area of math for their physical theories whether it\u2019s real physics or just mental masturbation, look at string theory. Math is going to fill all the available space one day, so get used to it. It\u2019s a good life strategy to learn math through calculus and computer algorithms in one\u2019s youth (before age 25, when the mind changes) to equip the mind for life\u2019s challenges.

            "answer_text": "A2A, thanks. I assume we can exclude bad instruction from consideration and focus on the aspects inherent to mathematics. If so, I believe that that what makes mathematics look and feel hard are two things: (1) that it requires us to overcome several of the strong cognitive biases (List of cognitive biases - Wikipedia) that we are wired to have, and (2) that the results regarded as highest-quality are those where we have achieved a full classiciation of the types of objects at hand. An example of each: (1) Trouble with the universal quantifier (\u201cfor every\u201d). For instance, by definition, a sequence is said to converge to a number L if every neighborhood of L contains some tail of that sequence. On reading this definition, we try to imagine ourselves checking *every* neighborhood of L for this condition. (I am not an expert on this, but it seems like we are trying to use a familiar procedure\u2014checking one interval at a time\u2014and this might be a manifestation of the Law of the instrument - Wikipedia ?). But, of course, there are infinitely many neighborhoods of L, so our \u201cvisceral\u201d part of the mind gets stressed: How are we going to check them all? (2) Here the hardship is knowing whether we have really found all instances of an object of a specific type. (E.g., find all groups of order 24, or all functions of bounded variation on the interval [0, 1], or all linear transformations that preserve a certain subspace of the vector space). This hardship never goes away: there are still open classification problems. In summary: dealing with infinite (or finite, but intractably large) collections of objects and verifying that a sought list is truly complete. P.S. One might also feel that, in mathematics, the questions that come up in \u201cdaily life\u201d, on being stated mathematically, completely change their appearance and don\u2019t even look like anything practical any more. And the answers, accordingly, also don\u2019t look like they answer the original question. But, this afflicts only the novice who is not yet familiar with the mathematical machinery, so it is not a persistent difficulty: eventually, an engineering student gets used to the fact that the mathematics governing the workings of a car is a bunch of equations and experimental values.:) What I have tried to describe are the difficulties that never really go away, as they go against our cognitive wiring. This is just my opinion, so others may disagree. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it can be. Let\u2019s compare it to say, English. If you are given an assignment in English, you can in theory write whatever you like, as long as you adhere (to a degree) to the guidelines of the genres you are told to write within, and manage to justify how what you write is correct. There are thousands of ways to write it out, where fluency, vocabulary, and subject-related content (however weakly related it may be) all plays the role in whether the result is correct or not. Two people can essentially write the same, but be several grades apart because they didn\u2019t manage a similar level of argumentation. Mathematics, on the other hand, works on rules. When the formula to calculate the area of the circle is \u03c0r2, you can\u2019t write it as \u03c0r3 provided you defend your decision sufficiently. It doesn\u2019t matter how well figured out your mathematical work looks, if the answer, of which there are often just one, is wrong. If two people write the same thing, provided the formulas used, and the answers given are the same, it doesn\u2019t matter how poorly formulated the end statement is, because your equation is correct. Both will then, in theory, be given the same grade. If you do not know the appropriate formulas in mathematics, or do not know how to use them, mathematics becomes impossible. The same occurs in the event you use the wrong formula in the first place. In comparison writing an essay can be done with all the wrong tools (except the right writing system and proper grammar), as long as it is fluently enough stated to be convincing. I am not very gifted in mathematics. I manage basic equations, enough to have a good grade in basic maths in high school, but I\u2019m no future professional mathematician. I have some issues with my linguistic prowess too due to the few regulations I was taught (with very limited success) to abide by during that same time period, leaving me with a better math character than first language grade (though equal with English as its second-language status left room for some artistic freedom). I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "As another says, math is easy (or at least doable) if you have the right foundation.  But what is that foundation and how do you get it? The foundation is essentially linguistic.  Algebra is a language with rules, grammar, etc.  The grammar is more critical than in spoken languages, because the power of it is in the manipulations that can be done, relying on that grammar.  There are other aspects to math, but in real life, school-level algebra is the foundation.  And a language is learned by practice. We practice language because we need it.  Kids hear language from their parents and have lessons in school.  But at a young age kids have to learn arithmetic before they are even ready to learn algebra.  So the kids who are able to \"get\" arithmetic fastest can start earlier.  Then they have to want to practice it and seek opportunities to use it and think about it.  After a few years of this, the language starts to become easy and one can say the student has the beginning of \"foundations\". The people who go on to specialize in math and show up to answer questions like this one did all this at a stage of childhood they barely remember any more.  They were fortunate to have adequate education, and they are probably more talented in this sort of thing so they got through it faster and were \"accelerated\", in \"honors\", etc.   (Some of us are reminded by having children of our own, that we weren't born knowing basic algebra.)  They talk about the process of building on that foundation, and indeed it is not too hard and is very rewarding.  But the people who think math is hard are the ones without that foundation. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of answer on this subject already. I wouldn't want to repeat what others have said. Basically, there are two reasons among others why math is hard Math is hard for many because of its many rules. You must follow all the rules of math no matter who you are to arrive at the answer.Rules like: minus times minus=+, minus times plus = minus\u2026.. Human being naturally hate too many rules. That is why most people hate religion because of its many rules. To learn math, you must be willing to first relax and Learn the rules governing Maths. To do this, you need a sound teacher. 2.The second reason why math is hard is because most people hate thinking. Yeah! People don't want to think at all. And math is about thinking, it require attention and patient. NB: Please, if you are finding math difficult after this step and making up your mind to learn same. And you still not getting it, please change your tutor. Your math tutor may kill your interest in math if he or she is not good.

            "answer_text": "I have a different take on this question. It\u2019s like asking \u201cwhy is music hard?\u201d or \u201cwhy is history hard?\u201d, etc. The thing is, a huge number of people know how to add, subtract, multiply. Fewer people know high school algebra or geometry. Fewer yet know calculus and so on. But we can say the same thing about any talent. Many people can write but few publish novels. Some of us have learned to play a musical instrument but not many people would want to listen to us. So I think what defines when a subject becomes hard is the point where the degree of difficulty to master the subject is such that only a small percentage of people are willing or able to invest the time to do it. Those people who can are said to have a \u201ctalent\u201d. If everyone could master mathematics at a certain level, that level would no longer be considered \u201chard\u201d. That level where easy turns to hard is dependent on many factors. What is hard in mathematics depends upon time. Not very long ago, adding would have been considered hard and if you could do it you would be a wizard. Another factor is the demand for the talent. There are a lot more people good at computer programming now than there were 40 years ago in part due to the salaries a talented programmer can command. ",

            "answer_text": "Illiteracy and its costs to individuals and to society has long been a focus of concern in public policy. A corresponding lack of ability in mathematics\u2013innumeracy\u2013has received increasing attention in the last few decades. The ability to use basic math is more and more important as modern day society grows more complex. Some children have a problem in learning to read that is disproportionate to any other academic challenge they face. Some children have a corresponding problem with math. For some reason, the ideas just don\u2019t come together for these students. In a recent article in \u201cCurrent Directions in Psychological Science,\u201d David Geary (2013) reviews evidence that one cause of the problem may be a fundamental deficit in the representation of numerosity. Geary describes three possible sources of a problem in children\u2019s appreciation of number. To appreciate where the problems may lie, you need to know about the approximate number system. All children (and members of many other species) are born with an ability to appreciate numerosity. The approximate number system does not support precise counting, but allows for comparison judgements of \u201cmore than\u201d or \u201cless than.\u201d For example, in the figure below you can tell at a glance (and without counting) which cloud contains more dots.  This ability \u2013making the comparison without counting\u2013is supported by the approximate number system. (Formal experiments control for things like the total amount of \u201cdot material\u201d in each field, and so on.) The ability depends not on the absolute difference in number of dots, but on the ratio. Adults can discriminate ratios as low as 11:10. Infants can perform this task, but the ratio of the difference in dots must be much greater, closer to 2:1. Many researchers believe that this approximate number system is the scaffold for an understanding of the cardinal values of number. So the first possible source of problems in mathematics may be that the approximate number system does not develop at a typical pace, leaving the child slow to develop the cognitive representations of quantity that can support mathematics. A second possibility is that the approximate number system works just fine, but the problem lies in associating symbols (number names and Arabic numerals) to the quantities represented there. Geary speculates that regulating attention may be particularly important to this ability. Finally, it is possible for children to appreciate the cardinal value of numbers and yet not understand the logical relationships among those numbers, to appreciate the structure as a whole. That\u2019s the third possible problem. Geary suggests that there is at least suggestive evidence that each of these potential problems creates trouble for some students. The analogy to dyslexia is irresistible, and not inappropriate. Math, like reading, is not a \u201cnatural\u201d human activity. It is a cultural contrivance, and the cognitive apparatus to support it must be hijacked from mental systems meant to support other activities. As such, it is fragile, meaning it lacks redundancy. If something goes wrong, the system as a whole functions very poorly. Thus, understanding how things might go wrong is essential to helping children who struggle early on. Source ",

No, it isn\u2019t. Maths has been introduced as difficult since its beginning. People just do not have an idea about how can we solve this problem. The situation of Mathematics (and also geometry) is totally miserable. Do not misunderstand the life. I\u2019m calling Maths named \u201clife\u201d because of its individual. Life is a systematic layout I think. And right there, Mathematics supports our lives. It makes our functions easier and shorter. Also latest searches show that learning Mathematics fightining against malignant skin and brain tumours. Apart from these, of course Mathematics is going to desire somethings. Here is what Mathematics wants and how to learn Mathematics language; 1- Being patient is the only choice you have.Yes, if you want to learn Maths, then you have to learn how to be patient while learning maths. 2- Without Practise, Maths will be kick you off!Yes again, you didn\u2019t mishear, please do not be worry. Because latest study about Maths shows that while learning Maths, doing practise always raise your Maths skills. 3- Never forget that: Maths is a language\u2026You had better read. Maths is a language. But how? Let me prove my thesis. But firstly you must have 2 things. A formulised maths book (or you can open a pdf on net) and an article of a strange language that you don\u2019t know. Open primarily the article and try to read. It\u2019s basically predictable that you won\u2019t pull the article off. Because of the word: \u201cunknow function\u201d we don\u2019t have to know everything. And Maths in the list of course. After that, open the maths book, surprise! Result: You understood nothing. I mean finally, first off all, abandon everything, please focus to learn & know. First learn, try to understand, reinforce it with using practising. If it still makes you feel bad, then never think and spit in my face. These ideas are mine, and also the specialist. Maths is not difficult. Trust me\u2026 ",

It's just the wrong belief of the people which is continuously spreading. I would like to share one scenario I was always weak in Maths and my parents being professor always kept on saying,\u201d we were toppers in maths we got 100/100 then why can\u2019t you ?\u201d. On the other side, my friends kept on saying it's difficult we cannot do it and all social media things posts, memes made fun of it, it was okay if you are poor in maths and this concept made me more passive towards the fact that I'm weak in maths. In my SSC was got very less score in maths, on the other hand, my friends or just say half of the people in the class got above 90 %. Same things repeated in my 11th my parents saying me to focus on maths and me just ignoring it. This was the time when a miracle happened I joined this class XYZ and we had a Sir. Sonawane he was just magical his teaching I still remember the formulas of 11th 12th. He changed not only me but people who were planning to leave maths in 11th just dropped this thought and everyone was enjoying maths. His teaching made everything simple, he believed in us, he made everyone do it in front of him. I, who got very few marks in maths in 10th became an expert in integration, differentiation, etc topics. We use to practice a lot, we were just mad about maths, on Sundays we use to go in class to solve sums with him. I, my parents everyone was just shocked when I said this\u201d Maths is the easiest and scoring subject\u201d.From that day I took challenges, solved as many as impossible questions. In my engineering career in M1, M2, M3 I always scored 50/50 in online exams(never joined any classes for that) So by this story of mine, I would say that if you are in a good environment you can achieve impossible. Try to take challenges once you get the concepts, once the basics are cleared everything seems easy in the future. Nothing is difficult in life it's just a wrong belief. Stop saying anything is difficult, change your way of thinking. I'm not a good writer ,just thought of sharing my view. ",

I then majored in Computer Science in college. So naturally I had quite a bit of exposure to Maths at a high level and I love it though decided not to make it into my life\u2019s focus. A few things I learned along the way about Maths: IQ is a huge predictor in Maths. This subject is so much about logic and abstraction, both of which are well represented in IQ testsIQ is quite an innate and unchanged endowment. People who were born with this endowment would advance so much faster in Maths than those who weren\u2019t. It may seem magicalMaths at an ordinary level doesn\u2019t require too much, however. People with natural endowment would find the subject too easy. People with less endowment will have to work for it. Most would be able to make itMaths at a world-class level will probably require both very high IQ and other skills (perhaps creativity, lateral thinking, strategy etc.). This is my guess. I can\u2019t speak for it at this levelSo if you mean studying Maths at high school or college level, I don\u2019t think it would be considered too difficult though it may take time. On another note about intelligence in general, outside of Maths and science, I found IQ specifically to be a slight advantage but quite often overrated ",

            "answer_text": "Learning math is a lot like building a house. You can put up a single story hut on uneven ground, but if you plan on building up you will need a solid foundation. Since every new floor relies on the structure underneath it, you have to be diligent and make sure that things are done right. Any small error that pops up in the process will get compounded as the house grows in height. An uneven floor might go unnoticed in a two story house but your goals need to be much bigger than that if you plan on doing mathematics. Much like your house, mathematics is built on simple principles. There is nothing hard about it if you have an intuition for what's going on. Most people find it difficult because every new concept builds on previous knowledge. A single bad teacher or a few missed lectures can lead to problems with every topic that follows it. A child, for example, might get through algebra without understanding how to deal with fractions but it will make learning trigonometry much harder and that in turn will make learning calculus nearly impossible. The key here is to actually understand the ideas, something that most schools fail to get across. Instead, the focus is on teaching kids to memorize formulas and computational tricks that will help them finish standardized tests on time. Fortunately real math doesn't work that way, so don't waste your time memorizing and try to understand instead. ",

            "answer_text": "Just to add some diversity to the answers, I'll suggest a specific source of difficulty: I think misconceptions sometimes arise when learning a new mathematical topic due to terminology that overlaps with everyday language. Here are some examples:  \"Real\" versus \"Imaginary\" numbers. These words suggest that one type of number is somehow more legitimate, applicable, or meaningful than the other, obscuring the fact that they're just labels for certain mathematical concepts. What is \"real\" about the addition of an infinite sequence of numbers like 3+1/10+4/100+1/1000+5/10000+\u20263+1/10+4/100+1/1000+5/10000+\u2026? Nothing, really. Just as the \"imaginary\" number ii is an invention to solve the equation x2=1x2=1, the \"real\" number \u03c0\u03c0 is an invention to represent the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its radius when measured with infinite precision (infinite precision = impossible). The mathematical concepts the terms apply to have little to do with the more familiar meanings of the word \"imaginary\" and \"real\". \"Open\" and \"closed\" sets in topology. The use of these terms in mathematics overlaps to some extent with how they are used in real life. It makes intuitive sense to think of a \"closed\" object as one that  \"includes all its members\", which is somehow what the mathematical definition is going for. Similarly for open. Yet, while it doesn't make sense in everyday language for something to be both open and closed, the empty set and the set of all real numbers are, according to the mathematical definition. You can think of this sort of terminology as the \"false friends\" when learning the language of mathematics. The everyday meaning of the word may be helpful for intuition and remembering the concept, but its important to not lose sight of the fact that it's just a label for a particular mathematical definition.\"Nonlinear equations\". Usually this is short-hand for \"not-necessarily linear equations\". It's confusing that a linear equation is included in the set of equations labelled \"nonlinear\". This usage is sort of justified in that techniques that apply to some particular set of nonlinear phenomena are constructed so that they are generalizations of some corresponding technique for linear phenomena. For instance, there are theorems to determine when nonlinear control systems are \"controllable\" that generalize previously developed theorems for linear systems. Even so, the terminology may contribute to misunderstanding.It's true that this sort of confusion in terms happens when learning many fields, but in my opinion mathematics is more prone to it. Our everyday use of language is much more tolerant to ambiguity than mathematics is.  I think this problem also ties in to other issues that can lead to mathematics seeming more difficult to learn than it may otherwise be. In some sense it's true that to really understand a mathematical topic, you have to know and understand the definitions. This can sometimes lead instructors to overemphasize rigor in their presentation and neglect to put in effort that might make the subject more relatable. For instance, one might think to avoid the confusion mentioned above when discussing \"open\" versus \"closed\" it's better to simply present the definitions and not discuss how the everyday meaning of those words is connected. This is unfortunate, since that connection aids understanding and intuition, even if it doesn't perfectly map to the concept. This sort of phenomenon is exacerbated by the fact that the instructor has likely been comfortable with these concepts for so long that he or she may be more likely to fail to anticipate and address the difficulties faced by someone learning them for the first time.  That said, this is only a small piece of why many people find mathematics difficult to learn. I only bring it up because I think it's interesting to think about and possibly helpful to keep in mind when learning (at least it has been for me, personally). ",

            "answer_text": "The brain did not evolve to be a general-purpose computer, it evolved in response to specific recurring adaptive problems in ancestral environments, building adaptations on previous adaptations. Math ability and general intelligence factor are strongly related. General intelligence here is like general-purpose computer. The nature of consciousness is such that we don't generally perceive the computations of the mind (there is generally no evolved function to do so) and so our reasoning subjectively appears rational, intuitive, and seamless. This is precisely why Kahneman's work starting around 1972 is so important - starting with the standard cognitive psychology assumption that the mind is like a computer - logical and general-purpose, Kahneman and others documented many cognitive biases. Now evolutionary psychologists, really beginning with Cosmides in the 1980s working on cheater detection mechanisms of the mind (The Wason Selection Task) are working from the other direction, starting with the assumption of no mental structures unless they evolved (generally speaking). (See also Gerd Gigerenzer's work et al.) General intelligence factor is a very useful psychometrics tool, but ultimately the logic of William James writing around 1900 applies -- Humans have reason because we have more instincts, not less. i.e. \"reasoning instincts\" as Pinker writes about such as in The Language Instinct. Math is hard because our minds are kludged together from many evolved reasoning instincts not specifically designed/evolved for general purpose problems, or for math. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is a language, albeit a universal language. Often, it can be hard to see past the \u201cmathematical jargon\u201d, which is unavoidable in written mathematics. Consider a person who can only speak English. Show that person a sentence in English, then the same sentence in Spanish. The English person will analyse the words in the Spanish sentence individually and eventually conclude what they believe the sentence as a whole means, whereas the English person will read the english sentence and understand what is written almost immediately. The ideas and reasonings behind the sentence are the same, but the language it is presented in is different. Still, it would likely take the English person far longer to properly understand the Spanish sentence, whereas it is immediately understood when presented in English. Now, apply this analogy to mathematics. A mathematician, who knows how to read, write an speak the language of mathematics can decipher a sentence \u201cwritten in mathematics\u201d (for want of a better phrase). But a student of mathematics, who is seeing this new presentation of an idea for the first time, will initially struggle and blunder their way through the sentence. For example, consider this simple idea: the distance a car travels in a given period of time indicates the speed (or velocity) of the car. We can rewrite this same sentence in terms of mathematics: Suppose y represents distance and x represents time, then dy/dx represents the speed of the car. Without first knowing about variables and derivatives the mathematics student won\u2019t be able to understand the latter sentence as easily as they are able to read the former. This leads to a perceived difficulty. In some cases, it is enough to put the student off and thereby perpetuate the idea that \u201cMaths is hard\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I find that often a lot of things are left out of math explanations maybe for the sake of being concise and elegant. I was reading a proof on Quora the other day that there is no solution to y^2 = x^3\u20135. I have a background in mathematics but not in number theory. So the proof went, \u201cassume there is a solution, reduce modulo 4. Then they point to a table of values for y^2 mod 4 and x^3\u20131 mod4. The table shows the remainder when y^2 is divided by 4 and when x^3\u20131 is divided by 4. So I\u2019m thinking : why pick x^3\u20131 instead of x^3\u20135 like in the question. I guess I am missing out on some logic. So then I do an internet search for someone else to explain the solution and saw the same solution. So then I had a choice to think about it for another hour or to say hell with it and do something else and think ok, sometime I\u2019ll have to study modular arithmetic and maybe my point of misunderstanding will come to me. So even for math people frustration arises when explanations are not clear because someone versed in the field assumes that everyone should be able to fill in the details. Of course for the purpose of publishing math results economy and short explanations are often best. The other extreme is of course too much explanation with hundreds of identical exercises for the reader to do and that\u2019s just as bad and an equal time waster. Sometimes it seems that math is kind of a way to divide people into two groups, those that get it and those that don\u2019t. The group consisting of those that don\u2019t is very very large. When I was in University , some of the math profs would look down on Computer people as being quite stupid. It seems that some math exams were almost set to weed out those that were not truly into math to prove that they were stupid. So some of the blame for math difficulty may be in the elitist attitude of some academics. Practically when you teach a large group of students, it is of course hard to tailor the teaching to each student\u2019s level of understanding. So a middle of the road approach is used which may bore the brightest and fail the less capable. Teaching math is always a hard challenge that a good teacher always strives to improve on. ",

Ok let us try to understand why this is Neil degrasse tyson came up with a conclusion that when we say ,\u201dwe are bad at math\u201d or \u201cI am not a math person\u201d the only conclusion that comes to mind is that we are not equipped for logical thinking which is highly contradictory because the human brain is designed to think logically. So why is this? It is because that we are taught mathematics in such a way that we are forced to perceive it as alienish. The teachers themselves teach it in such a way that students really can\u2019t understand it no matter how many times we try. The only way out of this is following these methods. Determination : Be determined that you will understand everything that you want to know about maths no matter what.Rid yourself from negative taughts: When we keep on telling ourselves that we can\u2019t do it we just can\u2019t we are feeding ouselves with negative energy and then we seriously can\u2019t even solve simple algebra, instead develope a positive attitude and tell yourself \u201cIT IS JUST MATH AND NOTHING ELSE\u201dPassion: Develope a passion for it and you are bound to success.Understand which mode of instruction is better for you: Are you an autodidact? do you learn best by reading? do you learn best by watching, listening or are you a hands on learner.Use resources available to you the internet, books, videosDevelop a positive mind set.Have fun.Take it slow.Hard workNever quitThis is how you achieve victory.

            "answer_text": "Math is hard for exactly the same reasons that poetry is hard. The point in each case is to effectively describe things that are difficult to put into words. They are in different domains, of course. Where poetry might try to describe a mood, mathematics might try to describe a curve, and while we all know what a mood feels like and a curve looks like, putting those things into words takes real effort. Poetry and mathematics both demand abstract thinkingPoetry and mathematics both demand attention to subtlety and detailPoetry and mathematics both demand that we stop looking at \u2018things\u2019 and start looking at the relationships between \u2018things\u2019And up until about the middle of high school, people who like poetry and mathematics get more or less the same kind of treatment from a coarse, literal-minded society. That doesn\u2019t make math or poetry harder, it just makes them harder to enjoy. So yes, math (and poetry) is hard because it asks you to express yourself in new, unaccustomed ways. In a way, it is exactly the same problem a 1 year old child faces when s\u2019he realizes s\u2019he can\u2019t just point at something and make a noise and expect to get it. It has to be the right noise (a word, a label, a description, a metaphor, an equation) to get the job done. ",

            "answer_text": "Math is difficult because most of us do not think in terms of mathematical concepts. People studying the humanities in particular. tend to apply the same thought process to math class as to history. It simply doesn\u2019t work. The other problem is that some people think they can memorize how to solve problems. They fail to recognize that each problem may require a slightly different method. When you take a math class, pay attention to the principles. If you apply the applicable principle and apply it correctly, solving the problem is easy. The other factor is that math is like a brick wall. the lower bricks support those higher up. If you do not know math (adding and subtracting), you can not do algebra. If you do not know your algebra, you will be lost in geometry. If you do not have both algebra and geometry, you can not learn calculus. etc. Consider also that each new topic is strange to the beginner. Algebra is different and thus hard. so is geometry for the same reason. I thought calculus was very hard until I spent some time learning it. I am dyslexic. If I can learn math well enough to use it in industry and then to teach math, so can you. It is only as difficult as you think it is. ",

            "answer_text": "Let us talk about a Group in mathematics. From the Wikipedia : A group is a set, G, together with an operation\u22c5 (called the group law of G) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element, denoted a \u22c5 b or ab. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, (G, \u22c5), must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms: Closure For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a \u22c5 b, is also in G. Associativity For all a, b and c in G, (a \u22c5 b) \u22c5 c = a \u22c5 (b \u22c5 c). Identity element There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a in G, the equation e \u22c5 a = a \u22c5 e = a holds. Such an element is unique , and thus one speaks of the identity element. Inverse element For each a in G, there exists an element b in G, commonly denoted by a1a1 (or \u2212a, if the operation is denoted \"+\"), such that a \u22c5 b = b \u22c5 a = e, where e is the identity element. Okay, so far so good. We are ready to work on groups and for easy examples , you can already determine if they are groups. Congratulations, you have learned a little bit of Group theory ! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014(1) But , wait ! Why did you learn it? I mean, what was the reason that some mathematicians randomly formed a structure like this ? Is it just what it seems at the face value, or is there an ulterior motive? And lastly , why the name group ? \u2014\u2014\u2014(2) If you end your association with mathematics at the point marked (1) , mathematics will seem to you like a boring , hard subject, a lot to memorize and in general , something that was build by the whims of people who had nothing better to do ( Who called themselves mathematicians) If you cover up to point (2) , the art will slowly be revealed to you. You\u2019ll understand why they are interesting, and why mathematicians are artists painting on a canvas made of numbers. And more than that, you will see things in a different light. You will understand that addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, the operations you learned when you were a kid, the operations that still make up half your calculations aren\u2019t special at all. Once you see them through and through, you will have the power to define your own operations, according to your will. Just to solve some problem. And you\u2019ll know exactly how the operator behaves. Imagine the power that you\u2019ll possess. I am not saying that mathematics will be easy after that. But there\u2019ll be a difference. Mathematics , when properly understood ,and when you have proper tools at your disposal can be very much like a story of Sherlock Holmes. Is the mystery easy? Nah, its hard. Is it interesting? Its Christmas ! ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is from the perspective of a lay man with high school level knowledge of Mathematics. I did take it as an elective in college but have never really used those higher concepts.  I was bad at Mathematics in school. Reason : I was told constantly that I am \"brilliant\" at the languages(my mother was a language teacher so she knew how to keep me interested and hence at the top of the class), good at Social Sciences(easy enough at school level with all that \"eating by heart\" and vomiting over in the examination) and Maths was one area that I needed to improve to be a topper. Sciences? I managed one way or the other - some concepts interested me, the ones that didn't were again learned by heart and vomited. As time progressed, the more I was asked to improve, the worse it got - at one point of time I had A+ in all subjects and a red mark in Mathematics. Now that I look back, I realize its no more difficult than a lot of other things I learnt to do over time.Cooking. Dancing. Swimming. Learning a new language. Out of pure curiosity, I took a couple of sessions with Khan Academy over the topics that had seemed impossible 15 years ago. Voila! I was able to solve questions without the slightest of issues. I have not become more brain active in these years - rather slower. Then what had changed? I was not worried about failing. I took my time and no one was telling me that I should be scared of the Maths monster. My learning? Maths is not difficult- at least no more than other disciplines. Its just that the higher level concept draws heavily or maybe totally from one or more concepts of the lower level - you miss one step and bam! there you go all the way down. In comparison you are not hurt as much if you miss on a concept in another discipline. Languages - miss a concept and you will get it (eventually) once you speak. Sciences - its mostly basics (till high school)  and at places where it is not the higher concept draws from just one lower concept. Easy enough to get that.You cannot \"speak\" Maths to learn a concept and the lack of clarity in one thing leads to failure in another. Chain reaction :) No amount of practice can bring in a concept if the lower rung of the ladder is missing. 99% of people/kids miss one or the other \"Maths step\" at one point or the other and they hit the wall. In retrospect, the people who told me about the Maths monster were scared themselves.  Unless they go back(or are rather taken back) to the basics and re-learn it remains that way. The fear gene is passed on from one generation to other and hence the cliche \"Maths is difficult\". ",

However, there is no end, and most people run into a layer where they just don't get it. For most people, this is something like high school or college calculus. When students reach this point, their minds often take the approach, \"Mathematics has gotten progressively harder over the years. I can't even take this, let alone something harder.\" As I said, this is usually high school. These people have never seen how diverse mathematics can be. They've done some basic algebra, and basic trigonometry, and now some basic calculus, and there is nothing to show them why they should even continue. Many of these people are bright enough that they could likely make a huge impact in number theory, field theory, and many different branches of algebra. However, they get to calculus, and they assume that because there is one branch of math that they are bad at, they will never be good at any of the others, so they stop trying  to be good at mathematics, and instead do something else. To summarize, the problem isn't that they couldn't be great, it's that they assume that they can't. ",

But as a subject, mathematics has one major challenge that results in many people finding it difficult, and it\u2019s this\u2026 \u2026unlike history, or many other subjects, anyone will have major difficulties if they start falling behind. If they don\u2019t stay up, they are quickly lost and most in that situation never, ever catch up. The problem is not uncorrectable, but it requires the student get help in going back and picking up whatever they failed to learn. One example is: how difficult calculus is. It isn\u2019t just the conceptual challenge of calculus itself, but the fact that if you\u2019re weak in any of the subjects leading UP to calculus \u2014 algebra, trig, analytic geometry\u2014you\u2019ll be in trouble trying to learn calculus. And then it gets worse from there. You can look up the most modern, state-of-the-art math concepts on wikipedia, for example, but the articles assume you already know a tremendous amount of subjects nearly as advanced. And this is a problem. It presumes that before you get to the \u201cA\u201d level of knowledge, for example, you must first get to the \u201cA-\u201d level. But if you\u2019re only at the \u201cB\u201d or \u201cC\u201d level, then abandon hope, all ye who enter. For the math students who get all of it \u2014 probably people who never missed a single day of class and therefore never fell behind \u2014 perhaps they get a great sense of pride from knowing what leaves other people baffled. It\u2019s a shame there aren\u2019t more people dedicated to making mathematics more obvious. ",

            "answer_text": "The main reason is that how it was taught does not match with the things you like. So you didn\u2019t learn enough math yet to make it interesting. Some people like some rock music so they want to learn to play that on a guitar. So you get very excited and sign up for lessons. Then you find lessons are very hard and are very boring because you have to learn to just play these stupid notes over and over again and all you want to do it just learn to play your favorite song. So then you think, ok hell with music. You are going to study art. So you sign up for art class. You want to draw all that cool Manga stuff to impress your friends. Then you find out the teacher just had you drawing circles for three classes. You didn\u2019t want this. You want to draw cool action characters like Superman flying through the air and not stupid circle. So you conclude art is very stupid and boring. So then there is this chess guy at your school who won $1,000 in some chess tournament. So you ask him to teach you. It would be cool to be a world champ and beat everyone like in the movies. So he teaches you how all the pieces move and a few tricks and you try that on some of your friends and lose. So then you conclude that guy doesn\u2019t know how to teach and makes chess very boring and dumb. With math, you have to learn a lot of basic stuff before you can do anything with it. Suppose you want to write a cool computer game where you have explosions and you can shoot stuff and have all kinds of neat graphics. You want to do that. You know that some of these games made some teens super rich. So then you find out you need to know a programming language and you also need to know stuff about geometry and algebra before you can do anything. But before you can understand algebra and geometry you need to really know your arithmetic but you thought arithmetic was totally boring. So you decide hell with writing computer games. Computer games are stupid anyway, except for playing them. Everything seems to require too much work before you can do anything. well that\u2019s how the world works. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what you mean by difficult, and on who you are. First natural talent helps. Just as it's very hard to be a 5' tall NBA player, you can definitely have or not have an aptitude towards mathematics. But more importantly, more than almost any other subject you will study, maths is progressive and builds on what you have done before. To illustrate if you for whatever reason miss a year of History class there is going to be an area of history you know nothing about and a few techniques that you might have to pick up from others. But you'll only struggle a little most of the time. If you miss a year of Math class most of what you need to know the next year builds on what you learned the previous year and you are going to be floundering throughout the next year. If you miss work in math class you can not afford to not catch it up in the way you can in most other classes. On the other hand this means that if you make sure you miss nothing out math is probably easier than most other classes because so many people do miss steps out and then find themselves struggling. And it's hard to look back and see where you've actually missed something because it was almost certainly one or two steps before you actually started to struggle. Put the work in to keep up and you'll find that the people who get by on ability while not working struggle while you find it easy. So is it difficult? No - but it does require you to be thorough in a way few other subjects do. ",

History, English literature, etc. I could read, study and learn in near solitude. Mathematics is made more difficult by authors who don\u2019t know the subject well enough, and often not at all, to describe it in textbooks. Then you have art history majors made into math teachers in a Summer\u2019s course. How the hell can you learn math? It can be rather daunting. Your parents usually can\u2019t offer help because about twice a decade a whole new math approach arrives in your school district. Then we have group problem solving. Usually even worse than the U.S. Congress. Some classrooms in grade school don\u2019t offer two or three levels of instruction. Wouldn\u2019t want to hurt someone\u2019s self esteem. So the class is taught at the level of least knowledgeable or interested student. So much for learning what is required by the grade level. Lastly, math is given short minutes each week in class. Students know more about minority contributions to their local area than about math. We teach both the US system, similar to the British imperial system, and the metric system. The metric system doesn\u2019t relate well to the everyday world and is difficult to use in everyday measurements. The US system relates easily to the world around us but is not used by most of the world. Math is easy if textbooks are well written and teachers competent. Neither, I fear, happens on a regular basis. Don\u2019t despair, someday you\u2019ll will find that inspiring math teacher and learn. ",

            "answer_text": "From an evolutionary perspective, our abilities in abstract reasoning, including mathematics, are a comparatively recent development. Most of us are highly skilled in terms of our ability to perceive and interact with the physical world, but this comes so naturally we often don't even really consider it. This problem is very well illustrated in the field of Artificial Intelligence and specifically Moravec's paradox.  According to Moravec, \"Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much more powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge. We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.\" ",

Students don\u2019t have the liberty of hearing \u201cyou almost got it.\u201dMath is cumulative. In a history or English class, every new year is like a reset button. No one assumes any prior knowledge. In math, if you messed up two years ago, it will come back to haunt you.Math is taught differently. In English, you learn what a sentence is before you learn about its parts. You hear stories before you write sentences. So, when you learn about what a verb is, it fits. Math is taught to you like a jigsaw puzzle. We start with addition. And then multiplication. And then algebra. And then calculus. And finally, after calculus, you might start to see how any of it can be applied to the real world. Being taught mathematics is being given the pieces to a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle, only to be shown the big picture 10 years later.Math incites fear. \u201cMath is hard\u201d is a trope. Children are taught from a young age that math is a challenge. So the ones that get it feel great. But the ones that don\u2019t feel justified. It\u2019s okay not to be good at math because it\u2019s \u201chard.\u201d Unfortunately, math only gets harder once you\u2019ve decided that you can\u2019t/won\u2019t do it.Math is boring. Okay. Math isn\u2019t always boring. But staring at something that you don\u2019t understand at all for an hour is boring. And trying to learn something that is boring is hard. So learning math is hard.

Is the answer to this question as simple as saying that Mathematics in our school is not linked directly to the real context of everyday mathematical uses we apply in our daily life. There could be numerous reasons as why mathematics is perceived as a hard subjects than others, some of the reasons are :- Conceptually, many topics of mathematics are integrated with each other, for example concept of carry over or carry forward is somehow connected with the concept of PLACE VALUE. So without knowing the concept of place value, learners find difficulties in addition with carry forward, again in case of subtraction,multiplication and division too.Rote memorized rules and manipulation of symbols with little or no meaning are harder to learn than integrated conceptual structure.Poor pedagogical practices are one of the major reason in understanding math, as teachers put too much emphasis on memorizing formula and are dealing with traditional standard algorithms for the four basic operations and its related word problem.So in order to understand Maths well, one of the important aspect of the pedagogy should be \u201cEXPERIENTIAL\u201d and let the learners to learn the concepts through concrete ways , which could be done doing activities using concrete physical tools . once the learners develops a concrete understanding of the concept, we can move towards abstraction of the experiential learning and it will help the learner to mathematize his/her learning.

            "answer_text": "Ok, I\u2019ll take a stab at that. It\u2019s because mathematics is, in a sense, trivial. It\u2019s trivial because it does not involve discovering anything about the world, taking measurements, or doing experiments. It\u2019s just about things that are logically equivalent. That\u2019s the relationship between a theorem and axioms. They just follow logically. It should be totally obvious. But it isn\u2019t. Because we just aren\u2019t that smart. No one. At least no one so far. Our brains aren\u2019t really wired that way. That\u2019s why, for example, we see optical illusions, or sometimes trip on stuff. We\u2019re wired to know stuff based on experience, not logic. It\u2019s really hard to think logically, just like it\u2019s a lot harder to interpret the phrase \u201cbird sitting on a toadstool\u201d than to interpret a picture of a bird sitting on a toadstool. Maybe a lot of theorems would be obvious to a far more advanced creature, just as a lot of things are obvious to us, that just aren\u2019t obvious to a dog. So, mathematics is hard because it deals with stuff that should be obvious, because it follows logically, but it isn\u2019t, because we just ain\u2019t that smart nor wired for it. Mathematics is a crutch to extend our minds, but it\u2019s a hard crutch to use. Think of a dog riding a bicycle. It\u2019s unnatural. It\u2019s hard. Not all of them can do it, and fewer can do it well. The difference, though, is that mathematics is useful because it can connect things that aren\u2019t obvious to us naturally. ",

            "answer_text": "I did very well up until \"New Math\" started when I was in 5th grade.  Suddenly, it no longer mattered how I did a problem, or what answer I got, but whether or not I understood the concept behind the function. Huh? After that, I was lost, mathematically.  It seemed that I only understood what I learned the year after I learned it, when I was then lost in the next year. I never 'got' math-  it was always, always a struggle.   In college Algebra II, the instructor had a double masters-  one in Mathematics, one in Logic.  He taught us in Greek-  literally.  He'd cover the boards in Greek symbols and numbers while we frantically scribbled, trying to understand AND keep up with what he was writing, then he'd come to the end of the equation and say, \"Well, there's a mistake in the arithmetic somewhere- don't worry about it\" and erase the whole thing! I remember the night before an exam on ratios and proportions, I dreamed the problems all night long.  I was aware enough in the dream to know I didn't have a pencil or paper, so I had to do these long, long divisions in my head, remember where the decimals went in my head, no pencil, no eraser, all in my head.  One of the worst nights of sleep I have had in my life. I pulled a B on the exam;  but I still shudder at doing ratios and percentages. I am very good at many things, but I am not good at math.  Perhaps it is the way I was taught for a few years, perhaps it is not a bent I have.  I believe talent comes in more subjects than simply the arts.  I think mathematical ability is a talent no less than the ability to draw, or sing, or play a musical instrument.  A person may have the talent, the bent, but still must be taught enough, or, better, led towards, an ability to explore for themselves.  I never had that-  math was always torture.  I know why I don't like maths, and it's because, despite trying over and over, I'm not good at it. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the single biggest reason that anyone finds mathematics difficult is communication. You might think this is the same for any subject, not only mathematics, and to some extent it is true, but with mathematics there are certain built in obstacles.What makes mathematics glamorous and fascinating to those that love it are all those amazing symbols, and squiggles, that makes you part of the club when you proudly start writing them on a pad or whiteboard. The new, and special language that makes the subject so alive is for many the first problem. So if you are frightened a starting place could be to ask the more confident to slow down, and explain those symbols, and markings on the whiteboard. If you don't like the new symbols practice, and don't be frightened to make a fool of yourself, because whoever you are, sooner or later, you will get it wrong! I remember choosing to study at one particular university because I'd read some of the papers written by one of the lecturers. I sat through their lectures full of enthusiasm, but it has to be said they made many blunders, but they could be forgiven because they approached everything with such grace, and I learnt so much from their approach to the subject.Even putting the symbols to one side there are still the words that are often so frightening, words like hypotenuse, perpendicular, differentiation, integration, mutually exclusive, indeterminate, axiomatic, modulo, lemma, corrolory, theorem and the list goes on and on. Again knowing how the words came about can add a deepness to the subject that many educators either don't know or are too busy to mention. Yet some explanation of a word could add a new handle and dimension to the subject.So let's put both the symbols and the words to one side, why else might some find the mathematical domain daunting and difficult? Mathematics seems to have an endless number of rules that you have to stick to or else! This is true it does have a lot to remember when using it, it can be particularly off putting to have worked hard on something only to find it is wrong because of a slip right at the beginning of the work. However, imagine listening to your favourite song and the singer or band member started dropping notes all over the place. Would that be acceptable? Mathematics needs to be exact, because it deals with things that need an exact answer. How many times would you want to listen to nonsensical music before your nerves became completely jangled? If you think about it the rules actually make the subject accessible. If you get the rules, and apply them correctly, you get the right answer. There is no argument, unlike other subjects.Remember that essay you wrote for English or History that time, you know the one you thought was perfect? You got in back and the grade appeared to be subterranean, you read your classmates version and you couldn't tell the difference, but their grade is stratospheric. Well perhaps there were very subtle differences, but you couldn't tell and what's more subjectity could have been at work. This will not happen in mathematics, not at the majority of levels in any case.So if we put the strange symbols, words, and rules to one side what else makes mathematics difficult? Well beyond a solid understanding of arithmetic most people don't have to use mathematics in their everyday life. We are continuously talking and so our verbal skills are continuously updated. The internet constantly tells us what is happening in the world and we use this as currency when conversing. Mathematics is fairly invisible to most people, but it is in fact everywhere! Telecommunications, aviation, commerce, modern medicine, geological exploration, and just about everything that means a thing has mathematics at its core. If these areas interest you then start turning on your mathematical thinking, we all have it! ",

            "answer_text": "Maths is difficult or not depends on how your approach is towards studies. Some people love to learn stories and so they like history. They find it amazing who was who, while some people do not want to mug-up things at all. They just believe in learning few formulas and use it to solve problems ( while this is what elementary maths is) At college level you will need to memorize and mug up few derivations etc. Maths itself is a vast subject. Linear algebra, calculas , geometry, abstract maths etc. Linear algebra is one of the easiest to understand. Geometry requires you to learn up all formulas of different fiqures, their properties and then whenever you get a question you have to find out which property applies. A maths question is just like a lock. And you already have numerous keys to it. You just need to know which key matches (property) and which side you have to twist. If your approach towards studies is that you should already know all answers to questions and learn them up prior and you can\u2019t apply propeties on the spot to solve it then maths does becomes difficult. Obviously maths is a subject which requires persistent work. An hour of study every day. However it\u2019s quite rewarding both career wise and also raises your percentile academic wise. ",

Since you\u2019re not being specific, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re talking about primary or secondary mathematics, or maybe 100- or 200-level college classes. In this case, the answer is: Because you were taught poorly, and therefore lack self-efficacy. You should apply the following general approach of making sense of a novel mathematics problem. Find a way to turn the mathematical abstraction into a concrete, real-world problem. If you don\u2019t know how to do this on your own, use the Google. You could alternately type the problem into the comment section below, and I\u2019d be happy to help you with this.Draw a picture.Think about it.Reduce the problem to a simpler one with smaller numbers or fewer features, if that helps.Formulate your best guess.Talk to other people about it.Repeat on similar problems until the operation or concept is familiar.The more problems you solve and new concepts you understand intuitively, the stronger your self-efficacy will become, and the more comfortable you will feel tackling new challenges. On the other hand, maybe you\u2019re talking about advanced mathematics. In that case, the answer is, because it takes a long time to solve the problems and understand the material. And unless you\u2019re a grad student in mathematics, or a researcher in a related domain, you probably have other things to do with each day\u2019s 24 hours, so you don\u2019t have time to make sense of it. Also, the books are expensive, and there aren\u2019t many resources on the internet, so it\u2019s harder to get a good explanation without investing money or your indentured servitude in grad school.

No one assumes any prior knowledge. In math, if you messed up two years ago, it will come back to haunt you.Math is taught differently. In English, you learn what a sentence is before you learn about its parts. You hear stories before you write sentences. So, when you learn about what a verb is, it fits. Math is taught to you like a jigsaw puzzle. We start with addition. And then multiplication. And then algebra. And then calculus. And finally, after calculus, you might start to see how any of it can be applied to the real world. Being taught mathematics is being given the pieces to a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle, only to be shown the big picture 10 years later.Math incites fear. \u201cMath is hard\u201d is a trope.

            "answer_text": " Math has an order of thinking which has to come by practice. If students lack in logical understanding of Math concepts, they fall behind in grades and feel shaken and diffident in Math classes. There are some strategies for students to understand the language of Math and improve their grades. Master a topic before moving onto the next topic Math is like reading. While practicing reading, if you cannot recognize words, you cannot understand their meaning. Similarly, if you are not comfortable with a Math topic, you won\u2019t be able to move to the next one. Get it done through a friend or teacher or best online Math tutor. If you leave it half done, there are chances of your getting frustrated and hopeless about the topic when you come back to it. Work out sample problems and check the answers Working out sample problems in every chapter helps get practice in every lesson along with familiarity of the types of problems you can expect for your test. Further, you get used to a routine to sit with practice problems for every chapter once the chapter is done. Write down a problem Don\u2019t think your way to answer while solving a problem. Write it down first. Then take it step by step. Do a step at a time. It is quite natural to think that you can solve a problem by thinking the way to it in your mind. It creates only a mess in your mind. So write down even the simplest steps to avoid confusion while solving problems. Find a quiet place for doing homework Doing homework in a quiet place is essential for better concentration and focus on concepts. Even then, you may get confused many times with tricky sums .In such situations, you can seek Math homework help online and grasp ideas that have eluded you so far in your homework tasks. Teach Math to others It is a universal truth that those who are able to teach a concept can understand it better. It is extremely right in the context of Math learning. This works especially well in group study where one of your classmates may be lagging behind in Math work. By helping him, you are able to rehearse your understanding of Math topics and also improve your confidence in Math learning. Avoid writing with pen while working out problems You may want to erase, strike out a number while solving problems. Overwriting with pen may cause confusion. Avoid writing with pen at the first attempt of a problem. Neat writing helps you solve the problem with ease. Don\u2019t sit late night for solving problems Your mind gets exhausted by the end of the day and it is not the time for you to try new or tough problems. It is the time for you to revise the old ones without stressing your mind. Thus doing Math with success for better grades is a matter of practice and working out problems with a clear mind.

The boredom is what ultimately causes that small insect inside the brain to evolve into the reptile of fear of math and its disregard as abstruse over a course of exasperation and anxiety. Curriculum. We are expected to mug up formulae, expansions (for some people, there is an additional \"questions\" I would like to append at the end of this list) and vomit them out in our terms and finals to get marks and grades. According to me, this is not a real test of one's aptitude in any subject. In fact, for a subject like math, it hampers creativity. Math, and creative? Yes, very. Vomiting out results, solving a certain problem using a certain standard method, and not even trying to think of solving it by other methods (maybe more elegant) is a very serious threat to intellectual creativity. This is what lays the foundation of the \"mundane\" beginning of fear of math. And it is justified! It develops an image of math as that of a ravenous monster who could eat your brain and suck your happiness and grades, and give you nothing but some obscure formula or result to mug up.This is further catalysed by lack of interest. And this is what happens by personal choice. Sometimes, the lack of interest is a consequence of the curriculum. Of course, you can develop an interest by reading more if you want to, but that can again happen only if you want to. You need to love the subject to be able to try to know it well. If not love, maybe be addicted or attracted to it in some way or the other. ",

            "answer_text": "I like to think people struggle with math because of how abstract the concepts are, and how they\u2019re very difficult to tie to real-world concepts. These abstract-concepts often require powerful spatial-reasoning abilities to fully understand. There are so many reasons thats why people think Math is hard. The first reason being the media has imprinted into our minds that Math is for people with high intelligence. We see this in tv shows such as The Big Bang Theory where scientists like Sheldon are continuosly using math in their everyday lives. This has told us that math is only for the extremely intelligence hence it takes a lot of skill to do so. Also, Math requires a plenty of analytical skills that need critical thinking. Some people find it difficult to use these critical thinking skills so that could be another reason why they find it difficult. It also needs you to memorize certain steps and formulas which could be tricky for those who have trouble remembering. The problem with math is twofold: Math is somewhat like a ladder. If you get stopped at algebra, calculus is out. If you get stopped at calculus, differential equations is out.The level of abstraction \u2014 it\u2019s dealing the with abstract in world where most things have a some kind of corollary.",

We may classify mathematics into the \u201ceasy\u201d mathematics, which is the known and fully understood mathematics, and the \u201chard\u201d mathematics (theorems that seem to be difficult to crack). When most people talk about \u201chard\u201d mathematics they are talking about algebra, calculus, or something else we know. This stuff is generally easy to mathematicians. It is definitely not hard. So why is it hard for some people? Well, there are many tricks you can use that are not given in textbooks. That makes it \u201chard\u201d. Then there is a large amount of memorization. You need to create a memory palace in your mind of all the theorems and concepts to be able to effectively recall them. If you do not do that, then they will be hard to learn. But if you are talking about the first definition of \u201chard\u201d I gave. There is a deeper and more fundamental reason why mathematics is hard. Fundamental it is hard to prove theorems because our mathematics is not currently expressive enough to prove some theorems. ",

These are the major problems : It's because most of the time we are not given a proper visualization of the concept ( it's changing these days ). This part is very important, as basic interest in the subject is created only when you visualize the central idea properly. Or, we are not into that logical thinking.May be, the practical application of the concept is not mentioned, so the link between the classroom and real world is missing.Or it's because, we are not practising enough. We are not putting in the required amount of time and effort into understanding the particular topic ( as time is a constraint ). Or because the faculty is not able to communicate well enough for you to get each and every bit of it.I think if all the above reasons are not your problems, then it's because you are not able to enjoy the subject. The best way to understand and enjoy the subject is to dig in deeper. Images source: Google. ",

According to me, learning mathematics is not hard if we understand it first. In our case, what happens we learn things first that is \u201cwhat is Pythagoras Formula?\u201d, we know it but we do not try to understand the concept behind it. This makes hard mathematics. Then we would be confused in the formula, this creates a very feverish difficulty. This feels mathematics so hard. For illustration, we had learned clock at our childhood firstly. That means we have already familiar with the numbers. That is awareness of the number is understanding and how to see time in the clock is Learning. Similarly, firstly we have to understand money and number then learn to count money. From the above examples, it has cleared that we have concepts of daily routine mathematics so that we can able see the proper time, calories in the diet, the distance between the place and many more. of course, this regular computation makes life so susceptible. Then why we feel mathematics subject so hard. The only reason or solution is first to understand then learn or apply. ",

It is full of artistic expression using tools that are based of logic and reasoning. Unlike science, there is no practical or materialistic connect. To develop mathematical thinking, we need to encourage the student to unleash their artist within, while disciplining him/her to use logic and reason as the only tools. To do so, the teacher needs to have the same artistic acumen with the environment being encouraging as well. But for all practical reasons, very rare people amongst us get such teachers. Rest all, get only task focused or exam oriented mentors. Being task or goal oriented is necessary. This is the only way you can instill discipline onto the student, which is necessary in Mathematics. But ignoring the fact that overdoing it kills the ability to think independently and express themselves, creates the hatred. I want to end this answer with this funny, but thought provoking clip from the Indian film Taare Zameen Par. Do we encourage this imagination?  ",

There are some people who have something like dyslexia but for numbers.  It is probably more common than thought... maybe 1/200 or something like that.  Those people struggle.   Another factor is that math teachers are often absolutely dreadful.  They like to frighten and to focus on \"top\" students.  That's not what teachers should do.  Top students more or less take care of their own learning.  The people who need teachers are often the bottom tier--but they need to be people who want to learn.  I don't put too much stock in math talent.  Most people who are good have had some period when discipline and numeracy was very much emphasized versus the lives of others.  I've seen no great peer-reviewed study that shows people raised in the same system with the same opportunities have wildly different math outcomes.  Happy to be corrected on that. ",

            "answer_text": "By \u2018math\u2019 I assume you mean maths higher than basic algebra. I like to think people struggle with math because of how abstract the concepts are, and how they\u2019re very difficult to tie to real-world concepts. These abstract-concepts often require powerful spatial-reasoning capabilities to fully understand. Take for example, studying a human cell in school. You learn that Micochondria produces the energy for the cell. Of course, the underlying chemistry behind how this actually happens is surely very complicated, but you have a basis of understanding. You can compare the Mitochondria to a power plant for a cell. Similarly, in money subjects, you can tie concepts you learn to concepts in real-life for a better understanding. Then we come to math. Take an infinite series for an example. You can add up an infinite number of values\u2026 and get a finite number? What? We don't encounter the concept of \u2018infinity\u2019 in every day life, so it is very hard to grasp how this is possible.. but it is. In order to really understand math, you must really be able to visualize the concepts as you read them, without ever having visualized something like that before. This is a very difficult challenge and why few are blessed with the ability to really grasp advanced mathematics. The presence of highly abstract concepts that are difficult (if not impossible) to relate to real-life examples is one of many reasons that math is so hard, and yet so beautiful ",

That\u2019s how you feel better when you see other great mathematicians are humans, like you and me, and they had their own difficult time understanding things, but they kept challenging themselves because they loved it.

Look at all the characters in Pok\u00e9mon. Children can learn anything. Math problems are not that hard. How many operations are there? Learn about sets and subsets. Learn about mathematical expressions, relations, and then graphs. Then get to proofs. You could do all this from grades K- 5. What makes math hard is the curriculum. It\u2019s never the kids!

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is difficult because, to many people, it is boring. Most advanced math lacks any relevancy to everyday life and can be quite abstract. It's like being taught a foreign language but told that no one else out there speaks it. Very few people have the willpower to sit down and put in the required mental energy to learn it. I've met quite a few math geniuses in my time and one thing I've noticed about all of them is they really enjoy math. My feeling is more people out there are capable of doing advanced math but they don't enjoy it enough to put in the effort.   This is only one reason why math seems difficult but the biggest reason is that it simply is actually difficult. You need to be of above average intelligence to to progress far in math and most people simply aren't capable of it. Asking why math is difficult is like asking why running a 4 minute mile is difficult. It's difficult for most but some people who are elite athletes can do it.   Finally, I'd like to add that not all math is difficult. Most math is very easy. Arithmetic, basic geometry, calculating percentages is very easy and the vast majority of the adult population have no problem with those skills. Math can get very hard if you keep on studying it but that is true of pretty much anything. ",

            "answer_text": "Math is like sports. When you\u2019re learning to play a sport, is it enough to read books about the sport, memorize some facts, and maybe watch movies about it? Of course not! With sports you learn by doing. It\u2019s the same in math: you can\u2019t just read the book, you have to do the practice problems (homework). Math is like sports in another way. If you want to be good at basketball, do you practice only right before a game? No, youpractice every day or almost every day. It\u2019s the same with math: you have to keep your \u201cmental muscles\u201d limber by working with it every day. Math is like foreign languages. When you study a foreign language, you know there will be a lot of words you don\u2019t know. The same is true in math, except that many of the words look like English words. But math terms like set, prove, hypothesis, term, solution have special meanings that are different from ordinary English. Approach math like a foreign language and make sure you understand every term. It might be helpful to build up a vocabulary list in your notebook. Math is like science or engineering. You need to be very meticulous and work everything out logically. There may be different ways to get to the right answer, but there\u2019s only one right answer. Math is like building construction. When you\u2019re building a house, you would never think of trying to put up the second floor before the first floor. Building is asequential process. The same is true in math: each concept builds on the ones that came before. In history, you can understand the Depression pretty well even if you didn\u2019t study World War I. But in math it\u2019s different: you need to understand factoring very well or you won\u2019t be able to solve equations. This means that if you\u2019re strapped for time, the one course that\u2019s most dangerous to let slide is your math course. With other courses, if you don\u2019t understand day 11 you can probably follow the lecture on day 12. With math, you have to understand day 11 or you\u2019ll likely be lost in day 12. The moral is that you need to stay current. If ever you don\u2019t understand something, get help on it right away. Otherwise you\u2019ve just knocked away the first floor of your house, and you know what that will do when you try to put up the second floor. Hope this helps.. ",

There is no redundancy in mathematical notation (unlike normal written text).It is possible to arrive at a \u201ccorrect\u201d result to most trivial problems in totally incorrect ways. Thus is it very easy to build and reinforce misconceptions. Breaking those misconceptions when one meets less trivial problems is difficult and results in the \u201cI don\u2019t get it!\u201d mental reaction.Mathematics is vast and each and every field requires constant practise to remain fluent.Mathematics is cumulative in ways many extremely skilled mathematicians underestimate and, when those highly skilled mathematicians are asked to design education policy they vastly underestimate the need for proficiency in very low level tasks. (e.g. knowledge of multiplication facts is essential if a student is to make meaningful progress in understanding shape, area and algebra. As \u201cmaths professors\u201d have developed far, far past that initial level and no longer need multiplication facts to progress their study, they underestimate the need for the novice to have solid knowledge of these facts.)Mathematics is often taught very badly - there are many jobs that pay (and reward in other ways) numerate graduates better than teaching maths so those who teach it are often not very good at it. This can even result in the opinion that a maths teacher should be bad at maths \u201cso they understand why students struggle\u201d.I think that\u2019s enough to be getting on with.. ",

Please find below the Tami alphabet:  Now you can learn the alphabet and know the associated sounds. Even if you manage to learn it by heart will you be able to understand a sentence ? Will you be able to understand poetry or appreciate a literary work ? Obviously it will be hard. That's why maths is hard. You learn the alphabet first (the numbers) Then you learn grammar (the operators) Next you are expressed to understand sentences and poetry and prose. (Theorems , proofs and equation) This makes it hard. Just like a language the objective of math is to express facts or situations. If you aren't provided with context nothing makes sense and everything is hard. Second example: Watch the star Trek episode darmok. Darmok (Television series episode).

            "answer_text": "Math is hard, because Math is perfect.  What I mean by that is Math has been simplified over and over again to be very exact and clear.  In Math, there is only one way to say what you want to say.  Whereas in English, you can say the same thing multiple ways.  I mean, you can really make your point over and over again.  Every time, you can construct a whole new sentence to say the exact same thing, or illustrate the same point, in colorful ambiguity.  You can just keep rattling on, repeating yourself... Short answer:  if you miss one simple piece of math notation or theory in Chapter 1, then you need it in Chapter 5, you are stuck.  There's no way to work that problem other than figuring out what you don't know.  And that's not fun, and its hard, and it can be hard to get help. So math can be frustrating because you have to understand all the basics to learn the next thing.  And well, I don't know about you, but I tend to forget things... What are we talking about? ",

            "answer_text": "Math is tough. This is a common problem in the student community. To do away with this, please follow the writeup below. Life is a perpetual instruction in cause and effect.\u201d \u2015 Ralph Waldo Emerson. Mathematics is a subject that deals with analysis, computation and evaluation, respectively. The three aspects can be related to initiation, propagation and termination of a certain quantity. It is the step by step method to achieve a logical conclusion. Mathematics fear or math anxiety is a real problem that most of the students face today. It is an anxiety about one\u2019s ability to do mathematics. According to Mark H. Ashcraft, maths anxiety is \u201ca feeling of tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with math performance\u201d. A student may believe he or she is incapable of doing mathematics problems before attempting the problem or even before the teacher explains the problem.A student may have a bad attitude about mathematics. When he in mathematics class, he may be nervous and unable to sit still or focus on the lecture.Math-anxious students may dread even going to mathematics class. There is a greater fear of answering a teacher's question incorrectly in mathematics class than other classes.They also tend to compare their grades to their peers' more and worry more about how their peers will react to them if they give a wrong answer in mathematics class.Students may experience math anxiety because they have never experienced success in their mathematics classes. This can be due to poor instruction. If the teacher does not teach well, the average student will most likely not do well in his class.Also, the student may have taken an insufficient number of mathematics classes, causing him to be unprepared for the class he is in. This could especially be a problem in schools where teachers are very strongly discouraged from failing their students. It is possible for students to be in a mathematics class that they should not be in because they did not pass the previous class.Math anxiety begins at different ages for different people. Some students may experience it as early as third or fourth grade.The crux of math anxiety is thought to occur in middle school when students experience increasing social pressures.The major causes of mathematics anxiety or fear are as follows: Mathematics is Abstract- The subject is abstract in nature and I feel that Vedic Maths Tricks and Shortcuts can help us to reduce Maths fear to a greater extent.Teaching Methodology- Conventional system of teaching lacks innovation and makes the subject, dull and boring. Students fail to understand and visualize the concept. Gradually, the interest from the subject decreases.Formulations of mathematical equations- Formulation of mathematical equations require good analytical ability. It is not possible to learn mathematics like other subjects.Poor Command over Tables- Table is an integral part in developing fundamentals. A survey was conducted and it was found that a good number of students had poor command.Poor Trainers- A poor trainer neither enjoys the subject nor makes it\u2019s interesting for his pupil.There are certain tips and tricks (i.e. solutions) for doing away with maths fear. I commonly name them as \u2018LAB-ID\u2019 which is nothing but a model that helps in reduction and eventually removal of maths anxiety or fear. a) [I] Identification- Identifying the problem is a main thing before getting its solution. It is natural to get multiple methods to solve a particular problem but it should never confuse us. The main motive of an individual should be to solve the sum/problem accordingly without any ambiguity. The method that takes less time and memory should be followed. For example, if we are given a problem to sum the numbers, then we must understand that it works on discrete values while integration should not be implemented here as it involves summation of continuous values. b) [D] Daily Practice- The most essential step is to practice daily. Scientific study shows that daily practice may lead to a state of mind where there will no doubt and at times, an individual delivers his best. c) [L] Learning from Mistakes- One who learns from his mistakes are the ones who shine in life like anything. They never look back to anything. They gain experience from failure and try not to repeat the same mistakes again and again. Math fear will fly away without any second thought! d) [A] Asking doubts from Mentors- Clarification of doubts is an integral part as well. We should always remember that \u2018Doubts are never meant to be unsolved\u2019. We should always approach our mentors or teachers to clear them. The more we are away from doubts, the chances of getting success, multiplies exponentially. e) [B] Being Confident- Being confident is a deterministic approach. Suppose an individual is given a multiple choice question with three options. He chooses one option with determination and confidence and gets it correct. Then, he or she is referred to be deterministic. For any number of situations, the output that is obtained is singular or unary in nature and type. Unlike all other phobia, this is also very detrimental in student community. The best way to avoid such psychological tantrum is to focus on our basics or fundamentals from the very beginning of the session. The motive of a maths student is not to mug up formulas and theories instead he should use various available resources in the web to strengthen his ground. After strengthening the ground, the next step is to sow seeds and maintain it regularly. The same process is repeated again and again to grow crops by the farmers but still they continue doing it. These can be linked to real life situation as well. Educators may be teaching students to have a math phobia rather than teaching them to love the subject. It is generally observed that students who have a math phobia may also have test taking anxiety. Timed tests and too much test preparation in the area of math, which is one of the two major focuses of high stakes testing, can exacerbate the issue. It is important for educators to find a balance with formative and summative assessments where math is concerned. That balance must be between teaching a love of the subject and not assessing so much that the love disappears. \u00a9 Suprabhat Das References: Helping Students Cope with Math PhobiaHomehttp://mathematigal.com/home/2013/10/28/good-articleson-math-fearEducation Articles7 Reasons behind Math Anxiety and How to Prevent ItThe above article has been published by me in LinkedIn as well.

            "answer_text": "Depends on what's considered mathematics. If you were to ask a mathematician what they do all day, I hold certainty they won't be expanding and factoring quadratics or any sort of non generalist computational tasks. David Hilbert, highly regarded mathematician of the 20th century, recalled one time where he wasn't sure if 7+5 equalled 12 or 13 (neither am I). I'm unable to tell you what 12 x 13 equals, or read a clock - yet I'm capable of set theory. If we were to consider arithmetic to be mathematics (like many do) then no, maths isn't too hard (except for individuals like myself). Opposite in mind, if we consider proof to be 'real' mathematics, maths is immensely hard and inaccessible for many. ",

Basic problem, people don\u2019t have patience when they are unable to solve a string of problems in a row. They start feeling like I can\u2019t do maths.Its not meant for me. Second probable reason is that there is so much of scope of problem types in maths. You can never say that I have done this much practice and i can solve any problem instantly. You have to scratch your mind each time you get a problem. Some people take it in other way and start feeling scared of new maths problem. Instead of being scared, try to solve the problem. Try wildly sometimes. You will feel confident once you solve a couple of \u201ctough\u201d questions. Up to my class 10 final exam , I was supposed to opt for biology. I didn\u2019t do much maths in my sub junior standards, although i was good at it. But finally i went for maths, practiced ,got disappointed, again practiced and right now m here at IIT R. All i felt about maths is as mentioned above. So don\u2019t give up on maths. It will definitely work. It is bound to do so. Hope this much will work, ",

If you are interested in making money, you will eventually learn about credit, taxation etc. - and the concepts/rules that govern them will make sense to you (just an example). We interact with people and the physical world for fulfilling our needs and desires. When it comes to people, mathematics is irrelevant :-P And as for the physical world (whose importance is only secondary in comparison), we deal with it intuitively - I don\u2019t need mathematics to manipulate the physical world to suit my requirements. It is only when civilization progressed that mathematics got applied to the physical world in the form of (mathematically represented) models (e.g. Newton\u2019s laws of motion). But only a minority need to understand science and use this in their work. So necessity to understand mathematics (that forms a basis for us humans with finite minds) is not present. My essential argument is there is not much of a natural incentive to learn mathematics :) Personally, I am not a great fan of mathematics. But with time I have come to realise (and there are many others who would agree with me on this, I\u2019m sure) that essential to mathematics is the mathematical way of reasoning. It is the logical reasoning that is its essential takeaway. It teaches us to start with assumptions and build upon them (via implications). This can be applied to anything. Computer scientists/engineers for example apply it every day, every minute at their jobs. Every profession which requires significant \u201cinvestment on thought\u201d would require it. Why, philosophy is much about this skill, secondary only to experience (IMHO). Mathematics can be thought of as a playground for you to experiment, learn and sharpen your analytical skills. They will be required by anyone - only, to varying extent. This I know is no inspiring essay to get started on mathematics. All I am saying here is - if what you desire would require mathematics for understanding, it would start making sense to you someday\u2026at least to some extent. Till then it would be only a bunch of formulas, theorems, rules that God only knows who invented and that you\u2019d have to memorize (and forget the minute the final exam got over) to get through to the next class :-D But if this answer made some sense to you (hopefully it did), do take some subject/topic (or thing) you like and try to explore the mathematics behind it. It would make sense. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow or the next month - but at least in 10 or 20 years from now. Do remember to upvote my answer whenever it does . ",

            "answer_text": "The statement,'Just go ahead and learn the formula as is!', plagued me during my final year of high school. Mathematics is built upon a set of key concepts that are often interconnected in terms of their use to calculate an answer. Hence, in my opinion, studying requires a solid understanding of the derivation of mathematical formulae and consequently why we use them in particular mathematical situations. This gives the student a wider scope of the subject and allows them to make links between different 'subdivisions' of mathematics. As for why mathematics is difficult to study, perhaps the answer lies in the aforementioned opinion: Many students are not taught Mathematics in a manner that amalgamates all their mathematical concepts and allows their thought process to function as one complete unit. In the school system's defence, perhaps part of the reason for not being taught the background knowledge of all concepts is due to the fact that students do not always have adequate understanding of mathematics in order to grasp the derivation of a formula. The statement, ' Just go ahead and learn the formula as is!\u2019, plagued me during my final year of high school. Nevertheless, my best advice would be to delve a bit deeper into mathematical concepts on your as much as possible. Try to find patterns in your work. Play around with mathematics. Try to figure out a different way to calculate problems. Then, test yourself by applying your solid mathematical concepts to both familiar and unfamiliar situations. ",

A lot of the reason is because of the way it's taught in schools. Children are taught to be mindless calculation machines, instead of being taught to discover interesting things with maths. They, understandably, hate it, so they don't try that hard, so they can't do it.  I teach math for SAT/ACT/GRE test prep and I am more of a Verbal person (Professional Writer and all), but at the company I work for we have to teach both. To this day, I am one of the most requested tutors because I approach Mathematics as someone for whom math is not necessarily intuitive and who doesn't expect it to be easy for all students. I have had to find numerous ways to make complex math make sense to me quickly, so I have become a veritable expert at explaining it in multiple ways to others. This helps me to connect to my students better, understand where they are having trouble, and makes me more effective as a math tutor. I find my students are better at math than we all (their parents, they, and I) thought once it is explained to them in a more accessible way. And like Jeremy Miles stated: \"Everything is hard\"... Until someone takes the time to explain it to you well. ",

It takes a lot of time before you get the hang of it. It\u2019s like learning Spanish. At first nothing makes sense but after a while you get the hang of it.

            "answer_text": "If you approach mathematics with the mindset that it is not difficult, but rather sort of like a universal language that is foreign to you at the moment, it may give you a different perspective. Math may seem difficult at first because you are not interested and just want it to be over as soon as possible. That's just fear of failure. There is a high probability you may run into challenges and fail some of them. However, you should use those failures to leverage a better effort out of yourself. Math can seem boring because of the logic, identities, associations and rules you use in application. These characteristics are the fundamentals on which you build. Succeeding in mathematics is a building process in which you start with the basics and fundamentals, and build on those until you work your way up to modeling the physical world, behavior and phenomema you see everywhere. You can't start out doing differential equations; you have to build up to it. You become fluent in this universal language in other words. I say universal language because the entire world can communicate with each other in mathematics and understand each other even though we speak different linguistic languages. In addition, if you lean more towards arts and humanities you may think that math is dry and you aren't creating\u2026art. I think math changes the way you view the world and it certainly affects your reasoning and decision making. That applies to everything you do - even painting, writing or composing music. In my opinion mathematics broaden your creativity and sharpen your mind in ways you can't quite quantify. If you become adept enough in math practicum you will find it is a lot like art in the way you innovate and create to solve problems, model behaviors and give us the best approximations to predict or represent the universe around us.

You love Math, you\u2019ll work out Math even when you\u2019re on your vaccations.The roots. One who got adequate basics in the best way it should be taught, would find it easier.Practice.

Some of my colleagues in the arts might jump at a chance to contradict me on that, but it\u2019s not so far fetched. Mathematics requires a good grounding in basic arithmetic skills just like the study of literature requires a good basic vocabulary. You also need to understand rules and processes: of math operations in mathematics and the rules and processes of human interactions in literature. In both subjects you need skills of abstract reasoning to recognize larger patterns and how those patterns can be applied in other circumstances. That said, some people are better at mathematical reasoning than they are at literary reasoning. You tend to like what you are good at and work harder at it. On the other hand, neither mathematics nor literature is so hard that any educated person should be excused from not having a basic understanding of both. Yes, work will be involved, but any worthwhile structure (or education) requires a solid foundation of a variety of skills. ",

Yes, diagrams. Those things people are supposed to abhor. Well, at least a certain French group abhored. Diagrams are absolutely essential to the correct understanding of mathematics. Third, you can turn any problem you don't understand into a problem you do understand. We usually use formula sheets, as books have a better memory than people, people are best left to things people do well. Fourth, write down all the steps/show your working. Skipping steps is a good way to lose track of things. Fifth, check results. These steps will let you go from start to finish with any problem. It doesn't matter if you're doing triple integrals, horribly complex Boolean algebra (important in encryption), partial differential equations, set theory (if you've never written software in Z, you've missed out), pi calculus, or Laplace transforms, you can ALWAYS make the problem one you can trivially do. Usually, the diagram is enough to do this. Nor does it matter if the problem is signals theory, fractals or sound processing. Those are all just details. The great thing about maths is that details don't matter. They can be converted into something else. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a friend who\u2019s a teacher in China who currently teaches Gr.12 physics. Now keep in mind that the Chinese needs to take their university entrance exam after Gr.12, so if a teacher is allowed to teach Gr.12 math, she needs to have a proven track record of been capable to teach since high school rankings in China is almost entirely based on how well its student body performs in the entrance exam. Her comment was that a lot of people think math is hard isn\u2019t because they aren\u2019t capable of doing the actual mathematics or lacks logic. A lot of people can\u2019t do math because of the exact opposite - they were terrible at literature when they were young, that they are unable to comprehend what the teachers are trying to explain in elementary school. And since math is cumulative where you need to have a firm grasp on the basics to be able to learn the more complicated stuff, those people who couldn\u2019t understand what the heck the teachers were trying to teach in elementary school will be behind in math, and that gap will widen as time goes by until math becomes a fearsome subject. So, her suggestion to parents with young children was, if the child is suffering in math, make absolute certain that he\u2019s capable on the literature side first before hiring a math tutor. It doesn\u2019t matter how good a math tutor is, if the child can not comprehend what is being explained to him or her, the math portion will never make sense. ",

There is a greater fear of answering a teacher's question incorrectly in mathematics class than other classes.They also tend to compare their grades to their peers' more and worry more about how their peers will react to them if they give a wrong answer in mathematics class.Students may experience math anxiety because they have never experienced success in their mathematics classes. This can be due to poor instruction. If the teacher does not teach well, the average student will most likely not do well in his class.Also, the student may have taken an insufficient number of mathematics classes, causing him to be unprepared for the class he is in. This could especially be a problem in schools where teachers are very strongly discouraged from failing their students. It is possible for students to be in a mathematics class that they should not be in because they did not pass the previous class.Math anxiety begins at different ages for different people. Some students may experience it as early as third or fourth grade.The crux of math anxiety is thought to occur in middle school when students experience increasing social pressures.",

Maths is fundamentally different from other subjects, first it is the base of all science subjects (be it physics, chemistry, economics etc) and secondly one needs to build on concepts learnt to learn new thing. In physics if you are not good in optics it has no corelation in the way you would perform in Newton Mechanics paper or thermodynamics. But in case of maths if you do not understand algebra then there is no way you would be able to master calculus or vectors. It is algebra which generally starts differentiating between students, till algebra people are decent enough at it but once it starts becoming abstract people\u2019s understanding takes a nose dive. It is essential at this stage to teach them effectively otherwise they would forever be afraid of maths. Then there are some students who would learn the equations and learn the way they are implemented in text book and be happy with it, this method would work in any other subject but maths being a base which can be employed in multiple ways is not conducive to such rot learning. When faced with a variation in a problem students start failing as they didn't grasp the concept but were rot learning. ",

In facts, you have so many proofs the math is complex, depending on how you define \u201chard\u201d, that you may turn the question the other way: to which complexity class belongs math ? (An open question, to the best of my knowledge.) Now this rises a true question: does complex necessary means difficult ? For example, Diophantines Equations or Algebraic Geometry problems are usually inextricable to solve but very simple to state. On the other side, there is nothing simpler than Cohomology and Category theory, once you have understood what mathematicians are talking about and at which level of abstraction they do reason. This takes a long time (in years) because there are many things to master on the way, but none of the steps taken individually is neither difficult nor \u201chard\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is not spectator sport which goes the saying. The defeatist attitude towards mathematics are due to a number of factors\u201d Subject of InstructionsThe study of mathematics as a \"demonstrative discipline\" begins in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, who coined the term \"mathematics\" from the ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 (mathema), meaning \"subject of instruction\". Teachers world wide fail to make students understand that the subject requires more attention due to the numerous instructions. Pythagoras termed it as subject of instructions because it needs ones attention and time. No-Go-AreaSome basic level teachers have made mathematics a no-go-area for many a beginner. They use misconception of mathematical ideas. For example it is common among teachers of mathematics at the basic levels terming < as \u201cless than\u201d. Knowing very well that the phrase \u201cless than\u201d suggest negative (-). The inequality < is read as \u201cis less than\u201d. Consider the two sentences below. 2 less than y2 is less than y2 less than y is an expression indicating y - 2 2 is less than y is a statement indicating 2 < y The two sentences above show that teachers also contribute to students not getting the mathematical concepts. The formative ages, when a concept is registered on ones mind, it is hard to reverse it. Hence the saying \u201cIt is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men\u201d The Joy of Doing MathematicsOne of the increments in the study of mathematics is to like it. When you like it, you will develop the love for it. If you love something it means you have the joy of doing it. Students who are lazy and disorganised are mathematically weak. Solid FoundationAnother area is that one needs to get a solid starting foundation. Your ability to do advance mathematics at higher level depends on the early foundation from year 1\u201310. If you have kids and you want them to be mathematically sound in future, start teaching them early. Let them like, love, and enjoy. It will be part of the future habit. CHILDREN HAVING STRONG SOLID MATHEMATICS FOUNDATION WILL RULE THE WORLD. More PractiseYou need to discipline yourself when it comes to mathematics. You need to do more practise at least 5 hours a day. Learning mathematics is a life time project. If you don\u2019t have time, just forget it. You can\u2019t make it. These are some of the factors why people see mathematics as difficult words. Sorry for lengthy answers ",

This might be sounds like a prejudice, but it is not. I respect everyone, and I am not saying the I have such an ability for maths as well. If I say that most people are not naturally prepared to play football or basketball or to play an instrument, going further than the basic first steps, I suppose all of you will agree. Although we can train someone to play these things, it is quite certain that he will not climb the mountain, but stop in an intermediate level beyond which he can\u2019t go. The same happens with maths. People can do the basic steps, sum and add numbers, to make some simple rules involving percentage and so on. Some more treined can do more with calculus, algebra and so on. But, comparatively, they would not be able to play a piano in a concert, of to play basketball in a team, etc. They will not understand the more advanced maths even with effort. We have different abilities, and intelligence presents itself in different ways. This of course doesn't mean that people who do maths is more intelligent that other people; well, usually they are, but there are excellent people in other fields as well, yet I have a feeling that these people would understand maths more than the basics if they intend to do it. So, I think its a question of skills. Some have, others do not. The comfort is that there are plenty of things to be done well out of maths. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not going to tell you that maths is not difficult, because it is. If maths were easy, you wouldn't be asking this question. The reason why most people find maths hard is because we don't get nearly enough practice, and sometimes we just don't have an interest for maths, which leads to us finding it hard. The problem the world has is that everyone expects people to be good in maths, even though they aren't good in maths themselves. People don't realise that maths is a skill, and you have to want to learn to master the skill, it won't come randomly unless you're a genius. What they also don't realise is that you won't want to learn a skill if you have no interest for it. So, to answer your question, maths is difficult to us because we lack the skill. And you know what? Screw anyone that expects us to master a skill we have no passion for. ",

            "answer_text": "Not just you, mathematics is a nightmare for everyone. There are 3 types of students: I love Mathematics For these people mathematics is the biggest nightmare. What the hell is going on? I can't understand a thing. These questions, they seem so simple, still I am stuck.I don't care Why do people so much care about mathematics. Top colleges and school have gone so far as to make it compulsory for all. All competitions require some level of mathematics.I can't Understand Mathematics I want to study mathematics, I know it's important, I know it will be useful for rest of my life. But no matter how hard I try I can't understand a bit. Oh God! Looks like I will fail.It doesn't matter to which one of the above category you belong. Maths is not everything. I have seen people with less than average math skill, who have grown up to become way more successful than average people. If you don't like it, stop studying it right now. Ramanujan studied nothing but maths, and I don't know anyone of greater potential to succeed. The point is not to study maths, but to do what you like. He loved maths. What do you love? Do you like maths and still aren't able to understand it? Then it's not your fault, just get yourself a teacher who can teach you the real essence of it. If you find interest in it, carry on and you will learn it in no time. There is no easier subject on this planet. This is one of the subjects which have been completely made by humans. No confusion, no ambiguity, no exceptions. Everything goes by definition. Everything depends on how you define it. People sometimes fear it because they can't understand what's going on. They don't know how these silly variables actually get these values. They think they need to remember the steps to get to the result. Well sometimes remembering the steps do help, but after a certain limit, you will be on your own, you will start getting questions you have never seen. That's where real mathematical skill is tested and trained. Don't just go for bookish mathematics. It has been a long time and now the trend should change. Consider the problem: There are seven bridge problem https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%25C3%25B6nigsberg&ved=2ahUKEwiEsN6y7priAhWBaCsKHXs7BMMQFjAZegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw2TD1fvvQbJcMMfN6o0qfPM . This problem has more mathematics than all your 10th standard books put together. If you can understand the solution to this problem, then my friend,you can master mathematics with very little effort. Finding solutions to unknown, unseen problems is something different. It takes much much much more effort than normal. I ain't talking about that. But others are easily understandable. ",

            "answer_text": "I beg to differ with others who have answered this question. If indeed mugging up is the reason people find maths boring and end up finding it difficult (by some weird logic) , by that logic we would be forced to find Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History and what not also boring and hence difficult.  As it turns out Biology, Physics, Chemistry and the likes always score over maths when it comes to 'easiness'. But it's important to see what is this easiness. I believe that it would not be far fetched to say that most students today on this planet do not like using their intelligence beyond a certain bare minimum  level, and maths challenges you to do the same.  One easy way to score good in the exams is to just do the back-book exercises one or two times and hope that the same questions come in the exam, something which people find easy, but the problem lies in the fact that trying to re-create a proof you have already seen and not derived yourself is like trying to explain someone else's doctoral thesis. Whilst you might be able to do an average job, it is next to impossible to explain completely the inspiration, motivation and insight behind the work of another person.   The harder way to do stuff but also the way which would, in the long run definitely enhance the insights you have regarding other questions, is to solve the questions on the spot. The beauty of Maths lies in the fact that even if one does not know anything but the axioms, and some very basic theorems, one can always derive any result desirous to be proven. In that sense maths differentiates itself from others wherein this element of logical deduction is bare minimal and sometimes this is what scares off people. Some people(meaning most people) have a psychological mindset wherein they do not feel comfortable without 'preparing' for an exam. So they often try to apply the strategy used by them towards 'learning' Physics and Chemistry, that is, solving a certain type of questions n number of times and hoping one of these comes.  In conclusion I will just say that all I am trying to imply is that God  gave everyone an equal amount of intelligence, what we choose to do with it depends on us. If we choose to ignore it and summon our other abilities to solve problems (read rote learning), we are basically rusting our beautiful mind, rendering it powerless, and ensuring that we end up finding difficult the subject, which can actually be called the easiest.

The introduction into mathematics is quite simply held. You start with basic logic and then go define what a group is, to get a feeling for abstract concepts and the idea of proofs without something concrete. When you covered the very basic you can start doing more difficult topics but students are comfortable with mathematical thinking by then. Comparitively when you study physics you will have to invest way more time into calculating exercises and doing experiments/documenting them. This will more likely lead you to drop it. People that drop mathematics in the beginning do that largely due to wrong expectations. If you study informatics you will likely have it easy in the beginning if you know basic programming. But as soon as you will go into technical informatics the time you must spent is a lot higher. And for things like economics, you will have to learn a lot more by heart. The math in it is pretty easy but you will have to prepare for more exams quite early into studying. Mathematics is much more relaxed in that way. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a pretty good question that I still can\u2019t answer, but I wonder about. Math capability is distributed very unequally among humans. People who are merely good at it can only gaze in amazement at those who are really good at it. And that extends up several levels, to those few individuals who are so far beyond mortal ken as to be nearly inhuman. Most progress in the past few thousand years of math has occurred as the result of a handful of geniuses. Why nature would endow anyone with math ability, much less make some of them so exceptional, is a mystery. What is the survival value? So many might be excused if they cannot grasp the combined math wisdom of a few dozen geniuses over the past few centuries. Maybe not everybody can deal with Fermat\u2019s last theorem, but the rudiments of arithmetic, algebra, and simple statistics should be pretty accessible to most people. If for no other reason than to learn to think logically, which is in short supply. It is a copout, to me, when I hear a politician or public figure bragging that they don\u2019t understand math. Maybe that buys them street cred, but it is socially irresponsible. Why celebrate ignorance? The biggest gift that humans can give their offspring is the combined wisdom of human civilization, including math, science, history, and political thought. The differences between 21st century life and 14th century life are largely due to engineering and medical advances, derived from science and math. Recognizing that is key to understanding why math is important, and why everybody needs to be exposed to it, to keep progress moving forward. If you can\u2019t handle it, be grateful that there will be others who can. ",

The process turned out to be so monotonous and lifeless that she gave up learning German! Did you notice where my friend had gone wrong? Yes, she failed to capture the basics well. Starting with simple examples and later going on to tougher ones would have been a good strategy for understanding the subject. She thinks, \u201cGerman is so hard\u201d. ",

At certain times in my life (mainly in fifth and sixth grades) I found math easy because the concepts made intuitive sense. The ideas clicked. I could incorporate new ideas in within my existing mathematical framework. At other times in my life, I struggled with math (especially with measure theory, point set topology, and functional analysis). It was because I found the concepts to be too abstruse. They didn\u2019t fit into a clear mental imagery in my head. However, I found the basics of Hilbert Spaces easy to understand, because I could relate their elements to the properties of quantum mechanical wave functions. Maybe if the topics were approached differently they may have made more sense. I keep this in mind when I teach Physics. and try to approach the concepts in multiple ways, always trying to build up from foundational principles, and trying to tie in new ideas with what they have learnt in other contexts e.g. Engineering applications. I also provide external references, encourage the better students to be tutors, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I think because math has pure abstract nurture, in simple terms, Math not just study thing as we see, but investigation, why it look like and allows us to put any object in the group that contains him with any shape, element from this group, and compare him with other things . To explain more,the difference about abstract and non abstract, Suppose you want to build a room you see. non abstract learning can teach you in simple steps how to build this room. However, an abstract method will teach you that the room shape is square and by defining the square area the a^2 by chosen a you control the room size. it also can take you furthermore by let you choose the shapes as you like to some extent. even up higher, until you study Architecture, which allows you to construct any building you visualize, off course will be some constraints, but as you see how abstract learning take you to none limited abilities.therefore will not be easy as you always deal with some you see, not how it looks when it been. Even simple math concept has incredible abstraction stunning. For example, if you put 5 mangoes in the side, and in another side you but 5 Bananas , you we can definitely say these two groups are equal ,because you construct one to one relation between them. The math took you too far by telling you any groups can put in one to on relation are equal, which it can blow your mind if know these two groups are equal 1 2 3 4\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 2 4 6 8\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Because you can obtain the second on by multiple the first one by 2, and this is one to one relation, an so this simple idea has remarkable outcomes. But this abstraction becoming easy, as you study.and also the way they teach math has a lot of downfalls, make it as night mare to many students. However , math with wonderful teaching and understanding is open your eyes to stunning world. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say mathematics is inherently difficult; in a sense, it\u2019s as easy as we can make it. However: It\u2019s rather unintuitive for most people, once you get to more advanced topics, because the abstraction makes it seem quite far removed from everyday experiences. Humans happen to be capable of advanced maths, but it\u2019s a consequence of our general cognitive abilities and not something we faced evolutionary pressure to be specifically good at (unlike, say, recognizing faces and facial expressions, which is an extremely complex task that most of us are good at as a result of evolution). You develop an intuition, but it takes time and effort, and it\u2019s often based on imperfect analogies.Mathematics *research* is difficult, because you\u2019re working at the frontier of human knowledge: nobody else knows the answers, and often nobody even knows what the right questions are. But all research is difficult and mathematics is not exceptional in this regard.Mathematics is highly structured. If you learn it as a haphazard collection of facts and recipes without trying to organize your knowledge, you will quickly get overwhelmed, but if you understand the structure, the raw quantity of information you need to retain is much less. Being forced to remember a deluge of unorganized information up to the limit of your ability, leaving no room for deeper comprehension, is not education but rather a kind of cognitive torture. \u2018Cramming\u2019 may help you pass the next exam, but it does you no favours in the long run.The subject is horribly misrepresented in many countries due to wider cultural problems (with the Anglo-Saxon world being an especially bad example). Maths has an unfortunate reputation in many countries of being uniformly difficult and only something those who are \u2018gifted\u2019 can get to grips with. (You can throw in sexist and racist stereotyping on top of this as to who the \u2018gifted\u2019 people are.) This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as students develop an anxiety around maths which inhibits their ability to learn, causing them to fall further behind what the system expects of them, and so on. Even worse, many of the people *teaching* maths in school suffer from a fear and lack of understanding of maths and pass that on to their students. Worse still, teachers are controlled by a chain of managers going all the way up to government ministers who have even less understanding of maths, and these managers demand that the students be taught a bunch of recipes in order to pass the next exam (which the managers foolishly take as some sort of \u2018benchmark\u2019 of mathematical aptitude).",

The problem is that mathematics gives more direct feedback when you\u2019re wrong. You might think you\u2019re stellar at English or a similar subject when you\u2019re actually quite bad. However, you\u2019re less likely to notice because a lot of methods of testing will allow subjective answers. So you don\u2019t just suck at math. You suck at both, but you\u2019re only aware of your math issue. In general, the people who are good at mathematics have strong verbal skills. This is because part of mathematics is writing precise definitions. Speaking concisely and precisely is the essence of mathematics. It is a language that specializes in removing ambiguity. The problem is that most people aren\u2019t trained well in language. Go to Facebook and find a news article. Look at the comments. I promise you that the majority of people will have either misinterpreted the article or made inferences that weren\u2019t actually supported by the author\u2019s writing. I think you will find that critical reading skills are strongly correlated with mathematical ability. ",

But it does have some vital importance that goes beyond solving a quadratic equation or factoring a polynomial. Math makes you think about how to approach a problem from sometimes different angles. Look for the best solution from the mathematical tools that you have been learning to use. For example, say I give you a quadratic equation to solve. You can1. Factor it.2. Use completing the square.3. Use the quadratic formula.4. Give up! It is too hard!If you were confronted with a life changing decision, would you think about number 4? I hope not! You would try and come up with a solution that may or may not work, that is how life goes sometimes. But you at least tried to figure out how best to approach a problem and did not just throw in the towel. If math is hard for you, try and figure out why. Ask questions and take each problem step by step. ",

            "answer_text": "Performing math of any kind is not inherently more difficult than any other subject, in fact, one could argue that it's easier than something like English or History because for instance in History, your teacher has to like your essay if you want to get an A in that essay. For math, plug some things into your calculator, write something's on your paper, and hey presto! I think the reason why it may be common for more and more kids especially in the United States to be struggling more in math than in other subjects is teachers do a poor job at explaining math in a way that can make sense for each student (especially the teachers who have been plagued with being required to use common core teaching). For instance, I would consider myself much stronger in math and sciences than any other subjects. However, if you and me were in the same chemistry class or calculus class and you asked me how I got a right answer on something you didn't, you might look at me as though I'm crazy. If the ability to visualize math isn't established at a young age, in my opinion, I think anyone will view any math or applied science class they take as a little more difficult at least from the start. While math has steps that work every time, the mental disconnect is what I find people have the most time struggling with. I hope this helped. ",

When a philosophy professor asks the Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms, it\u2019s a little abstract but approachable. You can have a sensible discussion with most people who have decently trained mind. Is there a form for everything? Yes. Really? What about things that don\u2019t or can\u2019t exist, like a unicorn or pink elephant? When a cognitive scientist speaks of how the old, sick and injured perceive, not as a matter of attitude but as a matter of physical perception, that a hill is a greater angle than the young and healthy \u2014 you might wonder how they test or know this but you can understand it. When an astrophysicist speaks on frame dragging of spinning black hole, it might take a bit get people to understand what the implications are but you can kind of get a sense of it. But unless you know the math behind it, you rally can\u2019t make further predictions. The math informs the physics and vice versa. The problem with math is twofold: Math is somewhat like a ladder. If you get stopped at algebra, calculus is out. If you get stopped at calculus, differential equations is out.The level of abstraction \u2014 it\u2019s dealing the with abstract in world where most things have a some sort of corollary.",

            "answer_text": "There is arithmetic and then there is mathematics. We start by leaning how to do things with numbers. Later we start to describe lines on a piece of graph paper with equations like y=x and the paths moving objects take. Then we discover how useful it would be to look at the areas under the lines who's paths we are describing with our line equations or find where the paths turn from going up to going down. After doing that things get really interesting as we start to group equations into different categories and find some of them really difficult to determine any kind of a result. At this stage mathematics becomes more of an art than a science.  It's a beautiful yet rigorous and precise subject that covers planing, engineering, fluid dynamics, simulation, experimental proof, code making and breaking, solving how many combinations does the Rubic cube have and much much more. So one reason that it is so hard to study is because it is has a very large number of subjects that it covers. ",

            "answer_text": "I think part of the problem is the way it is taught, at all levels. If you can think back to when you were 2 or 3 in the kindergarten. You were probably given a toy to experiment with. It would have different shapes like triangles, circles, squares etc. You would also have a tool with a solid form of these shapes. You would naturally try to fit the solid tool into the shapes. Also, you would probably have had a simple jig-saw puzzle of maybe 6 pieces and, with some prompting, manage to fit the pieces together. You were doing mathematics! Fast forward a bit until \u201creal\u201d school starts at about 5 (in England). In the \u201cmathematics\u201d lessons you learnt your times table off by heart (well this was 60+ years ago, maybe now it has changed.) This is NOT mathematics. If you were taught this way, did you understand anything at all about numbers? Can you explain the difference between Roman numbers and the Arab/Indian system we use to-day? Can you write a number as a partial sum? What about conversion between different number bases? At a young age I learnt to read a clock but I had no idea about modular arithmetic until much later. I am not sure if doing a lot of exercises is necessarily the answer. I think a better approach is self (or indeed group) discovery with the teacher acting more as a coach. Obviously the teacher has to impart some knowledge but maybe should not give the answers immediately. For example in an algebra class, the teacher can tell the story of Gauss and finding a simple way to add up consecutive numbers. But then he can ask: what about squares and then, of course, cubes are particular interesting, why? From this he can introduce ideas of linear algebra, calculus and induction. How many times have you seen totally pointless sequence questions? Induction is such an important topic, I think, it should be introduced before the undergraduate stage. I experienced too much of a jump between the always solvable questions of school mathematics and the abstraction of pure maths and the real world problems of applied mathematics. The other difficulty to overcome is the language. There is a standard basic language of mathematics using symbols and words which have special meanings. These change over the years so you need to recognize and understand them. In more advanced topics there seems to be a tendency to create mathematical gobbledygook. I recently tried to read a paper on p-adic numbers but did not understand a single word. Surely it can\u2019t be that difficult. As a software engineer, I used a basically 2-adic number structure for about 35 years! ",

I saw the teacher and I told him I don\u2019t how to construct proofs. I need help. He told me to practice writing proofs that are already in the book and then I will develop a logic.

            "answer_text": "Mathematics (fromGreek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 m\u00e1th\u0113ma, \"knowledge, study, learning\") includes the study of such topics as quantity(number theory) structure(algebra), and change(mathematical analysis) It has no generally accepted definitionMathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry. Rigourous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid \u2018elements. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Pagano(1858\u20131932), David Hilbert(1862\u20131943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century., it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truthby rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissreance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day. Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics(mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later. In 2005, Gallup conducted a poll that asked students to name the school subject that they considered to be the most difficult. Not surprisingly, mathematics came out on top of the difficulty chart. So what is it about math that makes it difficult? Have you ever wondered? This definition gets to the crux of the problem when it comes to math, specifically the statement that a difficult task is one that is not \u201creadily\u201d done. The thing that makes math difficult for many students is that it takes patience and persistence. For many students, math is not something that comes intuitively or automatically - it takes plenty of effort. It is a subject that sometimes requires students to devote lots and lots of time and energy. This means, for many, the problem has little to do with brainpower; it is mostly a matter of staying power. And since students don't make their own timelines when it comes to \"getting it,\" they can run out of time as the teacher moves on to the next topic. Math and Brain Types But there is also an element of brain-style in the big picture, according to many scientists. There will always be opposing views on any topic, and the process of human learning is subject to ongoing debate, just like any other topic. But many theorists believe that people are wired with different math comprehension skills. According to some brain science scholars, logical, left-brain thinkers tend to understand things in sequential bits, while artistic, intuitive, right-brainers are more global. They take in a lot of information at one time and let it \"sink in.\" So left-brain dominant students may grasp concepts quickly while right-brain dominant students don\u2019t. To the right brain dominant student, Math as a Cumulative Discipline Math know-how is cumulative, which means it works much like a stack of building blocks. You have to gain understanding in one area before you can effectively go on to \u201cbuild upon\u201d another area. Our first mathematical building blocks are established in primary school when we learn rules for addition and multiplication, and those first concepts comprise our foundation. The next building blocks come in middle school when students first learn about formulas and operations. This information has to sink in and become \u201cfirm\u201d before students can move on to enlarge this framework of knowledge. The big problem starts to appear sometime between middle school and high school because students very often move on to a new grade or new subject before they\u2019re really ready. Students who earn a \u201cC\u201d in middle school have absorbed and understood about half of what they should, but they move on anyway. They move on or are moved on, because They think a C is good enough.Parents don\u2019t realize that moving on without a full understanding poses a big problem for high school and college.Teachers don\u2019t have time and energy enough to ensure that every single student understands every single concept.So students move to the next level with a really shaky foundation. The outcome of any shaky foundation is that there will be a serious limitation when it comes to building and real potential for complete failure at some point. The lesson here? Any student who receives a C in a math class should review heavily to make sure to pick up concepts they'll need later. In fact, it is smart to hire a tutor to help you review any time you find that you have struggled in a math class. Making Math Less Difficult We have established a few things when it comes to math and difficulty: Math seems difficult because it takes time and energy.Many people don't experience sufficient time to \"get\" math lessons, and they fall behind as the teacher moves on.Many move on to study more complex concepts with a shaky foundation.We often end up with a weak structure that is doomed to collapse at some point.Although this may sound like bad news, it is really good news. The fix is pretty easy if we\u2019re patient enough! No matter where you are in your math studies, you can excel if you backtrack far enough to reinforce your foundation. You must fill in the holes with a deep understanding of the basic concepts you encountered in middle school math. If you\u2019re in middle school right now, do not attempt to move on until you understand pre-algebra concepts fully. Get a tutor if necessary.If you\u2019re in high school and struggling with math, download a middle school math syllabus or hire a tutor. Make sure you understand every single concept and activity that is covered in middle grades.If you\u2019re in college, backtrack all the way to basic math and work forward. This won\u2019t take as long as it sounds. You can work forward through years of math in a week or two.No matter where you start and where you struggle, you must make sure you acknowledge any weak spots in your foundation and fill the holes with practice and understanding!

            "answer_text": "It is tough because it is being perceived to be tough. Actually, it is not so.  Mathematics is a bit different from languages. It requires application of logic in a broader sense. Some things have to be memorized in mathematics, and some need logical deduction.  Many mathematics teachers find it to be difficult to teach it. It is because it is not just enough for the teacher to teach the theory and formulas but also enable the students to apply them in many possible ways.The second part is tricky and because of this, the  proficiency of students in mathematics is seen to be less than than the average. So, a perception of mathematics being tough is spread. That's why Mathematics is so tough.(This was what I observed around me.) Another reason: This is from my experience. I do maths well. But I was not that good in languages. Or in Chemistry and Biology. I observed many classmates in my school do better than me in languages but fail to catch up with me in Maths and Physics. This told me that it depends on the person's ability. Some are better at memorizing things and others are good at application part. So, it is natural for some to feel mathematics to be easy and others, the other way round. But there is good news. I am again sharing my experience from my JEE preparation time. At that time, I found Physics to be easier to learn than the rest. The portion of mathematics that requires more logic was easy for me and I mastered those. But the memorizing chapters and chemistry posed a problem. I found out that my coaching institute teaches way more than what is required for JEE. So, I struck to the basics, the board textbooks. I started learning concepts one by one, took time to understand each concept, practiced till I felt comfortable and was, of course patient. At the end, I scored 113 marks in Physics and 109 marks each in mathematics and chemistry, totaling to 331/504 in the JEE, which is a relatively good total. I found out my strategy worked. That is to get grip on the basics, focusing on application of those basics, revising the basics time to time and writing the exam with a cool head.(I'm writing this para because I feel the question is asked on keeping exams in mind)     Conclusion: Mathematics is tough, unless  You are confident of yourself achieving what you want to.You make effort in the right path (like working according to a plan and revising frequently).You get to be thorough with the fundamentals.You practice by applying what you learnt with a calm mind, as practice makes one perfect.And importantly, You start believing that mathematics is not tough but important to life.

Everyone should have the experience of producing a bit of perfection, at least briefly.Math teaches logical reasoning more effectively than other subjects teach it.

That is to say, whatever you\u2019ve mastered, there\u2019s another level of understanding that extends and generalizes what you\u2019ve mastered. And once you\u2019ve mastered that, there\u2019s another level lying in wait. Then another, and another, and another. Eventually, you\u2019ll run up against your limits (!) and mathematics will become hard\u2014not in the same way that learning to juggle is hard (but doable), but spend-your-whole-life, succeed-one-time-out-of-three (if you\u2019re lucky), will-retire-without-having-proven-that-last-thing hard. That\u2019s why mathematicians think it\u2019s hard. Because you follow the White Rabbit in, and you never ever catch up. ",

I always liked doing stuff out of the box and not just mugging the entire thing up, which automatically makes me interested in Physics. And if it is tough for you, then it is just the frusture that you don't get the answer in 15 minutes. But I'm sure that you must be good in Biology, Chemistry etc. If you want to develop it, then try solving riddles and not particular G.K. stuff. Well, that is like the easiest but indirect way of doing it although you can just solve super tough questions and aim that you have to complete it today. Also that I'm cool in math. ",

Really, Mathematics has beauty in its own way. You don't have to memorize anything in it (Though many people say that Mathematics is full of formulas, which cannot be derived,  and one has to memorize each and every one of them). Well, if you ever met fools like them, just let them be fools. Even facts do have derivations in mathematics. Such is the beauty of subject. Another thing is that one has to only know which chapter he/she is reading, and the rest is the rest. For me, I have never ever read a chapter completely, don't know formulas as fluent as my other friends, but still score better than them in exams. Remember a thing: don't study, read or do mathematics, just play with it, and you would know in no time the beauty it possess. Mathematics has the ability to be your best friend, provided you play well with it. By the way,some topics need a bit more playing, like integral calculus. Whatever may be, never let your mind deceive you that you are studying or doing mathematics.   ",

Math is all about taking tangible object and creating abstract symbols to represent the physical world. Some people just have a hard time mentally converting the objects and symbols. Another basis of math is simply puzzle solving and pattern recognition. Those symbols that are created from things like number of apples in a bushel can be moved around to find patterns in relation to other things. Some people just aren't good at puzzles and patterns. To actually answer your question I think there are people who struggle with these things aND are vocal about their struggles. The second half is how it is taught. For 99 % of the population math should be taught from an applied perspective. If it is taught from too abstract standpoint then it turns a lot of people off. ",

Moreover, he knew when and where to apply this. How did he got this? By practising. When you will solve a sum wrong, two times, three times, you failed. But, you got three ways that doesn't works, thats the achievement. Next, time you try the problem, you will have different approach for solving. Maths needs patience and concentration. Rather than working seriously, try working sincerely. Most, people lack solving skill because of their poor basics. Now, if a 10 standard student says \"I don't know how to solve a fraction\", Obviously he will find diificulty in learning maths.Conclusion, to get maths- BasicsYour ApproachPractice",

When solving a calculation problem in algebra a mistake anywhere along the way will (most likely) give the wrong answer. If you are constructing a proof for a theorem every single step needs to follow logically with nothing overlooked. A great deal of both analytical and creative skills are needed for mathematical research. However, this is also the thing that makes mathematics so great. There is no ambiguity. If an argument is known to be correct then the opposing view doesn\u2019t need to be considered much. Compare this to fields like psychology, sociology, or politics. I find these much more difficult.

Something I see a lot is kids trying to memorise formulae and equations, without actually understanding what it means, and why it gives you the answer it does. Similarly, the use of calculators, not fully understanding what some of the inputs/functions do. Is there any areas in maths that you're struggling with? If so, I'd suggest reading up on it - grasp a deeper understanding of it. If it's Trigonometry, research what Sine, Cosine & Tangent actually are.Another issue may be a lack of interest in the subject. I find it difficult to study an in-depth topic if you don't have a refined interest in it. Exams are mostly memory tests and application of said knowledge, but in order to not forget what you've just learnt in class, make sure you 100% understand it. Ask questions if you have to, even if there's one lingering question, ask it.As 'difficult' is an adjective, it is based on perception, different for everybody. Anyone can do it, just some people understand things quicker than others.Just don't give up, and keep persevering. You'll get there in the end. ",

Madanayake (\u201cRavi\u201d) thinks: - Is it because Mathematics is NEITHER Totally Abstract or Hypothetical NOR Totally Concrete or \"Real\" ???????  If you look at the Very Basics of OTHER subjects;  Botany : Just look at a tree or plant, it has roots, a trunk, leaves and maybe flowers or some reproductive organs - all of these can be seen, felt, smelt, maybe tasted, and if shaken fast one could hear the sound of the plant shaking - all sensitive to the five sense perception.  Zoology : An animal, it has sense organs, limbs (legs, fins, wings and maybe a tail) maybe a head (if it is Not a microbe) - again all within the five sense perception.  Chemistry : Strike a match, and see it burn into Ash, you can See and probably also feel that there is a change in the properties of the starting material and the final product.  Physics : Light can be seen, Sound can be heard, Heat / Cold can be felt while Gravity, Magnetism and Electricity all have byproduct Fields which can exert forces on our Human Body, so that we can Feel them in some way or the other.  Computer / IT - We can press the mouse / touchpad or keys, and usually there is a Tangible Output to a Monitor or some other output device  But MATHEMATICS ??????? From the time we say 1,2,3, aren't we Already dealing with Abstract Concepts ? Therefore All operations starting from these Counting Numbers \"Have to Be Abstract,\" (I think) since those operations deal with Abstract Operands.  But, a number of these basic concepts could be Demonstrated using \"Real World\" \"Substances and Objects\". This is where the REAL or CONCRETE part of Mathematics comes in (Not the Operators or Operands themselves, but what they are based on).  (so) I like to call MATHEMATICS, the META-DATA of the Universe !!!!!!!!  Albert Einstein is supposed to have said this about Mathematics, \"So far as the theories of mathematics are about reality, they are not certain; so far as they are certain, they are not about reality.\"  For more of his quotes on Maths, please refer:- http://www. kidsmathgamesonline.com/facts/ einsteinmathquotes.html For \"Albert Einstein Math Quotes\"  (I hope other list members including our Senior Academic Staff will use this mail to contribute more, so we would understand \"What the Hell is Mathematics Really ???????\"  Best Regards, Ravi.

            "answer_text": "Most subjects work from general rules to specific examples. You dig deeper in a particular topic as you proceed in your study path. But mathematics works the other way around. Starting from the concept of positive integers, to negative integers, to fractions, to irrational numbers, and to complex numbers, you generalize the definition and conceptualize something that doesn't exist before. The definition of addition is also generalized by the associative and commutative properties. But why these properties? Why are they important? Why not extract the others? This is the reason that mathematics is deemed abstract. It takes creativity and imagination to study mathematics, rather than technical skills as most people think. Time and efforts do not necessarily give progress, which qualifies difficult in many sense. ",

That being said, you can get by in life without ever having to perform ballet.  You are confronted with some degree of math every day. 99.9% of people can do some math basic math (addition, subtraction - maybe multiplication) with a decent amount of proficiency.   However, just like any discipline, natural talent is only going to take 99.9% of people so far. You have to learn from mentors and practice diligently at your craft.  I took Calculus in College and I couldn't complete one of those equations now.  Just like I can no longer read the Kanji from my College Japanese courses.   Besides, if you see variable or the lovely \"i\" hanging around some numbers, it can make you a little nervous. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, Mathematics is not that hard. It\u2019s possible that you have an average or below-average teacher. The problem with this is if you were not taught proper basics in grades 1\u20135, you will struggle your entire life and still find it difficult. If you feel like Math is hard, take a step back. Start from the last grade Math that you studied. If you find that hard, start from two grades prior. Do this exercise and you will figure out what you have difficulty with. I promise this will change your perspective. I struggled with Math until grade-9, after that, it was my best subject. Thanks to an excellent teacher and mentor. If anything, Math is easier than other subjects. Think about it. In Math, you only have one trivial answer, either right or wrong. There are no feelings or speculations involved. The calculations are clear and there are only a few methods to reach a conclusion. Hope this answer helped. Cheers. _FF ",

So if u start liking maths too then automatically u will get interest n feel like to study it. So if u like something then u will automattically get interest n u feel it very easy . To actually say maths is easy than other subjects because in other subjects we should remember a lot of stuff.But in maths if u remember the method that\u2019s it,it is more than enough.U should have special interest on maths n this doesn\u2019t mean I am saying other subjects u should ignore.U should have special interest on them also . To make maths an easy subject first like it otherwise it\u2019s waste.Practice maths atleast 1 to 2 hrs if u r in school age because u have to study other subjects also n if u r doing any special degree on maths then u have to spend a lot of time on it.First the main point is concentration.Without concentration nothing we can do.Instead of wasting time u study n instead of wasting money u buy some books related to that subject u feel difficult n try to read n understand it once then u might feel that subject much more easy.

Then why do some people feel it tough to crack ? Just like any other subject,maths takes time to understand.Some people ignore this and end up studying only before the exams. Results will be bad.Period.After this they start believing that maths is tough.  Yeah. Compared to humanities and sciences,maths uses more analytical and reasoning part of your brain.Its true.But its easier once you get a grip on it,unlike humanities,which require great memory and other skills. There are some who believe maths is tough because they have heard it from many people and develop a fear for maths. If you want to build a good grip on basic mathematics, start with the geometry theorems,numbers ,arithmetic calculations and algebra. When understand the concepts like geometry passionately, you will be surprised to see the rules of the figures in nature and may become more curious or obsessive.           ",

It is possible that you have fundamental difficulties with symbolic logic (such as that which is used in algebra), and that is totally fine. With a good tutor and access to top-notch online resources you can overcome this difficulty, and still be good enough at math that you can do what you want in the real world, be it engineering or physics or law or business. But if you are struggling to understand why you are doing what the hell you are doing, then you are not truly understanding what is going on behind the scene with all the mathematical machinery, and you are not alone. Math is a powerful lens through which we may analyze and create, and if you read between the fine lines you will see that reality is inscribed in the language of mathematics (and in many different dialects of mathematics!) So take the time to truly understand why your teacher and textbooks define things the way they do, and you can literally wield math like a sword. Who said that only they have a monopoly on math? The greatest mathematicians in history never accepted what they were told as fact; they either had an intuitive understanding of what was going on, or forced themselves to gain such an intuition all on their own!

I\u2019ve never gotten a score of more than 85% on any essay I\u2019ve written in school and college. I actually consider mathematics to be the easiest subject to score well in overall since one\u2019s math grade is based on whether or not they correctly solve a problem, whereas one\u2019s English grade is often based on a teacher\u2019s opinion of the student\u2019s essays.

Now there are amazing people in math that get things so quick and so good beyond our ability as normal humans I guess.  The rest simply work at it.  To be good in math.  Understand the concepts.  In other words question every little thing.  I mean everything.  Even whatever is on your book.  If its a theorem and they prove it, then follow the proof and understand if it is true.

If you go to a higher level, you will find it difficult as well. It is true for any field of study, and math is not an exception. However, I have to admit that math does have some aspects that make it different, which may challenge the learners.  First, math is full of abstraction and is not easy to connect to your real life. You can somehow relate the Newton's Second Law to what you usually see, but solving a quadratic function in your daily life (except at work) is something unlikely to happen.

            "answer_text": "Mathematics uses explicit and precise rules, definitions, and structures. There is no wiggle room. Either a=b or it doesn\u2019t. If you are used to discussions where you can sway people to your way of thinking about a book or a philosophy, then these will not work in mathematics. English words can have several different meanings or shades of meanings, but mathematics has very set definitions for words. You can change the definition but then the mathematical system you are working in will change, which means you won\u2019t be able to work in the old system unless you change back. If you can think this way, you will find mathematics easy; if not, then you will continually have trouble. ",

They get 10 GCSE's at grade A* Other people are lucky to inherited a brain that is good at languages but no good at maths. Some people have inherited brains with a poor ability to remember any subject. This is not their fault as it was what they inherited and had no control over this. They need to learn at a much slower rate than lucky people. They can learn just as much and be good at maths if they try hard and carry on until they master mathematics. So if you think Maths is hard you are probably good at languages. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, in many cases, it is because teachers aren't paid enough. [This applies to most other subjects too - not just math.] The people who really are masters in math, they often choose a higher paying job. In other words, those who are left teaching aren't very good a math. In Finland, teaching is regarded as a high-status job, with good wages, and requires a university-degree. In other countries (including Denmark where I'm from), teaching is regarded as a low-status job (\"Anyone can be a teacher.\"). But this is so wrong. To teach a subject, you need to be able to master it from all angles, and you need to be able to explain to and engage your students.  Ask your teacher, what he/she likes about math? Why he/she likes math? What gives him/her a thrill? Why he/she chose to become a teacher? Read more here: Page on maa.org ",

All other subjects can be passed in by rote learning and maths require attention which a student ( who find maths hard .) doesn't pay much .A student cannot find real - life uses of some concepts. Factorising polynomials just for the sake of it makes the child think \u201c Will I use it in actual life ?\u201dMaths require practice , trust me , I speak this by experience. Students get demotivated when they do not find the solution at the first try and think \u201c XYZ student of my class can do it in 1 try , why can't ?\u201d Well , EVERY CHILD IS UNIQUE.During exam , read a question at least 2 times before solving it , this makes the question easier.PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I was also weak in maths , I failed the class 3 exams , but now I'm in class 9th amd I got 100 in maths thanks to my late father , who taught me maths and told me to practice it.",

Mathematics have an stigma since they require a different sort of thinking which involves abstract reasoning to derive conclusions from facts. In my experience, it is not hare although it may be tiring; it can be seen as learning a foreign language. But answering to your question, studying maths means breaking down a concept and absrobing it and in the end, being able to apply it to a number of different situations creatively and that is what makes them so daunting. In school we cannot be thought to think creative and I doubt that it is possible to be learnt. No matter what level of studies you have, what you have to bear in mind is that effort is what will provide results. ",

If you have trouble with your arithmetic (multiplication and fractions, etc) expect to find difficulty in algebra. Also, too many people just struggle with algebra! If you don\u2019t fully understand algebra, you are BOUND to struggle in calculus or trigonometry or algebra 2. It\u2019s really tragic. Math is compounding.

As much we go in depth of maths it will look that much simple even this is a only subject where all things are proved and no exception works. So if we are in love with the subject we don't have to learn it, once it practiced will be with us lifetime, without maths we can't imagine the world of science and other subject even we cant imagine our score cards without numbers.

If it wasn\u2019t hard then no \u201cah-ha\u201d and really very little joy. It is impossible to appreciate the beauty and the elegance of mathematics unless you can appreciate the difficulty.

For example, if it takes you any effort at all to multiply 1-digit numbers, it will take you much longer to learn how to factor or multiply equations like (x + 3)(x - 5), which in turn makes it much more difficult to do Calculus, etc.  So if you're having a hard time with some part of Math, check how easily and intuitively you can answer problems from the previous year's material. Getting to the point where that's as easy as 1+2 = 3 is necessary for learning the next step. ",

Visualization comes from the everyday experience Another major contributor to the difficulty of mathematics is lack of innovation in conventional system of teaching. Our education system works on rote methodology Mathematics does not work that way. It works on logic. Math is hard only for those who feels it is difficult to understand once you focused on it it makes so simple so never feel it is hard ",

I think its difficult in some concepts and easy in others I tkink it can be hard if your not 100% devoted to learning it, honestly. I think it can be easy to make yourself feel stupid when doing math, because it just messes with you. When you don't understand what your doing, when others find what your struggling with easy, etc. Its hard, but you got to brave through it. If you find it hard, then make it easy. Learn the material, understand it, and then ace it. If you find it easy, don't start thinking high of yourself, and keep revising that unit. Also, if its something you don't struggle with, help others who do have a hard time with it. That will be reviewing your knowledge, and helping them learn and not go through the same feelings, I guess. Personally, I despise math. You have no idea how many times I have cried over a stupid question, or got mad at myself for making a mistake, but you grow up and learn. Just remember that every mistake is an opportunity to learn. Got a question wrong on a test, now you wont get it wrong the next time. Just remember that you are you, and math is math. Don't let it ruin your life. ",

For me , maths is like a source to unlock all the mysteries of the universe. Maths seems difficult to those who finds it difficult. Actually it's very simple. Just what is needed is pure attention. With complete attention , one can do wonders. You'll not believe that maths is as simple as learning alphabets. I just wanna advice you that don't cram anything in maths. Maths is not at all about craming. If you want to be called as a master in maths then\u2026\u2026you need to follow my advice. Another advice\u2026..If you are not able to solve a maths question at once\u2026\u2026just try it twice\u2026.thrice\u2026.. continue solving and I assure you that you will surely get the answer. \u201c Try try but never cry\u201d .

Here are the examples(that i didn\u2019t know till 11th class starting) x>0 , y<1 so solve x=y-2 \u2014\u2014\u2014 so in this i used to ignore these(x>0,y<1) all which made me incapable of solving the solution or getting the right logic/confident about the question.(x+2)/x-1 , so i used to write it as (x+2)/x minus (x+2)/1And believe or not i was not able to solve algebra questions , ex= 3x-45y-24y.y=36 and 43x-32y+43y.y=54 , so now solve for x and y. I could not able to solve just bcuz that i was not clear with basic algebra rules(+ +=+ , + -=- etc)There are lots of left to tell.So finally u have to clear your basics . When u clear your basics then u will get confident of solving questions and most imp that your understanding logic will gonna be developed. ",

Instead of this you are finding maths a very difficult subject you can follow this step to solve mathematical problems: 1st -Read the question very carefully 2nd-Find what the question is telling 3rd-Decide that how to solve this sum(In this step you have to be careful because this is very important step because if this step becomes wrong whole sum will be wrong) 4th-Now you have to solve the sum 5th -Last step is to check the sum.

In my opinion, this is one of the biggest obstacles in mathematics that easily generate dropouts in calculus classes (this opinion is based on my teaching assistant experiences). In order to avoid this difficulty, some experts created calculus without limits. This subject is known as quantum calculus, and there\u2019s a good textbook about this area by Kac-Cheung published by Springer. But please do NOT go too far to turn back. If you try to reach the core of quantum calculus, you have to study about quantum groups, a very technical and complicated topic (generally, all mathematical subjects are created to be complicated if you go deeply into it).

I've worked with a few young people to help them get back on track with math.  So far, I haven't worked with any who truly are beyond help.   There are some few people who have math learning disabilities, along the lines of reading disabilities.

I can do arithmetic, of course, estimate totals and simplify a basic algebraic equation so I\u2019m not a complete innumerate, but I can\u2019t do much more than that. First, my early education in math was later than my reading, by about two years. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but they were formative years. I started learning to read at four, and still consider myself an excellent reader. Math, not so much. Second, I was not taught math sense. I memorized the multiplication table, I memorized theorems, I solved equations. Back in those days you did every operation by hand, even multiplication/division within a larger problem. Which leads me to the third part. Third, math problems (as I learned them) had multiple steps to reach only one possible right answer. Forget to carry a one and I get the wrong answer even when the greater process, which I struggled with, was done right. Negative reinforcement\u2014math was disappointment, and it felt unfair. English I had multiple ways to communicate a concept\u2014a functional way, a good way, an elegant way, a baroque way, and they were all correct. Math there was only one answer, and you had to be perfect or you were WRONG. Math never felt right. ",

The reason could be you are good at theoretical parts. If you would start with the basic numerical problem, solve the same question many number of times till you get your mind use to it. Do not think you are getting wrong answers every time , just be focused that i have now known many ways that i will not not be repeating next time when i will be covering the same topic. Start with the basic problems, ask your teachers to explain in a simplified way, you can go through YouTube tutorials for better understanding. Sit with your classmates and solve it together, you will learn better. Come back home, relax for few hours, get back to it.Revise your formulas and theorems quickly and start improving.  ",

No unnecessary and irrelevant cramming , just a fusion of pure logic and concepts. And that's why unlike other subjects , one cannot excel mathematics merely by spoon feeding! It demands involvement of the intellect. (Logical approach and reasoning)The correct approach to crack the question. (Application of concepts)And of course the will power to try and try until you make the fear of maths fear you. So , believe in your potential and the power of maths. Start facing the monster of maths rather than escaping! And I am sure , soon you will start loving maths. All the best , friend. :) ",

This is all before you get to doing the problems, lots and lots of problems, including word problems. ",

They can study it for years, but beyond basic computation it really doesn\u2019t tie in with life or work, unless they are a mathematics professor. Even engineers, architects and actuaries hone in on specific skills and do not use all that they have been taught to get their degrees. I once asked a high school math instructor for a example of when someone would use a quadratic formula in the real world, and she couldn\u2019t give me one. Some people prefer the logical basis of mathematics and continue to learn it because they find it easy. Others see it as a set of artificial rules that are not particularly useful. They prefer rather to learn language or psychology which are more useful dealing with people. After all people are not completely logical. ",

I have spent the majority of my career in Computer Science, with a focus in financial services and mathematics. I love every day of it. I can't imagine doing anything that would make me happier. For anyone serious about learning math it is certainly nice if you're teacher loves it as well.

From my point of view Mathematics was the easiest subject of all during 11th and 12th when compared to Physics, Chemistry, Biology and PE (hm hm yes \u201cPhysical Education\u201d, since my teacher made whole class to run 12 Laps of 800m track every week and also it was in Hindi\u2026LOL). I think a person finds Mathematics difficult when he/she lacks the basic knowledge or imaginations in order to solve a math problem. You can solve maths questions upto an extend by applying or performing certain procedures (like finding roots of quadratic equations and other formula based questions) but, after a period like in my case currently in 3rd Sem BTech, mathematics is on a whole different level and you can't just solve any questions just based on formulae, it requires pure understandings of the concept and a mind that doesn't gets frustrated when you can't solve even a single question\u2026\u2026 Anyway the point is just study regularly and try to understand the concepts, and if you can't understand any question \u201cnever hesitate to ask for help from friends, teachers, anyone whom you think that he/she is better in maths than you, you can ask me too(^^)\u201d\u2026..

If you tell someone they are good at something enough times, chances are, they will believe it. You may have a natural aptitude for say, art and drawing. But if that aptitude is not nurtured, well, then you will never live up to that potential. I can\u2019t draw worth shite - but I know if I spent 10 000 hours just drawing and learning drawing techniques, I would become great at drawing. Same thing with cooking, with gaming, and with math.

Don't hesitate, first of all learn tables from 1-20, squares upto 50 and cube upto 20, square roots upto 20 and practise multiplication, division, L.C.M and H.C.F as much as you can. Try to understand basic algebra and basics of shapes for geometry(triangles, quadrilaterals, circles). It will boost your confidence.

When I was in my 9th standard I used to be punish by my math teacher everyday. I was thinking why the hell math subject was created. Till my 10th standard I was thinking math is very difficult subject and started making distance with it. I would have been very happy after solving a simple question from unsolved papers. Anyhow I managed to score passing marks in Board. When I came in 11th standard. I joined a Math coaching which was my best decision that time. Firstly I started to go with solved examples and then with unsolved problems. So before going to coaching I used to solve the question which my teacher supposed to explain. Hence I was able to answer the question easily when my coaching teacher asks. My interest in Math started increasing. So I had done hard work with full dedication and within months I became bright student of mathematics in the class (Only in mathematics) :P Mathematics became my favorite subject and started loving to solve problems. And finally I scored highest marks in Mathematics in my district. So coming to question - People set up their mind that Math is very difficult to understand like what I did that time. And they started making distance with it rather come up to closer and tackle from it. Until and unless you give time in solving problems things would be difficult. Mathematics is all about the patience, you have to live longer with the problems. Good mathematics is not about how many answers you know, It\u2019s how you behave when you don\u2019t know. Thanks !!

This can only be understood once you start enjoying it. For instance: We all must have seen a dancer performing a hip hop or classical dance form, everyone praises the performance and think it is difficult but for them, it is easy and enjoyable. Similarly, anyone who enjoys mathematics finds it simple. Start enjoying things and eventually you will find it easy and simple. Also, students tend to forget concepts or things related to a particular topic, which Mathematics does not allow them to do so. One has to be regular with concepts and practice. These are a few major reasons, students find mathematics difficult. Rest it varies from student to student. So, start enjoying the maths and be Regular with it.

You see, some fields in life (namely the social sciences) are mostly about remembering and memorizing stuff. While in science, we use lots of math, because math is the language of the world. Math evolves around logic, and claims. So you're like a detective trying to solve (prove) mysteries using initial clues. This process utilizes all the logic, creativity, hard work and focus you have. And of course, one small calculation mistake or one unclear - which turns to +, and it's all ruined. People don't appreciate math enough. ",

Sure, you have the maths geniuses who can breeze through most of the problems, but even they need to practice solving problems from time to time. Here on Charles University, even people who are mediocre in maths can graduate the uni. The difference is, they need much more practice to be on the same level with those who are natural talents in maths. The only reason you can fail at class is when you\u00b4re so untalented that you\u00b4d have to practice so much it wouldn\u00b4t be humanly possible.\u201d To answer your question: that depends on how talented you are at maths. If very, it\u00b4s much easier than when you\u00b4re not (duh), but you can still manage with hard work. I need to add that I haven\u00b4t studied maths, and this is only relayed from people who did.

I also liked that an answer in maths was right or wrong rather than may be or shades of right. Early on in school, you are basically learning aritmetic and possibly spatial awareness. As you progress concepts become more abstract but they are all based on logic so in 99% cases a good teacher will ensure you understand. Of course eventually the right / wrong dochotomy changes. In stats, some hypothesis might be true with a certainty of 95% so no longer black or white. ",

It is because we are human beings and human beings tend to stay in our comfort zone, not willing to make an extra effort unless it is extremely necessary.  Understanding Mathematics is a skill and does not come natural for everybody as well as not everybody has the ability to run a Marathon and win it.  In order to become good in Mathematics, as any other skill, it has to be inherent to you, meaning that you must have a higher level of ability to learn it than average people and once you realize that you are good in Math, you need to get out of the comfort zone and practice it in order to master it to higher levels.

And the problems they give you in school can feel boring and repetitive. And most people need to know little math to get by in life. Math can teach you to think logically, and help with problem solving thinking. If you value the logic in math, you may learn to value the truth in life, and value facts over unsubstantiated opinion. This can be a good thing, or annoying\u2026but that\u2019s a long discussion :) Math can be beautiful for some, like myself. It\u2019s pleasant to work with math problems where the answer isn\u2019t about opinion like politics. Our universe is ruled by forces which can be understood through math. And there\u2019s surprising patterns in math, like mandlebrodt sets, or how the series 1+2+3+\u2026 can be shown to equal -1/12, which seems insane and meaningless, yet has some connections to physics. The problem with math is in some cases, you have to work your way up to and through some higher college level classes before some of the more interesting math is revealed, yet very few people will ever go that far in math. But there\u2019s lot of recreational math, and youtube videos showing interesting math stuff explained so that a lot of people can understand some of the interesting ideas, like numberphile. ",

You are either good at maths or you are bad at it. There is no middle ground. This is the thing about maths that makes it tougher than many other subjects. Even when you think about it examination wise, you either get full marks for a problem or get zero. This risk sometimes makes students scared of it.

Two variables give two answers. But worst is to come when quadratics give usually two results. Sometimes the same one and sometimes none at all. What gives? By the time you advance into the 6th form (year 12) you find out about complex numbers? And there is you thinking numbers were already complex enough. Oddly the education system breaks the teaching of mathematics down to the extent that every new complication is only one step up from the last. Get your foundations right and the stairs are not so hard to climb. You might even get good enough to take a degree in pure mathematics and get your mind blown away. ",

I am useless at maths unless it add, subtract, divide and multiply. Show me 1/4, 1/8 etc and ask me to work with them and I'm toast! Likewise with geometry and algebra, both of which subjects at school, I spent reading a book under the desk. English, history, geography - all those subjects are wonderful!  I strongly suspect that Shulamit has the right of it. When I was in primary school back in the 1950s, every Friday afternoon, we had to add up columns of figures and jump to our feet when we finished. This turned it into a competition and I couldn't do it as fast as the others. finally I stood up when I knew I had a wrong answer. The teacher knew I was wrong, so she got up, same to my desk and belted me, for what seemed like five minutes, over my knuckles with the edge of a heavy wooden ruler.   Even though I had trouble then, 60 years later, I can still add figures up in my head faster than many kids with a calculator. So, pity I didn't have someone like Shulamit for a teacher!!! ",

They don't understand from where to start and what to follow . Also some blame can be put on the teachers for lack of teaching skills.

IT IS NOT INHERENTLY DIFFICULT\u2014THAT IS AN ILLUSION. It\u2019s being taught by people who don\u2019t really care about it, and the students assume that attitude and begin to hate it themselves. It is a cycle of abuse that has yet to be interrupted. It\u2019s such a widely hated subject that there\u2019s an entire culture and narrative of questioning its very use, when essentially everything modern society enjoys in terms of technology and leisure would not have been possible without someone spending lots of time doing mathematics.

Much of this processing, of course, is subconscious and automatic, as conscious (IQ-type) thinking is limited in it\u2019s bandwidth. Being good at Math requires intuition to be developed. And practice helps build intuition, but some people have very fast brains (at least in certain phases of development) and will naturally develop intuition faster, and have more prominent peaks in mathematical intuition (and other fields).

Believe me, take interest in it and practise it daily, I bet the day wont be far when it shall be your favorite subject. Most importantly dont solve tough problems directly. Solve very easy questions and then increase the difficulty daily. I also went through such a phase in my life. When I was in Class IV, I used to feel math difficult. By rigorous practice it\u2019s now my favorite subject. Honestly speaking, it is quite interesting and enjoying subject. ",

As I am one of the example , in the initial days I was also a bit weak in mathematics and not able to perform well but when I started understanding the subject with concentration I started improving when I was in 11 th standard , there was a time when I was so sure that I could anyhow solve every problem that came to me and became very friendly with the subject that I love it and became excited whenever I heard anything about mathematics. At last , I just wanna say that you might became excellent in any subject if you started changing your perception about it. ",

Math requires a lot of memorization, you at the very least need to know where to find specific formulas, plus the basic \u201ctimes table\u201d. Some people find everyday math hard, some don't even realize how much math is used in everyday life. That math is easy to most. Oddly enough, that also happens to be the same math people thought was so hard in grade school. ",

The more time you spend, the better you will get at it. Nobody was born a mathematican or an Einstien. So there is no secret to it. Atleast no short cut. But you may definetly want to look into many more ways to learn maths- it is not just in books, have fun with it. Donot just keep solving sums, find them in routine life and try to find your theories in them. Make playcards, do group studies, never mind getting a wrong answer when you are practising, just keep at it till you get the method. Hope this will help! ",

For example, Lockhart says \"A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns.\" I would offer that mathematics is the study of what \"proceeds\" by definition alone (logical consequences), and that those definitions are asserted by the mathematician herself (hence being the \"maker\" of patterns). This may be very different to \"most\" people's experience, which I would argue is actually how to do computation, rather than practice mathematics (the two are related of course; a computation is correct in virtue of the axioms and theorems of the theory it is responsible to).

One chapter will be on numbers line, then angles, then ratios, then average, then fractions, ... 4. For other subjects, you don't have to worry about all the chapters.

It is the improper introduction of maths that leaves many children with a lifelong aversion for the subject. Maths is often very poorly taught by us teachers, who themselves don\u2019t have a strong passion or a deep appreciation for it. Most of us focus on and cater to the question \u201cWhat\u201d? and by doing so we conveniently avoid and ignore the fundamental question which is \u201cWHY\u201d? Also, the books in mathematics are generally written from the mathematician\u2019s perspective. The beauty and spirit of mathematics are indeed in its freedom and abstraction but a child at an early age isn\u2019t expected to understand it. Often, which is almost always, it is left to the students to comprehend the real-life applications of mathematics and somehow find beauty and joy in it, on their own. In words of acclaimed Indian mathematician, Shakuntala Devi students abhor maths because of the wrong approach and because it is looked as a subject. The intimidating, imagination less, uninteresting computation exercises and formula-based learning that go by the name of math is a horrible experience for the students. And when they struggle, they begin to dread math, and eventually, we lose thousands of students who could be the scientists and engineers of tomorrow. If we reflect and take more time to ground them in the basics, we can turn them on to maths. ",

And your  theory is perfect..basically I'm not so good in maths Bt thereafter my results in maths...In 12th -94\\100 So ultimately maths is easy when you do it happily...And also you have to conquer that fear about maths...!!!

Start converting any math's problem into a competition b/w you fellow students or friends. My idea of why people find Maths difficult is the continously changing basic concepts and formulas. In each and every grade, we have a maths book which is mostly thicker than any other subjects'. And then comes the content. Unit wise, all concepts, formulas, basics change and as soon as we face any issue that we try hard but don't understand, we start thinking maths is out of our league. But that's my friends, is where we are wrong. What that situation need is a little more push. And if, by chance, you are able to tackle that issue by yourself then that concept would be the one that you remember for comparatively longer time than any other concept that you understood when someone taught you. If you just grab the root of the problem keep moving steady you will surely reach the solution. ",
