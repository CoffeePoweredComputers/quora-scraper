            "answer_text": "Prime factorization theorem also called fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every number greater than 1 is either a prime or can be factored as product of primes in unique way except order of primes. Ie:- 400=2*2*2*2*5*5 is written as the product of primes, however some 2 can be written after or between 5, so order is not considerable. This theorem also indicate that 1 is not a prime. If so a number can be written in product of prime/s and 1( many times as we wish it). ",
