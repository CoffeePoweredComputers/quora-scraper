            "answer_text": "wow.. What a tricky question. The Question asked : AT LEAST how many students pass? to get the least number of student to pass, we need to assume got a bunch of students that get full marks. This will decrease the number of students who passed. the total for 62 + 78 + 70 + 76 + 65 +81 + 80 + 95 + 72 + 81 = 760 of total correct answers from here, we can deduce that at most, 76 students get full marks. That will be a total of 760 correct answers.. and the other 24 gets nothing. hence, the LEAST possible numbers of student that pass is 76.. You try any other configuration of possible numbers, will get higher value than that ",

            "answer_text": "I think Amir has it backwards. The least efficient thing to do is distribute 6 correct answers to as many students as possible - i.e. the largest possible failing score. With the 760 correct answers you have, you can't fail everyone as that only uses up 600 answers. For every student that we pass, you are correct that we want to pass them with full marks to use up as many correct answers as possible. We use up 4 correct answers every time we convert a failed student to a full-marks student, and we have 160 answers to use up, so we can do 40 students at full marks = 400 correct answers + 60 students at 6 marks for the remaining 360 correct answers. Therefore at least 40 students pass. (As a quick sanity check, we can have 40 student at full marks as there are no individual questions for which less than 40 students scored the max.) ",
