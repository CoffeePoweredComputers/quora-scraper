            "answer_text": "A non-linear ODE is one that can be expressed in a form where all y terms are isolated. For example:  As  and  are isolated from other y terms. The following example in non-linear:  As you can see, the first term contains two y variables, the first and second derivative. This is what it means by non linear. The same would be true if the following would occur:  As the first term again is squared and so it is no longer linear. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an ordinary differential equation that isn\u2019t linear. Linear means that if u and v are both solutions, then so is au + bv, where a and b are real numbers, with a + b = 1. For \u201clinear and homogeneous\u201d, you can drop the condition on a and b. So for example du/dx = u^2. The solutions are -1/(x + C), for the various choices of the constant C. ",
