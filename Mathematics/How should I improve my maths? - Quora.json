            "answer_text": "The more you understand, more you learn. 1.If you don't understand something, focus on mastering that topic before moving on to the next topic. It sounds simple, but it is absolutely essential. Lets say a student is learning Algebra, for example. Further, lets say he or she is having a hard time understanding how to add and subtract negative and positive numbers. All of us struggle with this in the beginning as it is a sticky point for most students. Some students in this situation, out of frustration that they \"can't\" learn this topic, will move on to the next lesson in the hope that they will be able to understand that one. This is a recipe for disaster. Math is very much like learning to read. If you don't know your letter sounds then you have no hope of being able to sound out words of course there is no way possible that you could read a book. All math courses are taught in a specific sequence because the every topic builds on the previous topic. If you are having a problem with a topic, continue working with that one until you understand it and can work problems successfully. Watch the DVD section over again, attend tutoring, read the book and examples a second time, or even get a totally different book to have it explained a different way...but whatever you do not turn the page and tackle the next topic. If you do, you will get even more frustrated and you in all likelihood will begin to give up hope. 2) Work example problems and check your answers to gain practice with every lesson. The entire premise of the DVD series is to \"learn by example\" and it is quite simply the easiest way to learn Math. After watching the section on the DVD and reading the section in your textbook, begin working examples from the end of the chapter. Make sure to work the problems that have answers in the back of the book, and check every one. Always begin with the easiest problem in your book, even if you think it will be too \"easy\" to solve. It is very very important to build your confidence. This is why the DVD lessons begin with easier problems that no one will have any issue understanding. Gradually work harder and harder problems from your book and check your answer for each one. After working a dozen or more problems from the section (two dozen is best), you are ready to move on to the next section. Many students want to plow though a lesson just to make it to the next one. You cannot just read a section in a Math book and become an expert on that section. You must work problems. If you can't work problems then you are not ready to move on. The good news is that working problems will build your confidence, and confidence is 100% the name of the game in Math. 3) When beginning to work a Math problem, do not \"map out a path from problem-to-answer\" in your head before writing anything down. I see this almost every day. It is very common when someone looks at a Math problem that they try to \"figure it out\" in their head before writing anything down. Take Algebra for example. When a beginning student looks at an equation, he or she will be tempted to solve the equation in their head and not write anything down. Students are tempted to do this most often with Word Problems. Since a word problem is written in sentence form, it is common to think that you can \"think your way to the answer\". I will tell you that I never, ever, solve any sort of math problem without writing it down. Ever. What you need to do is begin by first writing down the problem. Then you begin to solve it one step at a time. Write down even the simple things. What you need to ensure is that every single step that you write down is perfectly legal. In other words, if you are solving an equation for example and you subtract \"10\" from both sides....write that down. Then in the NEXT step actually do that subtraction. Then if you need to divide both sides by \"2\" write THAT down...then in the NEXT step actually do the division. This gives you a paper trail to check your work and also it allows you to break the problem down in to bite sized chunks. If you can be sure that every single little step is legal, then you will be in good shape. If you try to do too many things at one time, which is common, you will probably try to do something illegal and get into trouble. 4) When you study and do homework, try to find a quiet place to do it. I was the worst offender of this while in school. I used to listen to music all of the time while trying to do homework. I'd also listen to the TV as 'background noise\" while studying. Over time I realized that if I had a quiet place without the background noise, I could focus much better. What I found is that when reading, for example...I would have to read something perhaps 3 or 4 times if I was listening to something else but only once if I had some quiet. People love to listen to music while studying, but I am convinced that it is much more effective if you don't. Try to find a quiet spot in your home or in the Library to get your schoolwork done and you will get your work done much more quickly because you'll be able to focus and absorb more. 5) If someone asks you for help, try to explain the topic to them as best you can. This one is going to seem a little odd for this list...but there is one universal truth. Those who can teach others have a true grasp of the material. Many times when studying in groups there will be one member of the group who is behind and doesn't \"get it\". Try to help that person, even if your own work will take longer. Not only will you feel like you are helping someone else succeed, but the process of rephrasing information back to someone else and breaking things down into bite sized chunks will increase your own understanding. It will help you understand at a fundamental level what the stumbling blocks are for the topic, which will help you as you move on in your math studies. 6) Never, ever work math problems in pen. This one is pretty simple. You will make a mistake; it is only a matter of time. When you do, you will want to completely erase your mistake and write over it. You will never, ever want to scratch something out and write next to the scratch-out. This will lead to a paper that is hard to read, and the scratch-outs will actually increase your anxiety about solving these problems. You want clean-neat paper with a clean well thought-out solution. 7) Try to use a mechanical pencil with separate eraser, if you can. Mechanical pencils have cleaner lines and the separate eraser allows you to erase more cleanly. Nothing is worse than making a mistake and trying to erase something then just smearing that all around your page. The cheap erasers will do this and make your life hard. Invest in a good mechanical pencil and a good separate eraser. 8) Keep your solutions neat and line-by-line. Always work problems vertically, with one step on every line. Never work horizontally. It may take more paper, but you will be able to follow your steps much more easily. More importantly, the teacher will be able to follow your work much better which allows him/her to give you partial credit. If there are just 2 steps when there should be 10, you will not be getting any points for your thought process. The steps you write down tell the teacher what you are thinking and how you are attacking the problem. 9) Don't work problems very late at night. I know all of the college students will be laughing at this, but it is true. I have tried many, many times to do Calculus or Physics late at night, after 12 or 1am, but you are just doing yourself a disservice. I have stared at problems for hours because I just could not sleep until I knew how to solve it...then I finally fell asleep out of extreme fatigue...but when I woke up it just seemed so simple how to proceed with the problem. Also, I have worked problems at night and got the wrong answer, and I knew I must have a silly mistake in the solution. I would usually set out to find it, but many times when you are tired you simply can't find the silly mistake. The next morning after about 5 minutes I could spot the simple sign error or even a simple multiplication error that caused the problem. 10) If the problem lends itself to it, draw a picture of the problem. This is most applicable for Trigonometry, Calculus, and Physics Students, but also applies to any word problem in basic math or algebra. Please do yourself a favor and draw a picture of what the problem is describing, even if your picture is simple. We are visual beings...the process of drawing the situation causes us to internalize what the problem is really asking for. It helps figure out how to proceed. If you are in Physics, you should draw a picture for every single problem that you work out. If you are in Calculus, definitely draw pictures for all related rate problems. If you are in Calculus 2 or Calculus 3, definitely draw a picture of all of your 3-dimensional problems (3d integrals). If you are in basic math and Jenny gives Bob 2 pencils and Bob gives 1 pencil away, draw that situation. It will really help you figure out how to proceed. Remember, there is no silver bullet in learning Math. It comes with taking things one step at a time and with practice. The tips above will help you along in your math studies, and give you confidence. And confidence is 100% the name of the game in learning any level of Math. ",

            "answer_text": "First, stop telling yourself that you are weak in mathematics. You may have had a hard time in the past, and it may take you longer than your peers to \u201cget it\u201d but there is a pretty good chance that the thing that you are \u201cweak\u201d in is in keeping track of all the stuff that they want you to keep track of in order to pass the tests. We teach math with a focus on things that are easy to test - we ask you to remember what the Mantissa is or which numbers are imaginary or what the commutative property of addition is. Who cares about that stuff? Nobody in your adult life will ever ask you about any of that crap. So, just because you don\u2019t get good grades on math tests does not mean that you are not good at math. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t need to try to learn and remember all that stuff, because you are going to get asked that stuff on tests time and time again. But don\u2019t blame that on math - blame that on the state of the public education system. The best way to get good at math is to forget about being ready for the test, and instead focus on understanding what you are doing. If you listen to your teacher with a goal of understanding what you are doing, and why you are doing it, then you will be off to a good start. Then you have to start doing the homework problems. Most of the time, the homework problems will be easy to start off with, and then get harder as you go. If you understand what you are doing, then you\u2019ll have to work to stretch yourself, but you will be able to move along. If you don\u2019t understand the material, it will seem impossible. Don\u2019t sit and stare at the problem - it won\u2019t solve itself. Instead, go back to the beginning and try to figure out what you don\u2019t understand. See if there is a Khan Academy video about it. A lot of schools now have online help desk websites where you can ask questions. Here\u2019s an example of what I mean by \u201cunderstanding.\u201d Students memorize the formula for the area of a triangle - 1/2 the base times the height. But they don\u2019t bother to figure out WHY that is the formula. If you have a rectangle, the formula for the area is the base times the height If you cut it in half diagonally, it would make a triangle - so the area of the triangle is 1/2 the area of the rectangle - just as if you cut it in half. Once you understand this, you don\u2019t have to memorize the area of the triangle - you just understand it and you can use this any time you need it for the rest of your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Relax, take your time and please read this lengthy answer. You see there is a reason for a person to be bright. It's the concentration and the qualities that come along with it, that gives that ability. It's a mental thing, mental development. Along with that development comes, being good at : learning things, memorizing them, recalling them fast, analyzing the combinations and patterns, logic, + reduction in stress / anxiety with the loading of studies, which puts a perfect skill platform for studying. All you need to do is strengthening your concentrating power. For that you could do a simple meditation. If you do this, soon you'll find out you're the smartest out there. Just give it a try and see. I suggest, close your eyes and observe your breath gently for a while, and don't think about anything at this time. This will put you in a very relaxed mode. Practice this time to time, you'll feel cool, relaxed and your creativity is increasing. You can use it in your studies in the way I mention below. Doing this simple looking meditation would build up your concentration, and as a result Your learning capacities, memory capacities, analytical capacities will also increase, making you smarter!    Also as a general rule, develop the kind of imagination I mention below. I'll take Maths as an example (that's an answer I wrote for a question), Don't let the Maths control you, turn it other way round. You be the master, you control Maths. Don't take it so seriously. When you shrink in to the math topic that's been taught, you feel like you are stuck in it, and get bored. Instead, think about the bigger picture, then that topic would look so light and tiny to you, instead of getting stuck in it. That big picture will make you creative. You'll feel like maths is like some tiny symbol manipulations that would be like throwing those tiny icons here and there in a huge i pod screen, no big deal. Don't get shrink by the topic, you think about the bigger picture, you be the master.  If you think bigger than the topic, you'll get to know the manipulations that are being performed as Math functions, on those tiny symbols. That's what math is about, symbols, patterns, and manipulations. If you could develop this kind of imagination about maths, soon you'll find it Maths is your slave, and will never be bored again. You'll enjoy your studies from now on! This applies to other studies as well, and for the things of life also! turn it other way round! I hope you get the idea. Think about the bigger picture, turn it other way round, you be the master, you control the subjects. [The BIG Picture in general is: The mind capacity is so HUGE, so for any subject it's those tiny symbols, patterns and their manipulations to the Mind. Without shrinking to the size of those tiny symbols and patterns, let the Mind be HUGE (run at HUGE) and let it learn those manipulations, which are done on those tiny symbols and patterns] (We need future Einsteins, so be a one!)   Her's another simple meditation that you could do and a little insight to what meditation does, What you need to build up is the concentration (not letting the mind run after the 6 senses), distractions simply mean your mind is running after the 6 senses. Start with the \"metta\" meditation, you could focus on you first and do it (may there be metta, karuna, mudita, upekka in me [ie. May I be happy. May I be well. May I be safe. May I be peaceful and at ease] : just mutter the words from your heart), then go (may all the living beings be metta, karuna, mudita, upekka: ie. May all be happy. May all be well. May all be safe. May all be peaceful and at ease.) keep the muttering from your heart. The longer you do it, your concentration would build up (your mind would not run after the 6 senses any longer). What that means is, you have the concentration, you are cool, you see the answers fast, so fast that you won't even believe. You are way cool / happy / stress free and you absorb more what you study of. Keep up the meditation from time to time.  Doing this is a joy. I really like the \"metta\" meditation, as it could be done anywhere, anytime. I even do that while I walk, travel also.  Also please read this answer too that I wrote for an earlier request, I see 2 studying types, 1 - HARD Study 2 - SMART Study SMART studying is what I think is better. Here are 2 answers I've already written to questions. Please go through them, and you'll understand. What should I do if I have my final exams in 10 days and I haven't studied anything? First of all, it's good that you've understand the pitfall. Make it a point never ever to do that again. There is a purpose you entered higher studies, and that goal should be achieved at any cost. Don't panic, you still have hope. Keeping your mind cool and happier matters a lot at this moment. You need to keep it that way for the rest of the days. Then on the studying part you need a technique that will make things absorb super fast. There is a way for all these things.  Do these simple 2 meditations, time to time. Study, take a break and do the meditations for a while, repeat. It's better if you can get the best possible isolation, (physically and mentally). Physically - find an isolated room to study, mentally - imagine the universe and the tiny earth, imagine your are out of the earth, this will put a whole load of problems that would cause troubles in concentration, out. Now you've created and found the perfect study heaven. No more disturbances. You see, it's like this. When you go to the big screen to watch movies, do you ever bother to remember anything about your home or any of those related matters? No, right. So it's like that. Now that you environment is set do these simple meditation along with the studies, 1 Close your eyes and observe your breath gently for a while, and don't think about anything at this time, be light hearted. This will put you in a very relaxed mode. You'll feel cool, relaxed, your concentration would build up. 2 Start the \"metta\" meditation, you could focus on you first and do it (may there be metta, karuna, mudita, upekka in me [ie. May I be happy. May I be well. May I be safe. May I be peaceful and at ease] : just mutter the words from your heart), then go (may all the living beings be metta, karuna, mudita, upekka: ie. May all be happy. May all be well. May all be safe. May all be peaceful and at ease.) keep the muttering from your heart. You'll calm down, you'll feel so cool, happy, your concentration would build up.  These simple meditations would do all the things I mentioned above. It will definitely let you have pure concentration, heavy absorption of the studies. When ever you feel, stressed / unhappy just remember the picture that you are out of the tiny earth, and do the meditation for a while and it will kick start that attitude for studying. Go get it soldier, you can make it. Give your best shot. I too was a campus student, and I never got to do these. Once I knew the benefits of it personally I regret a lot why I couldn't do them back at there. Keep up this practice for your entire life. This is my advice of SMART studying / not HARD studying.  Recall, \"The One who conquers his mind, rules the World!\" Good Luck, with your studies!    ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend do what the greats did. Many people think that there was something special about the brain of people like Newton or Einstein. The reality is they had to work hard too. There are a few things you can do to improve. One is practice and practice hard. Becoming good at math is a lot of hard work. Do not practice the easy stuff. Seek out what you struggle the most with. If you only spend time on the parts of math you excel at you will never get better at the parts you need the most improvement. For example if you struggle with 3D spatial reasoning then focus on that. There will be many times where you will be frustrated, where you will want to cry your eyes out and give up because it feels hopeless. The important thing is to keep to it. Another thing is set good goals for yourself. If your goal is \u201cI want to improve my math skills\u201d. That is a terrible goal. A better goal is, \u201cI want to increase my skills in Differential Calculus.\u201d. What makes this goal better is that it is more specific. There are things you can do to improve your goal even more. The more specific and focused, the better. Your goal should be specific, highlighting exactly what you are going to do. It should be measurable, how much better do you want to be, find a way to put numbers to that. Make it attainable, know what you can handle and pace yourself. Think realistically, know how much you are willing to work, do not push yourself harder than you are willing to work. Your goal needs to be time bound, when do you want to be better by. If your goals are not like this you will likely give up before you achieve it. If I asked you two months from now how you were doing on your goal, you should be able to give me some sort of indication as to your progress. Lastly take math classes, read math textbooks, and look over math papers. If you do all of these things you will almost certainly improve. I can not speak to the extent to which you will improve. I honestly do not know how much talent you have, and I do not know what kind of work ethic you have, but I can tell you this, improving in math takes time and hard work. This is such a cliche, but practice makes perfect. One last thing, if all else fails, find someone who is skilled in math, and ask them to help you improve. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do I become better at math? Are there any tips?\u201d Mary Smith, You should be flying along, very happy, enthusiastic, able to learn the material easily, understanding what you are reading or hearing, able to solve the type of problems you want, and able to apply the material to anything you wish in life. Not just college but to your career, to your family, to your basic purpose in life, anything. You should study with these things in mind. You should be confident you can learn any subject you wish. If not, then here are some tips to help you do that. I believe that Reading comes before Math. If you were having any trouble with Reading, not \u201cflying along\u201d\u2026and all that\u201d, then you are very likely to have trouble with Math. If you did not have a study course that teaches you how to be \u201cflying along\u2026and all that, while learning Reading then you need an excellent study course. Such a course is The Student Hat Course. Once a student has been brought up to \u201cflying along\u2026and all that\u201d then it is a simple matter to keep them at that high level. Every time one slows or gets less bright, less happy, one just locates the words the student just went past on that page or a page before, gets those clarified and the material restudied and the student fly\u2019s on. Now if a student can not do that themselves they need The Student Hat. It will teach you how to use a Dictionary to define each word, so that it no longer bothers you in the future. You may need a simple Grammar Course, so you know how things fit together. You may need something called \u201cMethod One Word Clearing\u201d done, so you are flying along, at the begining of the study course. It gives you a starting point where you can continue forward from there. With those things done, you can be a successful student and keep yourself flying along. 90% of the time when you are flying along and begin to slow down, that can be handled with clarifying words only. So this is the most important tip of all. You have to learn how to notice when this happens, and how to correct it yourself. Tip #1: One tip is to quickly look over the first page of any new material you want to learn or any old material you want to restudy. You scan it fast just looking for any words that do not instantly react to you as something you do understand, at that speed. If you don\u2019t understand a word at scanning speed you don\u2019t know it well enough, yet. Circle each word you find, or make up a word list. Then clarify each one with a Dictionary, or a Glossary or a Textbook, or an Encyclopedia. (Not the context only.) Clarify that whole list first, so you know each of those words or symbols well. They you dive in and study that page for real. Now you have just that many barriers to your understanding the material out of the way. There may be more words there you need to clarify before it all becomes clear to you. Don\u2019t leave the page till you get it. Do this page by page. Story #1: I had a student once that did not do the homework assigned by his regular teacher. So later in the day I had him get the assignment and read it outloud for me. There were 200 words on that page. He could not read, that means he could not even say some of the words, 80 of them. He was within 3 months of graduating high school. I asked him what each word meant, as we moved along and I stopped him on each hesitation, lack of comprehension, stumble or stutter, etc. Anything that was not just reading quickly, easily, happily, with comprehension. He was being tutored on Phonics, so I did not bother with that. If he stumbled, I asked him to locate a word. If he could not read the word he located, I read it. He could not say 40% of the words on the page. He could not understand 20% of the words on the page. I defined each one for him as we moved along. All of a sudden, after being defined, he had no trouble saying the word when he saw it. At the bottom of the page he was reading faster and faster and now comprehending what he read. He had learned 80 new words in a few minutes. He had just be been passing them by without understanding them. Tip #2: You should have a purpose or use for each thing you study. You can ask yourself questions like: How can I use this in life? How has someone used this? How can I apply this to something I want to do? These are application type questions. This is one way to connect each thing you are learning with your life. For example, if you find yourself thinking the thought, \u201cWill this be on the test?\u201d You want to just do this Tip #2. Work out how it is actually important to you personally. Story #2: I once talked to a School Board about these things at a public meeting. A student stopped me later and said he had asked his Calculus teacher, \u201cWhy are we learning Calculus?\u201d The teacher said, \u201cThat is a good question.\u201d I don\u2019t know but I will get back to you. A couple of days later the boy said that teacher told him, none of the teachers knew the answer to his question. I gave him 7 reasons to learn Calculus right off the top of my head, but I also told him your Tip #2. He got it! Tip #3: You should learn how to use a Dictionary properly, and when to use it. This might be The How to Use a Dictionary Course, like in the book with the same name: How to Use a Dictionary: Picture Book for Children: L. Ron Hubbard: 9781584600077: Amazon.com: Books  Tip #4: You should learn grammar from a simple textbook on grammar, like the book:  Grammar and Communication for Children: L Ron Hubbard: 9781403158901: Amazon.com: Books Tip #5: Hire a tutor or work with a parent or family member or ask at school or your library, or your local community college about volunteer tutors. You can pair up with another student as a study partner, or with a study group. Story #5: A mom was having trouble with her daughter in Math who was failing for several years. She was currently in an 8th grade Pre-Algebra class. I went with the mom to her daughter\u2019s class, and we observed. I tutored the girl and found simple words early in Math that she actually had never heard of, and some she went past without understanding. She was using a calculator and doing\u201dcalculator math. After we clarified the words well she went up to straight A\u2019s in the class. She was flying along, happy, and working math faster than I could follow. She was very eager to get on with her Math. Her willingness to learn Math had returned. I have some other answers on Quora about study. You might to read a few. Best of luck, Leon ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not a mathematician, however, I enjoy mathematics and just as you, felt that I was not very good at it. When I decided to become a better problem-solver I started reading a few books about mathematical thinking, what mathematics is really about and of course problem-solving. Through this process I realized that my previous conception of mathematics was wrong and that the way in which I was approaching it wasn't very effective. See from what I have learned, mathematics is not about calculations, it's about thinking logically, finding meaning, connections and patterns. If you want to be good at this, and I believe almost anyone can get good at it, you have to cultivate the right habits of mind. For this all you need is proper instruction, discipline and dedication.  If you want to follow a path similar to my own, I would recommend you read: @Mathematical Problem Solving: Alan Schoenfeld: 9780126288711: Amazon.com: Books, @Amazon.com: Thinking Mathematically (2nd Edition) (9780273728917): J. Mason, L. Burton, K. Stacey: Books and How To Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method: George Polya, Sam Sloan: 9784871878302: Amazon.com: Books. I think it's better if you follow this order. With these book I think you'll find good instruction, the discipline and dedication will have to come from you, and I think if you really want to get better, you'll have no problem providing it. Lastly, to get better you simply have to follow a process of trial an error. Practice, learn from your practice, remember what you learned and then apply it to later practice, then repeat. Good luck!

            "answer_text": "Someone asked: \u201cHow do I get better at math?\u201d Simple: Add yourself into the equation :-) The question itself is a bit open-ended, like, are we talking simple addition, more complex algebra, different yet tougher geography? or all-calculus and higher concepts, such as Einsteinian equations of relativity and that sort? Just for starters, as an elementary student, we had homework every day that involved dozens of math problems. Copying the problem (which was required) took up so much time and energy that I quickly asked myself, how can I do this more easily? The answer was immediately apparent: place my sheet of paper OVER the problems in the book and trace them straight through. (Keeping a finger on a lower left corner and flipping the paper sheet when in doubt helped avoid making mistakes as well.) From that point, all I had to do were the calculations, and those were einfach simple. Moving onto algebra, usually involving an equation, just plug in the value of 1 wherever possible and see how it works. In common life, especially in terms of addition and subtraction, try as often as possible to see things in terms of money. For example, 786\u2013432 = $7.86-$4.32 which gives $3.54 change. This works for many other uses in life, so keep your eyes peeled for them and try it whenever possible. When converting dates (such as years) in calendar terms, look for big blocks, such as from 1981 to 2016, that\u2019s 9+10 years up to 2000, then +16 more years, so you get 35 years. That\u2019s a WHOLE lot easier than figuring 2016\u20131981, which involves far too many numbers. NOTE: for MOST folk, simply knowing how to balance a checkbook is about all the math they\u2019ll ever need, although as a pizza driver, I found figuring MPG from using only the price per gallon and the total sale in conjunction with the miles traveled to be a rather fun project to figure out (thus avoiding the use of the actual quantity purchased.) Once upon a time, my dad used trigonometry of all things to figure out how long to make a guy wire to a radio antenna pole that extended about 20\u2032 above the gutter\u2019s edge, figured using the distance from the pole in the center of the house to the edge where the anchor wire was needed and the length of the pole itself minus the height from ground to gutter + the length from gutter to apex of the eaves. Then figuring out the angle from the anchor point to the top of the pole. THAT was cool! He used trig, but using A\u00b2+B\u00b2=C\u00b2 would do the trick just as easily. So for now, think in terms of numbers as money, and always use the value of 1 in an equation to see how it works (if possible.) If one devotes one\u2019s LIFE to becoming a mathematician, parts may become easier, but there will always be an interesting problem in need of solving ahead of you (such as P vs. NP and other light challenges, for example.)

            "answer_text": "The question doesn't really provided much information. I'm going to assume this is highschool or lower college level. Edit: Ok, now I see the rest of the question. First off, I started off as a community college student in the hopes to transfer to the university once I finished all my gen ed course. The primary motivator was one of money, with the community college obviously being seriously cheaper per unit, but also because I had been away from academia for a long time; I needed the smaller classroom environment so that I could ease back into the mindset and habitual routine of being an active student. During my two years at the community college, I met quite a few student who were actually university students, but were taking the odd class at the community college campus. And the number reason as to why? Difficulty. It wasn't about money, but rather that the university lower math classes (all 200 level classes and below), were presented in very large lecture halls and apparently were more difficult as the professors would simple recite the material almost verbatim to the corresponding course book. The community college professors would actually take the time to answer questions, allow groups to take the quizzes, and would walk around and help students. Also, their presentations went beyond the book so that the lectures provided much more information than some sterilized text manual. It's wasn't that the related courses at the community college were easier because the subject matter was easier, which they were (the calc teachers are pretty strict in their grading), but the learning environment so drastically different that the students were able to grasp the concepts and learn. (Edit: Maybe the above paragraph doesn't apply to you, but following should apply to any area of study)  Secondly, you need to ask yourself - why am I finding the course difficult? What is it about this course that makes it difficult? Once you can identify these things, then you need to ask yourself - what can I do with that knowledge? For example, if the lectures are confusing, then maybe you need to be reading ahead of the class schedule. Possibly talking with a tutor when talking stuff that you're reading ahead on. Then when you come to class for the lecture, you'll have at least some level of knowledge in which you can relate to during the lecture session.  And I think lastly, the challenge of learning isn't about being good at what you're good at, it's about working hard in the areas where you are weak. Everyone has weak areas in which things don't click or catch on quickly like with other subjects. Sometimes this can be in a subset areas of a specific course or class. In math, generally I've found all my classes to be easy in understanding the fundamentals, and the only work is committing to memory the smaller details of operations, but sometimes I get tripped up on certain concepts, or rather the application of them. I put extra time and energy into making sure I understand this and master it. We're often proud of our strengths, but what's that saying? We're only as strong as a our greatest weakness? Something like that. So my foundation is only as strong as the work I put into it. If you simply do enough to get by, especially in the areas you struggle with, then there will be gaps and faults in your foundation.  I believe it's part philosophical inquiry; asking the ~honest~ questions of ~why~ is this a problem for me, and ~what~ am I going to do with that knowledge? I believe it's part responsibility; am I going to put in the extra amount of time and work for areas that I struggle with in my studies? I believe it's part self reflection; what is my attitude towards these studies and do I care do to my best or be successful? Everybody struggles with something, but the problem is that when people struggle - negative feelings and attitudes (anger, frustration, anxiety,etc) become associated with the finding or applying the solutions.. to whatever problems. This only compounds the issue even further. And going forward, you convince yourself you just can't do it - or whatever excuse. Don't see it as a struggle, see it as a challenge. And see it as an opportunity to grow from conquering that challenge. You'll gain soo much more from that, than any student who can easily coast through a course. You are the accumulation of ~every~ challenge you've come up against. Who were you in those moments? ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re not going to like hearing this but there is no silver bullet. It\u2019s going to take hard work on your part. Studying and practice. And then study and practice some more. But remember that when it comes to studying it\u2019s quality, not quantity that counts. Or, to put it another way, \u201cIt\u2019s not the hours you put in but it\u2019s what you put in the hours\u201d. I know it sounds corny but it\u2019s true. First thing to remember - studying is very much an individual thing. What works for one student might very well not work for another. Some students have to write things down so the concept sticks. Others have to say it aloud. Still others have to walk around while reading the material. And some just have to do something - I know one of my daughter\u2019s grade school teachers used to hand out pieces of \u201cmounting putty\u201d at the start of each class to those students who regularly fidgeted - gave them something to do with their hands without bothering anyone else. Figure out what works for you. The usual holds - go to class, take notes, work on your assignments. Since you\u2019re asking the question here it\u2019s probably safe to say you\u2019re already doing that. If you\u2019re stuck on a concept ask your teacher. Whether it\u2019s a question in class or after school hours. They\u2019ll generally be more than willing to help you. And remember - THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A STUPID QUESTION! If you don\u2019t understand something odds are much of the rest of the class is in the same boat. And another point - math is very much a \u201ccumulative subject\u201d. That is, if you don\u2019t understand the material you were supposed to learn last year you\u2019re going to have troubles learning this year\u2019s material - all the more reason to speak to your teacher. BTW, if your school runs some sort of \u201cacademic assistance\u201d or \u201cmath drop in center\u201d use it (those are just rooms staffed by a rotating group of teachers who are there to help you - sometimes just hearing something explained a different way is all it takes). I know both my kid\u2019s high schools had some variant of this and the universities I attended (as both an undergrad and grad student) ran something similar - there they were staffed by graduate students.

            "answer_text": "Many children might not understand this answer, don\u2019t be depressed you will understand as the time passes. You can always get better at Mathematics since there is always scope for improvement. Here are two golden rules which I will present and further elaborate : Never Give up : Its like fighting a battle. If you are unable to solve a problem go to the basics and start afresh. Don\u2019t just write the steps as you solve instead work with them in your mind. Enjoy the heat of the battle between you and your intellect mounting up, its good for both. The \u2018Thinking Time\u2019 is the time when you seriously think about the problem. It is a few seconds for an average human to years for scientists. The more you increase it the better you become at maths.Start appreciating the unseen : Mathematics is more than just dry numbers. For example look at calculus, when you start learning calculus and see all those analytical and abstract proofs did you foresee what a great magic it was about to become for you afterwards. Its about going behind the scenes and understand the magic and when you come to know that the whole magic hinges on one completely obvious postulate you are amazed. Appreciate the beauty which not all develop the eyes to see and you will start loving maths.One last point which comes up is which step to follow first. It would be better if you keep them in mind and start working your way out. They complement each other. You also need to have sound concepts. Always work through with a paper and a pencil while reading the theory and believe in it to help you in your battle. All the great book reading and about the life of great mathematicians comes automatically when you find your love. Lastly remember those who have helped you whether it be people, proofs or the dead.
