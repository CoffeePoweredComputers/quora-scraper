            "answer_text": "Answer is Rs. 200. Let (C1, S1) & (C2, S2) denote respectively original & reduced (cost-price, sell-price) of the given watch. According to given data we have, S1 = C1*(1 + 0.15) = 1.15*C1 \u2026\u2026 (1) C2 = C1*(1 - 0.05) = 0.95*C1 \u2026\u2026 (2) S2 = S1 - 21 \u2026\u2026 (3) S2 = C2*(1 + 0.10) = 1.10*C2 \u2026\u2026 (4) Using (1), (2) & (3) we get from (4) as follows, S1 - 21 = 1.10*C2 or 1.15*C1 - 21 = 1.10*(0.95*C1) or (1.15 - 1.045)*C1 = 21 or C1 = 21/0.105 = 200 (Rs.)
