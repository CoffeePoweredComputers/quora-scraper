            "answer_text": "10 years ago, their combined age will be 67 years, which is supposed to be in ratio of 9:4. 67 is not completely divisible by 13. Otherwise age of D and A 10years ago will be 67*9/13 and 67*4/13. After 14 years, ages will be present age of both+ 14 years respectively. If instead of 87, 85 is taken as combined age at present, then 10 years ago, there total age will be 65 years. Or alternatively,it should be 11 years ago instead of 10 years. Thus D's age will be 45 and A will be 20 years old. Ratio will be 9:4 After ascertaining present age 14 years can be added to both and ratio calculated accordingly.Or I am missing something ?",

Assign value X years for PRESENT AGE OF person D, and Y years for person A. so X + Y=87\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(1) now 10 years before , age of D would be X-10 years, and of A would be Y-10, so (X-10)/(Y-10)=9/4 \u2026..(2) solve for X,using equations 1 & 2; gives Y=56.3 years, hence X= 87\u201356.3=30.7 years. from these figures, calculate the ages after 14 years; 70.3 & 44.7 years, ratio of which is 1.57\u2026.(rounded off to 2 decimals.
