            "answer_text": "Draw the x,y-plane. Draw a dot at the origin, to indicate the starting point. Move three units down the y-axis, to indicate the first leg. Draw a second dot. From this second dot, move four units to the left, parallel to the x-axis, to indicate the second leg. Draw a third dot. From this third point, move five units up, parallel to the y-axis, to indicate the third leg. Draw a fourth dot at (-4, 2). From this fourth point, draw a line, parallel to y = -x, to indicate the fourth leg. Draw a fifth dot. To determine the net displacement (rather than the total distance travelled), we must find the exact location of this fifth dot. The angled line forms a 45 degree angle with each of the x- and y-axes. So, off to the side, draw a 45\u201345\u201390 triangle. Label the two legs with length L, and label the hypotenuse with the stated distance of 2. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of L. Subtract this length value from the y-coordinate of the fourth dot, and add it to the x-coordinate. (Looking at your graph, you can see why.) Now plug this point, along with the origin (the starting point), into the Distance Formula, to find the requested value. ",

            "answer_text": "Solution: Find the net coordinatesUse the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the origin (starting point).Take the square root and you get the accrual distance.Answer: Net equals (4 - 2/sqrt(2)) west. And (2 - 2/sqrt(2)) north.Pythagorean theorem gives us (4 - 2/sqrt(2))^2 + (2 - 2/sqrt(2))^2 = 18 - 16/sqrt(2) + 6 - 8/sqrt(2) = 24 - 24/sqrt(2)The square root gives us the positive length of 2.6513.",
