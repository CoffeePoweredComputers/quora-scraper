Then we got, (2x+9)(x-7)=0 Either, (2x+9)=0 Or,2x=-9 Or,x=-9/2 OR, (X-7)=0 X=7..And Hope it helps you\u2026 Sorry for my late answer ",

Using 9 we now get 2(9)^2=162 -45=117 (still greater than 63, so lets try 7. 2(7^2)-35=98\u201335=63. 2X^2\u20135X=63 Solving this equation will also give you 7 and -9/2 ",
