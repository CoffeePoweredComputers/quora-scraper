            "answer_text": "FOR CBSE BOARD... Class 10th Maths is not at all tough. Infact, the entire portion is like a sandwich which you can easily understand and complete without any problems. On top of that, the new system has made it easier for the students as they don't have to write the exam for the entire maths portion. It is only selected chapters from the book which they need to study for the exams.  The chapters where most students have problems are Pair of Linear Equation in Two Variables, Quadratic Equations, Trigonometry, Applications of Trigonometry and Mensuration. There will be some theorems as well which you need to mug up (not only the theorem, but their proof as well).   I would say practice is the only key here. The more you practice, the better you will get. It doesn't only help in getting correct results but also helps you to improve your speed (which will come in handy when you are stuck in some question in the exam). Apart from solving the NCERT Book questions, try solving the example questions from RD Sharma and Together With (the books which I used during my 10th standard). If you have time, you can also solve the exercise questions given in these books (you'll find that they have the same difficulty level as the example questions). And make sure to solve the previous years papers as well. They'll help you to score good marks in exams. But from understanding point of view, NCERT Book, RD Sharma and Together With will suffice....  ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on you actually.. When i was in 10th everything was in my Comfort zone except Social Yaa... I was really good at maths as the chapters were actually interesting and even made some sense, I've made a full 10 points in 10th boards in maths.. And then the worst thing happened the 11th... When i entered 11th everything scattered out nothing made sense i eventually lost interest in every subject even Maths but yaa in my case i had a latent interest in Programming which helped me. Leave it.. To answer your question i wish to continue to say that yaa it depends on you solely dont listen to others try to attempt them and see if you provoke your bars of interest and then once you get a small zeal towards solving maths problems, Its done no problem in maths would be diff for you... The main key to success in maths is Practicing really hard may that be whatever class Practice + A bit of interest will get you to your comfort zones. ",
