            "answer_text": "I assume you want to have three attempts, picking a marble. If you allow a higher number of attempts the analysis gets much more interesting though. If you pick the first marble, your chance to get blue is [math]\\frac{5}{10}=0.5[/math] Then you have 9 left, with 4 being blue. Your second chance then yields [math]\\frac{4}{9}=0.444.[/math] And for the last you get [math]\\frac{3}{8}=0.375[/math] Putting it all together you get [math]\\frac{5}{10}\\frac{4}{9}\\frac{3}{8}=\\frac{60}{720}=\\frac{1}{12}[/math].
