Since the average of 20, 70 and x is 40, that means that our average formula looks like this: (20+70+x)/3 = 40 x + 90 = 120 x = 30 Now we do the same thing to solve for y (20+70+30+y)/4 = 50 120 + y = 200 y = 80 notice we could have actually not solved for x and gone straight to the answer since x + 90 = 120, that means that (120+y)/4 = 50, so y = 80 still.

The only difference between my answer and those of others is that I\u2019m doing it slightly more efficiently by not bothering to solve for x first, since that\u2019s not required for the answer. We know that the average of 20, 70 and x is 40, so , which implies that . The average of 20, 70, x and y is 50, so . This implies that , so . ",
