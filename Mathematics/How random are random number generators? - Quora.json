            "answer_text": "They are pretty good for most purposes, if you choose a tested standard one.  Period lengths are very long -- usually over 10^20 -- and there are no simple patterns to be found.   Exceptions:  the built-in RAND() function in Excel is based on a terrible linear-congruential generator with a short period (unless they have fixed it).  Old versions of Numerical Recipes contained a low-quality generator; this was fixed around 1995. Built-in system rand()/srand()  functions, accessed directly in C and probably used as the implementation under most scripting languages, do not have a standard implementation so there can be no guarantee of their quality.  (As of C++11, there is a C++ standard random generation package offering engines and adaptors you can mix to your heart's content:  Pseudo-random number generation.) I guess there was a gradual shift from about 1990 to 2005, by the end of which good random number generators were easy enough to find.  In today's world there are a few scattered bad generators, in very old or incompetently maintained code.   ",
