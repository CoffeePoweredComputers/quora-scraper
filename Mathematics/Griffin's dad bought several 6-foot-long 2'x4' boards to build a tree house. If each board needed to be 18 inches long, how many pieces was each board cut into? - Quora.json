            "answer_text": "If you have ever cut lumber before you realize that the blade has a thickness. So you can cut each board into at most 3 pieces 18\u2033 long with one piece left over that will be less than 18\u2033 long (assuming that the boards were actually 6\u2032 long to begin with). So the boards were likely cut into 4 pieces with only 3 of them being 18\u2033 long. Could cut the the non-18\u2033 piece into as many pieces as you like if they can be used for something else. Someone else said you can get more pieces if you also cut lengthwise into say 1\u2033 width pieces. I doubt that was the intent, but if you do you also have to consider that 2x4 lumber is generally not 2\u2033 x 4\u2033 so be careful of any such answers. Usually a 2x4 is about 1.5\u2033 x 3.5\u2033. ",

            "answer_text": "The question does not tell what the width needs to be. The answer depends on that. For example - If 1 inch wide, then we can get a total of 48 pieces each 18 inches long + 1 2 = 60 total pieces each 1 inch wide and 18 inches long ",
