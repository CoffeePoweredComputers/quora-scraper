            "answer_text": "I have developed equation already for 2 types of pipe and is still valid.Asssume the two types are to fill the tank simultaneously, it takes time t t=xy/x+y where x=12 and pipes A and y=16 and pipes B. t will give you 6.86minutes .Good but not there yet. If in 4 minutes before the tank is full you close pipe A which is larger.Pipes A and B would have worked for only 2.86 minutes together and the tank will only be filled by 2.86/6.86 or 41.7% filled and 58.3% empty. It is getting interesting I suppose but not there yet.Now if only pipe B is to fill the tank note that it will take 16minutes confirmed. Now to fill the remaining 58.3% it will take 16*0.583 minutes and you get 9.31minutes.Great we are getting close Remember that both pipes work for 2.86 minutes before pipe A is closed The total time to fill is 2.86+9.31 minutes and you get 12.17 minutes or 12minutes and 10.2 seconds Interesting I suppose the implication is that the pipe B is not not necessary if the system does not need to shut off the pipe A 4 minutes before the tank is filled. In design you incorporate pipe B if the pipe A cannot function more than 3 minutes and you still want to ensure that the tank is filled within 12 minutes. ",

Now, we can know that efficiency of: A is 4 units /minute ( Since 48/12=4) and B is 3 units/minute (Since 48/16=3) Also given that, A is closed 4 minutes before the tank is full. Hence, we add that 4 minute work of A to total work and divide by combined efficiency of A & B. Now, 48+(4\u00d74)=64. Then 64/7= 9 1/7 minutes. (Efficiency of A&B =7) Answer is 9 1/7 minutes. ",

Let time required to fill the tank be 'x' min. That means A was open for (x-4) min and B was open for x min\u2026. Together they complete the task, hence equation will be equated to 1.
