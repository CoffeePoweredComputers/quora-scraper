            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t buy it like that any more. Firstly, beef is minced, not ground, and secondly it\u2019s sold by the kg. Assuming that you mean 3 avoirdupois pounds, that\u2019s about 1.35 kg. A kg of minced beef costs about $12, so your\u2019re looking at about $16.20. That\u2019s round here, of course. Round where you are (where? you don\u2019t say) it\u2019s probably different. So why ask Quora? Your local butcher or supermarket will gladly give you pricing. Is this a serious question? I haven\u2019t downvoted it, but I will downvote any further such question, and report it. ",
