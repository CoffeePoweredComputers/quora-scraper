            "answer_text": "It depends upon whether your event is a \u2018mathematical\u2019 event or a \u2018real\u2019 event. For example: I pick a random integer; what is the probability that it is either odd or even? This clearly has probability equal to 1. What is the probability that it is either prime or composite? Basically, I\u2019m inventing tautologies here\u2026 statements that cannot be false and have probability equal to 1. But tautologies are the realm of mathematics. If we\u2019re dealing with \u2018real\u2019 events then we can always invoke the infinitesimal probabilities of quantum mechanical fame that our event won\u2019t play out as expected. I would be interested to hear of a \u2018real\u2019 \u2018world of physics\u2019 \u2018probability 1\u2019 event\u2026 any suggestions? Don\u2019t give me coin tosses or I\u2019ll land you on the edge. And similar arguments. ",
