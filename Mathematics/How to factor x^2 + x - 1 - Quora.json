            "answer_text": "We can also factorize a quadratic polynomial, using quadratic formula\u2026 Method: (1) : First get the value of x for the above polynomial p(x) = 0 (2) : Then take additive inverse of those values of x. (3) : Then each value is added to x separately to get its factors. P(x) = x\u00b2 + x - 1 = 0 => x = {-1+ - \u221a(1\u00b2 + 4)}/2 ( using quadratic formula) => x = (-1 +\u221a5)/2 & (-1 -\u221a5)/2 Additive inverse of 1st value = -(-1+\u221a5)/2 =(1-\u221a5)/2 Additive inverse of 2nd value = -(-1-\u221a5)/2 = (1+\u221a5)/2 Hence, factors are.. = x + {(1-\u221a5)/2} & x +{(1+\u221a5)/2} = (2x +1-\u221a5) /2 & (2x +1 +\u221a5)/2 = (1/4) ( 2x+1-\u221a5) (2x+1+\u221a5) So, factors are (1/4) (2x+1-\u221a5) (2x+1+\u221a5) ",
