            "answer_text": "If you look at the PDF you see that 5/10 Is half the mean. So you have a mean of 1. So P(0) = 1/e. This assumes P(1) is twice P(2) P(1)=10 is a false statement because probabilities are between zero and one. The ratio assumption here says that P(0)=1/e, P(1)=1/e and P(2)=1/2e. P(k)=1/(k!e). This would be your guess if your probabilities were frequencies from experimental outcomes. People often confuse frequency with probability. I see another post saying P(2)=.4 and P(1)=.2. These constraints cannot specify a Poisson. My remarks above prove it because I wrote the unique Poisson with P(2)/P(1)=1/2. ",

But, supposing that you meant that P(X = 1) and P(X = 2) are respectively proportional to 10 and 5, we can do this:  And, since the mean of a Poisson Random Variable can\u2019t be zero, the only possible answer is that the mean is 1.
