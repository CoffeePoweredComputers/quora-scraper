            "answer_text": "The given ellipse can be written as : x\u00b2/9 + y\u00b2/4 = 1 \u2026. .. ..(1). Any line which is || to the line 4x - 2y - 5 = 0 is given by 4x - 2y + k = 0 . If it is a normal line to the ellipse (1), then it must be comparable with the normal at any point P(3cost, 2sint) of the ellipse (1). But the normal at the point P is given as follows; (y - 2sint) = - (1/m)(x - 3cost), where m is slope of the tangent at the point P . Now, we have from (1), m = dy/dx at P. It ==> m = (-2/3)cot(t) which in turn gives (-1/m)= (3/2)tan(t) . Hence the equation of the normal line is : (y - 2sint) =(3/2)tan(t).(x - 3cost) or 2y - (3.tant)x + 5 sint = 0 \u2026. .,,(2). Comparing it with 4x - 2y + k = 0 , we get, 2/-2 = 4/(-3tant) = k/5.sint . From the first two ratios , we get, tan(t) = 4/3 ==> cos(t) = (\u00b13/5) and sin(t) = (\u00b14/5). Therefore, the required points P are (3.(\u00b13/5), 2.(\u00b14/5) or =(9/5, 8/5), (-9/5, -8/5) . The two normal lines || to the given normal line are ; 4x - 2y \u00b1 4 = 0 . ",
