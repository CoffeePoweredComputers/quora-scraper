            "answer_text": "Maths was my enemy for almost whole of my school life. The subject became a huge hindrance in me getting my high scores. Let me tell you I went about tackling it(my method worked in 2013, I am sure it works even today). Let\u2019s go in steps: I joined a tuition. Cliche, I know. It helped me though. Tuition helped me to allot a specific amount of time to maths everyday. I made it a point to join a tuition which has a small batch size, so that I can easily talk and clarify my doubts with my teacher.Solve all the NCERT questions. I tell this to every student. NCERT textbook is your Bible. Be thorough with all the sums(including examples) of NCERT. When I say solve, I mean take a pen and book, write and solve. DO NOT READ MATHS, PRACTICE IT.When you are practicing maths, keep a thin book with you to write down all the formulae. Make sure you write what each variable stands for. Whenever you have time, go through formulae. If not use it for last minute reference before entering your exam hall.After solving NCERT questions thoroughly, dig up all previous year question papers. Dig previous 10 year\u2019s question paper. Solve them using timer. Make sure you complete your paper( write the answer the way you would write in your exam, with all the steps) in 2.5 hrs. Attempt your co-ordinate geometry and statistics questions also within this 2.5 hours. This will improve your speed.Grab a reference book, I used Together with and R.D.Sharma. Try solving them as much as possible. Approach your tuition of school teacher if you are not able to solve. Please remember, while checking the solutions of solved questions in reference book, there is a chance that your method might be different or your final answer does not match. Don\u2019t fret, books can be wrong at times. Again, approach your teacher.Remember your exam is a written exam and maths is a subject which can have calculation mistakes while writing, hence practice writing.DO NOT use calculator while practicing the questions. Calculate manually. Once you have finished doing the exercise, cross-check using calculator.(A tip) Usually the numbers used in the questions would be such that the calculation becomes easy. Usually you will get a perfect answer within few steps. If you didn\u2019t probably you are using a longer method or your answer is wrong. Crosscheck!(Not applicable for R.D.Sharma\u2019s questions)I am sorry the answer went long, but this is what I did. It seems like a lot but trust me, it is difficult to do. After doing all of this, my marks in 10th was 10.00(CGPA) and in 12th it was 99/100. I am telling you my marks so that you know that the method actually works. I had a group of friends with whom I used to practice and all of them got equally good marks. I hope this helps you. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Maths is a very important subject or we can say that it is a very scoring subject. If you master the maths of class 10 then it would definitely help you in class 11 ( If you would take maths in class 11). Let me tell you what I did to get good marks in maths and what I did wrong during the preparation of maths in class 10. Your concepts should be clear - For mastering maths, your concepts should be crystal clear. Go through NCERT, Youtube videos, etc to understand the concepts.Practice Practice!! - Without daily practice, you cannot master maths. Maths is not a subject to mug up the answers. It needs practice. Practice different types of question from different books ( If you have completed your NCERT)Solve NCERT thoroughly- Ncert should be your first priority. First complete NCERT then go for other books.Never ever rely on NCERT - It may sound absurd but remember you want to MASTER MATHS. You do not want to just pass in the exams. Once you have completed NCERT, go for higher level books like- RD SHARMA, RS AGGARWAL. I Think it is a MUST to solve RD SHARMA or the latter one to master maths. Don\u2019t solve all the questions of RD SHARMA but at least solve the solved examples and few questions from HOTS ( High Order Thinking Skills).Solve about 20 previous years question paper - Solving previous year question paper will help you to know that what type of questions are asked mostly every year. Try to solve it in 3 hours as this is the time you are given in your exams.Never leave the weak chapters - Never leave the chapters which you find hard and you are weak in it. Give more time and solve more questions from that chapter.Enjoy maths - Never take maths as a burden. If you solve maths reluctantly than you will never be able to get good marks in maths. ENJOY the essence of maths.Remember that you want to master maths. Give your Hundred percent and score well in maths. Always Remember:- \u201c If You Can Dream It, You Can Achieve It\u201d ",
