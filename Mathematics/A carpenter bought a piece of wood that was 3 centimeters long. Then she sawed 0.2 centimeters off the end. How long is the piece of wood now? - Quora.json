            "answer_text": "I don't believe that there is a wood that is expensive enough to be sold in such short lengths as 3 cm. Which as far as definition is concerned is only the length of the end of my thumb. So the thickness of the saw comes into play in determining the remainder of the piece of wood since the only sensible saw to use on such a small piece of wood is a veneer saw that is less than 1 mm. in terms of the curf then the calculation is 3. Cm - (2. mm + - 1. mm) answer. = 2.8 cm. or 2.7 cm. Since this question purports to be a woodwork question and as such is a practical question, then I live In a real world and not an imaginary mathematical world I have answered this as a woodwork teacher and not a mathematician. And so in conclusion, may I suggest that the person asking the question looks at a ruler and makes sure that the measurements are correct and not 1 tenth or 100th. of the actual measurements, or written incorrectly in cm. as opposed to metres which would make more sense.

She would just use scraps. What did he need it for? A grasshopper\u2019s swing? She must be hoping for some small grasshoppers. ",
