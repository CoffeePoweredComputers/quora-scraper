            "answer_text": "Note: this answer refers to the original details of the question, which were \"I want to learn Graph theory because someone told me that is useful in theoretical and system neuroscience.\" The easy but somewhat misleading answer is: See What are some good books for self-studying graph theory? A more honest answer is that your motivation for studying graph theory is quite misguided. What \"someone told you\" relies on the assumption that since neural networks can be modeled as graphs, the mathematical theory of graphs must be important in neuroscience.  There is a very limited amount of truth in that. It may be helpful to know about some basic concepts of graph theory when studying neuroscience but for the most part, the questions studied in a typical graph theory textbook would be entirely irrelevant for the serious study of system neuroscience or related disciplines.  There may be some very specific approaches to neuroscience that rely more heavily on the mathematics of graphs than others, but until you get very deep into the subject you're unlikely to benefit materially from this sort of abstract math.  Don't get me wrong - graph theory is fun to learn and very enriching intellectually. I'm not one to stop anyone from reading and solving problems in Diestel's or Bollobas' textbooks. But I'd caution anyone against diving into that just because someone told them it's useful for neuroscience. ",

            "answer_text": "I have the book you are looking for Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten Most presentations of quantitative information are poorly designed\u2014painfully so, often to the point of misinformation. This problem, however, is rarely noticed and even more rarely addressed. We use tables and graphs to communicate quantitative information: the critical numbers that measure the health, identify the opportunities, and forecast the future of our organizations. Even the best information is useless, however, if its story is poorly told. This problem exists because almost no one has ever been trained to design tables and graphs for effective and efficient communication. Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten is the most accessible, practical, and comprehensive guide to table and graph design available. The second edition of Show Me the Numbers improves on the first by polishing the content throughout (including updated figures) and adding 91 more pages of content, including: 1) A new preface; 2) A new chapter entitled \"Silly Graphs That Are Best Forsaken,\" which alerts readers to some of the current misuses of graphs such as donut charts, circle charts, unit charts, and funnel charts; 3) A new chapter about quantitative narrative entitled \"Telling Compelling Stories with Numbers\"; and 4) New appendices entitled \"Constructing Table Lens Displays in Excel,\" \"Constructing Box Plots in Excel,\" and \"Useful Color Palettes.\" ",
