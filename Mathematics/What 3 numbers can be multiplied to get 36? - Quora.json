            "answer_text": "An infinite set of 3 numbers can be used to get to 36: (36/(pi*pi), pi, pi) works for example or (36/127, 127, 1) also works or if you really want to get fancy and use imaginary numbers: (36i,i,-1) The follow up question then is how you want to constrain the question: In order to come to a finite amount of solutions, the problem has to be constrained to Integers (more on that later: just in case) only. If we limit the possible numbers we are allowed to use to the set of Natural or Whole numbers (Natural numbers being the counting numbers, and the Whole Numbers being the Natural numbers set + 0). We can get a finite amount of answers: (1,1,36),(1,2,18),(1,3,12),(1,4,9),(1,6,6),(2,2,9),(2,3,6), and(3,3,4) Edit: (I forgot to provide an explanation on how to find these answers): What am I about to suggest in regards to finding these Whole/Natural Number solutions is a brute force approach with a bit of math to reduce the number of possibilities . We take every factor of 36 : (1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36) 1.We go to the first factor 2.We divide 36 by the factor 3.Record every pair of factors with the original factor (Skipping over duplicates) 4.Move on to the next factor and repeat steps 2 and 3. If 36 divided by the original factor is less than the original factor you\u2019ve discovered every possible trio. If you want to extend the list to all Integers(the Whole Numbers + their negative counterparts) we simply have to apply the knowledge that two negatives multiplied together results in the same result as their positive counterparts being multiplied together, resulting in many more possibilities: (-36,-1,1), (-1,-1,36),(-2,-1,18),(-18,-1,2),(-18,-2,1),(-3,-1,12),(-12,-3,12),(-12,-1,3) \u2026etc. (In case the above isn\u2019t obvious, we\u2019re going through a finite amount of answers and taking every possible combination of negative counterparts that results in a positive answer) ",
