            "answer_text": "Well , it depends a lot on what you mean by concentrated. If you take HCl - hydrochloric acid. This has molar mass 36.5g/mol A 1.0M solution will contain 36.5g HCl in 1.0L of solution . This is 3.65g /100mL of solution , which is 3.65%m/v. Most people would consider this to be a dilute solution. But if you take a salt such as barium iodide : BaI2. This has molar mass = 391g/mol A 1.0M solution will contain 39.1g/100m solution. or 39.1%m/v. This is a concentrated solution in mass terms But in general I think that a 1.0M solution can be classified as dilute in terms of molarity. ",
