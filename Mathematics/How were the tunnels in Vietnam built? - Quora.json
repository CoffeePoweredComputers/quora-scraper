            "answer_text": "Tunnels during the Vietnam war were built the hard, old-fashioned way: by hands. The revolutionary forces (VC/NVA) and their sympathizers had no excavators, industrial drills or trucks, about the most technologically sophisticated tools they ever used were wheelbarrows, carts and pulleys. Amazingly, they managed to build 200 miles of tunnel in the famed Cu Chi district which was just 20 miles north of South Vietnamese capital Saigon and right next to the headquarters of the U.S. 25th \u201cTropic Lightning\u201d Infantry Division. The job included 3 main components: Digging:Each tunnel-digging team typically consisted of 3 men. First, two teams dug two \u201cdry wells\u201d about 10 meters apart from each other. These \u201cdry wells\u201d were shafts from the surface down 3 to 5 meters. Once reaching the required depth, the two teams would dig toward each other underground (and then downward). In each team, one man dug, another shoveled the earth into baskets then took them to the dry well where the other team member was waiting to haul the baskets up to the ground. Each dry well had to be filled after it had been dug.  New hoes or spades were just too cumbersome for digging underground, therefore diggers\u2019 favorite tools were worn-out spades and hoes the size of a bowl. Other tools included bamboo lifting poles, bamboo baskets, bamboo lifting tripods, etc.  (Image source: Viet Cong and NVA Tunnels and Fortifications of the Vietnam War, Gordon Rottman.) In case you\u2019re wondering, the shaft was called a \u201cdry well\u201d because it certainly looked that way: a well with no water. VCs in the Cu Chi area had studied carefully the geology of the area and knew that Cu Chi was about 12\u201315 meters above sea level, there was certainly no water for the first 6 meters down and the water table was usually found at about 10\u201315 meters. It was just perfect for tunneling. The work norm for earth excavation was about 1m3/person/day, but obviously this varied with the digger\u2019s age, health, the climate, and the soil. According to one digger\u2019s experience, only about 0.5m3 of earth was excavated per working day. Another digger recounted that during the dry season when the earth was as hard as rock, he could only dig about 30cm down in 6 hours. It was, however, easier to dig during the rainy season or near a ventilation hole where there was more oxygen. 2. Disposing of the earth Thousands of tons of earth was hauled from the underground tunnels to the surface, where did the VC hide it? They couldn\u2019t just pile up the freshly-dug earth into high, large mounds. Instead, the earth was made into house basements, furrows for farming or banks for communications and combat trenches. Sometimes it was poured into streams and the nearby Saigon River but never left heaped in mounds. If U.S. bombs hit somewhere near the tunnel sites, the VC would simply shovel the earth into the new bomb craters. Sometimes, they loaded the earth into carts and had water buffaloes pull the carts away from the tunnel sites to be disposed of elsewhere. It was all about common sense, some ingenuity and hard labor. 3. Camouflage: The real security for the tunnel system depended on the precise and cunning use of camouflage. Tom Mango\u2019s book \u201cThe tunnels of Cu Chi\u201d cited a captured VC document detailing tunnel camouflage techniques: If the duration of use [of the tunnel] is long, we should grow viable plants. Change dried leaves before [they get] dark, and blot out all suspicious traces before daybreak. Give a contrast to the camouflage by using high and low plants. Do not show a dull and prominent heap of earth. Plants and branches must be picked far from the fortifications and the troop\u2019s locations. When an emergency repair is necessary never pick up branches and leaves between the enemy and us, and especially do not gather a great number in one place. Many Vietnamese rural people had a natural eye for blending fortifications into the vegetation and terrain. As a result, VC tunnels were extremely well camouflaged and almost invisible to onlookers. When going on patrols in the Cu Chi district, U.S. infantrymen often reported finding hundreds of \u201cenemy bunkers and secret tunnels containing guerilla caches\u201d. But like their body count figures, these findings were wildly inaccurate. Cu Chi was in effect a free-strike zone for U.S. artillery and air force. General Ellis Williamson of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division specifically ordered artillery to be fired at regular intervals regardless of any military justification. He also had a policy of 1,000 outgoing artillery shells for every one incoming. Consequently, every single household in the Cu Chi district had to dig tunnels and bunkers for their own protection against indiscriminate U.S. shelling. The tunnels that U.S. infantrymen found were neither \u201csecret\u201d nor \u201cguerilla\u201d, they were little more than crude holes gouged out of hard earth. The real VC combat tunnels were to remain maddeningly elusive for years and could be found only with considerable luck or ingenuity. In fact, from its arrival in late 1965 to its departure in 1971 the 25th Division never found several secret VC tunnel entrances inside its own perimeters. ",
