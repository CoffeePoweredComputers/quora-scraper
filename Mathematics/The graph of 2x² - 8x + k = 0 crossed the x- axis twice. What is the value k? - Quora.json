Thus we are looking for the values of kk such that 2x2\u22128x+k=02x2\u22128x+k=0 has 22 real solutions. Using the quadratic formula x=8\u00b164\u22128k\u221a4x=8\u00b164\u22128k4, we see that the above is true when 64\u22128k>064\u22128k>0. Solving for kk shows that f(x)f(x) crosses the xx-axis twice when k<8k<8. ",
