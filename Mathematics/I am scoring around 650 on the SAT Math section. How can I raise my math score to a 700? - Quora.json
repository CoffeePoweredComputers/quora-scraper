            "answer_text": "Answer the grid-in/student-response questions first. You can\u2019t guess on those, so get those points before they\u2019re lost. Underline everything that seems useful, somehow it helps me remember and often prevents me from needing to reread the question multiple times. Understand the different types of questions. The SAT follows a pretty regular format, and if you know exactly what each type of question is looking for, it will save you valuable time and help you not fall into the same traps (for example, questions where they give you different solution sets to choose from\u2014e.g. {3,2} {3,2,1} {3}\u2014they are often trying to test if you remember to check and see if your solution is extraneous; don\u2019t rush on these ones and mistakenly assume your solutions are all correct, because they will rarely be). Don\u2019t wait too long on one question, circle and come back later. I had trouble with letting answers go, but it is crucial. Look at the answers before you start solving, you might actually be finding the wrong type of solution because you misunderstood the question. Also sometimes the answers are somewhat obvious and it\u2019s a waste of time to solve them (ex: convert this equation into point-slope, and then only one answer is in point-slope form\u2014yes I have seen these). Of course taking practice tests is one of the best ways to improve in your score, but only if you pay close attention to where you made mistakes (even if it appears to just be a word misread, look for any patterns). That\u2019s all I can think of in this moment, hope something helps! ",

As Nathan Chiu\u2019s answer says, take more practice tests. Importantly, don\u2019t just take them\u2014review them. Look at every math question you missed, and ask yourself why. If there was a rule or math fact that you didn\u2019t know, learn it. If you made a careless mistake, watch out for that sort of thing, and consider whether you were rushing through that question. If you got snared by one of ETS\u2019 tricks, look at what they did and why you fell for it. If you don\u2019t know why you got something wrong, ask someone for help. A 50 point improvement should be pretty attainable. Thanks for the A2A. ",

Practice makes you perfect. Take the most recent one, answer as if you are doing in a test center and within the prescribed time. Evaluate your answers, you have scoring sheet and also explanations to answers available. Review all wrong / guessed questions and understand how you can get them right next time. Adopt this iterative approach, until you complete all official tests and will definitely improve your overall score. ",
