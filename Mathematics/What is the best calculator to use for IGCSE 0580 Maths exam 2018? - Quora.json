            "answer_text": "The examination boards accept a wide range of calculators. The Casio FX 83GT Plus is very popular. The Casio FX 85GT plus give a few more functions but also solar power, although I have yet to hear of a Casio FX 83 Plus running out of battery in the middle of an exam. The FX 991ES Plus has even more functions, is faster and is useful for mathematics and physics at A Level. e.g. I used standard deviation at A Level, but my daughter got through until her second year degree doing engineering without having to use it. In the lab today I would use a laptop with more flexible software that can be edited than a calculator even one that can go back through the entries. The new range of ClassWiz calculators like the FX 991EX are used in US and Germany. There are four models in the US, but only one available in the UK other than by import - I got mine from India for half of the UK price of \u00a340. These remain a premium price and offer little over the other models for students. I thought with the new grade 1\u20139 exams with answers sometimes left in root form or in terms of pi it would be the preferred choice. The display is better but I can see the black ground carbon fibre appearance may cause some people with eye conditions to find it very hard to use. I need perfect lighting to use it but have no issue with older models. The English version lacks a useful function of converting repeated decimals to fractions. The German version FX 991DE has more functions including those that are useful whilst studying GCSE maths. Those going onto university may find that you have to have a Casio FX 83GT plus as no other calculator, even much older models passed down from the 1980s are permitted. Coming up for the exams in a few weeks stick with any that you are used to. For examinations later this year or next look out for the summer sales when you can get the FX 85GT Plus for \u00a36\u20137 and not the typical shop price of \u00a311.99 or more. There are always plenty on eBay but postage costs add significantly to the expense. ",

            "answer_text": "I suggest to use CASIO fx-85ES PLUS or CASIO fx-82ES. Both of them have better display especially showing the fractions and operations more clearly than the older ones. In our country, we ban students from using calculator such as CASIO fx-991ES PLUS which has the EQN and SOLVE buttons because these can calculate out the simultaneous equations and quadratic equations easily. Otherwise, follow your school\u2019s and country exam rules. ",
