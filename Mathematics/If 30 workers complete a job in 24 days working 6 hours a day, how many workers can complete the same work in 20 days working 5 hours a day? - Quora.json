            "answer_text": "Here 30 workers working 6 hours a day for 24 days complete the job. So the work requires 30*24*6 = 4320 worker-day-hours of input. So, to complete the job in 20 days working 5 hours a day will require: 4320/(20*5) = 43.20 men. Since you cannot have 0.2 man, engage 44 men for 19 days, that is 44*19*5 = 4180 worker-day-hours are executed and on the 20th day have (4320\u20134180/1*5 = 140/5 = 28 workers. So you require 44 workers for 19 days working 5 hours a day and on the 20th gay have only 28 workers working 5 hours. Check: 44 workers* 19 days * 5 hours + 28 workers* 1 days * 5 hours = 4180 + 140 or 4320 worker-day-hours of input. ",
