            "answer_text": "Algebraically, Let x = number of students that passed both quizzes, y = number of students that passed 1st quiz and failed 2nd quiz, z = number of students that passed 2nd quiz and failed 1st quiz. Thus, as per info given, 30 - x - y - z = 4, (1) x + y = 16 or x = 16 - y and (2) x + z = 20 or x = 20 - z. (3) Substituting eq. (2) into (1), 30 - (16 - y) - y - z = 4 or 30 - 16 + y - y - z = 4 or 14 - z = 4 or z = 14 -4 = 10. So z =10. (4) Also 16 - y = 20 - z because they are both equal to x as per eq. (2) and (3) above. (5) Substituting the value of z from (4) above into eq, (5), 16 - y = 20 -z = 20 -10 = 10 or y = 16 - 10 = 6. (6), Substituting the values of z (see (4)) and y (see (6)) into eq. (1), 30 - x - 6 - 10 = 4 or 14 - x = 4 or x = 14 - 4 =10. (7) Conclusion: x = 10 passed both quizzes. (see (7)), ",

            "answer_text": "14 failed the first test and out of that 4 also failed the second so 10 failed the first but passed the second. So out of the 20 that passed the second 10 had failed the first. So 10 people passed both. Going the other way you\u2019d get the same answer. 20 passed the second so 10 failed and out of that 4 also failed the first leaving 6 that failed the second but passed the first so again, 10 passed the first and the second.
