            "answer_text": "Both have to do with circular motion, but in very different ways. Suppose an object is in uniform circular motion. That is, it is traveling in a circle at constant speed. Think of swinging a ball on a string in a horizontal circle over your head. Because the ball and string is sweeping out a constantly changing angle (with respect to, say, the direction you are facing, we say that it has angular velocity in addition to its linear velocity tangential to the circular path. But if the speed of the ball is not changing (that is, it is in uniform circular motion), the angular velocity is constant, so the angular acceleration is zero.. However, since the direction the ball is traveling is constantly changing, the ball itself is accelerating. That is, the string is constantly pulling the ball into its circular motion, and that force due to tension in the string is always toward your hand (the center of the circle) so is called a centripetal force and the acceleration is called the centripetal acceleration. Now suppose you swing that ball ever faster. Since there is an ever increasing speed, the angular velocity of the ball and string is constantly increasing. So we say that the angular acceleration is the rate at which the angular velocity is changing. Notice that if the ball is traveling in a circle (or more generally, in any curved path) it is subject to centripetal acceleration. But only if the rate at which it sweeps out an angle is changing does it have angular acceleration. ",
