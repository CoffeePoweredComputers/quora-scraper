            "answer_text": "Let a equals to 0 Now, a.b = 0 bcz 0 multiplied by any number gives 0. Let b equals to 0 Again, a.b = 0 bcz 0 multiplied by any number gives 0. It means a.b = 0 if any of the a and b or both will be 0. But, question is asking for a.b>0 Now, let a<0 So, a.b<0 since any negative number multiplied by any positive number always gives a negative with b It means a.b <0 if any of the a and b is <0. It means for a.b = 0 a and b both must be either <0 or > 0. Thank you Hope you'll get your answer and find it easy to understand. ",
