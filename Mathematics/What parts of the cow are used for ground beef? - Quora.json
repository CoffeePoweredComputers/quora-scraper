            "answer_text": "A bit of good info on Wikipedia: Ground beef.  And Matt is on track. The real answer is that you can grind any part of a beef animal you want; it depends on your goals.  Do you want the best quality ground, or do you want to use the grinder to 'fix' toughness? I thought I'd add a personal anecdote.  We were recently surprised at our small ranch when we had to cull a ~10 year-old cow who went lame.  We decided to butcher the otherwise healthy animal for personal consumption with the help of our neighbour, who raised and butchered beef cattle for decades.  I went into it with the assumption that we'd grind the whole animal for burger, sausage, etc -- nasty old cow, right? My wise old neighbour kind of tricked me into a realization.  He said, \"Grind it all?  Okay.  Well, all right, how about we just cut a couple of steaks off this quarter and my wife can grill them for lunch.  Then we'll decide what to do.\"  I agreed, and after tasting the result -- right off the hanging quarter, to the grill and onto the plate -- I was reformed. It was juicy, lots of intramuscular fat (marbling), not too tough, and most importantly, INCREDIBLY flavourful.  I mean, wow.  Beef.  Yes.  I decided to cut a few roasts and a lot of steaks.  We've since barbequed a few of the steaks accounting for the age of the animal (marinate, bbq slow & low, rest, serve with a nice local wine and garden fresh salad) and been blown out of our chairs.  Mmm, writing this is making me hungry. This 'old cow = tough, poor quality' mentality is a US/Canada phenomenon (I'm sure shared by other regions I'm unfamiliar with as well).  According to Allan Nation in his book 'Grassfed to Finish', the French tend to prefer beef from an older animal.  A quote from a French meat cutter: \"A five-year-old cow is like a 36-year-old woman.  She is at the peak of her beauty.\"   He quotes a Parisian saying that French dairymen voluntarily cull 30% of their cow herd each year for beef sales.  That picky, enlightened people also apparently believes that ground meat should come from a MORE tender animal, because it will be cooked quickly and is less forgiving.  Compare this to North American assumption that the grinder is the way to take care of any tough meat. Increasingly, my opinion is that you can 'fix' tougher cuts by curing them or using appropriate cooking methods.  Think about beef brisket.  Lots of connective tissue, supports ~60% of the beast's weight.  Tough, right?  Hence, corned beef.  Pastrami.  Whole brisket smoked all day and all night by some crusty old Texan.  Mmm.  If you want a good burger, grind a good cut.  Sorry if this got a little off track and out of hand.  I hope some French & Texan folk chime in .  ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat parts of the cow are used for ground beef?\u201d Any and all parts of the cow an be ground, but ground beef is the cheapest beef, so if you\u2019re trying to make money, you\u2019d use as little as possible for grinding. I did work for a couple months, years ago, in a supermarket meat department. All the trimmings from other cuts of beef went into the \u2018to grind\u2019 pile. So those stickers that said \u2018Ground Chuck\u2019 or \u2018Ground Round\u2019 weren\u2019t exactly accurate. The fat content labels couldn\u2019t have been accurate either: the boss just eye balled how much fat was mixed in. I didn\u2019t like that job and got out as soon as I could. Thanks for asking me this question, Richard Annotico. ",
