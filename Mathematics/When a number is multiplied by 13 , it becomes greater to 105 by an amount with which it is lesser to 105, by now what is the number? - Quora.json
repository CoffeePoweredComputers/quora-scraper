Now as per the statement Initially number is less to 105 by an amount say y. so, 1st Equation can be made as : x = 105 + y. Now the number is multiplied by 13 and number is y more than 105. Second equation can be made as : 13x = 105 + y. Solving both equations we get x ( our number ) as 15 and y as 90. ",
