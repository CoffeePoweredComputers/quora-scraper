If you are looking for something totally general and have heard of Game Theory but don't entirely grasp even what it even is, I would watch the scene in \"A Beautiful Mind\" where Nash discovers out \"Governing Dynamics\" (and disproves Adam Smith) it is a cornerstone of Game Theory:     I would then start reading through the introductory and review notes (in addition to the class slides) from the Game Theory class at MIT (on Opencourseware) General \"Game Theory\" classes:MIT 04'http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/60693/14-126-fall-2004/contents/index.htm  MIT 10'http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-126-game-theory-spring-2010/lecture-notes/  There is also notes from the same class on a website (outside of opencourseware) form 2002:http://web.mit.edu/14.12/www/  Here's the 1st set of slides from the 2002 class:http://web.mit.edu/14.12/www/02F_slides102.pdf  Game Theory Applied to Specific Fields:\"Economic Applications for Game Theory\" looks pretty cool:http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-12-economic-applications-of-game-theory-fall-2005/lecture-notes/ \"Game Theory with Engineering Applications\":http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-254-game-theory-with-engineering-applications-spring-2010/  \"Game Theory and Political Theory\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/political-science/17-881-game-theory-and-political-theory-fall-2004/  or, Browse All of the classes:http://search.mit.edu/search?site=ocw&client=mit&getfields=*&output=xml_no_dtd&proxystylesheet=http://ocw.mit.edu/search/google-ocw.xsl&proxyreload=1&as_dt=i&oe=utf-8&departmentName=web&filter=0&courseName=&q=Game+Theory&btnG.x=0&btnG.y=0 Yale also has a course on Game Theory, I believe a lecture from it is posted:http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159  *as an aside, if I'm ever looking for some sort of general introduction on any topic I browse the online catalogue of courses on any of these kind of University Sites (or go to Khan Academy) UPennhttp://www.sas.upenn.edu/lps/online  Cornellhttp://www.sce.cornell.edu/dl/index.php  Yalehttp://oyc.yale.edu/  Columbiahttp://ci.columbia.edu/ci/ecourses/index.html  There are also a TON on iTunes University ",
