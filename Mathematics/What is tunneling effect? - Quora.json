            "answer_text": "Suppose we have a potential barrier of height \u201cV\u201d and the energy of the incident particle is \u201cE\u201d. Now, two situations may arise:- 1. The incident particle has energy greater than the height of the barrier i.e., E > V. 2. The incident particle has energy less than the height of the barrier i.e., E < V. Classically, the particle has sufficient energy to cross the barrier in 1st case, so whole of the energy gets transmitted through the barrier, while in 2nd case it would not be possible for the particle to cross the barrier, it would be completed reflected. However, quantum mechanically there is a finite probability of finding the particle even in E < V, this is called quantum tunneling. It is attributed to the fact that particles are described by waves in Quantum mechanics, and in E < V incident particles would also transmit in the barrier region due to their wave nature and their probability decays exponentially.

            "answer_text": "Classical physics predicts that particle can cross the potential energy barrier only when it has higher energy than the barrier height . The quantum mechanics theory predicts that particles with less energy may pass from one side of the barrier to the side if the particle has very low mass . A particle with mass \u201cm\u201d and velocity \u201cv\u201d has wave length given by Lambda = h/mv. The wave properties of the particle become significant if the wave length is large enough to be detected . This is possible if the mass is small. Electron exhibiting the dufferaction from a crystal latice and emission of electrons from metal at low temperature are example of \u201c Tunneling\u201d. ",
