            "answer_text": "I don't think the basic mathematics have any philosophical bent (think Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and Geometry). Those are all just describing the behavior of functions and what properties shapes have.   Calculus 1 is learning techniques on how to deal with the limits of certain functions, and on finding areas under certain functions.   To me, all of those basic math courses are doing is showing you \"how to play the game\". You can't appraise/evaluate (philosophize about) \"the game\" unless you know how to play it.  I haven't taken Calculus 2, but I bet for more than half of it, you're still learning to \"play the game\". For a while you're learning to \"play the game\", and only until junior or senior level math courses would you even think of Philosophy within a math context.  So the answer is no to your first question...Boolean logic can be taught separately from math courses (and oftentimes is). You could probably take a Symbolic Logic course after Algebra 2 and do just fine.  I think the level of math (based on mathematical proofs) required to sufficiently appraise/evaluate math is probably pretty high. Junior or senior undergraduate (math major) level is my best guess. You could ask the broader TOK questions (\"How do we know that we know math?\" ie that math is true) but those answers lie in proofs and axioms of Math itself. If you understand the proof and axioms you know why we know that we know math (why we know that math is true). The answer is that we use deduction to know math and mathematical principles which we then build a system from further deducation. To handle such proofs requires a high caliber of math. This question is not answered by Philosophy alone. Rather, it is answered by using Philosophy to guide the inquiry & is sufficiently answered by Math itself.  The topic of deduction is a philosophical one, but it's clearly too general to be directly connected to math alone. As such, it's not necessarily both a mathematical and philosophical concern. ",

            "answer_text": "Socrates\u2019 Meno is the connection. There is an explanation of what is going on at Math Forum - Ask Dr. Math. The way I look at it, philosphers and scientists are searching for some kind of truth. Most of modern science would be incomprehensible to an ancient philospher, but the same is not necessarily true for quite advanced mathematics. For example, a ball (cannonball shot or tennis ball thrown) travels in a parabola. That it does so is due to gravity, which as a force accelerates bodies towards each other. This can be described mathematically just as the doubling of the square in Meno can, but is mathematically the result of integrating a constant (g) twice to get a position (height). Mathematics is also used to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which describes how matter behaves on very small scales. This is probably why modern philosphers prefer to argue about simpler things than physics, but causes lovely headaches for non-philosophers. As you said, logic is the main area of overlap, but another connection is Bertrand Russell, who together with Whitehead had a go at some interesting mathematical logic but also was an excellent philosopher.
