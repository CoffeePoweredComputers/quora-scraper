            "answer_text": "It depends. First students need to learn multiplication tables. Period! Then learn basic math and algebra the long hand way. This is simply a learning method to instill an ability for problem solving and to know the steps needed to solve a problem. Then with working harder problems like \u201cword problems \u201c then use a calculator to reduce simple errors like multiplying 2 2 digit numbers or finding a square root. I graduated high school in 1975. This is how I learned math. Calculators barely were out when I went to college. Because of the steps I took in learning math i can do some more complex problems in my head whereas high school student going into college can\u2019t multiply 6 by 7 without a calculator. A calculator is for accuracy in solving problems and not for side stepping the need to learn HOW to solve problems. The educational system in this country has gone to shit over the past decades by not teaching kids how to learn. And don\u2019t get me started on SOL tests that kids are taught how to pass multiple choice tests instead of them learning the subject. ",

            "answer_text": "In many classes calculators are allowed. In Algebra I and Algebra II, using the calculator is one of the skills you are supposed to acquire. So it\u2019s actually mandatory. And the school should supply them, both for class and for end of course exams. But calculators are not encouraged when you are learning algorithms for arithmetic, when you are combining fractions, when you are converting between decimals and percentages, and lots of other places. During these kinds of activities a calculator would replace practice and reduce your exposure to numbers and values. Practice and exposure to numbers and algorithms create in your brain something called number sense. Number sense is that part of your brain that looks at an answer and thinks \u201cthat can\u2019t be right.\u201d It\u2019s the feeling you have both when a sum or product makes sense and when it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s the hugeness of large numbers and the smallness of tiny numbers, and how they fit together, turned into an intuition that you will apply throughout your life. You develop number sense by playing with numbers. But if you use a calculator, you are not playing with numbers as much. Your number sense will develop slower. If it develops at all. Plus, calculators can be expensive. It would hardly be fair to let only the rich students use calculators. ",
