Thus it can improve your understanding level.And with a glance you should be able to find the type of that question.I am mentioning some types here. Difference of Numbers: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 , 30, \u2026?.., \u2026?\u2026. 5, 6, 10, 19, 35, \u2026?.., \u2026?\u2026. difference of squares Difference of Differences or Progressive differences: 5, 6, 9, 14, 21, \u2026?.., \u2026?\u2026. Multiplication of previous term: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, (this is Geometric series also) If difference is becoming huge it may be based on multiplication Fractional Multiplication: 5, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 15, 37.5, \u2026?.., \u2026?\u2026. Multiplication and Plus or Minus: 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, \u2026?.., \u2026?\u2026. (x 2 +1 , x 2 - 1 ) Random pattern: 66, 36, 18, \u2026?.. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, \u2026?.., \u2026?\u2026.

Try checking differences between terms, and the differences between those differences and so on.Try using squares or cubes of numbers combined with adding or subtracting numbers.If these don't work, try to think outside the box. Like days of the week, years of the month, characters in a series. Maybe it's the letters of some word and the numbers are just characters in the alphabet.Usually these three can help you a lot. Although you can always ask for hints. Hope this helps. -/T/ ",
