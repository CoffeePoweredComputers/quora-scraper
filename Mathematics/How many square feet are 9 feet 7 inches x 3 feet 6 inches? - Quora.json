            "answer_text": "When dealing with mixed variables, like feet and inches, I try to express them in one variable, either square feet or square inches, then convert the answer to the units that were asked for, as a final step. It\u2019s much less confusing that way, especially when you\u2019re dealing with numbers in base 12. The reason that the Metric system is SO much easier to work with is that it\u2019s in base ten. Want to multiply or divide by 10? Easy, just move the decimal. The numbers we\u2019re dealing with, here, are not going to translate to whole feet, so we will work in inches. 9\u2032 7\u2033 = 115\u2033 and 3\u2032 6\u2033 = 42\u2033. The question asks for Area; the formula for Area is A = L X W. 115\u2033 X 42\u2033 = 4,830 in\u00b2. We have our answer, but since the question specifies an answer in square feet, we will have to convert in\u00b2. to ft\u00b2. There are 144 in\u00b2 per ft\u00b2. 4,830 in\u00b2 \u00f7 144 in\u00b2 = 33.54166667 ft\u00b2 or 33 ft\u00b2 78 in\u00b2. Either answer is correct, but I think it best, clearer to give the remaining area in the exact number of in\u00b2, rather than as 0.54166667 ft\u00b2. But it might be even better to give the remaining square inches in both forms, if you\u2019re dealing with an instructor who is highly precise; after all, the question DOES specify \u2018square feet\u2019. Perhaps the answer with square feet would be better for the instructor; the answer with the exact number of square inches would certainly be more useful to the Carpenter or other craftsman who has to deal with his project.

            "answer_text": "In the rectangle: Area = Length x Width. Length = 9 feet 7 inches. Width = 3 feet 6 inches. Convert Length 9*(12)+7 = 115 inches. Convert Width 3*(12) +6 = 42 inches. Area = Length x Width. Area = 115 * 42 inches. Area = 4830 inches. Convert area to square feet: 4830 inches/144 = 33.54166666666666667 Therefore there are approximately 33.5416 square feet in an object 9 feet 7 inches by 3 feet 6 inches. ",
