            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll add a caveat to your question \u2014 as written, the answer is \u201cinfinite,\u201d as every real number between 100 and 300 can be divided by 7, although not all of them are evenly divisible (for example, 50*Pi is in between 100 and 300, but [50*Pi/7] is not a whole number). So, I\u2019ll answer the related question, \u201cHow many whole numbers between 100 and 300 are evenly divisible by 7?\u201d Let\u2019s start with finding the smallest and largest numbers that fit. The smallest number greater than 100 evenly divisible by 7 is 105, or 7*15. The largest number less than 300 evenly divisible by 7 is 294, or 7*42. Every number that can be written as 7*N where N is between 15 and 42 is evenly divisible by 7 and between 100 and 300. So now, you know that the list you\u2019re looking for is the list of numbers [7*15, 7*16, \u2026 , 7*42]. Drop the \u201c7*\u201d from each element, and you\u2019ve got a list of 15 through 42. Shift that back so the first element is 1 (subtract 14 from each, basically), and you\u2019ve got 1 through 28. There are 28 numbers evenly divisible by 7 between 100 and 300. ",
