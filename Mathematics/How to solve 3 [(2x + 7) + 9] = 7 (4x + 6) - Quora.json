            "answer_text": "First step pass the 3 from left side to right side : 2x+7+9 = (7/3)(4x+6) <=> 2x+16 = (28/3)x+14 Then you regroup all the terms including \u201cx\u201d on one side, the plain numbers on the other side : 2x - (28/3)x = -2 <=> (2-(28/3))x = -2 <=> [(6\u201328)/3]x = -2 <=> -(22/3)x = -2 <=> (22/3)x = 2 Finally, you divide both sides by the value multiplicating \u201cx\u201d to have the result for 1*x : <=> x = 2*(3/22) => x = 3/11 Now don't forget to verify your answer : 3*[(2*(3/11)+7+9] = 3*[(6/11)+16] = 3*(182/11) = 546/11 7*(4*(3/11)+6) = 7*[(12/11)+6] = 7*(78/11) = 546/11 So x = 3/11 Here I have detailed most of the steps so you understand more clearly. But with time, you will see that you will process some of the steps in your head and only write down a part of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Start by simplifying each side. For the left side: 3[(2x+7)+9] Starting from the inside and moving out. Layers are defined by parentheses/brackets: 2x+7: We can\u2019t add 2x+7. We move on out to the next layer.(2x+7)+9: We can add the 7 and 9, resulting in 2x+16.3[2x+16]: We can multiply both values by 3, resulting in 6x+48.Simplified left side: 6x+48Now for the right side: 7(4x+6) 4x+6: We can\u2019t add 4x and 6. Move on to the next layer.7(4x+6): We can multiply both values within the parentheses by 7, resulting in 28x+42.Simplified right side: 28x+42Now we set both sides equal to each other and solve for x. 6x+48=28x+42 6=22x 6/22=0.27272727273=x There you go.
