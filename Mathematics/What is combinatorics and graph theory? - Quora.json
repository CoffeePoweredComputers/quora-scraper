            "answer_text": "Combinatorics is how to \u201ccount\u201d the number of combinations. For example: I have a system to test with 4 redundant buses. The system should report a warning should any two buses fail. How many Test Cases are necessary to test for all bus failure reporting conditions? Graph Theory is about understanding the connection between nodes. The two most heavly used algorithms I use are: 1. Transive Closure and 2. Topological sort. We ave A goes to B and B goes to C. Transitive closure would tell use A also goes to C. Topological sort tells you who is connected, who are roots, and who are the leaves. A call tree is a result of a topological sort. ",
