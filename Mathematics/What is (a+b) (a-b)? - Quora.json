            "answer_text": "To solve this problem, you will want to FOIL. That is, multiply the Firsts (the left-most terms in each parentheses (the 1st term in the 1st parentheses by the 1st term in the 2nd parentheses)), Then, multiply the Outers (the terms on the far left and right (the 1st term in the 1st parentheses by the 2nd term of the 2nd parentheses)), Then, multiply the Inners (the two terms closest to the center (that is, the 2nd term of the 1st parentheses by the 1st term of the 2nd parentheses)), Finally, multiply the Lasts (the right-most terms in each parentheses (the 2nd term of the 1st parentheses by the 2nd term of the 2nd parentheses)). (Firsts, Outers, Inners, Lasts \u2192 F.O.I.L.) Now, apply it! (A + B) (A - B) \u2192 Firsts: A * A = A^2 (A squared) \u2192 Outers: A * (-B) = (-AB) \u2192 Inners: B * A = AB \u2192 Lasts: B * (-B) = (-B^2) Now, add the products together: A^2 + (-AB) + AB + (-B^2) = A^2 - AB + AB - B^2 \u2192 Like terms AB cancel to get your final answer \u2192 A^2 - B^2. Hope that helps! (P.S. This type of problem is called a Difference of Squares, as the solution is one perfect square (A^2) minus another (B^2)). ",

            "answer_text": "Obtained by multiplying (a\u2013b) times (a+b). You need remember that the minus sign goes with (\u2013b), because you might just as well have written (a + (\u2013b)) in place of (a \u2013 b) So (a \u2013 b) (a + b) = (a + (\u2013b))(a + b ) = a2 + (\u2013b) a + ab + (\u2013b)b = a2 \u2013 ba + ab \u2013 b2 = a2 \u2013 b2 Rewriting just the beginning and the end (a \u2013 b)(a + b) = a2 \u2013 b2 This too will be useful in deriving the theorem of Pythagoras, in a different way. Finally, two more identities which you may occasionally encounter: (a \u2013 b)(a2 + ab + b2) = a3 \u2013 b3 (a + b)(a2 \u2013 ab + b2) = a3 + b3 ",
