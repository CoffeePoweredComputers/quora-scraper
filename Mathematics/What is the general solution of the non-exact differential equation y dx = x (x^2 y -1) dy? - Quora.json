            "answer_text": "The equation ydx = x(x^2y -1 ) can be rewritten as dx/dy = x^3 - x/y , or in the Bernoulli\u2019s form dx/dy +x/y = x^3 . Take x = V(y)^(-1/2) and the equation becomes V\u2019 - 2/y = -2 which is an ordinary and linear first order DE in normal form. The integrating factor is 1/y^2 and the solution is given by V = (y^2)[ Integral of ( -2dy/y^2 ) + C ] . Follows V = 2y + Cy^2 and the solution (2y + Cy^2)x^2 -1 =0 . ",
