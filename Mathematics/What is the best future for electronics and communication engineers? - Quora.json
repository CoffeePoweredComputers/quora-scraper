            "answer_text": "Being an Electronics & Communications Engineer I m telling to you honestly . If you are able to move with IT then only EC have some future otherwise simply planning to go in core then right now nothing in indian industry. Because of in indian electronics industry there is only few companies are there who are manufacturing products other wise all the core electronics companies are simply importing materials from China with garbage quality's n assembling here put Make in India tag and started selling. For assembling purpose they are hiring some semi skilled ITI guyes or simply graduate boys because of the have to pay less for assembling and normal graduate or ITI holder are ready to work with 8k\u201312k salary.. They didn't hire B.tech guyes because first of all the initial amount they giving is too less if they agreed to work they will surely left with in a year after learning something.thats why these companies will not prefer to hire btech guyes. Telecom companies are also hiring normal graduate because of their less paying policy.they hire some two are three top institute graduates except that they will prefer normal graduate. 2nd option for GATE there are very few electronics PSUs in india . only few vacancies are there and in market there are too many competition is there approx 10k students all over india are making prepration for GATE it will increase every year. After taking degree 80%of indian parents are not allowing for any prepration same for students they don't want to study some more for 1\u20132 year . Maximum ECE graduate join IT because of this .They learn programming or other IT courses and move to IT. In india nothing is in market for electronics graduate except some top institute student's. And the other part of the answer is If you are planning to go in IT then it's very bright future. Start learning some programming languages as well as some IT courses during your B.Tech . Try to focus on some latest IT technology like SAP,Hadoop etc and languages JAVA,.net ,PHP etc . These courses will help you to provide you highly paying job in initially. After you'll get some 2\u20133 years experience you will move anywhere in IT industry. Edit- above answer based on my 2 years experience of industry and also I m sure it's for every normal ECE graduate. ",

            "answer_text": "The future scope of Electronics & Communication Engineers are quite bright.They have Plenty of Career Options. There are many sectors which provides them opportunity to enhance their skills. Here I have listed some of the career Options which can be choose by an ECE Graduate.  Job Option: This option is mostly Preferred by freshers. Their are lots of job options available for ECE Students. I have divided the job options here into different sectors so that one can analyse that how many sectors they have to work.Networking Sector: Electronics Engineers can go in Networking sectors Job. Some big companies like Cisco and other provides this Opportunity. They can get some handsome amount of wages too.IT Sector: Electronics students can go for this sector too. This sectors demands a good knowledge in Programming Languages. After gaining some experience good amount of money can also be earned.Core Electronics Sector: This is definitely on the first priority for the students. Working in the core Industry is somewhat the dream of many students so that they can apply their knowledge. But the worst part is that its not a cake walk to get a job in the core industry easily. Starting salary might also be low.Marketing Sector Jobs: Marketing sector jobs demands a good communication skills and good knowledge of English. Salary range is quite large in it.2. Government Job Options: There are many students who preferred to work in government sector job rather than work in Private sector job. ECE Students can go for government sectors job too. It is Required to beat Competition to be select in government jobs. ISRO, DRDO, BARC, CSIR, IAS, PCS these are some of the options where an ECE Studnets can get the job. Along with it they can go for Bank PO exam, SSC-CGL and many more. 3. Higher Study Option: Some students can choose higher study as their career options . Most of the students choose these options for their higher studies: GATE: Most students go for M.tech. GATE is an exam which provides an opportunity to do the M.tech from some Reputed Institute of India. Not only in M.tech Gate score is also used in PSUs for job Purpose.CAT: CAT Exam is given by many candidates who seek to take admissions in MBA. CAT is the second most preferred option by ECE Students for their further study Option.4. Entrepreneurship: It is the new sector which is attracting the students very much. Number of students who wants to become an entrepreneur is less but this field is growing very fast. Now a days students are working on their own Ideas and converting those Ideas as a product. So, these are some of the options which ECE Students can use to give their career a new shape. Thank you all for reading this answer. Cheers!!!!!!! ",
