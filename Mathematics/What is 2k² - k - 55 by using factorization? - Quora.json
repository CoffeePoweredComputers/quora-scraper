            "answer_text": "2k^2 - k - 55 All based on this idea: (ax+b)(cx+d) = acx^2 + (bc+ad)x + bd In words, we need factors of a*c (2 in our case) to build the coefficient on x^2 and we need factors of bd (55 in our case) to build the constant term. The coefficient on x is a slightly more complicated expression involving factors from ac and bd. It MUST look like this when we\u2019re done factoring: (2k __ __)(k __ __) \u2014 Since 2 has no factorization other that 2 * 1 We\u2019re done with the \u201cac\u201d part. Seek now the factorization of 55. 1 * 55 5 * 11 That\u2019s it Now, it MUST look like one of these: (2k __ 1)(k __ 55) (2k __ 55)(k __ 1) (2k __ 5)(k __ 11) (2k __ 11)(k __ 5) We\u2019re done with the \u201cbd\u201d part. To be honest, this can be a very large list in some problems. We\u2019re pretty lucky on this one. Finally, figure out which one works. (2k __ 1)(k __ 55) ==> 2*55 = 110 & 1*1 = 1 \u2014 That will never get us to 1. 110 + 1 = 111 and 110 - 1 = 109 (2k __ 55)(k __ 1) ==> 2*1 = 1 & 55*1 = 55 \u2014 That will never get us to 1. 55 + 1 = 56 and 55 - 1 = 54 (2k __ 5)(k __ 11) ==> 2*11 = 22 & 5*1 = 5 \u2014 That will never get us to 1. 22 + 5 = 27 and 22 - 5 = 17 (2k __ 11)(k __ 5) ==> 2*5 = 10 & 11*1 = 11 \u2014 11 \u2013 10 = 1!!! This is what we seek. We just need the right signs in the right places. Now, it MUST look like one of these: (2k + 11)(k - 5) = 2k^2 + k - 55 \u2014 Nope. (2k - 11)(k + 5) = 2k^2 - k - 55 \u2014 Yup. What we\u2019ve done is chop the problem up into pieces. No need to think of all the numbers at the same time. Note: There are several other ways to proceed. None is particularly more convenient in every case. Some problems suggest some process. Get to know the several methods and, after a while, your brain will tell you the best way to proceed for a given problem. ",
