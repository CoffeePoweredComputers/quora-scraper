            "answer_text": "Honestly I have no idea about why hamburgers are usually made from ground beef rather than ground pork because it is supposed to be \u2018Ham\u2019, right? I guess pork is more loaded with lard which means more of cholesterol that many people avoid for health reason. I can recall 2 decades before when I went to a restaurant in Hamburg, I ordered sauted vegetables but notified that I did not want the lard (I do not eat or touch anything related to pig), then the cook told me that the restaurant did not use lard because of health reason. And despite of the fact that pork is consumed by millions of people over the world, there also millions who do not eat it for either religious reason or other. Therefore, Hamburger is still labelled as Hamburger instead of Beefburger for keeping the orginal label or name. That\u2019s only my thought over your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the \u201cham\u201d in hamburger doesn\u2019t reference the meat. Before the hamburger on the bun there was Hamburg style steak, with Hamburg coming from the name of a German city. At one point they started serving the Hamburg style steak on bread and by the late 1800\u2019s they started calling that a Hamburger steak sandwich (the switch from Hamburg to Hamburger may be related to German immigrants from Hamburg being associated with it as Hamburger with a capital H indicates someone from Hamburg). From there it got shortened to the point they just called it a hamburger. ",
