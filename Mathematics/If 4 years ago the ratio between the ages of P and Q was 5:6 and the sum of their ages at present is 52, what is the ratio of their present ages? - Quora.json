Let the present ages of P be x years and Q be y years The sum of their ages at present is 52, it means x + y = 52 x = 52 - y\u2026Eq..1 4 years ago the ratio between the ages of P and Q was 5:6 4 years ago the age of P was x - 4 and Q's age y - 4 The ratio between their ages (x - 4)/(y - 4) = 5/6 Cross multiplication 6 (x - 4) = 5 (y - 4) 6x - 24 = 5y - 20 6x - 5y = 24 - 20 6x - 5y = 4\u2026Eq..2 Substituting the value of x from Eq..1 to Eq..2 6x - 5y = 4 6 (52 - y) - 5y = 4 312 - 6y - 5y = 4 --11y = \u2014312 + 4 --11y = \u2014308 11y = 308 y = 308/11 y = 28 The present age of Q is 26 years Substituting value of y in Eq. 1 to derive value of x x = 52 - y x = 52 - 28 x = 24 The present age of P is 24 years The ratio of their present ages P/Q = 24/28 = 6/7 Ratio of P : Q = 6 : 7 Answer: the ratio of present ages of P and Q is 6:7 and their present ages, P is 24 years and Q is 28 years ",
