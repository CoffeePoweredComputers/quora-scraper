When D=0, there is one real \u201cdouble\u201d root. When D < 0, there are no real roots. For the quadratic you have, q=1, r=-a, and s=b D=r^2\u20134qs=(-a)^2\u20134(1)(b)=a^2\u20134b since the coefficient r=-a is squared, r^2 is positive-definite. Moreover, a^2\u20134b >= 0 for real roots a^2 >= 4b Solution: b <= (a^2)/4 ",
