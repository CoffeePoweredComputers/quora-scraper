            "answer_text": "This is a circle: (I apologise for the size of the images)  Now let\u2019s make several points on it:   (the black point in the middle is approximately where the centre of the circle is) Now let\u2019s connect them all in to the centre:  They all take up reasonably the same distance, and if not, then it\u2019s because I misplaced the centre slightly. So every point on the circle has the same distance to the centre as the other points. Therefore, when a point is connected to the centre, that line is one of an infinite number of radii.
