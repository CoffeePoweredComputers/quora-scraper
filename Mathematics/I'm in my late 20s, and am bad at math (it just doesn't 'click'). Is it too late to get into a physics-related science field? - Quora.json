            "answer_text": "It seems like the obvious answer is to just learn math. It doesn\u2019t require you to be a super genius or even intelligent. I know plenty of people who are extremely stupid and have degrees in mathematics. I\u2019ve always had a hard time learning mathematics in a classroom. Generally, I have to read the books on my own to truly learn anything. It is possible that you just haven\u2019t discovered the method which will help you learn the best. You should devote time to finding out what works for you. Here are some things to try: 1.) Read the book from the class. 2.) Watch a youtube video on the topic. I suggest patrickJMT. His videos go through graduate school level mathematics. 3.) Attend class and take notes 4.) Work with your friends. This one is really somewhat of a hidden gem. I\u2019ve been lost many times until I heard a peer explain something to me. One thing I should say is that many schools consider Algebra to be their lowest for credit math class. It is possible your math skills are not high enough to succeed at algebra yet. In which case you\u2019re struggling because you don\u2019t have prerequisite knowledge. Kids are often pushed into these classes by the university\u2019s placement department because the college\u2019s mathematics examination is awful. For example, when I was a TA for an algebra class I occasionally encountered students who didn\u2019t know their multiplication tables. So you should consider that you may need to take a remedial math class. Talk to your professor and see what he/she thinks. It is probably possible to succeed at physics without being good at math. However, we\u2019re still talking about the calculus III and differential equations level of mathematics. This is usually considered to be basic mathematics. It might seem extremely advanced to you right now, but I assure you it is the absolute minimum for any physics degree. Good luck. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the math. It is definitely possible for you to do it. You might just have to change some habits. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it is never too late. To actually do this successfully, however, you will need to get your math up to speed. However, you can\u2019t fix anything unless you know what exactly the problem is. For example, are you unable to wrap your head around applications of calculus and formulate problems as differential equations, are you struggling with combinatorics because you didn\u2019t understand the underlying counting principles well enough, or even more fundamentally, do have issues with high-school level algebra? If you aren\u2019t sure, you should spend a few hours meeting with someone who can help you figure this out - it doesn\u2019t have to be a math teacher or even a mathematician. It could be a friend/acquaintance who has a keen knack for explaining and teaching things, even if their job isn\u2019t teaching. Once you figure out what the deficiencies are, you can work on remediating them - you can try to teach yourself from books at the appropriate level, or take actual classes. This will take a lot of time and effort, and it is ultimately you who has to decide if it is worth it. In summary, first identify the nature of your problem, and then think about whether you want to take the next steps. ",
