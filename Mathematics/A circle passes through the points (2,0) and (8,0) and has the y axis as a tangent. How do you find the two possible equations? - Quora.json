            "answer_text": "An important skill in maths is being able to simplify a problem. Your run-of-the-mill garden mathematician will probably start by drawing or imagining a sketch like this (apologies to AJ Nelson, whose answer I nicked this from):  Don\u2019t. Let me show you how to do this with the minimum of effort. Our first step is to roll the plane up into a vertical cylinder, so that the y-axis is on the surface, pointing along the cylinder, and the x-axis curls back round on itself. Furthermore, let the circumference of the cylinder be 1. See what I did there? Now the points (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) ... (8,0) are all the same point!! We have reduced our problem to the following: find the equation of the circle that goes through the origin and has the y-axis as a tangent. Something like this:  Of course, there are an infinite number of such circles (I\u2019ve drawn three, in red), so to decide which one to pick, I suggest the following: since the question mentions two points that the circle goes through, pick the smallest circle that goes through the origin twice, like this:  The centre of this circle is at [math]\\frac{1}{2}[/math] and has radius [math]\\frac{1}{2}[/math], so the equation is [math](x-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}[/math]. I hope this helps! ",
