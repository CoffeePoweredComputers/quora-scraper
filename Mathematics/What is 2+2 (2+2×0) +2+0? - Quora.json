            "answer_text": "Geez, doesn\u2019t anyone ever remember the proper order of operations? This sort of inane question keeps coming up time after time. It\u2019s a simple as hell 6th grade level problem. Some folks on here call it BODMAS, here in the States it\u2019s called PEMDAS with the catchy mnemonic of \u201cPlease excuse my dear Aunt Sally\u201d to help memorize it or as I preferred, \u201cPlease Excuse My Deranged Algebra Students\u201d.Levels of priority are as follow: Any function or operation inside a parentheses (P) is performed first, and still follows the order of operations internally.Next level is Exponentiation (E) which can be either a power or a root. If there is a parentheses with an exponent outside it or a parentheses underneath a root symbol, do the parentheses first, then complete the operation of the root or exponent of that result.The following level is Multiplication and Division, done left to right in sequential order, with only the immediate terms either side of the operation sign.The final and last step is to perform the addition and subtraction operations, going from left to right.Keep in mind here that a simple six function calculator will not perform the correct order of operation when a calculation is keyed in sequence as read. That requires a scientific calculator. Most smart phones have both versions, and the iPhones can be rotated sideways to go into the scientific mode. Here is the problems broken down step by step using the PEMDAS method, which again is the only correct way to do this; 2+2(2+2x0)+2+0=? 2+2(2+2x0)+2+0= The term inside the parentheses is solved first2+2(2+0)+2+0= 2x0 is the first part solved, answer is 02+2(2+0)+2+0= (2+0)=2; this completes the parentheses2+2(2)+2+0= Next in line is multiplication and division done left to right in sequence, and a number in front of a parentheses is understood to mean multiplication; 2x(2)=42+4+2+0=8 Finally addition and subtraction done left to right to wrap it up.I would suggest you stop texting in class and surfing the net with your phone and start paying attention to what is happening in front of you. Take notes, work examples and pay attention. I used to assign order of operation problems with a dozen or more operations in much more complicated problems than this to 8th grade students who were only operating at the 6th grade level. They were able to break it down step by step just as I\u2019ve shown here. Wake up and get a clue. Step 2 is where the most mistakes take place at.",

            "answer_text": "Sadly, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a lot of answers citing PEMDAS, BODMAS, and other similar acronyms. Please know that these are all only memory devices some people use to teach/learn the order of operations. All of those acronyms stand for the same thing. They just use different words (e.g., parentheses or brackets - same thing), so the acronyms are slightly different. Please refer to the actual rules of precedence, for that is how you can know how to solve a problem with mixed operations such as this one. This is the order of operations, directly from a McGraw-Hill math text.  So, let\u2019s look at the problem you presented\u20262+2(2+2x0)+2+0 First, I\u2019m going to fix the notation a little bit because you really should not use an x for multiplication. Most people use an asterisk or a vertically centered dot. 2+2(2+2*0)+2+0 Now we\u2019re ready for the steps cited above. Step 1 - Solve inside of the grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces). Note that you follow the same precedence rules inside of the parentheses. We have mixed operations inside of the parentheses, so we need to follow the same rules inside there. That means we\u2019re going to multiply first, then add, but inside only. So now we have: 2+2(2+0)+2+0 And then, still solving inside of the grouping symbols 2+2(2)+2+0 Step 2 is to resolve exponents and roots, but there are none, so we continue. Step 3, as we did before, multiply (or divide) left to right, as they appear. 2+4+2+0 Step 4, add it all together =8 All of that said, it is worrisome when someone old enough to be on Quora is struggling with fundamental arithmetic. What specific questions do you have about this problem and/or others like it? You could have just as easily entered this into a math engine or calculator, but you chose to ask here, so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s a deeper question? What\u2019s up? ",

Perform the operations inside the symbols of inclusion (parentheses, brackets, braces) and above and below each fraction bar. Start with the innermost inclusion symbol. (2.) Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order in which they appear from left to right. (3.)

I forgot multiplication comes before addition. In the brackets it would be 2*0 = 0 and 2 + 0 = 2. x = 2 + 2 (2 + 2 * 0) + 2 + 0 x = 2 + 2 (2 + 0) + 2 + 0 Add only the two\u2019s cancelling out the zeros. Which leaves 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 x = 4 + (2) + 2 x = 4 + 2 + 2 x = 4 + 4 x = 8 Therefore x = 8 and not 6. A simple error I overlooked from getting distracted. It still is however simple math to do. ",
