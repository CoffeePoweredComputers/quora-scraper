            "answer_text": "There have been geometric answers already, but here is how to power through the calculus. The plan: let [math]x[/math] be the missing side of the triangle. You can see that [math]1\\leq x\\leq 3[/math]. Get the missing angle [math]A[/math] as a function of [math]x[/math], and then maximize the function on this interval. Step 1: By the Law of Cosines, [math]1^2=2^2+x^2-4x\\cos(A)[/math] Step 2: Solve for [math]\\cos(A)[/math]: [math]1=4+x^2-4x\\cos(A)[/math] [math]\\frac{x^2+3}{4x}=\\cos(A)[/math] Step 3: We want to maximize [math]A[/math]. Since [math]\\cos(A)[/math] is a decreasing function on [math][0,180][/math], which is the set of possible angles in a triangle, this is the same as minimizing [math]\\cos(A)[/math]. So find the minimum. Find the derivative: [math]\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{x^2+3}{4x}=\\frac{4x(2x)-4(x^2+3)}{16x^2}[/math] Set to zero (same as setting the numerator to zero): [math]8x^2-4x^2-12=0[/math] [math]x=\\sqrt{3}[/math] This value of [math]x[/math] lies in the desired interval. (The negative root does not.) I will not go through the full check that this is in fact the minimum. Now to find [math]A[/math], use the function found earlier: [math]\\frac{x^2+3}{4x}=\\cos(A)[/math] Plug in [math]x=\\sqrt{3}[/math]: [math]\\frac{6}{4\\sqrt{3}}=\\cos(A)[/math] [math]\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}=\\cos(A)[/math] [math]A=30[/math] and we are done.

If you draw a point C then get a compass and draw two circles (A, B) with C the centre of radius 2 and 1 respectively. Then try to make a triangle you will see this is the case. ",
