Go from right to left, so in this instance, multiply first 0 + 0 - 0 \u00f7 0 Next divide Let n equal to any solution of zero over zero 0 + 0 - {A|B} Addition or subtraction. Right to left Add first 0 - {A|B} Then subtract {A|B} If the square root of 64 can equal to more than one values (positive 8 and negative 8), then zero over zero can equal to more than one values too.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not defined, because you can\u2019t divide by 0. What does it mean to write a / 0 = b? Well, it\u2019d mean that there\u2019d have to be a number b so that 0 times b would equal a. Now, if a is not 0 then such a number doesn\u2019t exist, does it? As 0 times any number equals 0. So you can\u2019t even write any such thing; the whole equation is nonsensical. Now how about 0 / 0 = b? This is a bit different; it would mean that there\u2019d have to be a number b so that 0 times b equals 0. Well, that would work, wouldn\u2019t it? It actually works for any number b. But that\u2019s the problem; you don\u2019t have a single number; there are multiple solutions. But talking about division means talking about algebraic operation, which is a Morphism - Wikipedia. And that has either 1 result or isn\u2019t defined (for the arguments) at all. You\u2019d have to define division differently; not as a morphism from e.g. R to R, but as a morphism from R to 2^R (i.e. to a set of subsets of R). In such a case, you could say that the result of a / 0 is an empty set for a != 0 and 0 / 0 is equal to R (it holds for any number). In the other cases, a / b = {c} where c = a / b as usual. But in the standard algebra, it\u2019s simply not defined. ",
