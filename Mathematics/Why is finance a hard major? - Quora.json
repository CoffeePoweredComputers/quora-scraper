            "answer_text": "Ehh, at most American schools finance is a concentration of the Business Administration major which typically is a joke. You hear it is hard a lot because most people who major in business really are not interested in math and thus put not effort into getting skilled in a key life skill, and since finance would have the most math and perhaps maybe some coding courses, people think it is hard. Try an Econ major at a school with a real econ major or just take upper div financial econ from an econ department, finance classes in an actual finance degree like a MFE, or a major like mathematics with a concentration in actuarial and financial sciences. When you see what a stochastic partial differential equation is, or have to apply advanced macroecon topics utilizing techniques from several stats and econometrics courses and ideas from mathematical econ and your linear algebra and vector calc course or try to learn real analysis based probability, then you will learn what \u201chard\u201d finance can be\u2026 Coming from a \u201chonors\u201d/pre-grad school math, econ-philosophy joint major, Industrial-Systems Eng/OR triple major with degrees in computational economics; joint IEOR/MBA ; and Stats who got the first degree as part of a 4 + 1 thing at my school, then worked in finance and got funded my MBA/IEOR and decided quantitative stuff was for me and worked as a quant data engineer till he decided he wanted to be a quant and now is getting his Ph.D in Information Geometry and did his masters in stats instead of math since IG applies heavily to time series and I wanted the theoretical and applied stats courses, and am not being charge to get the MFE except some random fees for graduation, networking events, etc that is only a few thousand, I have a job lined up with a 300k package doing real finance, that is hard, you wouldn\u2019t know what most of the symbols I use in my notes are, you wouldn\u2019t know what most of my code is trying to accomplish, and you wouldn\u2019t know what hedge fund needs me\u2026and it's like 20 million dollar fiber line straight to a major telecom center.

            "answer_text": "Finance majors need a specific skill set if they want to achieve success in this dynamic industry. Take a look at this list to see if you have what it takes! 1. You have stellar communication skills Financial discussions can get complicated. Whether you\u2019re explaining to a client exactly what\u2019s happening with their money or you\u2019re brokering a complex financial deal, you need to have solid communication skills to keep the process moving smoothly. 2. You take initiative You don\u2019t need directives to make yourself useful. Whether you are at work or engaging in a project for fun, you like to look at goals and start working on a way to make those goals happen. Even if you aren\u2019t sure how to do something, you know that getting started is usually more effective than kicking around doing nothing. 3. You\u2019re inquisitive You aren\u2019t just curious about finance. You\u2019re curious about lots of things. Some people walk through their day with their head down, just trying to do their part and go home. But that\u2019s not you\u2014you want to see what\u2019s going on. That is a highly valued trait in the finance industry. 4. You work hard When you have your eyes on a goal, you\u2019re willing to work for it. If that means going the extra mile or thinking outside the box, then you\u2019ll do it. You are tenacious when it comes to completing your mission. That trait is pretty valuable in any industry, but in finance, it\u2019s a must. 5. You have high emotional intelligence (EQ) You don\u2019t have a hard time relating to people. Whether it\u2019s your best friend or someone you\u2019ve never met before, you like to understand where people are coming from, and you are pretty good at reading between the lines of what someone is saying. 6. You love to learn You get bored with repetitive tasks that stay the same, week after week. The best jobs you\u2019ve had were marked by their interesting developments, new things to learn and new people to meet. You\u2019re just plain energized when you learn something new, and you\u2019re pretty good at catching on fast. That\u2019s a critical finance trait. 7. You persist No one likes setbacks, but instead of getting disheartened, you rise to the challenge. You are willing to work at something for a long time if that\u2019s what success takes. And when it comes to finance, time is often a huge factor in success. 8. You\u2019re a natural problem solver Finance professionals deal with problem solving on a daily basis, from negotiating a deal to determining the best solution for a client. You\u2019ll stand out above the crowd if you can show your employer you have the critical-thinking skills to handle tricky situations. Many people don\u2019t realize how many different roles and job opportunities exist within the finance sector. [1] Footnotes[1] Finance - Wikipedia",
