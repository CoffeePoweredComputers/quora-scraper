            "answer_text": "Because it is difficult. The first round of difficulty is learning its basic rules and accepting that forcing things never works. Working within these very rigid rules runs counter to our urges to force things to fit. After you get past that stage the next challenge is working with the thought that math has only correct and incorrect. There is no such thing as partially correct. A proof or calculation is either correct and valid, or incorrect and invalid. You eventually get to the point where you have long solutions and coping with the fact that a mistake in the very early parts cannot be remedied in the later parts. You have to discard your work and go back and correct the mistake, then build again from that point. You have to learn to work with it, never fight it. However. If you develop the right discipline with math you enter a world that opens doors to so many fields. Math doesn\u2019t get easy. It really isn\u2019t. But it is rewarding. ",

            "answer_text": "There is one thing I know that makes maths difficult. And that's skipping the basics. Maths itself has foundations. And once you ignore them, you won't find maths easy. These foundation could be seen as Addition, multiplication, division and subtraction. These operations are found in all maths topics. Also, you don't just cram a formula in maths, you learn it. Get to know how that formula came about. And also, just keep on solving questions .start from simpler ones in order to get the logic. Then you can move on to harder ones. Note:The questions are still going to be difficult but only easy for you to solve. ",
