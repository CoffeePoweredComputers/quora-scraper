            "answer_text": "You can quickly do a ballpark figure. I'd say, 261 = 255 in this context. So, the odds of less than 255 is around 50%. Now, you can easily do your single sample t-test with a mean of 255 (as a limit) and test whether that comes from a population wtih 261. But, remember, a SD of 17 depends on the sample size of the original, not the 14 samples, to estimate a confidence interval. At any rate, the odds are going to be close to 5o% because 255 is so close to 261. To have a more precise answer requires a more precise question or information. ",
