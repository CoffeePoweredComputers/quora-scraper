            "answer_text": "The definition of complex differentiability requires that the derivative exist and be the same in all direction in the plane. So say u+iv = f(x+iy) where x, y, u, and v are real variables, we require lim as h real \u2192 0 of ((f(x+iy+h) - f(x+iy))/h to exist and to be the same as lim as h real \u2192 0 of ((f(x+iy+ih) - f(x+iy))/ih. The equality of these limits leads to the equation:partial derivative wrt x of u+iy = (1/i)*(partial derivative wrt y of u+iy)which gets you the Cauchy-Riemann equations. See the link below. The conjugate function fails to satisfy the Cauchy-Riemannequations. Eg the partial derivative of Re(x-iy) wrt x is 1, that of Im(x-iy) wrt y is -1. The derivative is not the same when taken in real and imaginary directions. Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations - Wikipedia ",
