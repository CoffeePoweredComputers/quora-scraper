            "answer_text": "Asha Mehta gave false information. The schools each have their own test score submission policies. Some schools make you submit all your scores, others only allow you to send in your best composite, etc. It\u2019s all up to the school. The same applies for the ACT. Concerning which test to take\u2013it\u2019s more about how your brain works really. I highly encourage you to try both tests to see which one you like better\u2013which one \u201cfeels\u201d easier. The SAT gives your more time per question, but they tend to be trickier and not so straight forward. The ACT gives you less time, but the questions are more blunt and don\u2019t ask much about inferencing. If you\u2019re more of a critical thinker and a philosopher try the SAT. If you\u2019re a quick thinker and a pragmatist try the ACT. All in all, unless financial burdens become an issue, take both and see which one you like. To my knowledge, no school requires you to submit ACT and SAT scores, so don\u2019t worry about taking them both. ",
