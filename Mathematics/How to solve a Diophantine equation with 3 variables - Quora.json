            "answer_text": "Q: How do you solve a Diophantine equation with 3 variables? My personal favourite technique is generating functions. For example, count the solutions to , where  are non-negative integers. This is equivalent to , where  is even,  is divisible by 3, and  is divisible by 5. That is the coefficient of  in the expansion of  ",
