Area of a circle is a function of square of the radius. f(r) = \u03c0r\u00b2 When radius is doubled; f(2r) = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0r\u00b2; area increases four times. When radius is trebled; f(3r) = \u03c0(3r)\u00b2 = 9\u03c0r\u00b2; area increases nine times. When radius increases n times; f(nr) = \u03c0(nr)\u00b2 = n\u00b2\u03c0r\u00b2 ",

            "answer_text": "My dear friend Subash Yadav, We have given that only one condition if \u201cI double the diameter of a circle \u201c. Find out the changed Area =? Now suppose that we have a circle of center C having origin O and radius r and diameter d. Then, Area of the circle will be A = \u03c0r^2\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014(1) Now the area has been shown in radius term we can convert it into the diameter terms. Then A1 = \u03c0(d/2)^2 {r= d/2} A1= (\u03c0/4)(d^2)\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-(2) Now when the diameter will be double then diameter = 2d Now Area A2 = (\u03c0/4)[2d]^2= \u03c0d^2= A1/4 When you will be double the diameter then the New Area will become (1/4) times of the intial area. I hope that your doubt will be cleared up. Thankyou, Best regards, Er. Ashutosh Sharma ",
