            "answer_text": "You have to select 5 balls out of which exact 3 balls should be red, so why not first select red balls only, we will think of remaining later\u2026. We have to select 3 Red balls out of 4, so the number of ways is 4C3 = 4!/(3!1!) = 4.Now as we have chosen the 3 red balls, 2 remaining balls have to be selected out of 8 balls (3 blue+ 5 yellow), so the number of ways is = 8C2=8!/(6!2!)= 28.Now to get the final answer, multiply Ans1 with Ans2 as both things have to be done = 4 * 28 = 112. I hope you understood it. ",
