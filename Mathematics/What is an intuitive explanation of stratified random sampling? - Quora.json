            "answer_text": "Background: Let's say there is a town in the middle of the US who is having elections for mayor in the next few months. One of the candidates, John Doe, has heard rumor he is losing to his opponent, Jessica Deer, because of the younger population's vote. Worried, he contacts you, a stats major from the nearby university (low budget), to sample the population to see if this rumor is true.  You get to work, and reading the current census you see that there are 10,000 people in this town. The age demographics are distributed as follow: 10% 0-18, 20% 18-26, 40% 26-68, 30% 68-100.  So, you divide the age groups into strata, having 1k people in the 0-18, 2k in the 18-26, 4k in the 26-68 and 3k in the 68-100.  Now you know that the 18-26 group makes up 20% of the population, so you randomly sample 20% of the 2000 in the group or 420 people (and follow this procedure for the other strata). You discover that the rumors are true and that a shocking 92% of the 18-26 group says will be voting for Ms. Deer. Curious, you look into this and discover that Ms. Deer is the only real candidate, and that Mr. Doe was just a name invented by your stats prof to help you understand stratified random sampling.  Which raises the question, who was 10% of that age group voting for? ",

            "answer_text": "Stratification ensures that your sample has representation from different strata of the population. Look at the following example: You are selecting a sample of 50 students from a co-ed school. If you randomly select, it can happen that all your sample are either males or all are females. But dividing the students into males and females and selecting a part of the sample from one group and the remaining from other group ensures that both groups get represented. How much advantage it has in terms of better accuracy of your estimate depends on whether the variable under study varies by gender. ",
