            "answer_text": "The primes are the atoms of all natural numbers, and numbers generally, including the real and complex numbers. Any natural number can be represented by a some molecule of such atoms or by an atom - which is itself, in case the number is prime itself. For example: 637=7\u20227\u202213. This molecule is combined from two atoms of 7 and one atom of 13, a total of 3 atoms (primes), in which 2 distinguished primes. Another example: 147=3\u20223\u20223\u20223\u20223\u20225\u202211\u202211. This molecule is combined of five atoms of 3, one atom of 5 and two atoms of 11. A total of 8 atoms (primes), in which 3 distinguished primes: 3, 5 and 11. So prime Factorization is actually find (all) the components of a given natural number that is bigger than 1 - finding exactly what is the number of each prime which divides (with no remain) that number (until it turns to be the number 1).

            "answer_text": "Every compsite Number is a product of Primes besides 1 and the number itself. Let us take some examples for better explanation. Take a Number, say 30 30=2\u00d73\u00d75 2 ,3 and 5 are all primes. So 2,3 &5 are are PRIME FACTORS of 30 or expressed in a different way,the Prime Factorisation of 30 is 2*3*5. Please note that 30 is also divisible by 6 (2*3),10 (2*5) ,15 (3*5),1 & 30. None of these are Prime factors. They are simply Factors more correctly DIVISORS of the Number 30. Prime factorisation in Mathematics plays an important part in general and Modular Airthmatic in particular . To name afew ,any composite number with a Prime are both co-primes. The GCD/HCF of a Number or Numbers with a Prime is always 1 ,larger prmes are of very importance for strict security in cryptography etc. \u25a1Ans. ",
