            "answer_text": "Let the sum of money be Rs.P. C.I. - S.I. = Rs. 46\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(given). P.[(1+r/100)^3. -1] - P.r.3/100 = 46. P.[ 1+3.1.r/100.(1 +r/100)+ r^3/10^6 - 1 - 3.r/100] = 46. P .[ r/100.(3+3.r/100 + r^2/10^4 - 3)]= 46. or, P . r/100.(3r/100+r^2/10^4) = 46. or, P.(r/100)^2.(3 + r/100)= 46. or, P = 46/(r/100)^2.{(300+r)/100}. or, P = 46\u00d710^6/r^2.(300+r)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(1) Thus , by putting the value of r in eqn. (1). we can solve the value of P. For example r= 10% p.a. P = 46\u00d710^6/10^2.(310). P = 46000/31= Rs.1483.87. Answer. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two unknowns in the problem - Principle (P) and Rate (r). But we have only one equation to solve. It requires iteration and you will get different values of P and r. You need to provide rate of interest to work out a single solution of the problem. An attempt is made : CI = P * (1 +r)^3 - P = P( 1 + 3r^2 + 3r + r^3) - P = P(r^3 + 3r^2 + 3r) SI for 3 years = P * r * 3 = 3Pr The difference is 46, So, P(r^3 + 3r^2 + 3r) - 3Pr = 46 Or, P(r^3 + 3r^2 ) = 46 Or, P = 46 / ( r^3 + 3r^2) It will give innumerable values of P and r. You choose whatever suits you. For example, If r = 0.05 ( i.e.,5%), P = 6033 If, r = 0.1 ( i.e., 10%), P = 1484 etc. and so on\u2026\u2026\u2026. You can still work out. ",
