            "answer_text": "The 12th root of 8 is 1.18921. So the rate of compound interest is 18.921% p a. In order that the principal amount becomes 16 times itself,it has to be as per the following equation: The nth power of 1.18921=16 where n is the number of years in which the amount becomes 16 times. The 16th power of 1.18921 is 16.006 So the amount of principal at the compounded rate of 18.921 % becomes 16 times after 16 years. In other words a principal becomes 8 times after 12 years ,gets doubled to 16 times after another 4 years. ",
