Also, it is well related to golden ratio. In Fibonacci sequence, any given number is Approx. 1.618 times of the preceding number Ignoring first few numbers. Uses of Fibonacci series in maths: It is well used to solve euglids algorithm, where the toughest input pair is in case of 2 consecutive numbers Fibonacci series.

The fibonacci series is such a series where each number is the sum of two preceding numbers or one can say each number is the sum of previous two numbers before it. It is denoted by Fn ( n is subscript here). The series goes like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233\u2026\u2026. ",
