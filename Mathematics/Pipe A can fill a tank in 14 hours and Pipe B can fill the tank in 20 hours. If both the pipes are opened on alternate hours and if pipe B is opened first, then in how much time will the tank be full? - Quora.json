            "answer_text": "Pipe A can fill a Tank in 14 hours... (1). Pipe B can fill it in 20 hours... (2). A' s capacity per hour is 1/14 part of the Tank. B's capacity per hour is 1/20 part of the Tank. Both can fill in \u20261/14 + 1/20 = (10 + 7)/140 = 17/140 part in an Hour And fill the Tank in\u2026. 140/17 = 8 and 4/17 hours. It implies that both the Pipes A and B are opened alternately the time would be double of 8 and 4/17 hours i.e 16 and 8/17 Hours. Pipe B opened first,then Pipe B fills all odd hours from 1st to 17th hours, that is 9 Hours and Pipe A fills all even hours from 2nd to16th hours, 8 hours. Total 9+8=17 hours. Approximately. Let's now see how much of the Tank is filled in 8 hours jointly i.e 1/2 of the total Time of16 Hours. ( 17/140 ) x 8 = 136/140 part of the Tank. The balance left is\u2026 140/140 (i.e the whole 1) - 136/140 = 4/140 or 1/35 part left which less than 1/20 part filled by pipe B in the 17th hour. If 1/20 part is filled in 1 hour or 60 minutes, then 1/35 part would take 1200/35 = 34.286 minutes. Therefore the total time is.. 16 Hours and 34.286 Minutes. Answer. ",
