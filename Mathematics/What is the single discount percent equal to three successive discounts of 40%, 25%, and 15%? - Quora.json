            "answer_text": "There are multiple ways to solve it. Here I'll show you 2 ways as others are already discussed in different answers. Method 1: the formula 2 successive discount are calculated by formula a+b -a*b/100 So for 40% and 25% 40+25\u201340*25/100 65\u201310=55% Now for 55% and 15% 55+15\u201355*15/100 70\u20138.25 =61.75% You can use this formula for any number of successive discount cases. Though I don't recommend this procedure as it involve lot's of calculation, it has its own use in some cases. Method 2: converting % into fraction and successively multiplying it 40% discount is =60% 60%=3/5 75%=3/4 and 85%=17/20 = 3*3*17/(5*4*20) =153/400 Net discount % = (1\u2013153/400)*100 =247/4 =61.75% Hope this helps.
