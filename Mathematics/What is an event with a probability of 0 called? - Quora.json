            "answer_text": "Probability of 0 is \u201cimpossible\u201d - Technically you won\u2019t see this unless the event is really contrived. However in sports you will definitely see events with 0 probability late in the season where teams will not have enough points to win any championships. Probability of 1 is \u201ccertain\u201d - Again, this is rare, unless you are talking about something that is happening \u201cnow\u201d or something that has happened in the past. Taking the championship example again, if someone has enough points that they cannot be beaten in the games left they have a probability of 1 that they are champion, even if the awarding of the title hasn\u2019t happened yet. In most cases an event will lie somewhere above 0 and below 1. ",
