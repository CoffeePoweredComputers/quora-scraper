            "answer_text": "Just as a heads up, my answer will come off as being very biased considering my credential. However, especially being on the inside as an SAT tutor myself, I do truly believe in everything I say for this answer as I've personally seen the results. Also I'm going to really try to not make it sound like I'm advertising, but there's only so much I can do about that. I really suggest a tutor or tutoring service. Get SAT books and use Khan Academy as well, as they are great resources, however, you won't get the personal attention that you would get from a tutor. Sylvan offers an SAT prep program. The students I work with do 2 hour sessions of math once a week for 8 weeks (although it can last longer if you need it to!) These sessions are generally one-on-one (exceptions are really only when we're super busy around the end of the school year). Again, take this with a grain of salt since I actually am a tutor there. Also, if you choose this route, look up reviews of your local tutoring centers before committing to one. Obviously it might differ where you are (if there's even a Sylvan there), but the general concept of having a tutor is the same no matter what service you may use, even if it's just a private tutor. A tutor will be able to tailor lessons to your weaknesses and will be much more helpful than just a book (although again, those are also great resources). ",

            "answer_text": "If you have enough time in hand, learn the basic from khan academy. It teaches you from the very beginning. If you are taking test soon, go through the Barron\u2019s old SAT books to learn the basic arithmetic and geometry. Then go through the new version. It should take you a few weeks to learn all the topics. Once you have the basic idea start practicing. Use stopwatch and calculate average time taken to solve the problems. Your target would be minimising taken time. The more you practice the more efficient you become. Try to find a fellow learner. After solving a chapter do talk and share the solving tactics with each other. So the bottom line is PRACTISE as much as you can. ",

Get another book which is actually explaining the subjects. Start reading about the subjects about the questions you couldn\u2019t answer. Give yourself few day. Go back to test try to solve them again. Don\u2019t read the explanation and immediately go try solving the question again. This will deceive you. Repeat until you are happy with your performance. ",
