            "answer_text": "The main difference is that a converging function has a limiting value as the idependent variable increases infinitely ,whereas a divergent function does not. For example if y= 2 - 1/x, then as x increases infinitely ,the function n converges on the value 2. In contradistinction, y= 2-x tends to no specific value as x increases infinitely. ",
