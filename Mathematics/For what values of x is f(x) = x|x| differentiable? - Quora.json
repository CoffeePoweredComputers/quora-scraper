Since  is continuous, we know that the two halves are continuous. We just need to check the point where they meet: . Simple observation will tell you the slope of both halves is zero at this point so they meet smoothly, and hence the function is differentiable.  ",

            "answer_text": "The better question is: for which values is it not differentiable? For f(x)=|x|=abs(x) the answer is easy. It is only not differentiable at x=0. For x*abs(x) we have to think a bit. What is this, essentially? After some seconds thinking i come to the conclusion that it yields the same as sign(x)*x\u00b2, because abs(x\u00b2) is the same as x\u00b2 (for real values) and the only difference to xabs(x) is that xabs(x) can be negative if x is negative. So we know xabs(x)=sign(x)x\u00b2. The differentiation of it yields 2sign(x)x. Thats the same as 2abs(x). That\u2019s a function without a break though, so there is no values where xabs(x) is not differentiable. The second differentiation has a problem at x=0 again though. ",
