            "answer_text": "Depends on which ratio you want to portray. If you want to show the ratio of area, 1:2 or the smaller circle if 50% the area of the larger circle If you want to show the ratio of the radius of the circle it takes a little more work since area is [math]\\pi*r^2[/math] and double that area would be [math]2*\\pi*r^2[/math] so let\u2019s look at the math. a1 = area of smaller circle and a2 is area of larger circle, r1 = radius of smaller circle and r2 = radius of larger circle so [math]a1=\\pi*r1^2[/math] and [math]a2=\\pi*r2^2[/math] [math]a1=\\frac{a2}{2}[/math] or even easier [math]a1=a2*0.5[/math] so therefore [math]\\pi*r1^2 = \\pi*r2^2*0.5[/math] we can factor out [math]\\pi[/math] from both equations leaving us with [math]r1^2=r2^2*0.5[/math] now we need to find the square root of each side to get us r1 so [math]r1=\\sqrt{r2^2*0.5}[/math] or [math]r1=r2*\\sqrt{0.5}[/math] which leaves us with [math]r1 = r2 * 0.7071[/math] or the radius of the smaller circle being 70.71% of the larger circle and consequently, that would be the same difference in percentage of the circumference since [math]c=\\pi*2*r[/math] ",

            "answer_text": "This is an incredibly difficult question, but it seems to me that after going through the whole calculation, that the ratio in percent of the smaller circle to the larger circle is 50% of the area. incidentally the ratio between the radii (and circumference, as opposed to the area) can be obtained as follows: a1*0.5=a2 a1=Pi*r1^2 a2=Pi*r2^2 -> r1^2*0.5 = r2 ^ 2 sqrt(r1^2*0.5) = r2 r1 * sqrt(0.5) = r2 so the ratio of the radius of the small circle to that of the large circle is sqrt(0.5)*100= ~70.71% ",
