            "answer_text": "You probably enjoy math.You most likely have developed greater than normal mental skill/agility from practising with paper and pencil.You likely were born with an innate understanding of math. Just as there are child prodigies who are born with music skills so to some people are child prodigies of math.With hours of practise some math calculations can be done mentally faster than having to commit yourself to writing out all the calculations out on paper. I, for example, can calculate how much tip to leave for a waitress many times faster in my head than others can using paper and pencil.",

As an example, if you keep playing Tetris for an extended period of time, you will start seeing the pieces fall down, when you close your eyes. You might even dream about them. ",
