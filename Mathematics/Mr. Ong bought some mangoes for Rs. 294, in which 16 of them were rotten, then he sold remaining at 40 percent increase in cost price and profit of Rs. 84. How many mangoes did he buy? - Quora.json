            "answer_text": "Ans Let no. of mangoes bought = x C.P of x mangoes = Rs 294 C.P of 1 mango = 294/x C.P of 16 rotten mangoes = ( 294 \u00d7 16 ) /x = 4704/x Rs C.P of remaining mangoes =( 294 ) - 4704/x = ( 294x - 4704) / x Now he wants 40 % profit on these remaining mangoes. Therefore S.P of remaining mangoes = 1.4 ( 294x - 4704) /x = ( 411.6x - 6585.6 ) /x Now we know Profit = S.P - C.P 84 = {( 411.6x - 6585.6 ) /x } - ( 294x - 4704 ) /x 84 x = 411.6x - 294 x - 6585.6 + 4704 84 x = 117.6 x - 1881.6 84x - 117.6 x = - 1881.6 -33. 6 x = - 1881.6 x = 1881.6 /33.6 = 56 x = 56 mangoes Ans We can also check the answer C.p of one mango = 294/56 = Rs 5.25 Now 16 mangoes are rotten Therefore remaining mangoes = 56 - 16 = 40 C.P of 40 mangoes = 40 \u00d7 5.25 = 210 Profit = 40 % S.P of 40 mangoes = 1.4 \u00d7 210 = Rs 294 Difference in S.P and C.P = 294 - 210 = Rs 84 which is same as per given in question.

            "answer_text": "Let he bought x mangoes for Rs. 294. C.P. = Rs.294. , Cost price of each mango = Rs.294/x. Rotten mangoes =16. Remaining mangoes = (x-16). S.P. of each mango = Rs.294/x.(1+40/100) = Rs.294.(1.4)/x. S.P. of all the remaining mangoes= Rs.294.(1.4).(x-16)/x. S.P. - C.P = profit. 294.(1.4).(x-16)/x - 294 = 84. or. 294.(1.4).(x-16)/x = 378. or , 378.x = 294.(1.4).(x-16). or , 126.x = 98\u00d7(14/10).(x-16). or , 9.x = (49/5)\u00d7(x-16). or , 49.x - 49\u00d716 = 45.x. or , 4.x = 49\u00d716. => x = (49\u00d716)/4 = 196.
