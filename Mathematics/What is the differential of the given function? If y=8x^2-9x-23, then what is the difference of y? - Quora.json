            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A!! Well from your question, I think you are trying to ask the differentiation of the function w.r.t y and w.r.t x. We have y=8x2\u22129x\u221223.y=8x2\u22129x\u221223. Differentiating w.r.t x, dydx=16x\u22129dydx=16x\u22129 Differentiating w.r.t y, 1=16xdxdy\u22129dxdy1=16xdxdy\u22129dxdy Taking dxdydxdy common, 1=dxdy(16x\u22129)1=dxdy(16x\u22129) \u27f9dxdy=116x\u22129\u27f9dxdy=116x\u22129 Hope it helps you! Thank you!! ",
