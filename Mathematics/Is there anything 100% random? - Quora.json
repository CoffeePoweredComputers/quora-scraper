            "answer_text": "We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes. \u2014\u2009Pierre Simon Laplace, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities Ref: Laplace's demon - Wikipedia Take a coin and toss. It is random. If you add a small weight to the head side and toss it, there is a bias and the coin tosses will result in one outcome. If a person is unaware of the added weight, even 100 continuous heads means one of the possible random outcome. I heard that thermal noise is truly random but even that must be governed by something Any source of random number remains true random number generator as long as we don\u2019t have any prediction on the behavior of the source. So the question here is, do we have a proper model that explains the source or not. If we are to believe there exists a theory of everything, then there is no true random source. Currently quantum particles can be trusted as better random source as they are unpredictable and no governing principle known to us. So, to answer your question: \u201cYes, we do have many true random sources. Even if we are living in deterministic universe, this is true because we don\u2019t know theory of everything\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "You are right to suspect that even thermal noise follows deterministic rules according to classical mechanics. And while some interpretations of quantum mechanics may allow for intrinsic \u2018true\u2019 randomness (e.g. Copenhagen), others interpretations of quantum mechanics also try to (locally in each world) get rid of any \u2018quantum true randomness\u2019 (e.g. multiverse). So your suspicion is correct, and unlike most people\u2019s beliefs (even among scientists), to consider the world as fully deterministic (not to confuse with fully predictable in any way) is not only natural but mainstream and not far-fetched or somehow unsurprising according to the set of all physical theories that we currently have and describe the world with surprising accuracy.
