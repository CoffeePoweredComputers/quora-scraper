            "answer_text": "Because selection bias. The problems that can be reduced to linear algebra make up a sizable portion of the problems that can be solved at all. Linear algebra is generally a well-understood and simple domain. Whenever a problem can be reduced to linear algebra, however circuitously and cleverly, it usually is reduced to linear algebra and then, often times, it can be solved. Of course, many problems can\u2019t be reduced to linear algebra. Sometimes such problems can be solved in other ways, but many such problems are unsolved. The end result is that if you survey all the problems we\u2019ve ever solved along with their solutions, you see a lot of linear algebra. You see a lot of linear transformations, linear approximations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, inner products, change of basis, and did I mention eigenvalues? No? So eigenvalues. And eigenvectors. Lots of them. You see differentials, and cohomology, and linear representations, and Hecke operators, and vector bundles, and many other sophisticated machinery which can be regarded as deep ways of linearizing. Because at the end of the day, as Ehud de Shalit once told me, the only equations we can handle really well are linear equations. So we seek them, and if they don\u2019t seem to be around, we conjure them. A significant amount of modern math can be understood as a desperate attempt to linearize that which seems non-linear. We frequently fail, but we also succeed more often than might seem reasonable at first glance. The methods are ingenious, and the results are deep and surprising. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t agree with your premises, unless we use a very broad definition of both \u201clinear algebra\u201d and \u201creduce\u201d. Let\u2019s start with \u201clinear algebra\u201d. Do we count Hilbert spaces as linear algebra? On one hand, if you think about them in an abstract way, then probably yes. But most of useful Hilbert spaces are functional spaces and their interesting properties are closely related to analytic properties. In this sense, it is more like analysis than algebra. For me, as soon as you have inequalities and estimates it\u2019s no longer algebra, it\u2019s analysis. So from where I stand, it looks more like analysis that use some language and notion of \u201clinear algebra\u201d than \u201clinear algebra\u201d itself. Similar thing happens with \u201creduce\u201d. If we are talking about \u201cuse\u201d, then it is true. But, on the other hand, in most papers you have to add or multiply at least two numbers. Would you say that everything is reduced to arithmetic? Probably not. Let\u2019s look at more advanced example: linearisation. Is it reduction to algebra? Yes and No. Again, from my experience, the hard and interesting part is how to linearize and how to show that your linearization still captures important properties of the original object. Doing a bit of linear algebra at the end is usually is almost in the same category as \u201creduction to arithmetic\u201d. To summarise: With a wide definition of \u201clinear algebra\u201d and \u201creduce\u201d it is true since linear algebra is one of the simplest fundamental blocks of mathematics, so it appears all over the place. With more strict definition, I do not believe that it actually true. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a joke about a mathematician in an interview. Interviewer: What do you do when you see a building on fire? Mathematician: Do X, Y and Z and some other useful actions. Interviewer: What if the building is not on fire? Mathematician: In that case we will put the building on fire, then it becomes a known problem for which we already have the solution. Jokes apart, researchers are advised to convert/cast their problem into an existing and probably solved problem. This gives two benefits: It is sufficient for the researcher to convince how he has reduced/casted his problem to a similar existing problem. Thereby, he need not solve the problem to the end, because a lot of people might have solved the existing problem which has strong theoretical proofs. Any new solution(which might get invented in the future) to the existing problem can be easily applied to the new problem which was casted as an existing problem. A majority of the real world problems have already been solved by casting them as linear algebra problems. Since we have the solutions to these problems, converting any new problem into a problem of existing type is equivalent to solving the new problem with very less effort and it is easy to convince the research community.

I am thinking of numerical analysis when I say this. In fact it would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that numerical analysis is concerned with replacing continuous problems with discrete ones. When this is done, one usually ends up with a large system of linear equations to solve, which is then solved using Gaussian elimination (or any of its variants), a central topic in linear algebra.As function spaces: Functions of real and complex variables feature prominently all over mathematics. It turns out that often the vector space of functions of a particular kind provide a very useful structure to prove theorems about those functions. Introducing a vector space lets us talk about subspaces, projections, linear combinations, orthogonality, change of basis. This is how linear algebra enters differential equation theory, Fourier analysis and quantum mechanics, for example.",

            "answer_text": "Because a lot of mathematical problems (especially the ones that come up in real life) are linear. A linear problem is one where the equations relating the variables only involve multiplying the variables by constants and adding them together (eg 5x+2y=6). Linear algebra is very useful in solving linear problems, regardless of where they've come from. Even when problems aren't linear, they are often approximately linear for small changes in the variables. Differential calculus is all about making linear approximations (the derivative of curve at a point is the slope of the straight line that approximates the curve near that point). Any problem that involves multivariate calculus therefore involves linear algebra. ",

            "answer_text": "In continuous mathematics problems the answer is basically given by the implicit function theorem(s) or inverse function theorem(s). That is the abstract answer. The useful answer if you like mathematical methods in physics then have a look at perturbation theory. I liked Hinch\u2019s \u201cperturbation methods\u201d. It builds up the ideas through examples. If you are into mathematics, then dive into bifurcation theory and dynamical systems. Guckenheimer&Holmes, Carmen Chicone and V.I.Arnold - great reads. Those will give you strong geometric intuition.
