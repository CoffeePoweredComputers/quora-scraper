            "answer_text": "50+25=75 CP=P%=50 If you want to do this type of question without pen and paper then this method is for you, this method is applicable for all the questions in which profit percentage is equal to the cost price. Trick: choose a number for profit% and add with by divide the same number by 10 and sqaureof that number . 10% =10+1 15%=15+2.25 20%=20+4 30%=30+9 50%=50+25 First see the example Cp=10 P=10% SP=11 :: P=1 which is square of 1 CP=20 P=20% SP=24 :: P=4 which is a square of 2 CP=30 P=30% SP=39 :: P=9 which is a square of 3 CP=40 P=40% SP=56 :: P=16 which is a square of 4 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 CP=90. P=90%. SP=171 :: P=81 Which is a square of 9 SP=75 so find the closest value suppose I took 70, then 70+7^2 =70+49=109 ?? Next 60, then 60+6^2=60+36=96 ??? Next 50, then 50+5^2= 50+25 = 75\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713 Now you can try by your own SP=56 SP=144 PUT YOUR ANSWER IN COMMENT AND YOUR QUERY ALSO\u2026, ",
