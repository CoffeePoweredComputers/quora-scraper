            "answer_text": "Think of it as a arithmetic progression whereby the numbers in the sequence are: 1000,1005,1010\u2026. The formula to find the nth term, Un, in the series is Un = a + (n-1)d where a is the first term and d is the common difference between each term. Subbing in the values, you get 2000 = 1000 + (n-1)(5) ==> n = [(2000\u20131000)/5]+1 = 201. Alternatively you can think of the number of terms from 1 to 10 that are multiples of 1, you get 10 = difference/multiple + 1. ",
