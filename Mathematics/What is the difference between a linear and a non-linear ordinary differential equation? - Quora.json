            "answer_text": "If the derivatives of all orders present in a differential equation are of first degree then we say the differential equation is linear. For example a homogeneous differential equation of the type dy/dx = f(x,y)/g(x,y) is linear Similarly, the exact differential equation M dx + N dy = 0 where M and N are functions of x and y, the linear differential equation dy/dx +Py = Q where P and Q are functions of x, The Bernoulli\u2019s equation dy/dx + Py = Q y^n, or the linear differential equations with constant coefficients d^n y/d x^n + P1 d^n-1 /d x^n-1 +\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Pn y = X are all linear differential equations. Otherwise, the differential equations are said to be non-linear. For instance, the Clairaut's equation y^2 (1-p^2) = b^2 where p stands for dy/dx is non linear as its power is 2 in the equation. ",
