            "answer_text": "I guess you are talking about SAT Math subject test. If one is taking Math Subject level 2, It is not difficult to get 800 in SAT Math subject test. One can omit 7 to 8 questions and still get 800. One needs a bit of strategy. Remember that there is negative marking in SAT subject tests but there is not negative mark for omitting. Therefore develop a strategy such that you omit those question you have no clue about and take calculated risks in the ones you are doubtful. A score of 780 is still a poor score for good universities as it is 73 percentile. A score of 800 is 81 percentile. If you are talking about General SAT, then you simply have to get all the questions right to get 800. In the last SAT, my students got just 1 question wrong and ended up getting a score of 770; that\u2019s how cruel it can be. Attempt all the collegeboard papers and a few other papers from 3rd party sources and attempt again. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "How can I go from a 780 to an 800 in SAT math? You will not significantly miss out any admission chances because of your official SAT Math Section test score 780. (I have assumed what you stated above is from official test and not from official practice test). The resources (time and money) are spent on other admission requirements. PS: Increasing your score further may be helpful only for colleges like Caltech which has much smaller freshmen class size. Even there, just securing a perfect score will not secure you admission, as they do holistic review and standardized test score is just one of many other key elements. ",

            "answer_text": "I also got a 780 and only missed 2 questions. These were likely just careless arithmetic mistakes and not holes in my knowledge of the concepts. If you really want to retake the test for a 20 point fault, try to take more practice tests and reduce the amount of careless mistakes you make. Just try to leave some time at the end to thoroughly check your work for any possible arithmetic errors. Good luckZ ",

I had got the scores of 780, 790 and 800 in successive attempts When I was preparing for the test, I completed ALL the tests from Barron\u2019s, Princeton Review and the McGraw Hill books. A few from Kaplan as well (I would recommend you to stay away from this book, Worst prep book). NOTE: I did not study every topics from the prep books, just the ones I was getting q wrong in the practice tests ",
