            "answer_text": "In some sense, as you may already realize from your experience with calculus, we like to summarize the information of a sequence by its limit, i.e., by that which it converges to. Of course, something must be lost, but if we can retain the stuff we want, then we can still do interesting work. In that vein, uniform convergence is the sufficient condition for various analytical properties \u2013 chief among them continuity and integrability \u2013 to \"carry over\" to the limit. This therefore allows us to do what we want to do, which is to conveniently summarize a lot of information about a sequence of functions by a single function instead. You can think of this as collapsing down a sequence into a single function in such a way that it retains aspects we might find useful. Such transferability is incredibly useful in mathematics and beyond, and some would even argue uniform convergence is at the heart of real analysis, something which you may appreciate with time and experience. Another famous \u201ctransfer principle\u201d is that of hyperreal transferability; however, that is a stronger sense of transferability in that any first-order statement transfers appropriately whereas in the case of uniform convergence only some of the key properties do. That notwithstanding, uniform convergence is still a pretty big deal. Let us be somewhat more precise in the essential property of uniform convergence. Suppose we have a sequence  of functions which converges uniformly to , then if each  is continuous or integrable, then so too is the limit  continuous or integrable. This is the \u201ctransfer principle,\u201d loosely speaking, I am speaking of. The continuity consideration is so important that it has a special name: the uniform convergence theorem. There are also applications to differentiability and other such properties, but I will not go into any detail on those here. (Moreover, one can generalize uniform convergence is various ways.) I will, however, leave you with a famous example. Cauchy once proved that a uniformly convergent sequence with all elements continuous has limit that is continuous. At the time, Abel claimed a counterexample via Fourier series, but this was because the precise notions of convergence and uniform convergence did not yet exist. Abel\u2019s counterexample does show the failing of mere point-wise convergence in this respect, though. ",
