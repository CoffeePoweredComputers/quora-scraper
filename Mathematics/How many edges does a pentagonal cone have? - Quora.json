            "answer_text": "A cone is with circular base, however, pentagonal cone would have a pentagon in the base.    The right name for such a figure should pentagonal pyramid. Because it would have a pentagonal, so there would be 5 triangles, connecting each face of pentagon to the apex. The regular pentagonal pyramid has a base that is a regular pentagon and lateral faces that are equilateral triangles. The total number of edges for such a figure would be 5*2 = 10; and total number of vertices would be (5+1)=6. ",
