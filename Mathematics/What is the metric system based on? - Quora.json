            "answer_text": "It is based on 10 because you got 10 fingers! And on the basic unit of length called meter. 1 meter used to be the distance from the equator to the (geographic) north pole divided by 10.000.000. It\u2019s a universal unit. Even if you divide the distance in miles by 10.000.000 you will come to the SAME distance of ONE meter. One meter is about 1.1 yd = about 3.3 ft. Today\u2019s definition is more sophisticated: One meter is defined as the distance a light beam moves in 1/299 792 458 of a second. So the meter is based on a natural constant namely vacuum light speed. The metrical standard units are: gram (weight), liter (volume = \u201c3D-length\u201d), ampere (current), mole (amount of substance) and candela (luminous intensity aka \u201cbrightness\u201d). ;-) Nice thing is you got interdependencies between those units: 1 000 000 mm^3 (= 1000 cm^3) = 1000 mL (= 1 L) = 1000 g (= 1 kg) pure water (highest density at 4 \u00b0C)! Just to give you an idea about the imperial units: Is 1 ft^3 = gallon ? And if it was a gallon of water, how heavy is it? And how heavy would it be if it was about gasoline? Is 1 in^3 = cup ? Is 1 yd^3 = barrel ? If ONE gallon is filled in a cubic vessel, what dimensions does it exhibit? :-D Just for comparison: You got a vessel with the following dimensions: 1 m * 1 m * 1 m. It is filled by half. How much water is in there? Well\u2026 quite easy: 1 m * 1 m* 0.5 m = 0.5 m^3 =!= 500 L How heavy is it? EASY! 0.5 m^3 * 1ooo kg/m^3 (density of water) = 500 kg I watched lots of those videos explaining the metric system to US citizens\u2026 sometimes it\u2019s far too complicated as certain prefixes are not or seldomly used. The most common prefixes are milli (m = 1/1000), UNIT ( = 1) and kilo (k = 1000). For lengths we got the centi ( c = 1/100 ) as well as it\u2019s pretty handy. When you go to a bar and want to drink a single shot you will see the VERY rarely used 2 cL on single shot glasses. A double shot is 4 cL aka 40 mL. In natural sciences you will only use: tera (as in TB=terabyte or TeV=teraelectronvolt), giga (G as in GB or GeV) mega (as in MB or MeV), kilo (as in kB or keV), UNIT (=1), milli, micro, nano, pico, femto, atto. All those prefixes differ by the factor 1000. In natural sciences we do not use hecto, deca and deci. Seldomly centi is used for VERY special issues (like wavenumbers = waves/cm in IR/Raman-spectroscopy)! ",

            "answer_text": "The metric system is based on the metre, an arbitrary unit of length. Originally, it was approximately 1/10,000,000 the Earth\u2019s quarter meridional circumference. See Bill Spencer's answer to How was the length of a metre originally chosen? The kilogram was originally defined as the mass of water occupying 0.1 metre cubed. The metre and kilogram WERE the metric system for many years, though over the years five more standards were added as the basis underlying all metric units. Today, the metric system is based on seven arbitrary constants of nature. It has been the \u201cSI\u201d, or \"Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s\", since 1960. The seven units are currently based on: metre - speed of light in a vacuumkilogram - mass of a particular platinum-iridium cylinder in Parissecond - vibration of Cesium 133 atomsAmpere - metres, Newtons, and secondsKelvin - triple point of pure watermole - atoms in 12 g of candela - Hertz, Watts/steradian (i.e., kilograms, metres, seconds)History of the metric system - Wikipedia International System of Units - Wikipedia ",
