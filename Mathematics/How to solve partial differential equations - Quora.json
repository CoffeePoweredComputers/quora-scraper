Some can be solved analytically, if the variables are separable.Separation of Variables Lacking an analytical solution, numerical integration is usually the way to go.

            "answer_text": "Common techniques I see are separation of variables, clever variable transformations, and approximate solutions via numerical methods. Note that for most complicated domains, you will not find analytical solutions and will have to resort to numerical methods anyways. One additional point to note is that the approaches you use to solve PDEs numerically differ greatly depending on the type of PDE you are tackling (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic, mixed). ",
