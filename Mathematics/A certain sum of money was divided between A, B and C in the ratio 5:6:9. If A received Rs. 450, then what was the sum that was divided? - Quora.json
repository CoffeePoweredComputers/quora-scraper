Let the rational between ratio of money be x Thus the money received by A, B and C is A\u2019s share 5x, B\u2019s share 6x and C's share 9x If A received Rs. 450, then what was the sum that was divided A's share is 5x = \u20b9450 5x = 450 x = 450/5 x = 90 The rational is 45. Thus shares of all three are A's share 5x = 5 \u00d7 90 = \u20b9450 B's share 6x = 6 \u00d7 90 = \u20b9540 C's share 9x = 9 \u00d7 90 = \u20b9810 The sum that was decided was = \u20b9450 + \u20b9540 + \u20b9810 = \u20b91800 Answer the sum that was divided was \u20b91800 ",
