According to the problem (x+20)(y- 1/4) = xy \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(1) and (x-30)(y+ 3/4) = xy \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(2) Simplifying the two equations we get x-80y = -20 \u2026\u2026\u2026.(3) x-40y = 30\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(4) Solving (3) and (4) we get x = 80 and y = Rs 1.25 Hence the original number of mangoes = 80 and rate per mango = Rs 1.25 ps ",
