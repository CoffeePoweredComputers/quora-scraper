            "answer_text": " There are two ways of doing this Using geometry and arguments of symmetryThe point of intersection can be found either by plotting or by solving the equations of the two circles The equation of the first circle centred at (0,2) green is x^2 +(y-2)^2 =4 And the equation of the second circle centred at (2,0) blue is (x-2)^2 + y^2 =4 Expanding the two equations and solving the would give the condition x = y Putting this back in either equation will give y=0;y=2 The corresponding points (x=y) are (0,0) and (2,2) These are the points of intersection. Since both the circles have the same radius 2; the chord BC makes the same area with both the green and the blue circle. Then the required area is Area = 2\u00d7[area between chord BC and small arc of either circle] Now to find the area between chord BC and small arc of either circle Consider the sector ABD of blue circle its radius is (\u03c0r^2)/4 = \u03c0\u00d7 2\u00d72/4 = \u03c0 Consider the right angled triangle ABD its area is (BASE \u00d7 HEIGHT )/2 = 2 \u00d7 2 / 2 = 2 So the area between chord BC and small arc of either circle is \u03c0-2 The required area = 2\u00d7( \u03c0-2 ) =2\u03c0 - 4 = 2.2832. Another method is to use calculus We find the area between the two circles by using integration  The equation of the green semicircle is y= 2 - \u221a(4-x^2) The equation of the green semicircle is y= \u221a(4-(x-2)^2) .  = -(2\u00d7-\u03c0/2) -4 + (2\u00d7\u03c0/2) = \u03c0 -4 + \u03c0 =2\u03c0-4 Same answer as before\u2026 ",

The intersection region consists of two arcs which are of angle 90 degrees sectors Area of intersection will be twice the difference of area of one 90 degree sector and the triangle formed by common chord plus two radii of one circle 2 x ((1/4 x \u03c0 x 2^2)) - (1/2 x 2 x2)) = 2\u03c0-4 Squnits ",
