            "answer_text": "Solve 1 + x^2 + y(x)^2 + x ( dy(x))/( dx) (x - 2 y(x)) = 0: Let R(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + 1 and S(x, y) = x (x - 2 y). This is not an exact equation, because (dR(x, y))/(dy) = 2 y!=2 x - 2 y = (dS(x, y))/(dx). Find an integrating factor \u03bc(x) such that \u03bc(x) R(x, y) + ( dy(x))/( dx) \u03bc(x) S(x, y) = 0 is exact. This means d/(dy)(\u03bc(x) R(x, y)) = d/(dx)(\u03bc(x) S(x, y)): 2 y \u03bc(x) = x ( d\u03bc(x))/( dx) (x - 2 y) + x \u03bc(x) + (x - 2 y) \u03bc(x) Isolate \u03bc(x) to the left-hand side: ((d\u03bc(x))/(dx))/\u03bc(x) = -2/x Integrate both sides with respect to x: log(\u03bc(x)) = -2 log(x) Take exponentials of both sides: \u03bc(x) = 1/x^2 Multiply both sides of 1 + x^2 + y(x)^2 + x ( dy(x))/( dx) (x - 2 y(x)) = 0 by \u03bc(x): (x^2 + y(x)^2 + 1)/x^2 + (-(2 y(x))/x + 1) ( dy(x))/( dx) = 0 Let P(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2 + 1)/x^2 and Q(x, y) = -(2 y)/x + 1. This is an exact equation, because (dP(x, y))/(dy) = (2 y)/x^2 = (dQ(x, y))/(dx). Define f(x, y) such that (df(x, y))/(dx) = P(x, y) and (df(x, y))/(dy) = Q(x, y). Then, the solution will be given by f(x, y) = c_1, where c_1 is an arbitrary constant. Integrate (df(x, y))/(dx) with respect to x in order to find f(x, y): f(x, y) = integral(x^2 + y^2 + 1)/x^2 dx = x + (-y^2 - 1)/x + g(y) where g(y) is an arbitrary function of y. Differentiate f(x, y) with respect to y in order to find g(y): (df(x, y))/(dy) = d/(dy)(x + (-y^2 - 1)/x + g(y)) = -(2 y)/x + ( dg(y))/( dy) Substitute into (df(x, y))/(dy) = Q(x, y): -(2 y)/x + ( dg(y))/( dy) = -(2 y)/x + 1 Solve for ( dg(y))/( dy): ( dg(y))/( dy) = 1 Integrate ( dg(y))/( dy) with respect to y: g(y) = integral1 dy = y Substitute g(y) into f(x, y): f(x, y) = x + y + (-y^2 - 1)/x The solution is f(x, y) = c_1: x + y + (-y^2 - 1)/x = c_1 Solve for y: y(x) = 1/2 (x - sqrt(5 x^2 - 4 c_1 x - 4)) or y(x) = 1/2 (x + sqrt(5 x^2 - 4 c_1 x - 4)) Simplify the arbitrary constants: Answer: y(x) = 1/2 (x - sqrt(5 x^2 + c_1 x - 4)) or y(x) = 1/2 (x + sqrt(5 x^2 + c_1 x - 4)) ",

            "answer_text": "The equation can be written as M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0 with M = x^2 + y^2 +1 , N = x^2 - 2xy..This is not exact because M_y = 2y # N_x = 2(x - y) . However (M_y - N_x)/N = - 2/x depends only on x ,Then the integrating factor can be obtained as I.F. = 1/x^2. One obtains a new equation which is : P(x,y)dx + Q(x,y)dy =0, with P = 1 + y^2/x^2 + 1/x^2 Q = 1 - 2y/x This equation is an exact differential dF(x,y) = 0 because P_y = 2y/x^2 = Q_x. The solution is F(x,y) = C with F_x = P = 1 + y^2/x^2 + 1/x^2 F_y = Q = 1 -2y/x . Integrating the second equation leads to F(x,y) = y - (y^2)/x + G(x). Using the first equation gives G\u2019(x) = 1 + 1/x^2 so G(x) = x - 1/x + C. Substituting in the above expression leads to the solution F(x,y) = y + x - ( y^2 + 1 )/x = C. ",
