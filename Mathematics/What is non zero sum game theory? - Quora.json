            "answer_text": "A zero-sum game is when one \"player\" gains something at the expense of another \"player\" losing something. As such, a non-zero-sum game is when gains and losses can be made by all \"players\" without it affecting anyone else.  As such, this can be a \"win-win\" situation, where both \"players\" can gain something without anyone losing something. This term has been powerfully used and made popular in a 2017 released Science Fiction Movie Arrival  \u2014 S ",

            "answer_text": "Okay so I am not quite sure about your background in game theory or why you might think that zero sum games are predominant in game theory, which they are really not. A classic example in game theory is prisoners dilemma which is explained in many different ways online already, you can start here; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma Prisoners dilemma is not a zero sum game since payoffs of one player are not directly earned by the other player. Prisoners dilemma is a coordination problem which is common in game theory. I hope this answer helps :) ",
