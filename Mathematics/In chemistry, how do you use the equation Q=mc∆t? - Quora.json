            "answer_text": "Yes, your answer is correct\u2026mostly. In the equation Q=mc\u0394t: Q= the heat energy (Joules), m= the mass of the object/substance being heated (in this case it's water; also important in this situation to remember that 1ml of water is equal to 1g of water), c= the specific heat of the object/substance being heated (again\u2026water, at about 4.186 Joules/gram \u00d7 \u00b0C), and t= the change in temperature in \u00b0C (-9\u00b0C in this problem; negative because it's exothermic, or gives off energy). Substitute in your known values and get: Q= (150g)(4.186 J/g \u00d7 \u00b0C)(-9\u00b0C) Q= -5651.1 J I'm sure the small difference in our answers is due to the use of a slightly less precise specific heat value for water. c=4.18, maybe?

            "answer_text": "Well i will try to make that quick and easy Out of your answer i can see that you have used the values given to you . The mass m (here equals to the water or solution volume) and the change in temperature here equals 9 by subtracting intial and final temperatures and i see you multiliplied this by the value of heat capacity of water ( usually you get this value from your question or your text book and it should be around 4.186 joules for each gram of water). The only thing missing here to get the perfect answer is to make sure you are using the correct units in your equation If the answer is to be in the correct form all the units must be unified and you can get this easily from your book. See if mass is needed to be in cubic dm(equals also ml) and the unit of the result should be in which unit? Should it be in joules or kilojoules and voila your answer will be right In the question you mentioned for example you have to change from ml by dividing it by 1000 to get litres or cubic dm and so on to get the result as in joules Edit You need to check if your reaction is exothermic(releases energy to the surroundings ) if so you must add - ve sign to your answer .if the opposite (endothermic reaction it will remain + ve value) ",
