            "answer_text": "It would be impossible to get an exact answer. The Hamas has no interest in publishing such information, or in allowing it to be published. Even so, it is known that the number is high. This report from 2012 cites a Hamas authority: During a police patrol that the author was permitted to accompany in December 2011, nothing was done to impede the use of children in the tunnels, where, much as in Victorian coal mines, they are prized for their nimble bodies. At least 160 children have been killed in the tunnels, as of 2012, according to Hamas officials. Gaza's Tunnel Phenomenon: The Unintended Dynamics of Israel's Siege Of course, as always the case with reports that are inconvenient to the Hamas, a \u201ccorrection\u201d was issued, saying this was the **total** number of all people killed. This was as 2012. You can be sure that the deaths have continued\u2026 Publications and media are under almost constant surveillance, regarding what they publish, and always agree to requests to retract or withdraw when Hamas demands it. \u201cIt would be a real shame if something \u201chappened\u201d to your journalists\u2026\u201d ",
