I am going to teach you how to catch a fish. Rather then catching it for you. So that you never go hungry. What is this question? This question is classic word play. Where we use language to communicate facts and figures. Whats the purpose? The purpose is so that in future, you can find out the correct interpretation of the statement. How does the teacher assess? The teacher assess that you have interpreted the text accurately. Assuming your arithmetics skills are good.. Matching your answer with the right answer. Here arithmetic isn't of importance. What is this question? Its a question which uses the theme of trade. Where Selling point price is given. And if sold from that price point. Some percentage of loss, is incurred. What to do in this question? The question is clear, FIND the new selling price. With a percentage of profit. What to solve here? The question intends you to reverse calculate to the real cost. Because current selling point is a loss making one. So find the cost. Then new selling point, upon the cost. Now? Get busy. ",
