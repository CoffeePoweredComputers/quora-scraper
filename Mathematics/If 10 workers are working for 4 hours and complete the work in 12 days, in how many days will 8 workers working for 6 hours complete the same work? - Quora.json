            "answer_text": "Assumption: the 10 men worked 4 hrs a day, and not more , is for a reason. Assuming the work can only be done in chunks of 40 man hours , and they cannot continue and leave the next chunk partly done. Even if they try to work another 4 hrs on a same day , fatigue or labor laws , prevents them from doing so . So 8 men do 5 hours of the 40 man hours work per day , and cannot continue , due to same reasons mentioned above. Maybe they get extra hr each day to just do nothing or maybe they go easy and take the full 6 hr to work each day. Thus , they will take the same TWELVE DAYS !! to finish the work . ",

Example, let\u2019s say you had to built widget that required two people and one widget making machine to build the widget in 12 days. Putting 4 people to work will not shorten the time as the machine only requires 2 people to operate it. Therefore the only way to reduce the production time is to buy more widget making machines. Don\u2019t forget the critical line may be affected by other bottle necks such as lead times for raw materials. I suggest you google critical path analysis on how small changes can have a disproportionate impact to a production line or service. ",

Then divide the total number of hours by the number of employees. Then you know how long it took each employee to finish the project. Next you can take how long it takes each employee and divide it by 8 employees. Then divide that by 6 hours. Your answer will be the number of days it takes. ",
