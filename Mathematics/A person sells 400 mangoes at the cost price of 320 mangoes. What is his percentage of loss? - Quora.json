Let the CP of 1 mango be Rs.1 For 320 mangoes: CP will be Rs. 320 SP of 400 mangoes = Rs 320 SP of 1 mango = 320/400 = Rs. 0.8 As, we can clearly see SP < CP ; it's a loss Loss = 1\u20130.8 = Rs 0.2 Loss % = (Loss/CP)*100 Loss % = 0.2*100 = 20% :-) ",

Assuming the deal to have a price x rupees => the unit CP==(x/320) & that for unit SP = (x/400). So, the % loss per unit mango is [{(x/320)-(x/400)}/(x/320)]\u00d7100=(80/400)\u00d7100 =20%. Ans.. ",
