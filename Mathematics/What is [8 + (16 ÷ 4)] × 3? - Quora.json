            "answer_text": "What is [8 + (16 \u00f7 4)] \u00d7 3? Please, please erase PEMDAS and BODMAS from your memory and learn the math: Always do the operations that are enclosed in parentheses or brackets first, from the inside outward. Here, we calculate (16 \u00f7 4) first, which is 4. Then we do the calculation inside the square brackets: [8 + 4] = 12. Next, we would do powers (orders, or exponents), but there aren\u2019t any in this equation, so we can move on. Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right, as written. BODMAS does not mean division is always first, and PEMDAS does not mean that multiplication is always first. Both of those are wrong. Learn the math, not the memory tricks! Here, we multiply the quantity inside the square brackets, which is 12, by 3: 12 \u00d7 3 = 36. Finally, if there were any remaining addition or subtraction, we\u2019d do those also from left to right, as written. PEMDAS and BODMAS do not mean that addition is always first. That\u2019s wrong. Learn the math, not the memory tricks! ",

There\u2019s two dollops of bracket work to do in there and we go from the inside out. So first we do 16/4 which of course equals 4. We get: [8+4]3 Doing the second dollop, we get 8+4 which is twelve, and all we get then is: 12 X 3 Which is 36. BIDMAS. Remember it. ",
