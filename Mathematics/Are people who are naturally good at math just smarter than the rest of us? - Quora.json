            "answer_text": "No, not really. I\u2019m good at math, but it only helps me in a limited way. It doesn\u2019t help me with researching, writing, playing chess, studying, or even arguing effectively. I also know a few math people. They are really good at math but don\u2019t have any particular knowledge or skills outside math. So, math, speaking from my experience, helps me to solve problems when it comes to quantifying or calculating something. I think it\u2019s a good tool, but only in association with other intellectual skills. However, I have learned some good study habits from studying math: For instance, in order to understand a new mathematical concept, I first have to listen to the explanation or read the description. Then I have to try out some problem sets. When I don\u2019t get the right answers, it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t understand the explanation as well as I thought. So I go back and forth between learning the concept and applying it. Usually, I go through a state of total bewilderment to getting a few problem sets right to suddenly understanding the pattern to being able to replicate it and getting the solutions most of the time. Incidentally, when I don\u2019t get the solution, it\u2019s usually because I\u2019ve made a careless mistake, misusing an operation or using the wrong number in the equation. So this process of learning has been very useful for me when it comes to learning anything. I find it useful when learning a language or learning how to use a new software program. It\u2019s a simple algorithm: Get instruction.Try out instructions.Repeat looping steps 1 and 2 until I am able to replicate the process without a problem.Another thing I have learned from math is to follow a formulaic attitude to everything. I do this by making templates for everything. This makes it easier to do something well repeatedly. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer: Usually, but not always. The longer answer: Being good at math in and of itself does not mean a person is smarter than anyone else. Think about Rain Man. A person can be extremely good at, say, calculating numbers, but otherwise unable to lead a self-sufficient life. However, math ability does tend to correlate with high intelligence, and outside of cases of autistic savants, math probably has a higher correlation with IQ (for what that\u2019s worth) than any other area of ability. That said, \u201cintelligence\u201d is a tricky thing to define. IQ measures one kind of intelligence, essentially the ability to figure out particular kinds of problems. And some kinds of intelligence do tend to correlate with one another (e.g., musical and mathematical ability have some tendency to overlap), while others are fairly unrelated (e.g., logical reasoning and interpersonal skills). So you really have to define intelligence well before you can measure how well math skills correlate with it. ",
