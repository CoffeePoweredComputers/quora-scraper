            "answer_text": "Well my friend it\u2019s obviously the Radius. Angular AND Tangential acceleration both have units of Angular Speed and Tangential Speed over time. The usual relationship between Tangential and Angular speed is the Radius. Naturally there is no \u201ctime proportionality\u201d between \u201ctangential time\u201d and \u201cangular time\u201d rather than a plain simple \u201c1\u201d. Ergo \u201cTangential Acceleration = R * Angular Acceleration\u201d Hope ive been clear. ",
