            "answer_text": "There is not enough information given to address a standard frequentist probability. Say [math]N[/math] is the total number of marbles in the bag. There may be other types of objects in the bag as well. So far, we are given information on [math]15[/math] objects ([math]5[/math] red, [math]3[/math] yellow, and [math]7[/math] blue marbles respectively). Of the remaining [math]N-15[/math] possible objects in the bag, we cannot reliably attempt to guess how many are white, hence to possibly give a frequentist guess at the probability of choosing a white marble from the bag. However, if each of the remaining [math]N-15[/math] objects is a QM-behaving entity, with a possible state of \u201cwhite ball\u201d having a non-zero probability [math]p_k[/math], for the [math]k-[/math]th remaining object [math](k\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N-15\\})[/math], and we are given [math]N[/math], then we can approximate a quantum probability for observing and choosing a white ball. These remaining objects may also be non-QM, in which case, we calculate a standard frequentist probability of choosing a white ball based on the [math]p_k, N,[/math] and the composition of the other colored balls.
