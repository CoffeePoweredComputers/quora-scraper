            "answer_text": "You use integration. After all, the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus state that, in some loose sense of the word, the derivative and integral are inverse one another: (I) [math]f(x)=\\frac d{dx}\\int_c^xf(t)\\,dt[/math] (II) [math]\\int_a^bf'(x)\\,dx=f(b)-f(a)[/math] Thus, for example, if [math]f'(x)=x^2[/math], then (II) tells us that [math]\\int_a^bx^2\\,dx=f(b)-f(a)[/math]. Now, the familiar rules of integration entail [math]\\int x^2\\,dx=\\frac 13x^3+A[/math]. Of course, we go around questioning what the heck [math]A[/math] is \u2014 it can be any constant real number whatsoever, and adding it will not change the derivative of the right-hand side. In this case [math]A[/math] is called the constant of integration. When taking a definite integral though, this constant cancels itself out: [math]\\int_a^bx^2\\,dx=\\left(\\frac 13b^3+A\\right)-\\left(\\frac 13a^3+A\\right)=\\frac 13(b^3-a^3)[/math] thus giving a well-defined value in result. Thus if [math]f'(x)=x^2[/math], then (II) implies [math]f(b)-f(a)=\\frac 13(b^3-a^3)[/math]. It follows that [math]f(x)-f(0)=\\frac 13x^3[/math]. If we take [math]A=f(0)[/math], then [math]A[/math] is a constant such that [math]f(x)=\\frac 13x^3+A[/math] for all [math]x\\in\\mathbb R[/math]. Thus, we have a consistent definition of [math]f(x)[/math], which depends on an arbitrary constant [math]A[/math] but covers all possible answers to the question. This method likewise leads you to the function when you are given its derivative. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically, The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that Differentiation and Integration are inverse processes. So you can \u2018reverse\u2019 the differentiation by integrating. That is really easy with polynomials, you increase the power of x by one and divide by the new, larger power. So, [math]\\int x^2dx=\\frac{x^3}{3}+c[/math] The reason for the [math]+c[/math] is the reason that the answer to your question isn\u2019t as neat as you would like. The original function might have been [math]\\frac{x^3}{3}+4[/math] or [math]\\frac{x^3}{3}-\\pi[/math] or indeed any other function of the form [math]\\frac{x^3}{3}\\pm {a\\ constant}[/math] So you can not be sure exactly which one was the \u2018original function\u2019 unless you are given some additional information. For that reason, when doing an indefinite integral (which this is) you always add on the [math]+c[/math] to show that uncertainty. ",

            "answer_text": "It's the same thing as finding the integral of [math]f'(x)[/math], which is [often generally defined as] [math]f(x)[/math]. Integral Calculus tells us that if we want to find the integral [[math]f(x)[/math]] of a function [math]f'(x)=x^n[/math] with respect to [math]x[/math], then [math]f(x)=\\dfrac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C[/math].
