            "answer_text": "Homework Question: Joe walked 4 miles north, 9 miles east, 8 miles north, and then 7 miles east. If Joe now decides to walk straight back to where he started, how far must he walk? First of all, you should do your own homework. But I am really fascinated by Joe as a character. Joe is not very compelling. Neither is his journey. Is he just accumulating steps on a Fitbit? He seems rather aimless. If Joe is going to walk all of the way mentioned in your homework question, I hope he\u2019s at least stopping to meet friends and doing interesting things at points along his route. Before Joe turns around to go home, he should sit down and stay for awhile! Maybe Joe can see a show or a movie, or a gallery show. Maybe Joe can participate in an improv group. Joe could benefit from any kind of culture while he does math. Both matter. I\u2019ve got to say, Joe is beginning to look like a pretty good example of why a well rounded liberal arts STEAM and not only STEM inclusive education is vital to personal development, and still includes the teaching of math and science. Anyway, after all of that aimless walking, what would motivate Joe to also walk back home, and why would he necessarily take the same exact route? I don\u2019t see a critically clear logical reason for him to make either of those choices, necessarily . That may work for a basic math problem, but not in life. Joe should really be cultivated as a more complex character. And remember: you should always do your own homework, because that\u2019s how you learn. Also, If you submitted someone else\u2019s answer as your own homework, you were not ethical. It actually wasn\u2019t that ethical of adults to give you those answers. They should have helped point this out to you and are as responsible as you for this lapse in ethics. This time. You need to learn to do better going forward. So do they. For this and larger scale ethical dilemmas your entire lives. ",

            "answer_text": "To make this problem a little more interesting, let's add a story. Joe walked 4 miles north to pick up a piece of candy. He then walked 9 miles east to pick up another piece of candy.When Joe finally walked 7 miles east to pick up another piece of candy, he realized there was another piece of candy at his original position. How far away is Joe from that piece of candy? Should Joe still get that piece of candy, even though there is a suspicious looking box that looks like it might just tip over if that piece of string was pulled?     Part 1.a=4+8=12b=9+7=16a squared + b squared = c squaredc is what you are trying to find144+256=400square root of 400 is 20. Joe is 20 miles away from the piece of candy. Part II.Might as well get the last piece right? Extra credit.Assuming Joe walked 9 miles per hour (average speed given he was being chased by a nursery of rabid, mutated raccoons the whole time), and didn't stop for any break, how fast must Joe travel to go back in time and tell himself it was not worth the journey?    a.Time spent being chased by raccoons: 28/9= 3.11 hours . Yes, Joe spent 3.11 hours running from rabid raccoons at 9mph. Instead of standing up to a nursery, he ran for his life. Given he is a 140 lb grown 28 year old male, he has burned 3068 calories running from those savage little beasts.   b. (physicists, get ready to murder my answer)(299790000m/s-299\u2009792\u2009458m/s)= drum roll please...2458 meters per second faster than the speed of light = an additional 91.63982339616 mph over the speed of light (in a vacuum) The perfect answer would be:If Joe walked a total of 28 miles, 12 miles North and 16 miles East, running from a gaze of raccoons while picking up pieces of candy, he would end up 20 miles from his last piece of candy, in which he would have to travel 299790000m/s (91.63mph over the speed of light) for 60 seconds from his frame of reference to go back in time to warn himself from embarking on the journey, all while in an astronaut suit (taking into affect he there is no atmosphere, hence speed of light in a vacuum). So how far really is Joe from his original position? The original position is actually 17987400000 meters or in American, 11,176,852 miles Even more extra credit Because the land is flat, I assume the planet looks like a cube. here is the volume of the earth (4/3) (3.14) (6400000^3)let's convert it to a cube by simply cube rooting Earth's volume as suchx^3=(4/3) (3.14) (6400000^3)x=1.0315*10^7 meters      That's how long a length of one side of Earth would be.Because Joe is traveling 299790000m/s for 60 seconds (assuming Joe is traveling on the ground the whole time and not flying off the surface of the planet), Joe has traveled a total distance of 2698110000 meters. Divide that number by the circumference (in this case the perimeter of the cube which is one side length times 4  [2698110000 / 1.0315*10^7]) and you get the distance of how many time he went around (if not orbited) the Earth in 60 seconds. He went back in time 3.11 hours. It will take him 53 minutes to run back to his original position (or he could just text himself) to warn of the dangers of the journey. ",
