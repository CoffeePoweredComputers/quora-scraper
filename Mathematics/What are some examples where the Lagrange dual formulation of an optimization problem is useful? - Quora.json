            "answer_text": "A classical problem in mathematical finance is utility maximization / portfolio optimization.  An agent is basically investing in a stock market, and can choose an investment strategy pi, which results in some terminal wealth [math] X_T = X^\\pi_T [/math], which is some random variable, and the T refers to the end of the time horizon.  The agents wants to pick a strategy that maximizes his expected utility, [math] E \\left[ U \\left(X_T \\right) \\right] [/math].   Now U expresses the agent's risk aversion, and is modeled as a concave function, because the agent is wealth loving, but prefers a sure thing to an even bet.  Thus, the portfolio optimization is a convex (ok, concave) optimization problem.  This problem has a dual formulation.  Instead of maximizing over terminal wealths, one can minimize over the dual variables to terminal wealths, which are the (arbitrage free) pricing rules.  This is actually a common theme in economic theory, this duality between goods and prices.   In the classical case, one assumes that financial markets are complete.  This means that all risk in the market is capable of being hedged.  After some math (what is called the 2nd Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing), it emerges that this is equivalent to there being precisely one dual element (this is called the unique martingale measure).  Therefore, the dual optimization problem is trivial!  It is solved, and then inverted to get the primal optimum.  This methodology can be extended to incomplete markets, where there are unhedgeable sources of risk.  In a generalized sense, the dual optimization problem then becomes one of minimizing the entropy with respect to the physical measure This method was pioneered by Karatzas, and extended very deeply by Kramkov and Schachermayer.
