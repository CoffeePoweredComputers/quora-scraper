            "answer_text": "According to EBMcalc Medical Calculator , statistically, the average male with those parents would end up 185 cm, with a range of 177.5 - 193.5 cm. The genetics of height is too complicated for predictions to be any more accurate than +/- 8.5 cm. You should be happy that you surpassed the average. Whether you can grow more depends on only one thing - your bone age. The bone age is determined by the number of growth plates left in the X-ray of the left hand and wrist. Once they are closed, growth is over. This is typically at a bone age of around 17 - 18. For the average kid, the bone age is the same as their chronological age, but there is a lot of variation. You can get an X-ray to find out, but most physicians will not order this without a medical reason, not just to satisfy your curiosity. But, there is good correlation between bone age and puberty. You might get some idea how much growth you have left by figuring out where you are in your pubertal development. Growth stops when puberty is complete, as the hormones play a large role in closing the bone\u2019s growth plates. The final stage of puberty is called Tanner Stage 5. (google \u201cTanner stages of puberty\u201d). The average age boys reach Tanner 5 is 15 - 17 years old and the average boy has reached his final adult height by age 16 or 17. Boys who start puberty earlier than average (11.5 years) will stop growing sooner and boys who start puberty later than average will grow until an older age. If your pubic hair extends from the crotch area to include the medial (inside) aspects of your thighs, this is Tanner 5. There is typically a year or two of growth left once Tanner 5 begins. Hair along the linea alba, the line that \u201cconnects\u201d your pubic hair to your belly button generally means that growth is over. For males, if you need to shave everyday to avoid a 5 o\u2019clock shadow look, you are finished growing taller. ",

            "answer_text": "No, you can\u2019t. The average male stops growing at 18 and it\u2019s super very rare to see a male grow past 22. You stopped growing at least 3 years ago. No one I know - unless they have gigantism - grows past 22 and you\u2019re a few years past that anyways. Also, you already outgrew both parents. So why the fuck are you worrying? You are already taller than the average male in every country (even the Netherlands), so I\u2019d be thankful that I ended up tall if I were you. There are truly short men who\u2019d love to be your height, let alone, just be average (175cm for men). So instead of bitching about it like a 5-year-old, be thankful that you are taller than 29 out of every 30 males worldwide. ",
