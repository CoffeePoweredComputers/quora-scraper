            "answer_text": "These form an arithmetic progression (AP). If you find the difference between any two consecutive elements, it will always be constant (-1 in this case) For example, 1,4,7,10,13,16 \u2026\u2026 is an AP because each number is increased by 3 to make the next number (the difference of these numbers is called the common difference of AP ) Similarly , 4,-1,-6,-11,-16\u2026\u2026 is also an AP with common difference of -5. Now, coming to the question, (x-2) - (x-1) = -1 ( Term 2 - Term 1 ) (x-3) - (x-2) = -1 ( Term 3 - Term 2 ) (x-4) - (x-3) = -1 ( Term 4 - Term 3 ) .. .. .. So, difference between any two terms is same. So, they are an AP with common difference of -1. ",
