For example:  On the other hand, in the second case, where A is a subset of B, it means that every member of A is also a member of B. For example, both  and  are subsets of the set B above. In particular, this definition of subset means that both the empty set and B itself are subsets of B. This is true regardless of what B is, including when B is the empty set. ",
