            "answer_text": "If you are traveling on a route with mileposts, and you are looking for the best app which can help you find out the speed of your vehicle. Then use the GPS Speedometer App: Heads Up Display Car Odometer to find out how fast your vehicle is. GPS Speedometer App: Heads Up Display Car Odometer - Apps on Google Play Why is this app so distinct from the other speedo applications on the play store? 1 - If you don't have an internet connection, then don't worry this app will still work in the offline mode.2 - GPS Speedometer App not only shows you CURRENT speed, it also shows AVERAGE speed, total DISTANCE, MAXIMUM speed and TRIP time taken, you can change the UNITS whenever you want, in the center of your trip.3 - As if you want m / s, km / h or mph, you can put your DESIRED UNITS here. In the GPS speedometer app, the corresponding speed and distance will be shown.4 - GPS Speedometer is displayed in landscape and Portrait Mode5 - It keeps data like distance traveled, time duration spent, and time started and time ended in one trip.6 - This speed app is SMALL in size.

            "answer_text": "The speed is determined by when you measured the vehicle. The question stated that a vehicle traveled 30 km in one hour, but did not state it was a constant speed. If it was going 40 km/hr for 30 minutes and then 20 km/hr for 30 minutes, it would still cover 30 km in one hour. Or 50 km/hr and 10 km/hr, or any combination that would give a total of 30 km in one hour. ",
