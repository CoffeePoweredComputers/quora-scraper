            "answer_text": "Any finite -regular graph for  contains a cycle, but infinite -regular graphs need not have any cycles. Here\u2019s an example (copied from Regular graph - Wikipedia) of a 1-regular graph, which does not contain a cycle.  A finite 2-regular graph must contain a cycle. But here\u2019s an infinite 2-regular graph that does not contain a cycle. (From File:Infinite-2-regular-graph.png - Wikimedia Commons)  Similar infinite constructions exist for -regular graphs. For example, We can create an infinite tree with root of degree , and each other node having  children. Any finite graph with vertex degree of at least 2 must contain a cycle. Here\u2019s a quick proof: an acyclic undirected graph is a tree. A finite tree always has  vertices and  edges. But if the degree of every vertex is at least 2, then we have at least  edges, so the graph cannot be a tree and must not be acyclic. (See Prove that every undirected finite graph with vertex degree of at least 2 has a cycle for some alternate proofs.) ",
