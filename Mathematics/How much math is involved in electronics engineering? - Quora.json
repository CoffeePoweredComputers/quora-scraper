            "answer_text": "At about age 11 I got interested in a high-school chemistry book that had appeared in our house. Then I saw the statement in it to the effect that chemists had to know a lot of mathematics. Since I was having trouble with percentages in elementary school at the time, I put the book aside and turned my attention to electricity and electronics. Scan ahead 6 years and I\u2019m ready to head off to university, studying electrical engineering. I meet with a family friend who is an electrical engineer. He says \u201celectrical - that uses the most math of any branch of engineering\u201d. I was mortifed - but it was too late to change. I managed to get through with average grades - then it didn\u2019t matter any more. ",
