            "answer_text": "It's not impossible to transition into mathematics, especially from another highly technical field. It is still expected that you have a substantial background in math, and a good understanding of calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. As an engineer these topics should not be new to you. A pure math track may require additional coursework in abstract algebra and analysis as well.  Regardless, many programs will admit students from other disciplines with the stipulation that they complete some more foundational courses upon arrival. This can usually done over the summer or in one extra summester. It would certainly be beneficial to explain in your application why you are choosing this career change. Show them that you're passionate about mathematics! ",

            "answer_text": "Many institutes all over the world will accept a student without an undergraduate mathematics degree (but with some degree) for a research (PhD) level programme in Mathematics provided the student demonstrates some interest and aptitude for it. This means that you must show that you have studied quite a bit of undergraduate level mathematics in at least one area thoroughly. If admitted to the programme, you will do some remedial reading and then be examined for readiness for a PhD. In a number of institutes you can obtain a master's degree based on your mastery (!) of whatever they need for you to qualify for the research component of a PhD. I know at least a handful of people who have made the kind of transition that you wish to make. ",
