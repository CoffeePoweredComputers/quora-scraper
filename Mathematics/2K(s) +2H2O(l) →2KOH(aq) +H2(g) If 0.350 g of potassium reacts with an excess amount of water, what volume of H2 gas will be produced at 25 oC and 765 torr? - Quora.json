            "answer_text": "First we calculate how many moles of potassium we have: 0.35/39= 0.009 moles Since water is in excess we base our measurements on potassium. We want to calculate how many moles of hydrogen we have: 0.009/2= 0.0045 moles of Hydrogen at standard conditions Now we can also calculate the volume of hydrogen at standard conditions: Density of Hydrogen at STP is around 0.09 g/L m(H2)= 0.0045*2= 0.009 g V(H2) = (0.009 g)/ (0.09 g/L) = 0.1L at STP However our conditions state that the temperature and pressure are different from standard conditions so we use the following formula (Charles Law): PV/T = pv/t (the capital letters are the values for standard conditions and the small letters are for our conditions) - I noted them like this because is easier to type Standard temperature is 273K (T) Temperature in our experiment is 273+25 = 298K (t) Standard pressure is 1 atm (P) Pressure in our expermiment is 1.00658 atm (p) - transform 765 torr to atm Volume at STP is 0.1 L (V) So now we calculate the volume in our experiment by replacing the values in Charles Law formula and we get that: v = 0.108444 L Answer: 0.108444 L fo Hydrogen will be produced at 25 oC and 765 Torr ",

            "answer_text": "0.350 g of K = 0.350/39.1 = 8.95  10 mol = 8.95 mmol K. This will produce 8.95/2 = 4.48 mmol H. Molar volume at 25 \u00b0C is 24.5 mL/mmol, so 4.48*24.5 = 110 mL H will be produced. ",
