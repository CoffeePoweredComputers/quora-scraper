            "answer_text": "Soln: Let a and b be the two angles of the triangle. By questions, a + b = 116 \u2026\u2026\u2026(i) and a - b = 24 \u2026\u2026\u2026(ii) Adding i and ii we get, a + b + a - b = 116 + 24 => 2a = 140 => a = 140/2 = 70 Putting a = 70 in (i) we get 70 + b = 116 => b = 116 - 70 = 46 By angles sum property of a triangle, The third angle = 180 - (a+b) =180 - 116 = 64. Therefore, the measures of the angles are 46, 64 and 70 ",
