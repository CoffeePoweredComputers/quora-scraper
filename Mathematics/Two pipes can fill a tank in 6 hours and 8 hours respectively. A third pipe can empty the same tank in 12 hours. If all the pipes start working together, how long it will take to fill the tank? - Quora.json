            "answer_text": "One of the best ways to solve this will be to assume some capacity of the tank. No matter whatever capacity we take, the answer will still be the same. Now, to simplify the calculations, lets take the capacity of the tank to be an LCM(Least Common Multiple) of 6,8 and 12 which is 24 Litres. Now lets find the rate of each pipe (In terms of Litres/Hour) The rate of the first pipe= 24/6= 4 Litres/hour The rate of the second pipe=24/8= 3 Litres/hour The rate of the Third pipe=(-24/12) = -2 Litres/hour ( Make sure that I have used the minus sign because the water is being removed through this pipe) The next step is easy\u2026 Just add them and you will get the final rate when the pipes work together!! = 4 + 3 + (-2) = 5 Litres/hour. Now, if a pipe of rate 1 Litre/hour fills a tank of capacity 24 Litres in 24 hours, Then, a pipe of rate 5 Litres/hour fills a tank of capacity 24 litres in 24/5= 4.8 hours. And that\u2019s your final answer! I used 24 Litre Capacity of the tank for simplicity, you can also assume it be x and then solve using the same method I used. You will get the same answer because in the final step the x will be divided by itself. ",

Pipe B is filling the tank at 1/8 (3/24) rate per hour The combined Filling rates of Pipe A & B = 7/24 per hour Pipe C can empty the the tank at a rate of Minus 1/12 or 2/24 per hour.
