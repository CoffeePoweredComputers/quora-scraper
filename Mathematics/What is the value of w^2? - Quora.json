            "answer_text": "If you mean omega^2, it its value is (-1/2)-i.(\u221a3)/2,and it is one of the cube roots of 1, where i stands for \u221a(-1). The other two cube roots of 1, are 1 and omega = (-1/2)+i.\u221a(3)/2. The non-real cube roots omega and omega^2 are the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + x + 1 = 0. ",
