            "answer_text": "If I am correct to understand your question, you mean to ask how many numbers between 101\u2013200 are divisible by 4? If this is question then solution is seemingly simple. Let us consider the first number divisible by 4 in the close proximity of 101 is 104 (a number to be divisible by 4, the last two digit of the number must be a multiple of 4). 104,108,112,116\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.200 It follows a series of number which can be written as Nth term = first term + (no. of terms-1)* common difference (d) 200 = 104 + (n-1)d ; where d= 108\u2013104= 112\u2013108\u2026..=4 200 = 104 + (n-1)4 200 = 104 -4 + 4n 4n = 100 n = 25. There will some 25 numbers between 101 - 200 divisible by 4. ",
