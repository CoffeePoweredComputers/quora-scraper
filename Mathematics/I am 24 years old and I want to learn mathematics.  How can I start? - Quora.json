            "answer_text": "Well, being 24 years old, you must be at a stage where you can understand and interpret easily. Doesn't make sense to pick up grade school textbooks and see what's in them. I would suggest going for mathematical puzzles. And I mean problems which need rigorous mathematical treatment. Learning always becomes easy when you have to do it with an objective. Puzzles also serve as a productive passtime. I would advise that you start from combinatorics. That's one place where all you need is a basic knowledge of arithmetic and a logical mind. then theory of equations. Geometry you can approach the way that suits you most. I'm not sure if you're in a mood to do mathematics rigorously So calculus is optional. A lot of people also work a lot on styles of problem solving that eliminate the need for calculus. You could try looking into that.The most important part of this approach is that it will give you a good FEEL and INTUITION into mathematics.If you would like a book reccomendation, I would recommend Elementary mathematics by G Dorofeev. After that the rest will automatically fall into place based on how your interest grows. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do you want to learn math? Where you should start depends a lot on where you are and where you want to go. In any case, you're going to want textbooks and lectures. The textbooks provide problems to work on and good reference material, and the lectures provide a coherent presentation that's less comprehensive but more focused than the text. If you don't remember much high school math, start with elementary algebra and geometry. Texts are easy to find, and khanacademy.org has great lectures. If you find that you're struggling with pre-algebra (i.e. basic arithmetic, fractions, decimals, etc.), then back up and work on those first. If you feel pretty good about high school math, and you want to know math for engineering, simulation, etc., then move on to calculus next. If you're more interested in abstract mathematics, then you'll need a solid grounding in logic and proofs, after which you'll be ready for abstract algebra, analysis, combinatorics, etc. ",
