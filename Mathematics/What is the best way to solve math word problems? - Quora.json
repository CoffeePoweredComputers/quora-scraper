            "answer_text": "Hello! Your question is something that I bet most school kids, their parents, and probably even teachers come across a lot. I will try my best to provide an answer and links to further information! Firstly, let me say that the best way to solve math word problems is very subjective. Some people may be good at arithmetic operations or understanding formulae, some might be good at drawing diagrams and absorbing information from visual aids, while others might be good at reading and interpreting the data directly from the words on the page. Honestly it depends on what your strengths are. In general, solving a word problem usually requires the following steps: \u00b7 Read the problem and identify what the key phrases and operations are. Is it an algebra problem? Is it arithmetic? Maybe it\u2019s a commercial math problem which requires specific formulae like profit and loss. Or it could be a geometry problem about the properties of various angles, shapes, and lines. \u00b7 Identifying key words and phrases lets you decide what steps to take next. Does the problem require a diagram or does it involve plugging of data straight into certain formulae? Is there a graph or pie-chart which can help you understand the information more easily? \u00b7 Breaking down the word problem into diagrams and formulae really helps make the transition into a mathematical problem. Now all you need to do is put the values in the formulae and solve it. Now, coming back to the idea of different strengths that different people possess, when I was in school (and even now), I was very good at interpreting the data from the words and putting it in a formula. But once I put it in the formula and it was a game of numbers, it was challenging for me because I wasn\u2019t particularly good at mental calculations. I had to write stuff down, draw diagrams, take my time to do calculations. But the only thing that made me better was practice! Practice, practice, practice! With practice, you will see that certain key words will immediately point you in certain directions, you will realize faster and faster which formulae are to be used. Calculations that required you to write down the data and calculate it on paper will slowly become more comfortable. Similarly, if your strength is arithmetic calculations or understanding formulae (i.e. the mathematical side), you will see that interpretation of words and visual data will improve with practice. You will realize \u201coh I\u2019ve done something similar before, I know what this problem is asking!\u201d This was my attempt at answering your query, hope it helped! I would highly recommend this math blog where they delve into this topic in more detail! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.  I have two pieces of advice. First,  math is not a spectator sport. You can watch it for entertainment, but  the only way to learn the game is to get out and play.  This is not a skill gained overnight. Second, I'd like to offer a snippet from the book \"How To Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method\"   by George Pulyas.  Don't be put off by the title, this book is very  readable. Here are the most valuable two pages of that book: Understanding the Problem First. You have to understand the problem. What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition?Is  it possible to satisfy the condition? Is the condition sufficient to  determine the unknown? Or is it insufficient? Or redundant? Or  contradictory?  Draw a figure. [emphasis added: eg] Introduce suitable notation. Seperate the various parts of the condition. Can you write them down? Devising a plan Second.  Find the connection between the data and the unknown. You may be  obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot  be found. You should obtain eventually a plan of the solution. Have you seen it before? Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?Do you know a related problem? Do you know a theorem that could be useful?Look at the unknown! And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown.Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it? Could  you use its result? Could you use its method? Should you introduce some  auxiliary element in order to make its use possible? Could you restate the problem? Could you restate it still differently? Go back to definitions. If  you cannot solve the proposed problem try to solve first some related  problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem? A more  general problem? A more special problem? An analogous problem? Could you  solve another part of the problem? Keep only a part of the condition,  drop the other part; how far is the unknown then determined, how can it  vary? Could you derive something useful from the data? Could you think  of other data appropriate to determine the unknown? Could you change the  data appropriate to determine the unknown? Could you change the unknown  or the data, or both if necessary, so that the new unknown and the new  data are nearer to each other?  Did you use all the data? Did you  use the whole condition? Have you taken into account all the essential  notions involved in the problem? Carrying out the plan Third. Carry out your plan. Carrying out your plan of the solution, check each step. Can you see clearly that the step is correct? Can you prove that it is correct? Looking back Fourth. Can you check the result? Can you check the argument?Can you derive the result differently? Can you see it at a glance?Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem? HTH (answer adapted from How can one improve one's ability to solve math word problems?) ",
