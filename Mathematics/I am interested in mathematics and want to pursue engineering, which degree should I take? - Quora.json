            "answer_text": "Any Core Branch would do. 1) Mechanical Engineering:Thermal, Fluid and Heat Transfer requires sound knowledge of calculus and more specifically Differential Equations.CAD & CAE needs discrete mathematics and Linear Algebra to solve matrices and polynomial equations.Also Numerical Methods and Statistics is essential for understanding various models of mechanical sytems (eg: Operation Research or Mechatronics). 2) Computer Science:Discrete Mathematics is the foundation of modern computer science. Starting with Set Theory (Venn Diagrams) and Mathematical Logic it goes up to the study of Graphs, Trees and Combinatorics. Probability is also  an essential topic along with Topology (Advanced Geometry) and Advanced Algebra. 3) Civil Engineering:Structural Analysis demands sound knowledge of basic mathematical skills like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, etc. 4) Electronics and Electrical Engineering:Subjects like Power Electronics, Communication, Control Engineering, Signal Processing needs Differential Calculus, Complex Analysis, Fourier Analysis, Linear Algebra and Probability. So basically every branch of engineering will need to mathematical tools to solve problems. But remember a few things: 1) Math is a Subset of Engg:If you're choosing engineering just due to your interest in mathematics then you might be disappointed as mathematics is just a tool needed and there are many subjects that go without a single equation. 2) Some branches need less of itDon't confuse Information Technology with Computer Science as IT is more of front end programming like application development or web designing where maths is less used. CS on the other side deals with more back-end coding like OS development where interaction with hardware is necessary. This requires an optimized programme so the algorithm must be appropriately developed. This needs a lot of mathematical skill as the algorithm must be faster, smaller and simpler, all at a time. 3) You hardly apply what you learn Studying mathematics and being expert in it doesn't ensure that the job you'll be doing after graduating will need any of it. Majority of the engineers that pass out, almost 90% of them don't solve a single equation in their entire career. This is mostly because nowadays computers do the labor and things have become modular and pre-defined. So as you don't develop anything from the scratch, maths rarely comes into the picture. So choose wisely!Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Go for Mathematics and Computing Engineering (MCE) , it is a blend of mathematics with computer science and mathematical finance . The programme has three components: mathematics, computing and financial engineering which are perfectly blended so that the strong mathematical and analytical components that are in-built in the curriculum form the basis on which the technological aspects of computing and finance are developed. But this course is available in very few colleges of india like several IITs and DTU. ",
