            "answer_text": "Answer is 58%. Let M denotes the marked price. According to given data we have, Price after 1st discount of 30% = (1 - 0.30) * M = 0.7*M Price after 2nd discount of 40% = (1 - 0.40) * (0.7*M) = 0.42*M = (1 - 0.58) * M Hence a single discount of 58% is equivalent two successive discounts of 30% and 40%.
