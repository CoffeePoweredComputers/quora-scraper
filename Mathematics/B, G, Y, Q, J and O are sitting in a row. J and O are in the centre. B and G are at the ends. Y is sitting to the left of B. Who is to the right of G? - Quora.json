            "answer_text": "We have, from J and O in the centre and B and G at the ends, the row being (left to right, slash meaning \u201cone of the two\u201d): B/G, ?, J/O, O/J, ?, G/B The two ?s can only be the other two letters, Q and Y; thus, the row is: B/G, Q/Y, J/O, O/J, Y/Q, G/B Y is to the left of B. Thus, B cannot be at the left end, leaving: G, Q/Y, J/O, O/J, Y/Q, B Now, there are two possible interpretations of \u201cto the right\u201d. It could mean: a) \u201cin the next seat to the right\u201d, or b) \u201cin the next seat to the right, at the right end, or anything in between\u201d. In either case, \u201cto the left\u201d should mean the reverse of \u201cto the right\u201d. With interpretation a), Y is in the next-to-rightmost seat: G, Q, J/O, O/J, Y, B Thus, Q is to the right of G. With interpretation b), everyone else (B, Y, Q, J, and O) is to the right of G. ",
