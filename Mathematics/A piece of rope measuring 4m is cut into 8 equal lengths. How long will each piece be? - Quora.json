            "answer_text": "Ah, man. I\u2019ve seen many complex equations in my time, but none as puzzling as this. Ok. In my research, I calculated roughly 322204826 molecules of water in a meter. It\u2019s not rope, but it\u2019ll have to do. That\u2019s about 1288819304 molecules in 4 meters. Since four is half of eight, that means you\u2019re dividing that number by double the number, and double the number is 2577638608. The answer you get is 0.5. So, the pieces are 0.5 m long. Dang that was a doozy. ",

If you cut the rope 7 times (thus creating 8 pieces) you will never be able to cut them equally. Perhaps, by happenstance, one will be exactly 50 cm, plus or minus 0, but probably not two and certainly not all of them. So, depending on the skill of the cutter, each piece will be approximately 50 cm long but they will never be equal. So I guess the best answer to the question is: nobody knows. ",
