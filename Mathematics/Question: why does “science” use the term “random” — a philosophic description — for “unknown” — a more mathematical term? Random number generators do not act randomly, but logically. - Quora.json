            "answer_text": "Science uses the word \u201crandom\u201d to mean different things\u2026 and not just in the philosophical sense. You will be familiar with the way words can have more than one use? That is just how language works. This is the answer to the question:\u201d \u201cbecause words don\u2019t work the way the question assumes they do.\u201d However, that does not get you very far\u2026 I\u2019ll explain: Something being random is not the same as something being \u201cunknown\u201d\u2026 and that is not the use of the term in philosophy either. Chance versus Randomness The question mentions random-number generators \u2026 which generate \u201cpseudo-random\u201d numbers, not random numbers \u2026 so the term \u201crandom number generator\u201d is a misnomer. It is used because everyone understands that the object of such systems is to approximate as closely as needed, a random process. It need only have very low predicability for the period of the simulation. There are, however, random-number generators that do not behave logically \u2026 because they use natural processes rather than computer logic. For instance, a meteorological station measuring wind-speed in a gusty area is staggeringly random, if the number is the lowest digit of the speed most recently recorded when accessed. You are defied to find the pattern. In scientific theories, \u201crandom\u201d processes are a mathematical idealization. We accept that we cannot get to absolute random like we cannot get to infinity, or any absolute value or quality. That does not stop the concepts being useful for making models. ",

            "answer_text": "In a mathematical context, \u201crandom\u201d is not a philosophical term, and it has a much stricter meaning than simply \u201cunknown.\u201d It\u2019s a probabilistic term, and it means that all numbers are equally likely, and that the probability of any number at any time does not depend on what numbers turned up before. Of course a programmed \u201crandom number generator\u201d is not truly random, but every number has almost the same probability, and the probability distribution at any time depends significantly only on occurrences in the remote past. That makes it useful for experimental models.

Because statistics, a field of mathematics, uses the term random. Also, \u201cunknown\u201dimplies that nothing is known about the event, while random processes usually follow a predictable mathematically defined distribution - Gaussian, chi-squared, or whatever. Random number generators do not act randomly, but logically. If they\u2019re behaving \u201clogically\u201d because they\u2019re driven by an algorithm, they\u2019re actually pseudo-random number generators. However, over the past few decades it has become common for CPUs to include a hardware-based random bit generator which uses thermal noise across a diode or other similar quantum mechanical source as a source of randomness.

Answer: Because certain quantum phenomena seem to have what\u2019s technically called \u2018No hidden variables\u2019 i.e. Nothing at all \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 (at least as far as anyone can tell). Random number generators do not act randomly, but logically. No unless they are driven by some quantum phenomena like the decay of a radioactive element which seems to be without any \u2018hidden variables\u2019 behind the scenes but pseudo-random number generators are just as good if there\u2019s no way to predict their deterministic results. They are fine for something like creating a lottery number draw where balls bounce all over the place & cannot be controlled or predicted even though in principle they could be but not in practice.

I don\u2019t know the history of the terms, but \u201crandom\u201d has been used for a variable ranging over a probability space for a long time in mathematics. \u201cUnknown\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to imply that a probability is involved, nor even that it is impossible to prove what the value is from already known facts.
