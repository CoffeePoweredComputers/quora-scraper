Will a population of thousands of students actually produce all [math]2^{10}[/math] possibilities, or will some be absent? After all, pseudo-random number generators do sometimes fail to produce a particular output. \u201cOn producing random binary sequences\u201d, January 2009, The American Journal of Psychology 122(2):141-51, by Raymond Nickerson and Susan F. Butler[1], studies nearly this exact scenario. Each of 30 Tufts undergraduates, who participated for course credit, was asked to produce 100 10-item random sequences. This was done by typing 100 sequences, each of which was composed of 10 ones or zeros (representing heads or tails). Participants were asked to imagine that each of 100 people had tossed a coin 10 times and the results had been recorded in a table of 100 rows and 10 columns, with each row recording the outcomes of the 10 tosses by 1 person. They were asked to produce a table of the same size in such a way that if it were compared with the one that represented actual coin tosses, it would not be possible to tell with statistical tests which table represented the actual coin tosses and which did not. (The authors note that other studies ask the subjects to produce a sequence \u201clike\u201d one generated at random, but this could correctly lead the subjects to avoid unlikely occurrences!)  What this shows is that the subjects overestimated the number of even splits, overestimated all-heads or all-tails, and underestimated uneven splits such as 7\u20133. Analysis of the number of runs showed a similar divergence from strict probability, but they concluded that the students showed at least a reasonable idea about what the shape of the distribution should be. Interestingly, when the researchers looked at the first sequence from all 30 subject, it showed quite a lot of discrepancy from the uniform random distribution:  Based on this information we find no evidence that the students are incapable of guessing particular sequences (such as those with extremal counts or long runs), though they are certainly less likely to produce some outcomes, particularly on the first try. But, it is not an exact match\u2014 a student placed in a high-stress environment might not perform as well at producing random outputs. A student who always guesses the first option may well second-guess themselves on reviewing the outcome after the 10 questions have been answered.
