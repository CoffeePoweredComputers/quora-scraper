            "answer_text": "Fuse is a overload protective device connected in series - along the path of a load to be Protected. It must have continuos current carrying capacity, minimum , that of the load to be protected.. Too high a \u2018A\u2019 rating will under protect the load.That is \u2014 fuse rating must match the load to be protected. Hence loads of different ratings, specified by one of the ways as current, require fuses of appropriate rating \u2014 called as co-ordination. Your fuses being rated as 10A or 5 A signify -power consumption or rating of your load. Further as an example 5A fuse is suitable for 230V\u00d75 =1150 VA or 1150W for unity power factor . Say even up to 1250 VA/W. Caution: Fuses are intended to protect under short circuit ie :sudden high rise of current such as earth fault due to main insulation failure. Protecting against continuos overload is not assured and need other means. ",

            "answer_text": "Fuse, basically is a electrical protection for the protection of device or circuit or system from over current which could cause short circuit ur burn the device or system due to excessive heat. Every electrical system has this protection. Coming to your question 5A(Current carrying capacity) fuse means if there is flow of more than 5Ampere current through the fuse it will blow off saving the system from over current. Same is the case with 10A fuse. Basically main difference is the current carrying capacity.10A fuse can carry more current through it as compared to 5A but not more than 10A which is it's capacity. I hope your doubt is cleared. ",

            "answer_text": "As you are asking questions about rating of fuse wire, I hope you have a fair idea of what is a fuse and what is its function. Now coming to your question,the main difference between 10 A and 5 A fuse wire is the capacity it has to allow the flow of current before breaking down the circuit. A 5A fuse wire can withstand current upto 5A to be flown through it, once the current increases then this fuse wire will burntdown and it will disconnect the source from the power supply. So the similar case with 10A fuse i.e it can withstand current upto 10A to be flown through it, a slighlty increase in the current will break the fuse by disconnecting source from the supply. ",
