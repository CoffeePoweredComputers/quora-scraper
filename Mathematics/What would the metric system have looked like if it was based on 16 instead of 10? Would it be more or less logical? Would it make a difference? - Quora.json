            "answer_text": "It would depend on whether you chose to do that while using base 16 arithmetic. The reason metric is based on 10 is because the number system we use is also based on 10, so conversions between different sized units are very simple\u2013just shift a decimal. If we used base 16 for our regular arithmetic, a base 16 metric would be equally easy to use, but if we used base 16 metric in base 10 arithmetic (or vice versa) it would be a bit tricky. ",

It\u2019s also a lot harder to count in. ",
