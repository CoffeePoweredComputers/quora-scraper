            "answer_text": "Permutation means arrangement and combination means selection. So far I have been able to use these two concepts (at least to some extent) in following scenarios. You and your friends go for a movie. You can think of arranging your group into 5 seats such that you are always with one specific friend (or not besides one specific friend). Try permutations.You go in a marriage and there are numerous tasty delicious dishes. However, your plate can accommodate only 3 varieties at a time. Select any three of all. Try selections.You and your friends want to commute from your residential area to some other place. There is a group of 6 but the auto rickshaw can carry only 5. Select any 5 and also arrange them according to their preferences. Go for combinations and then permutation.You want to call your friend but you forgot the last two digits. All you remember was that both the digits were even. Hit and trial. You have 500 bucks to buy a gift for your girlfriend. You are in a shop and you have various options available. But there is a constraint that you need to buy at least two gifts and also have some money (say 20 bucks) in your pocket to get yourself back to your home. Try combinations.Once you buy those gifts, let's say you got three, you want to decide which one should you give first and which one should you gift last (the last one should be the best after all). Try permutations.:p  You can use those concepts in marketing skills (like which client to select or how many clients to select or in what way the clients should be distributed work etc), business administration, money management and so on.  However, so far I have only used them in my current real life situations.  :) ",

            "answer_text": "see most of us get confuse about when to use permutation and when to use combination.  use permutation when you are asked to do arrangement. use combination when you are asked to do selection. in permutation order matters in combination order does not matter let some website   ask  to set password consisting of four distinct alphabets, where each letter is used only once?  In this case, the letters in 4 different positions should be unique. That means \u2018AAAA\u2019, \u2018AABC\u2019, \u2018ABAC\u2019\u2026 wouldn\u2019t be the correct password. First position : You have 26 possibilities in first position. Second position : If you use letter \u201cA\u201d in first position, so you have 25 letters remain. 25 possibilities. Third position: 24 possibilities Fourth position: 23 possibilities Total possibilities = 26 * 25 * 24 * 23 or, The number of permutations of 4 letters chosen from 26 is 26P4 = 26 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23 = 358,800. suppose you want to go on a date and you have two different colored pants and three shirts you can use combination to use one pant and one shirt. suppose you want to choose a cricket team ...you have 5 bowlers 10 batsman and 12 allrounders. you want 4 bowlers , 5 batsman and 2 allrounders in your team  so you can use combination here other examples are permutation : dialing a phone number, number plate of a car, lock combination combination: teacher taking attendance ,Selecting courses (doesn\u2019t matter if I take MDM class first period or third), voting, card games like poker etc. ",
