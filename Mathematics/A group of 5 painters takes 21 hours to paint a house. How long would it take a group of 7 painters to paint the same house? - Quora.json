            "answer_text": "The elementary school answer is that the painting job takes 105 painter-hours, so a group of 7 painters would take 15 hours. The reality is that actual work doesn\u2019t scale this way. Jobs like writing a poem don\u2019t scale at all \u2014 1 is the only realistic number of authors. Some work can\u2019t be done by one person and needs a team, like construction where multiple people need to lift structural members. For house painting, only a painter would know how the job scales, and would know the optimum crew size for a given job and set of constraints. ",

            "answer_text": "A group of 5 painters take 21 hours to paint a house. It is equivalent to saying that each of the 5 painters worked for 21 hours each to complete the job. So the complete job is a 5 x 21 hours = 105 hour job. Now if the same job is to be comoleted by 7 painters we can just divide 105 hours by 7 which gives us 15 hours. So 7 painters will take 15 hours to paint the same house. However if this is a trick question, the group of 7 painters will need 0 hours to paint the same house as it has already been painted earlier by those 5 painters.\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a ",
