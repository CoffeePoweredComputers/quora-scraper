            "answer_text": "Yes, but with a little trick. It isn\u2019t possible in euclidian space, or, in other words, on a flat plane. But there are other types of space, for example, hyperbolic space.  It looks like the surface of this shape. And this is possible to build a pentagon with 4 and even 5 right angles on this surface, because it can be other sum of angles in shapes in non-euclidean spaces. For example, look at this triangle:  The sum of its angles is less than 180 degrees, but it is still a triangle. The same can be done with a pentagon:  It is not obvious, but its angles are actually 90 degrees each one. You can say that a pentagon and a triangle must be formed with straight lines and these lines on a hyperbolic surface are not straight, but the point is in the definition of a line. A line is the shortest route between 2 points and if we can use only such type of a surface, then the shortest routes, connecting points will look like these. The same thing happens with spheres. We could say that someone drove a car through a 100 km straight road, but in fact, as Earth is a sphere(approximately) and has a diameter of 40 000 km(also approximately), a 100 km road will make a 360*100/40000=0.9 degree turn around Earth. But it will still be a straight line on a globe, as it is the shortest route between 2 points(if we consider that we can\u2019t travel through the ground).  Here you can see a triangle on a globe with each angle of 90 degrees. Here each side of it turns 90 degrees in 3d space, in which the sphere is located, but are still straight on the sphere as a surface. And a pentagon on a sphere:  On a spherical surface the shapes have bigger sum of angles, than on a flat plane, but on a hyperbolic one - smaller sum. ",

            "answer_text": "Not on a flat surface, no! In Euclidean geometry, a Pentagon by definition is a polygon which must have 5 sides and 5 internal angles and 5 external angles. The internal angles must add up to 540 degrees. A polygon is a closed shape with at least 3 sides and must be made up of only straight lines. If it had 4 right angles that would sum to 360 degrees. 540\u2013360 = 180 meaning the last angle must be 180 degrees meaning the shape would not be closed. Update: Thank you Anton Rzhevskyi for your excellent answer. You are right Euclidean geometry only applies to shapes on a 2 dimensional flat surface. I have updated my answer accordingly. ",
