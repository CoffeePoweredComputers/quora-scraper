            "answer_text": "What's the relationship between KV and KW? What you are really asking is what is the relationship between V and W. The K\u2019s simply mean there are 1000 of them. So V is for volts and it is the pressure in an electrical circuit, just like psi might be the pressure in a hydraulic circuit. It is what makes the electricity flow in the circuit when a circuit is created. A single volt is very small and there are 1.5 volts in every A,C, or D cell battery. W is for watts. It is a unit of power; one of them is very small: 1/746 hp. So as you can see, both of these concepts are very small. The way to make them more useful is to multiply each by 1000, making them KV and KW. KV is the pressure in the electrical wire and one of them is pretty high. The pressure in a standard American receptacle is 120V. If you have ever felt 120V you know it can tingle you pretty good. So a KV is 8.3 times that, and it can jump off the wire to get you. So be careful around anything in the KV range. KW, like KV above, is 1000 Watts. Called a killowatt, it is 1000/746 Hp, or about 1.34HP. So, bottom line, its an apples and oranges relationship. You might talk about watts and volts in the home, whereas you would talk about KW and KV in a factory setting. ",

            "answer_text": "Remove the K part first, it just stands for Kilo or 1000. Now question becomes relation between V(voltage) and W(Watt). Voltage is the unit of difference in electrical potential between two points or the electromotive force. Watts is the unit of power and generally used when talking about electrical power. It can also be interpreted as rate of energy transfer. The one thing missing is the unit called Ampere which is a measure of the current.So the relation between the two for an electrical circuit is Power = Voltage * CurrentIn terms of units, it becomeswatt= voltage* ampererefer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power ",
