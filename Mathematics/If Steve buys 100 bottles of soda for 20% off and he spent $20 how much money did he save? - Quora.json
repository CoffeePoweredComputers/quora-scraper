            "answer_text": "He saved $5 The way I like to approach it is this: He bought something at 20% off, in other words he paid for it at 80% of the original price (100%-20%=80%). So I know right now that 80% of the original price of the sodas is $20. The only number I don\u2019t know here is the original price of them (x). So I just need to solve it from what I do know Aka: x * 80% = 20 It\u2019s as easy as dividing 20 by .8 With this I find that x = 25. That\u2019s my original price. The difference between 25 and 20 is 5. And there is my solution Another way to solve this is to use the quantity of the sodas: He bought 100 sodas for the price of 80. If 80 sodas costs $20, that means each soda is 25\u00a2 (20 \u00f7 80 = .25). The 20 sodas worth of savings is $5 (20 * .25 = 5) I don\u2019t like this method as much though for two reasons It\u2019s not as intuitive for meYou can\u2019t solve this way unless you know the quantity. The first method of solving it works no matter what the quantity is.Who Cares? It\u2019s all pretty straightforward with basic algebra and probably seems kinda boring, but I couldn't tell you how many times I use this kind of math when shopping or making basic business decisions. If you can get to where you\u2019re thinking in these terms when you\u2019re out doing errands or shopping online you\u2019ll avoid a lot of bad deals that companies want you to fall for! ",

            "answer_text": "Supppose x was the actual price for 100 bottles. So he bought 100 bottles for, (80x)/100 as there was 20% off. Now he spent $20 So, 80x/100 = 20 Or, 80x=20*100 Or, 80x=2000 Or, x=2000/80 Or, x=25 So the original cost for 100 bottles was $25 He bought it for $20 So he saved (25\u201320)=5 dollars So the answer is $5 ",
