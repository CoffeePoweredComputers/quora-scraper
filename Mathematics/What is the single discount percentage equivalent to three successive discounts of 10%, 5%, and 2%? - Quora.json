            "answer_text": "0.9 x 0.95 x 0.98 = 0.8379. ==> discount is (approx) 16% With a 10% discount, you are left with 0.9 of the regular price. Giving a discount of 5% on that, means multiplying by (100\u20135)/100, which is 0.95. so after the first and second discount, the price is 0.90 x 0.95 of the regular price. A 2% discount on that means multiplying by (100-2)/100, which makes the end result 0.9 x 0.95 x 0.98, which equals 0.8379. So the discounted price is 0.84, or 84%, of the regular price. This means that a total discount of 16% was given. Note that it doesn't matter in which order the discount are given. The end result is always 16% off! ",
