Each split represents a choice, and each line represents a possible outcome. Choice #1 at the top of the tree has 2 possible outcomes. The second level repeats that process with 2 possible choices and 4 possible outcomes, this repeats for all 5 levels giving us 32 possible outcomes at the bottom.  ",

This ignores the fact that the student could choose not to answer some or all of the question so there are actually 3 choices T,F or No answer if this is the case there are 3^5 = 243 possible ways to answer. If the test taker can physically write an answer instead of just checking a T or F or doing nothing there are even more ways to answer the test. ",
