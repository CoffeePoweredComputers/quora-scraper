            "answer_text": "In order for it to be one of those answers, you have to make a major assumption that is not explicitly stated in the question: that the cats can continue to catch 7 rats every 7 minutes at the same rate they did from the start. The question states one instance of them catching rats. It\u2019s not known what happens after that. There is too little to establish a pattern. Consider the case of diminishment. \u201cIf 7 cheetahs can run 7 miles in 7 minutes, how many cheetahs does it take to run 140 miles in 140 minutes?\u201d Can cheetahs continue to run at the pace they have in the beginning? Or will the rate slow over time? Consider the case of delay between cycles. What if after the cat catches a rat, it will lie down and eat it and then not feel like catching another rat for a while? Finally consider single use: \u201cIf 7 bombs can destroy 7 buildings in 7 minutes, how many bombs does it take to destroy 140 buildings in 140 minutes?\u201d Certainly not 7. Because once you use a bomb you can\u2019t use it again. I certainly hope these aren\u2019t real mathematics questions. ",

            "answer_text": "It's multiple choice. So you would choose the best answer, given just the choices and parameters of the question. The question may be mathematical and/or unrealistic, but if going for a graded test, or even to answer as a riddle (which requires lateral thinking), your least worse answer is \u201c7\u201d. If this was a hypothesis though, then you could say there is not enough information to reach a solid conclusion. Proper testing and a controlled environments would be needed to establish a base margin that a certain number of cats, on average, could kill a certain amount of rats within a certain period of time. Then postulate your opinion to\u2026\u2026 well\u2026\u2026 still choose the least worse answer because this is MULTIPLE CHOICE! ",
