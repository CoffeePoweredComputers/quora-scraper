            "answer_text": "Nowadays, jobs are hard to come by. To make things worse, there are much competition out there, and many people are \u2018hungry\u2019 for jobs. Many are willing to get hired at lower pay, a pay level that is under their market peers. To be noticed and get hired, you must stand out from the crowd. Nowadays, even a degree holder find it hard to get a job. You need specialization and outstanding skillsets to get noticed by employers. In some jobs, you need to be young and agile. Since there are thousands of jobless and unemployed graduates in many countries, you need to get degrees that are specialized and relevant to the market place. General degrees like Business, Finance, Arts will compete with other graduates that have specialized degrees such as ACCA, CIMA, Bachelor of accounting, Law, engineering, architecture, Medicine, Pharmacy and the likes. In specific industries like the legal practice, graduates with law degrees will stand out. For finance industries, people with professional certification such as CA, ACCA, CIMA, Bachelor of Accounting will stand out. In other industries like electronic manufacturing, electrical and electronic engineers will stand out. Unfortunately, general degrees like Business, Finance, Arts and the likes have to compete with the above mentioned specialized graduates for those industries mentioned earlier. Many of these graduates will then go for other general job types such as administration, marketing, sales, financial advisors, HR, reporters, interviewers, etc\u2026.which themselves becomes competitive when these specialized graduates, who did not get any jobs in their industries, overflows into these market place. Usually, employers can afford to be choosy now and will hire degree holders that were once expensive (especially those with specialized degrees) rather then general degree holders. In conclusion, if you are thinking of taking finance as your degree, I would rather you reconsider specialization (provided you are interested and have the appetite and aptitude for it) degree such as ACCA, CIMA, CFA , Bachelor of Accounting or Commerce or even Bachelor of Economics. You stand a better chance to be hired relatively in the long term. Good luck and I do hope I did not give you the wrong advice or picture. Do forgive me if I have inadvertently angered general degree holders in this discussion one way or another. I seek your kind understanding and do accept my apologies. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on what you think you want to do. I am a adjunct professor at a small community college in my spare time. I teach economics and occasionally a statistics class. Five years ago everything was called, \u201cbusiness\u201d. Today, they are either business, economics, accounting, or finance. I also run my own financial services firm. My answer is, \u201cit depends\u201d. Finance is a great degree for young people looking to work as a Financial Advisor. It gives you instant credibility, and a real background to effectively do the job of helping families and individuals save for retirement, plan for college, and invest assets. If you want to work at a bank, this is the major for you. Unfortunately, it is also one of the easiest degrees to get since the bar of entry into the field is relatively low. You could accomplish the same goals as stated above with an accounting degree, and have a greater amount of marketability for yourself. Becoming an Enrolled Agent, or a CPA will give you even greater opportunities to earn a living and more credibility in your client\u2019s eyes. If you want to work on Wall Street, you will be better served with a degree in Mathematics or Computer Engineering. The big firms aren\u2019t looking for more salespeople, (just kidding, they are ALWAYS looking for more salespeople) but they only eat what they kill. The best paying jobs are going to the technology guys who can make their machines faster or give them an edge with a new algorithm. The world of Finance is changing, and finally the colleges are catching up. A degree in Finance will give you an advantage for moving up at a financial firm. The best degree is the one you will use.
