            "answer_text": "The answer is hidden in the terms itself. Ordinary differential equations deal with the relation between derivatives of a function of a single scalar variable. For instance, [math] \\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2} + \\frac{dy}{dx} + y = \\exp(x).[/math] Here y is a function of x only. On the other hand, partial differential equations deal with the variation of a function of many variables, like a function u of two variables x and y. The following is an example of a partial differential equation. [math]\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0[/math] Here [math]\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}[/math] is the rate of change of u with respect to x only (similarly for y).
