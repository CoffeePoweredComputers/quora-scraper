            "answer_text": "As far as I know, there is no such formula. Math does not consist of only formulae. at times it can be as descriptive as biology or chemistry or more. There are of course exceptions as you grow in your mathematical knowledge. The basic definition of a rectangle as I am sure you know involves parallelism of opposite pairs of sides, and right angles between all adjacent sides. You may, however, find that there is a special relationship between vectors defining the points of a rectangle in a standard position (intersection of the diagonals at the origin)\u2026. Can you think of one offhand? (I can!). That\u2019s pretty simple and is not restricted to rectangles (what non-rectangular shape can you think of that must have that property?) Or you may find other special relationships between these vectors, but they must, of course, all \u00ab point \u00bb (pun!) back to th\u00e9 original definition and fundamental concepts. let me know if you find an other special relationship for vector defining a rectangle\u2026 I suspect they exist. Alternatively, the equations defining the lines may also yield some special characteristics. In fact, the vectors along or defining those lines must have special properties. Can you think of at least two? ",
