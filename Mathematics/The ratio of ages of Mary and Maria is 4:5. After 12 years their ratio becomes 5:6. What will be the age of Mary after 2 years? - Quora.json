            "answer_text": "Fine example of the Determinent Influence to Ratio. Explanation Had the Determinant changed that Basemost 0:1 Ratio that is Common to both as the age of Maria at Birth of Mary, in a Decreased Span of Say 5 Years and 12 Minutes the Ages of the Two Differ by? 5 years and 12 minutes. Same Applies to: The Ratio Of Coffees Drank per Urination of Mary and Maria is presently 4:5. In 12 Coffees the Ratio of Coffees Drank per Urination will rise to 5:6, If both drink 2 more coffees, how many Coffees will Mary have drank? The Answer\u2026 Mary is 48 Maria is 60 In 12 years Mary will age to 60, Maria ages to 72 In Two years Mary will progress to Age 50 while Maria Progresses to Age 62. The Formula? The formula? Few use it but it Involves: [math]^{\\frac {Combined Ratios}{Latter}+Proficient=\\frac {Combined Ratio_2}{Latter}}[/math] And in this example transforms to [math](9M\u00f75)+12=11M\u00f76[/math] Or [math]\\frac {9M}{5}+12=\\frac {11M}{6}[/math] And is a little bit like Converting C\u00b0 to F- on a Report Card. Which few ever use or do that nonsense but instead resolve by the easy way which uses Ratio Indexing as alike Cross Multiply: [math]  P=Proficient[/math] [math]  (R_1.a)(P)=Determinent_1.a[/math] [math]  (R_1.b)(P)=Determinent_1.b[/math] [math]  (R_2.a)(P)=Determinent_2.a[/math] [math]  (R_2.b)(P)=Determinent_2.b[/math] And Check: If [math]D_1.b+P=D_2.b[/math] AND [math]D_1.a+P=D_2.a[/math] Then: It Checks Again it need not formulate in Years it can formulate Coffees Drank, Urinations per Day, Cars Crashed after Purchase, Broken Engagements, Bad Attempts at Hair Dye, Bad Hair Days, Teeth Fallen Out or Teeth on their Partial Dentures.

            "answer_text": "Let the rational between present ages of Mary and Maria be x The ratio of ages of Mary and Maria is 4 : 5. Hence the respective ages of Mary and Maria are 4x and 5x After 12 years their ratio becomes 5 : 6. After we years the ages of Mary (4x + 12) and Maria (5x + 12) and their ratio becomes 5 : 6 (4x + 12) / (5x + 12) = 5 / 6 Cross multiplication 5 (5x + 12) = 6 (4x + 12) 25x + 60 = 24x + 72 25x - 24x = 72 - 60 x = 12 The rational is 12, therefore their ages are Mary's present age 4x= 4 \u00d7 12 = 48 years Maria's present age 5x= 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 years After 2 years their ages will be Mary's age = 48 + 2 = 50 years Maria's age = 60 + 2 = 62 years Answer Mary's age after 2 years is 50 years.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say M is Mary\u2019s age and m Maria\u2019s age. If we find their age today we can add 2 and find their age in 2 years We have: M/m = 4/5 which means that 5M = 4m or m = 1,25M Now by the second detail of the problem we have that the ratio becomes 5/6 after 12 years, but those 12 years count for both so: (M+12)/(m+12)=5/6 which means 5*(m+12) = 6(M+12) which leads to 5m = 6M + 12. Using the first equation we get that 5*1,25*M = 6M + 12 or 6,25M = 6M + 12.Subtracting 6M from both sides we get 0,25M = 12 and multiplying by 4 we get M = 48 and thus using the first equation again we get m = 1,25*48 = 60. These are their ages today. To find their ages in 2 years just add 2 to each of them. M in 2 years = 50m in 2 years = 62 ",

            "answer_text": "Since the ages of Mary and Maria are in the ratio 4:5, the actual ages can be taken as 4x years and 5x years respectively. After 12 years, their ages will be 4x+12 years and 5x+12 years. Therefore, as per the problem (4x+12)/(5x+12) = 5/6 => x = 12 Mary's age now is 4x years = 48 years. So after 2 years Mary will be 50 years. ",
