            "answer_text": " Here\u2019s how you solve it. calculate the equivalent resistance of the two parallel pairs. That leaves you with:three resistances in series. Calculate the sum of those three.you now have one single equivalent resistance. Apply Ohm\u2019s Law to calculate the current.It\u2019s really pretty easy. If you work out your answer and put it in the comments, I\u2019ll let you know if you\u2019re right or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Notice that R1 and R2 are in parallel. Also, notice that R4 and R5 are in parallel. Using the parallel formulas that are available to you, solve for the total resistance of those two parts of the circuit. What you will have left is three series resistors. Add those together to arrive at the total resistance of the circuit. Finally, using Ohm\u2019s Law, solve for the total current in the circuit. ",
