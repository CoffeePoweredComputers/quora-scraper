            "answer_text": "Should be 89. 9 times 23 = 207. That's the first multiple of 9 that breaks 200. The last multiple of 9 before breaking 1,000 is 9 times 111, which equals 999. So, 111 minus 23 = 88, however we need to add one to make sure we include the last one. This brings us to 89 multiples in that set. (If that last part doesn't make sense, think of a smaller set like multiples of 9 greater than 10 but less than 50). ",
