            "answer_text": "The angle of repose refers to the maximum inclination angle for a pile of granular bulk material before the material fails under its own weight. The material fails internally in shear and avalanches. The failure occurs essentially when the internal friction between material and material is overcome. So the \u201cangle of repose\u201d is sometimes referred to as the \u201cinternal angle of friction\u201d. Another mode of failure is when a sample of material slides over the wall material. For example, material in a bulk materials storage hopper might fail in shear along the sloped wall first before failing within the material. The maximum inclination angle before slipping at the wall is referred to as the angle of wall friction. ",
