            "answer_text": "To start off, it is important to note that all questions in the Math section carry the same marks. As a result, doing a harder question will not earn more marks than doing an easy one. The questions get harder as you progress through each section. There's a 25-minute non-calculator section, and a 55-minute calculator section following this. Both sections have questions where there are no multiple choice answers; you must fill out the answers yourself. When practicing SAT Maths, it's important to time yourself. This will improve your stamina for the real exam. Try to do a practice paper every month - you're bound to see improved results and accustom yourself to the format of the exam. Never jump through your wrong answers; always inspect your working and understand where you went wrong in every wrong answer. If you still don't understand a question, ask your Mathematics teacher to help you out. If you have the privilege, I suggest you purchase an SAT Math Practice Guide with sample answers. I recommend you'd buy a specialised one only for SAT Math. ",
