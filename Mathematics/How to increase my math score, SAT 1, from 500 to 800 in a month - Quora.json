            "answer_text": "I love questions like these and seem to be answering quite a few of them lately. Let me give you an even more definitive answer. You can\u2019t. That assessment may sound harsh, but consider the facts. According to College Board 2017 statistics, an SAT math score of 500 is in the 40th percentile of students who take the test. An SAT math score of 800 represents a percentile of 99+, really as close to that impossible 100th percentile as you can get. That\u2019s a 60 point percentile jump. Considering that roughly two million graduating college bound seniors take the SAT every year, you\u2019d like to outscore approximately 1,200,000 of your peers who are currently scoring higher than you, including all the of the other potential perfect math scorers. In a month. Self-confidence can take you very far in life, but sometimes a reality check helps us move from fantasy to reality. Some changes are too profound to enact in just one month. Imagine you started a month with no background in weight training. According to LiveStrong, the average bench press for an untrained woman who weighs 165 pounds is 80 pounds. A novice of average weigh can press 95 pounds, an intermediately experienced woman 115 pounds, and an advanced lifter 145 pounds or more. If you were that inexperienced lifter who actually started below average, could you see your bench press tripling from perhaps 55 pounds to 155 pounds in just a month? Without a coach? Now consider perfect scores. The world record for women\u2019s bench press is Becca Swanson, who benched an unimaginable 480 lbs. Imagine wanting to increase your bench press by a factor of nearly 10 from 55 pounds to 480 pounds in just a month? Without a coach?!? The truth is that dramatic improvement takes more than just desire and effort. True transformation takes time. Just doing your best is often not enough. Recruit the best prep coach you can, work relentlessly according to a proven plan, and optimize every academic and technical component of test day performance. That might not be enough to reach your most ambitious goals, but this effort will take you to your very best performance. Even better, follow the same steps but try to find another 2\u20133 months to prep! For the College Board percentile tables, see SAT Understanding Scores 2017: https://collegereadiness.college.... ",
