            "answer_text": "Welcome to the amazing world of electronics. I believe from the way you have written your question like other answers here you need to study the original question again or ask for some clarification. It is always good to have what is called in electronics a \u2018circuit diagram\u2019 showing the way electronic components are designed to work together to achieve a particular function. When learning about resistors the diagram will most likely show them wired as combinations of \u2018Parallel\u2019 and \u2018Series\u2019 wiring.  When Resistors are wired in series the two resistors values add up using the simple Rt = R1 + R2 formula. In this form they decrease (limit) what is called the \u2018current\u2019 (flow of electrons) in the circuit. Current(I) is measured in \u2018amperes\u2019 or \u2018amps\u2019 for short.  When Resistors are wired in Parallel they follow the following formula: 1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 With resistors wired in Parallel the current (I) in the circuit will increase. Any combination of Parallel and Series circuits connected together can be systematically worked through using the two formula above to find the equivalent resistance. To answer your question you need to find out how exactly all the 4 ten ohm resistors and the 20 ohm resistor are wired together, preferably with a circuit diagram. Main point is enjoy learning about electronics you may become very fascinated and find it stimulating. Most importantly it will help give you some insights of how the modern world actually works, which unfortunately is becoming a mysterious black art to many particularly if you ask them how their phone or computer or even a electric light actually works.
