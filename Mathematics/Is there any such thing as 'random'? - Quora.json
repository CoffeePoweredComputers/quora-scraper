            "answer_text": "An experiment is said to be random if its outcome cannot be predicted with certainty before the experiment takes place.  Coin flipping is the canonical example: you always get either H or T as a result, and it's nearly impossible to know which beforehand. Is coin flipping truly random?  Perhaps not. If you designed an extremely precise coin flipping machine, and you were able to very tightly control every variable in the experiment, then it ought to be possible in principle to predict whether the coin will come up H or T. The reason it ought to be possible is that the physics of coin flipping is classical mechanics, and classical mechanics is deterministic: if you know all of the input parameters to infinite precision, then the theory will predict the outcome with certainty. Don't get discouraged, though. Despite what can be done in principle, in practice, no one has built such a machine. And even if someone does manage it, that still doesn't mean that classical mechanics can't give us random experiments. There are many classical systems that exhibit chaos, which is the property that the slightest error in initial measurement can dramatically change the predicted outcome. That still might not satisfy you, though. The impossibility of making the prediction isn't because of some fundamental randomness; rather, it's merely due to the unknowability of the initial conditions. Suppose we could know the initial conditions. Would there then be any truly random experiments? The consensus nowadays is yes. No classical systems are fundamentally random, but many quantum mechanical systems appear to be. Quantum mechanics makes statistical predictions, and there are good reasons to think that we'll never be able to do better than that (see Bell's theorem). Quantum mechanics is nondeterministic, and many quantum experiments are, as far as we know, fundamentally random. At the end of the day, the question is mostly philosophical wankery. An experiment can be random even if its outcome is determined, so long as the observer doesn't have enough information to predict the result. Probability is useful whenever you have to reason on incomplete information, not just when you're facing things that are fundamentally unknowable. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition , randomness is picking a number that is uniformly distributed.  But when you are considering finite set of elements in natural world it is highly unlikely yo achieve uniform distribution , This probability of choosing an element in real world can not be exactly same as probability of choosing another element.  And also two successive random numbers required to be independent and there should not be any correlation between these two. Any correlation between two random number make it predictable and guess worthy, and they does not remain random any more (Random Number -- from Wolfram MathWorld ). So in real all the random number  used are psuedo-random numbers .  It is impossible to produce an arbitrarily long string of random digits and prove it is random. Strangely, it is also very difficult for humans to produce a string of random digits, and computer programs can be written which, on average, actually predict some of the digits humans will write down based on previous ones. There are a number of common methods used for generating pseudorandom numbers, the simplest of which is the linear congruence method. Another simple and elegant method is elementary cellular automaton rule 30, whose central column is given by 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ... (OEISA051023), and which provides the random number generator used for large integers in the Wolfram Language. Most random number generators require specification of an initial number used as the starting point, which is known as a \"seed.\" The goodness of random numbers generated by a givenalgorithm can be analyzed by examining its noise sphere. True Random Number Service offers  true random numbers to anyone on the Internet. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a real version of this question that has nothing to do with philosophy. Randomness is a description of predictability from the point of view of specific observers.  For example, if my friends throw me a surprise party on a specific date, and I don't know about it, then that event is basically random to me.  Obviously it is not random to the people planning the party.  Similarly if I wanted a sequence of random digits, I might start with the digits of PI beyond the first 20 or so that I happen to have memorized. A very common misconception, for example, is that randomness is in some dichotomy with a kind of universal determinism.  This is nonsense, of course.  Practical randomness has to do with the capabilities of the observer relative to a phenomenon generator.  Attempts at making something \"truly\" random, have to do with masking the mechanism that generates the random events.  For example the outcome of a coin flip (before it is flipped), for all intents and purposes is \"truly\" random (well, there's more to it than that).  This is because the flipper is unlikely to have sufficient control to intentionally influence the physics of the coin to change its outcome.  Some people like to sample \"the cosmic microwave background radiation\" in an attempt to shield the event generator from any predictability by any observer.  But this is usually overkill.  Simple cryptographically computer based secure random number generators, such as \"Fortuna\" are essentially \"perfectly random\" in the sense that nobody can practically predict its output. The universe having laws of physics or whatever, has nothing to do with randomness.  Randomness takes place in the mind of the observer, not in physical phenomenon.  The current angles in the triangle described by the centers of earth, moon and mars are, to me, purely random values.  Even though they are very deterministic, they are not deterministic by any current context in my head. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been asked to answer, so I'm going to take a stab at it, but I'm leery, so I apologize to all readers in advance. And I really don't know if I can do it in a \"playful\" fashion, since the playful fashion in which the question details are stated has led to a conception of quantum physics so completely wrong that I might be better off doing the finale speech from As You Like It and make more progress. Step 2 in grasping quantum physics is giving up everything you think you know about classical physics*. Things like \"the coordinates in which an electron exists\" don't actually have a meaning in quantum physics. They're a classical idea of of spatial location, and they don't exist in quantum physics. I know that you're really, really attached to it, because that's the way you've always seen the world to work, but from a quantum physics standpoint it's just plain wrong. In a moderately advanced QM course we can explain WHY you think that objects in the world have classical coordinates, but that's an advanced lesson, not an introductory lesson. What electrons do have is a wave function. In fact, EVERYTHING has a wave function. Everything IS a wave function. So what the hell is a wave function? A wave function is a description of some quantum property of an object. It takes as arguments some kind of abstract space (i.e. some property that we'll get to later) and returns as a value a complex number. That is, it assigns a complex number to every point in that abstract space. And the function is defined so that the sum of the squares at every single point is exactly 1. (I told you this wasn't going to be fun. It gets even less fun from here, so I strongly advise you stop reading. You won't have learned anything, but nobody promised you that learning was going to be fun. Quantum mechanics is a lot more fun when you're playing spooky \"what does it mean?\" games, which are a lot easier to play when you don't have any idea what you're talking about. Quit now and you have some chance of it remaining fun.) So what the hell is an abstract space? Well, it could be \"spacetime\", the ordinary coordinates you're used to thinking about. But we haven't gone back to plain old physics yet, far from it, because we're going to show that you don't get to use it the way you used plain space and time. The abstract space could also be momentum: the full set of speeds that a particle could be moving.  Depending on the quantum object, it could still be other things. For the moment, you think of it as just some arbitrary set of coordinates. It's just a set of meaningless numbers. Now, you can take those meaningless numbers and run them through your wave function. We said that if you sum the squares of the value of the wave function, you get 1. Wonderful. What's that mean? Well, here's one way to look at it. Ya know what else sums up to 1? Probabilities. So, let's pretend that the square of the wave function is a probability. In particular, let's say that it's the probability of being at that particular point in space-time. And when we sum all of it up we get... 1. What does that mean? It means that \"yes, with 100% certainty, we can say that the particle exists at some point in space and time.\" Wonderful. Wait, we also said that the wave function could represent momentum, how fast the particle is going. We sum it up, and we get out: \"Yes, with 100% certainty we can say that the particle has some speed between zero and infinity**\". Fantastic. Now it gets interesting, for sufficiently boring values of \"interesting\". So, where is the damn particle? Well... what's the probability of your age being precisely 35.0034029358243582835823482384821283234 years? Zero. Or at least, damn close to zero, and only because I got tired of typing random numbers. The more precise you try to be, the closer the probability gets to zero. So where is the particle? The probability of it being in any particular place is exactly zero. But we've got a saving grace here. We can at least give a range. The probability of your age being between 35 and 37 is some finite number. The probability of it being between 30 and 40 is larger. The probability of it being between 0 and 10,000 is exactly 1.  Given just an electron, all by itself in the universe, we can't actually say anything about it. But if we have, say a proton in the universe, then the electron will be attracted to it, and will be more likely to be near the proton than elsewhere. And we can say, \"The probability of it being between, say, 10^-12 meters of that proton is... well, some number. Not zero. And that's 100% of what we can say about the electron: with some probability, it's in that space. It's definitely, guaranteed NOT to be at any particular point.  Now... here's the thing. I think that all this discussion of probability here is rotting your brain. It works in simplified cases like this, but the more complicated the cases get, the harder it is to make the probability interpretation work. I say, screw the probability interpretation. What's the wave function? I don't know, and I don't care. I just know that when I apply it and do the rest of the math, what I observe is the answer that the number predicts. That number looks inherently \"random\" to me, because I'm stupid and I don't know everything. \"Random\" is a way of measuring what you don't know. Is it going to rain tomorrow? I don't know. Given the exact situation as I've seen it in the past, 30% of the time it has rained, 70% not. That's everything I can say about it. But \"the exact situation\" is really just a measurement of my inability to say precisely what today is like: where each air molecule is, how much momentum the car has on the street, etc etc etc.  The particle's movement isn't \"random\" except in that macro-scale sense of ignorance. Given the precise wave function of the entire universe, it proceeds exactly deterministically. There's no random number function in there. The wave function isn't random, because like I said, the particle isn't in some place, not any place. It just looks that way when I try to interact it with the rest of the universe, which tells you only about how much it is we don't know. And can't know, because the kinds of things that we think we can know about (like \"place\" and \"speed\") turn out not to be really there at all except as crude approximations to reality. A reality we can't measure directly because that's exactly what \"measurement\" isn't. Unfortunately, I haven't really told you a damn thing here. It looks random to you, and if you want to say it's random, not even duct tape is going to make you stop saying it. But that's so much less interesting than what's actually going on (and I've given you only a very crude, and frequently wrong, description of that) that all I can is sigh and wish more people would have a look at what's really going on rather than saying things even wronger than what I've said here. -----------------------------* Step 1 is letting go of everything you think you know about quantum physics.  ** This doesn't take relativity into account. You're already bored and lost. Don't make it harder by introducing relativity. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but it's a bit subtle.  You need a bit of computational complexity theory to really understand what's going on, but the basics are reasonably accessible.  From A brief overview of Complexity Theory: The concept of randomness has puzzled thinkers for ages. Their perspective can be described as ontological: they asked ``what is randomness'' and wondered whether it exist at all (or is the world deterministic). The perspective of complexity theory is behavioristic: it is based on defining objects as equivalent if they cannot be told apart by any efficient procedure. That is, a coin toss is (defined to be) ``random'' (even if one believes that the universe is deterministic) if it is infeasible to predict the coin's outcome. Likewise, a string (or a distribution of strings) is ``random'' if it is infeasible to distinguish it from the uniform distribution (regardless of whether or not one can generate the latter). Interestingly, randomness (or rather pseudorandomness) defined this way is efficiently expandable; that is, under a reasonable complexity assumption (to be discussed next), short pseudorandom strings can be deterministically expanded into long pseudorandom strings. Indeed, it turns out that randomness is intimately related to intractability. Firstly, note that the very definition of pseudorandomness refers to intractability (i.e., the infeasibility of distinguishing a pseudorandomness object from a uniformly distributed object). Secondly, as hinted above, a complexity assumption that refers to the existence of functions that are easy to evaluate but hard to invert (called one-way functions) imply the existence of deterministic programs (called pseudorandom generators) that stretch short random seeds into long pseudorandom sequences. In fact, it turns out that the existence of pseudorandom generators is equivalent to the existence of one-way functions. ",

As you say:  \"People  say the coordinates in which an electron exists is random, but there is  still a realm of probability that area is confined to. Therefore, it is  not random.\" It is unclear to me why you don't consider this random. Consider the case of radioactive half-lives. If we look at a single particle, we know there is a 50/50 chance that over the course of that period, the particle will decay. However, there is nothing that will cause a particular particle to go one way or the other. While it is confined to a set of possibilities, what actually happens is not determined by anything but mere chance.   Here randomness does not destroy the laws of nature because of the law of large numbers. While we don't know which particles will decay over a  half-life, we do not that 50% of them will. ",

            "answer_text": "You are confused. \"Random\" does not mean \"evenly distributed\", it means \"unpredictable\". No matter how non-linear or constrained a probability distribution is, if a variable on that domain is totally unpredictable within that distribution, then it is random. The sum of two dice, for example, form a curve, not a flat line. But if you offered to pay 5:1 on a roll of 7, 31:5 for a 6 or 8, 8:1 on a 4 or 10, etc., all at correct odds, there is no possible way for a bettor to do anything but break even in the long run. \"Random\" simply means that the dice are fair, and there's no way for a bettor to predict the next roll with any distribution other than the expected odds.

If you believe in Materialism and Naturalism, the idea that the only things that exist are physical or tangible, which is a presupposition of most secular and scientific inquiry, then there is no such thing as \"randomness\". All things have a cause, namely that which preceded it. Randomness would imply a break in the natural order of nature. Most religious believers, especially Sunni Muslims post al-Ghazali, would deny randomness as God is ultimately doing all things at all times. Randomness implies that another force exists which God does not have control over or chooses not to exercise his control over. With regards to sub-atomic particles - It isn't that electrons exist in randomness, bu that we cannot accurately define their \"location\" - mind you, electrons are not physical objects like billiard balls, so terms like location loses meaning.
