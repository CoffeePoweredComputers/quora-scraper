            "answer_text": "I have an example of a correlation between philosophy and mathematics. In probability theory, if the probability of events A and B are P(A) and P(B) respectively, wherein P(A),P(B)<1, then A. The probability of both events occurring simultaneously is P(A) x P(B) which is less than either P(A) or P(B). AND B. The probability of either event A or B occurring is P(A) + P(B) which is greater than either P(A) or P(B). And obviously, B>A (unless there is some isolated case wherein B<A). Now, think about your demands in life as P(A) and P(B). If you want both A and B then you are less likely to be happy in life. However, if you are flexible and willing to take either A or B, you will be much more happy in life. Cheers ! ",
