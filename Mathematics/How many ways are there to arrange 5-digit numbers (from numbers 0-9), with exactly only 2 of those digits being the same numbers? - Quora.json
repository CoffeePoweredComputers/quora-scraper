            "answer_text": "I assume that 5-digit numbers starting with 0 on the left don\u2019t count because otherwise they would be either 4-digit or 3-digit numbers depending on whether the number contains one zero or two zeroes on the left. We can classify the possible numbers as follows: (1) No zeroes. In this case, the 5-digit number consists of 4 non-zero different digits 1 - 9 with one of the four digits being duplicated. Number of arrangements is C(9,4)5!/2 = 7560. (2) One zero. In this case, the 5-digit number consists of the one zero and 3 non-zero different digits 1 - 9 with one of the three digits being duplicated. Number of arrangements, taking into account that the one zero can\u2019t be the first digit on the left side, is C(9,3)(5!/2 - 4!/2) = 4032. (3) Two zeroes. In this case, the 5-digit number consists of the two zeroes and 3 non-zero different digits 1 - 9, where a zero can\u2019t be the first digit on the left side. Number of arrangements is C(9,3)(5!/2 - 4!) = 3024. Adding the three results, we get 14616 total arrangements. ",

In case of leading 00:first and second digits are 0, other digits are from 1\u201391*1*9*8*7 In case of leading 0 we have two cases. 0 is repeating on place 3 or 4 or 5 : 1*9*8*7*3 and second case first digit is 0 and remaining 4 digits have 3 distinct and one repeated digit from set 1\u20139. Second digit repeated on position 3,4 or 5 (3 comb.)Third digit repeated on position 4,5 (2 comb.)Fourth digit repeated on position 5 (1 comb)Total is 1+2+3=61*9*8*7*6 10*9*8*7*10 - 1*1*9*8*7 - 1*9*8*7*3 - 1*9*8*7*6=9*8*7*(100\u20131\u20133\u20136)=9*8*7*90=45360 ",
