            "answer_text": "Nobody is bad at math. It's that simple. You may suffer from number blindness, or the building of one simple concept upon another may lose you to some degree. Math is really nothing more than that. It's a set of building blocks that are used to get from a to b. When I was in school, I had the hardest time with math problems. The steps, the rules, and the many different configurations of problems just cooked my brain. The numbers would dance around the paper, taunting me. At 15, I was preparing for my final exams. I was doing just great in everything except math. There were several areas where I just didn't get it. My parents paid for a tutor to sit with me for two hours a week. He was patient in a way that none of my teachers had time for. He walked me through all the different issues I was having, and then he would watch me struggle with them. Before very long, and with his help, I had those licked, and I did pretty well come exam time. Later on, I used much of the same knowledge to get me through college. Later in life, I became interested in the very same problem areas once again. I started with some basic algebra, and worked through entire books of problems. My knowledge was fuzzy, and I had to relearn a lot of the rules in order to get anywhere. But this time it was different. I had no stress and no time limit. I discovered that I had no issues at all. Juggling numbers in my head gets a little gnarly, but I would sit with a notebook and work through the problems. I also discovered some wonderful books that look at the spectrum of math and numbers in novel ways. The major problem with math is that there is always more than one way to derive the answer. Nobody taught me that in school. It was their way, or the highway! So, first of all... relax. Realize that it may not be you that is the problem. I never had much joy with my teachers. They went too fast, had too many students to deal with, and couldn't work at my pace. If you need external help, get it. I highly recommend it. And practice the areas that you find most troublesome. I eventually became a software developer, and have found many uses for the math I thought I would never use. And to think that, once upon a time, I too was \"bad at math.\" ",

            "answer_text": "It's a subject like any other, as well as a tool, albeit more misunderstood than many other well known subjects. Very few people are born \"very good\" at math, although some have personalities lend well to learning the subject: curious, tenacious, enjoys solving problems or getting to the root of things, appreciates or prefers abstractions and/or deep understandings, patient, passion for learning, willingness to work for knowledge, etc.    I find that those who are \"bad at math\" or don't like math lack these traits, and how \"bad at math\" someone says they are has little to do with their true abilities in learning the subject. As a college tutor I learned that often the greatest impedance to learning maths is one's belief in one's ability and desire to learn and understand mathematical concepts. There are those who struggle more and vice versa, but the majority of the spectrum of students, \"brilliant or not\", can master the maths through introductory calculus or beyond with persistent effort.    The next greatest impedance is the consistency of one's efforts. When tutoring, you could tell when one did their homework or not. A unfortunate misconception about maths is the belief that you may fully understand, recall, and/or be able to apply a concept by simply listening to a teacher lecture. Maths are skills as well as concepts that need to be practiced in order to be honed. If one desires to be better at maths they should most importantly practice.    Start with a textbook you can understand, perhaps high school algebra, read through it, performing the various exercises until you are able to teach it to someone else. And if possible, have someone available you can ask questions. Outside perspectives will expand your own and better round your understanding of concepts. When you are finished with the textbook or find nothing left of interest or necessity jump to a more advance textbook, preferably of interest. And most of all, don't give up. ",
