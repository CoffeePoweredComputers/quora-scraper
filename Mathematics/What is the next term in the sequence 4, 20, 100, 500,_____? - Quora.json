            "answer_text": "The answer is 2500. As you can see if we look over the first starting number that's is 4 and if we would multiply it by 5,the result is 20,the next no in the sequence . Again if we multiply 20 by 5 ,then the product we get is 100 ,which is next number in the sequence. So to find the next number in sequence of 500 ,we should multiply 500 by 4 ,and the ans we get is 2500 ",
