Here, above, the key word is \u201cdifference.\u201d That word is asking how much larger one number is from the other number or how much smaller one number is from the other number. To, answer this question we need to subtract the smaller number value from the larger number value, enabling us to express that difference as a positive value. 0.5909 - 0.27 = 0.3209 as the difference between 0.5909 and 0.27 Answer: 0.3209 ",

            "answer_text": "Easy! You can add as many 0\u2019s as you want after a decimal number and it won\u2019t alter anything. So, 0.27 is the same as 0.2700. We can now get a calculator or just do the question by hand on paper, which is 0.5909 - 0.2700 which equals 0.3209. So the difference between 0.5909 and 0.27 is 0.3209. Hope this helps! ",
