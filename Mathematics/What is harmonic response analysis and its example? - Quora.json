            "answer_text": "If you have a complicated structure and want to analyze its response to vibration for say the foundation of a vibration sensitive instrument in a hospital next to a railway you will need to determine its response to likely vibrations beforehand. In cases in the past by exciting it a one frequency and measuring the response at the same frequency you got a transfer function. Trouble is that with complicated structures you may get what is called parametric amplification where multiples of the frequency are excited. So you need to look for harmonics. For example - if you pull on the end of a slender beam the out of plane resonant frequency of the beam is half the excitation frequency because at the two extremes of deflection the end is in the shortened position. This can also happen in the run up of turbines and for that they generate a \u201cwaterfall\u201d chart showing the rise and fall of harmonics as the speed changes. http://dataphysics.com/products-and-solutions/dynamic-signal-analyzers-signalcalc/signalcalc-turbo.html ",
