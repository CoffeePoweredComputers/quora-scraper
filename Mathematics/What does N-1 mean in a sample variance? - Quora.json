            "answer_text": "N is the sample size so N-1 is one less. Suppose you sample the two numbers -1 and 1. The sample mean is zero so the deviations are -1 and +1, and the sum of the squared deviations (relative to the sample mean) is (-1)^2+1^2=2. How do we estimate the variance, i.e. the mean squared deviation, from this? In the sample itself, obviously, it is 2/N = 2/2 = 1. However, if you want to estimate the variance of the population from which the two numbers were samples, you have to take into account that the population mean might not be 0. If it is -1, for example, you would get a mean squared deviation of 2. If it were -2, you will get 5. It turns out that the unbiased estimate is 2, not 1, in this case. More generally, you have to divide the sum of squared deviations by N-1 instead of by N. Unless you somehow (magically) know the population mean. In that case, you ignore the sample mean, add up the squared deviations relative to the known population mean, and divide by N. ",
