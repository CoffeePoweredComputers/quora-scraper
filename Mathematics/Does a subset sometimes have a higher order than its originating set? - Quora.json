            "answer_text": "No. By definition, a set B has less or equal order (cardinality) than a set A if there is a one to one pairing (correspondence) between the elements of B and the elements of a subset of set A. (A is also a subset of itself.) This can obviously be done for any subset B of a set A. So a subset\u2019s cardinality can either have less (or for infinite sets) equal order as the set itself. For example, the set of all even positive integers is a proper subset of the set of all positive integers, but it has equal order because each positive integer N can be paired with its double 2N. ",

            "answer_text": "What do mean by order? If you mean cardinality then the answer is: \u201cno\". If A is a subset of B then the inclusion is injective. This tells us that the cardinality of A does not exceed the cardinality of B. It is possible though that a strict subset A of B has the same cardinality as B. This requires the existence of an injective map that has B as domain and A as codomain. For instance the function from integers to even integers that sends each element n to element 2n. ",
