            "answer_text": "In 1965, I could take that newly-minted quarter into the Rexall drugstore where I bought my candy, and I could buy FIVE Milky Way bars that were about half the size of the bars that sell for more than a Ickes now. (If I had an extra penny, I could get a \"6 for 26 cents\" deal on the candy bars at Rexall on Fridays.) My mom could get a gallon of gas for her car for that shiny 1965 quarter. She might even get a nickel of change back, I can remember \"gas war\" gas prices going as low as 19 cents a gallon. I filled my car up a couple days ago, and gas was $3.40/gallon (premium gas in Southern California.) At Woolworth's, in 1965, I could go to the toy department and get a bag of marbles and 15 cents change with my quarter. Last time I saw marbles at Toys 'R' Us, they were about $2.50 a bag. (I can't go to Woolworth's any more, they're long gone; looks like Toys 'R' Us is going away, too.) My 1965 quarter could buy me 5 Rainbow Sherbet ice cream cones at Thrifty Drugs, or two vanilla cones and a nickel change; or a Foster Freeze Chocolate-Dip Vanilla Soft Serve. A single scoop of vanilla in a cone anywhere is a couple dollars now. A chocolate dip Foster Freeze cone is about $2.50 now. I could go on, but it depresses me. What is a 1965 quarter worth today? A lot less than it was worth in 1965! (When they came out with the new, non-silver coinage in 1965 [1964 and earlier quarters were real silver], a lot of us kids were really excited about them, and if a cashier had the new quarters, we'd swap older silver quarters to get the new coins. Boy oh boy were we dumb. Wish I could go back to 1965 and save every silver quarter, dime and half-dollar I could get my hands on!) ",

            "answer_text": "1965 quarters almost always go for face value.  But there is an interesting quirk of history. 1965 was a busy year for the mint, since they largely stopped coining in silver. However, there were still some silver blanks from pre-1965 accidentally mixed into the new non-silver blanks. So there were probably a few dozen 1965 quarters minted in silver. Due to their rarity, they usually go for auction in the high 4 to low 5 digit range. However, it would be a waste of time to look for such coins in change. The mintage of Washington quarters was 1.8 billion in 1965 and there are probably no more than a few dozen silver 1965 quarters. You've be just as likely to win the lotto as find such a coin in change.  ",

The little known fact is that the San Fran Mint did make some \u201cSpecial Mint Sets\u201d in 1966 but with a 1965 date on them. There were even some with the year 1964 on them. If you have one of these (65\u201367) still in the package they are worth about $13 for the set. The 64 set is not priced because none have been auctioned to the public and they are very rare (they were not supposed to be made). An MS-65 (totally uncirculated) 1965 quarter is worth $9 as per \u201cThe Red Book 2017\u201d. Hope this helps. ",

Since the US mint had to replace ALL the silver coins that were removed from circulation in 1965, a massive number of halves, quarters, and dimes were minted. It isn't uncommon to still find coins from that year in pocket change. Since even then dollar coins had fallen out of everyday use outside of casinos, those weren't a factor. Also, in an effort not to devalue the newly created Kennedy half dollar, a clad silver version was produced through 1969. Your 1965 is a nickel/copper clad (just as quarters are today) and worth exactly 25 cents. ",

There were also no \"D\" mintmarked coins produced during 1965. There were over 1 billion quarters minted with the 1965 date on them. A quarter of that date that that is in choice uncirculated condition is worth $1.00 but generally will fetch less from a dealer, if he even has a need for a copy. Good luck. ",
