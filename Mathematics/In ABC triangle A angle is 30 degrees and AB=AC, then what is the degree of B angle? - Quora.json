            "answer_text": "Ans: Given AB=AC that means if we draw a triangle with A,B and C as vortices then angle opposite to the side AB must be equal to the angle opposite to the side AC i.e angle B=angle C . It is given that angle A = 30 degree. As we know sum of 3 angles in a triangle = 180 degree So angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degree => angle B + angle C= 180 degree - angle A = 180 degree - 30 degree=150 degree => 2 angle B =150 degree ( since angle B = angle C) => angle B = 150 degree/2 = 75 degree( Ans) ",
