            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t very difficult to say what \u201cPhilosophy of Mathematics\u201d is. It is a field of study that deals with questions like \u201cWhat is a number?\u201d \u201cAre truths of mathematics discovered or created?\u201d Simple questions such as these have given rise to further questions that become more technical. Since sets were used to explain what numbers are, we need to ask \u201cWhat is a set?\u201d Since the 19th Century, there\u2019s a large body of literature that\u2019s built up in the attempt to answer such questions. Bertrand Russell and Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy Bertrand Russell made important contributions to philosophy of mathematics. He did in fact write a book called Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, intended as a non-technical introduction to the field, making the results of his technical work available to philosophers who were not familiar with the symbolism of mathematical logic. Here\u2019s a quotation from his preface: Much of what is set forth in the following chapters is not properly to be called \u201cphilosophy,\u201d though the matters concerned were included in philosophy so long as no satisfactory science of them existed. The nature of infinity and continuity, for example, belonged in former days to philosophy, but belongs now to mathematics. Mathematical philosophy, in the strict sense, cannot, perhaps, be held to include such definite scientific results as have been obtained in this region; the philosophy of mathematics will naturally be expected to deal with questions on the frontier of knowledge, as to which comparative certainty is not yet attained. But speculation on such questions is hardly likely to be fruitful unless the more scientific parts of the principles of mathematics are known. A book dealing with those parts may, therefore, claim to be an introduction to mathematical philosophy, though it can hardly claim, except where it steps outside its province, to be actually dealing with a part of philosophy. Russell believed that the task of philosophers was to take speculative questions and turn them into scientific questions, thus expanding the domain of science and diminishing the domain of philosophy. As a question passes from the domain of philosophy to the domain of science, the philosopher will seek new questions to be converted. (\u201cScience\u201d here means \u201can organized body of knowledge\u201d, so Russell can take for granted that mathematics is a science). What Russell is saying here is that the book presents definitive mathematical answers to questions previously considered to be part of philosophy, answers that anyone who wishes to engage in advancing the philosophy of mathematics must be acquainted with. Thus the issues introduced in the book are no longer part of philosophy, but knowledge of them is necessary for anyone who wishes to be introduced to - to what? As far a I can see, in this passage \u201cMathematical Philosophy\u201d and \u201cPhilosophy of Mathematics\u201d are used interchangeably. Focus on this sentence: Mathematical philosophy, in the strict sense, cannot, perhaps, be held to include such definite scientific results as have been obtained in this region; the philosophy of mathematics will naturally be expected to deal with questions on the frontier of knowledge, as to which comparative certainty is not yet attained. Here, \u201cMathematical philosophy\u201d is not being contrasted with \u201cphilosophy of mathematics\u201d, they are being used as equivalent terms. (It is considered good style to avoid repeating a term if possible). Mathematical philosophy-Philosophy of mathematics does not include scientific results, it does include questions on the frontier of knowledge. So, it would seem that Bertrand Russell used \u201cMathematical Philosophy\u201d as a synonym for \u201cPhilosophy of Mathematics\u201d, and it just happened that, over time \u201cPhilosophy of Mathematics\u201d came to be adopted as the standard name for the field. Mathematics In Philosophy I thought it was important to mention Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy because anyone who types \u201cMathematical Philosophy\u201d into google will find plenty of references to this book. But looking around, I see that the term is used in another way that makes a lot of sense. Contemporary philosophers make use of mathematics to deal with all kinds of questions, not just questions in philosophy of mathematics. For example, when I first stated studying arguments for the existence of God (age sixteen), I came across Richard Swinburne\u2019s The Existence of God. (Later he became my supervisor). Swinburne uses Bayes\u2019s Theorem to analyze the probability that God exists - in order to understand the book, I had to be able to understand Bayes\u2019s Theorem. This is not particularly difficult - it is basic probability theory - but it was a lesson to me that if I was serious about philosophy, I could not neglect mathematics. That would be an example of mathematical philosophy. A lot of work in moral philosophy right now requires a knowledge of game theory. Donald Davidson\u2019s work on the nature of belief also draws on Bayesian decision theory. One of the pioneers of this field was Frank Ramsey - a contemporary of Russell who died at the age of 26. If Russell made huge contributions to the philosophy of mathematics, Ramsey can be praised for showing how mathematical techniques can be used to give results that have philosophical significance. I have a long list of books that I intend to read some day, and on that list is Eric Steinhart\u2019s More Precisely: The Math You Need To Do Philosophy. It isn\u2019t a book about philosophy of mathematics - the book is needed because in all kinds of context, philosophers find themselves making use of mathematical results. In this sense, mathematical philosophy is not a branch of philosophy. You might be working on philosophy of religion or philosophy of mind or ethics, and suddenly the author you are reading starts throwing in equations and deriving results from them. Either you give up or, if you really want to get to the bottom of the question, you get stuck in and pretty soon what you are doing is mathematical philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "Given the vagueness of the English language, these phrases could mean most anything that touch on both math and philosophy. The intended meaning would either have to be expressed up front or be obvious from the context. There could be no difference at all.   \"Philosophy of <some area of knowledge>\" often refers to the study of the philosophical aspects of that knowledge area. These aspects include things like existence, reality, meaning, and how things are known. In contrast, \"<some area of knowledge> philosophy\" would be used in phrases such as \"the <some area of knowledge> philosophy of so'n'so\" or \"so'n'so's <some area of knowledge> philosophy\" to refer to a specific philosophy about the knowledge area.
