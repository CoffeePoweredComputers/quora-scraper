            "answer_text": "Union( A U B) , intersection( A n B) , complement(A') & difference(A -B) are all 4 fundamental Set Operations. Complement of any set is found as shown below\u2026 A = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,\u2026\u2026.10} B= { 4,5,6 } Here, we notice that B is a subset of A & complement of set B , is the set of those elements , which are present in A but not in B. => B' = { 1,2,3,7,8,9,10} ie, cancell out common elements from both & whatever is left in A, is B'. There's a difference between Complement Operation & Difference Operation. That is \u2026. While finding difference (A-B) , it's not necessary that one set should be the sub set of the other. Like A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} & B= { 3,5,8,9,10} . Here B is not a subset of A. So, the set {1,2,4,6,7} is not B' but it is A-B. while finding complement , as shown above , one set should be the sub set of the other. Or one set should be the Universal set. ",

            "answer_text": "First, find the global set which concerns your set. Then, remove elements of the set you have from this global set. This gives you the complement of the set you want to obtain. For ex : Let A={1,2,3,4} be set within all integers I. Here, I becomes my global set. A\u2019( complement of A) will now be I - A, which is all integers except 1,2,3 and 4. ",
