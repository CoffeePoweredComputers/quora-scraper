            "answer_text": "The formula for the total number of degrees in any pentagon is (5\u20132) times 180 degrees. This is because 3 independent triangles can be inscribed in a pentagon. And each triangle\u2019s internal angles add up to 180 degrees, so: 3 times 180 degrees equals 540 degrees. Since it is a regular pentagon simply divide by 5 to get 108 degrees. ",

            "answer_text": "As I recall, the exterior angles of a regular, multi-sided polygon is 360 divided by the number of sides, so the interior angles would be 180 - (360/# of sides). So, for a regular pentagon, exterior angles are 360/5 = 72 deg, and interior angles are 108 deg. (As a check: for a square, exterior angles are 360/ = 90 deg; interior angles are 90 deg. For a hexagon, exterior angles are 360/6 = 60 deg; interior angles are 120 deg. Far from a general proof, but check values seem right.) ",
