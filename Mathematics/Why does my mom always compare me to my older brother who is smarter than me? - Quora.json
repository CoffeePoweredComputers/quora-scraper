            "answer_text": "Your mother is using an inordinately small sample size in her determination as to whether you are achieving appropriate goals. This is due to either bias on her part or laziness. If your brother was the firstborn child let\u2019s assume that the culmination of all of both of your parents\u2019 accomplishments and abilities were either spoon fed to him or forced down his gullet through a funnel. Nothing was too good for #1 son from educational materials to dietary needs to medical care. Now here comes #2. You are not Avis\u2122, you do not \u201cTry harder.\u201d You are fed the scraps left over in the wake of their Golden Boy. They may have noticed in the crib (his old one) that you were not learning math. Your verbal reasoning is not the same. It is almost as if\u2026you were not his clone! Because you are not his clone. Even if they replayed the tapes of every second of interaction your brother experienced with another human or anything from which he could learn and duplicated it exactly with you, you would not be the same. He may have learned by listening, you might require a more hands-on experience. He was a neat nut, you thrive in chaos. They do not understand what went wrong. And now, apparently expect you to run a self diagnostic program to tell them precisely what the differences are between yourself and your brother \u2014genetically, and also just exactly how you need to be treated in order to obtain the best possible outcome from this unknown genetic mix. I don\u2019t believe that most people are absolutely vastly more intelligent than others, but rather that mostly people are \u201cSmart Differently.\u201d Apparently they have not bothered to determine just what it is that you are \u201csmart at.\u201d This is a difficult enough task under the best of circumstances; it will not be made easier in the poor lighting conditions that most likely exist in the gloomy realm of the shadow of your brother in which you live. Perhaps independent testing will show your areas of ability better than the subjective opinions of your mother. Focus on not only what you do best, but what you enjoy the most. This will direct you to the activities where you are most likely to excel. The race is not against your brother, it is against a boring, ordinary existence which brings you no joy. If you can find what you love to do and get people to pay you to do it, you will never work a day in your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Because she thinks you need to be more like him. I think you need to be you. Each of us is born unique, with strengths and weaknesses and a unique walk through life that is almost certain to look different than our siblings, or anyone else for that matter. Yes, its wise to appreciate skills and abilities, interests and character traits that someone else has developed in their lives. There is great wisdom in learning from others, so if big bro has some really admirable things he has learned to do well, its not a bad idea to learn from him as much as you can. But, I think its even more important that you decide who you want to be and get busy doing more of that. I also think you should talk to your mom. Ask her why she is always comparing you to him, and talk to her about the traits he has that she likes. Talk about his weaknesses. Talk about her hopes for both of you - what is important and what is not. Spend the time to help her get to know YOU better, what\u2019s in your head and what makes you excited. Acknowledge those things about big bro she wants you to do too, but also be willing to suggest that if there are things about him she admires that you do not, things he is pursuing you have no interest in, that she makes space for you to be different. Mom\u2019s love their son\u2019s a lot. She wants you to be happy and successful. Its wise to listen to her and consider what her hopes and expectations for you are, and how your big bro is a good example for developing your life in that direction. But, at the same time, you need to let mom know where your hopes and dreams diverge, where your interests and talents and energies are different from your brother\u2019s, and have honest conversations about your desire to have her support those things in your life that are different from your brother\u2019s. Its generally a good think to have an older sibling that you can look up to. I have to assume that mom\u2019s references to him reflect that he is doing a lot of things well to grow up strong, independent, caring, humble and generally successful. Take advantage of that and try to appreciate that if your big bro was a jerk, a drug addict, violent and selfish, your mom would not compare you in the same way! it would be a much more problematic situation. Try to find what is good and valuable and fortunate in this situation. But in the end, we are all human, very imperfect, and we are all trying hard to succeed in our own way, and my hope for you is that your mom will help both you and your brother learn to make good decisions and build worthy lives to live, and also encourage and support you in your differences.
