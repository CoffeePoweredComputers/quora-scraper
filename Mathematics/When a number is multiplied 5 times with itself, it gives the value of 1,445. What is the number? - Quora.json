            "answer_text": "Let the no is x. Five times a number is 5x.multiply both we get ans =1445.now write the equation X. 5x=1445 5x.x=1445 Divide both side by 5,we get x. x=289 So, x=sqrt of 289 x=17is the answer. Now check your answer by multiplying 17and 5.17 17x85=1445 which is given to you in the question. ",

            "answer_text": "A number is multiplied 5 times with itself, can be written in the exponential form as\u2026. Let the number be \u2018a' So, a x a^5 = a^6 & a^6 = 1445 => a^6 = (17\u221a5)\u00b2 => a^6 = {( cube root 17\u221a5 ) }^6 => a = cube root 17\u221a5 ( as exponents are equal, so base should be equal) So, cube root of 17\u221a5 , when multiplied 5 times with itself, the required no ie (17\u221a5 )^1/3 x {( 17\u221a5)^1/3}^5 the product = {(17\u221a5)^1/3}^6 = 17\u221a5 x 17\u221a5 = 1445 Ans: (17\u221a5)^1/3 ",
