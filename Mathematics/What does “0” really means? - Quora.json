            "answer_text": "It depends on the context. I'm going to take you on a tiny journey through math history; if you want a short answer to this question, then skip down to the last couple of paragraphs. At one time, people just thought of numbers as adjectives; for example, five togas. Although no one had developed a concept of zero yet, we can look back with our modern eyes; in this context, zero things means no things. During 6th century BC, Pythagoras and his cultists started thinking of numbers as their own entities. (They may not have been the only ones; I'm not so familiar with that time period outside that geographical area.) They considered not merely numbers on their own but relationships between numbers; for example they realized that two and three shared the same relationship as four and six. They developed the concepts of what we recognize today as fractions. It\u2019s probably a good thing that they didn't know about zero yet since division involving zero would have been a disaster until they figured out what to do about it. Fastforward about 1200 years, when zero was developed as an actual number, not just a decimal placeholder, by Brahmagupta in India. That's where most of zero arithmetic rules you listed came from; the exception is 1/0=infinity; Brahmagupta defined 1/0 as 0. Eventually, somebody (I don\u2019t remember who, but I do remember it was at least 400 years later) noticed the problems inherent with this rule and re-defined 1/0 as infinity. What they didn't notice is that this causes its own set of problems. Still later, this was corrected: 1/0 is undefined. It all comes down to how division is defined. The easiest description of how division works goes back to using numbers as adjectives for unspecified objects: a/b means to figure out how many sets of b objects are contained in a set of a objects. Modern algebraists sometimes use a more operation-based approach; a/b is defined as the solution to b*??=a. Specifically, 1/0 is the solution to 0*??=1. No such number exists; therefore, 1/0 is undefined. ",

            "answer_text": "The number 0 fulfills a central role in mathematics as an additive identity of the integers, real numbers, and many other algebraic structures. Zero represented by \u20180\u2019 describes no quantity or an empty set.It is a mathematical identity, which when added to any other number yields the number itself.It is a point on the number line from which positive and negative quantities can be measured.Zero indicates the absence of all or any units under considerations.It can also be indicating the initial point, the center or the origin.It also relates to null set.Basically, it represents a quantity of no importance or a null set.",
