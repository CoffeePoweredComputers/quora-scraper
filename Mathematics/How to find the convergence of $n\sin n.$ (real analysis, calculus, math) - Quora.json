            "answer_text": "I understand you are trying to find the limit of the sequence n/sin(n) when n->inf Consider a subsequence n\u2019/sin(n\u2019) where n\u2019 are all values of n where 2k\u03c0<n<2k\u03c0+\u03c0, for all k. This implies that sin(n\u2019)>0 ; hence we may write: n\u2019/sin(n\u2019)>n\u2019, it is easy to see that when n\u2192inf =>n\u2019 \u2192inf, hence n\u2019/sin(n\u2019)\u2192inf. If a subsequence diverges so does the sequence therefore there is not a limit. Furthermore, adopting a similar approach you may define a subsequence with n\u201d/sin(n\u201d), selecting n\u201d so that sin(n\u201d)<0; in this case n\u201d/sin(n\u201d)->-inf\u2026. ",
