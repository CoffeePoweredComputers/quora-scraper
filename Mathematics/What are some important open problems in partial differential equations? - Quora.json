            "answer_text": "One problem which comes to my mind is the proof of existence and smoothness of the solutions of Navier-Stokes equation. If this problem is solved our understanding of turbulence, and fluid mechanics at large, would be better. This problem has been listed as one of the unsolved problems of the millennium by Clay Mathematical Institute. The institute also offers a prize money of one million USD to anyone who solves it. This fact can help in appreciating the criticality of this problem. ",
