            "answer_text": "Intelligence has way too much variation to ever have a truly level playing field on which to judge the merits of two people.  Of course, that doesn't mean you can never tell.  Sometimes the difference would be obvious enough in a particular sort of intelligence to be able to tell who was more intelligent regardless of the playing field. For example, if I was wondering who was smarter, me or Richard Feynman, I could probably figure that out without trying overly hard.  However, picking a winner between Feynman and Einstein might be a bit harder. But for most comparisons, I think that this would be one of those cases where perception equals reality. People do develop an impression about whether other people are smarter than them or not.  That perception is probably built on a foundation that depends on:  How much knowledge and experience you and the other person have accumulated in the fields in which you are \"competing\" at the time that the impression is formed.Exactly what mix of intelligence types you value and are seeking to compare and how your strengths and theirs happen to compare in that narrow band of interest, e.g. artists versus a chemists.In the most general sense, intelligence has been broken down in some theories into categories of fluid and crystallized intelligence. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence  In the end, I think people have some basic heuristics for deciding this stuff. First:Guesstimate about how much crystallized intelligence you would expect someone to have given their apparent time spent learning a given field based on a rate of acquisition over time.  If the other person creates an impression of crystallized intelligence that exceeds the expectations you might have for yourself, then that's one vote that they're smarter than you.  This is entirely based on a bunch of wild ass guesses about how much actual focused time the other person has spent narrowed in on this field, and anecdotal evidence about how much knowledge they have accumulated that has been extrapolated into a general feeling.  And your estimations of your own rate of acquiring knowledge are no better.  In fact, they're probably worse. Second:Encounter some problems that seem equally unfamiliar to both of you and judge the speed and thoroughness with which both you and the other person are comprehending and solving them.  This is more about fluid intelligence.  Here you might be more able to create a direct comparison as you can both work on the same problem from a similar starting position. However, I would guess that experience plays into solving these types of problems far more than we can detect and adjust for in our weighing of these things.  So really, you're back to Tyson versus Ali.  How would you have done given equal contextual help from experience versus the other person? There are interesting studies out there that basically conclude that we're all terrible judges of our relative merits.  Take the Dunning-Kruger effect: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect  People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains....This overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it.--\"Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments,\" by Justin Kruger and David Dunning  The same study, by the way, also concludes that the smart people underestimate their abilities. SO, what's the conclusion of this?  Basically, what you will probably do is fuzz up a bunch of squishy judgement calls based on guesstimates of expected performance in a couple of areas, wash it all through a set of human biases and then come up with a poor judgement.  If the gap between your intelligence and theirs is wide enough to overcome that mess then you will think they are smarter (or dumber) than you and be right simply because it's too hard to be wrong.  If it's not an extremely wide gap then you will conclude something, and that something is just as likely (if not more likely) to be wrong as it is to be right. Really, I suggest you just have both of you take some standardized tests and then argue about their validity.  If the other person out scores you AND convinces you it was a valid test, then you're probably dumber than them... on some level... about something... In the meantime, it's worth noting that intelligence and effectiveness are NOT the same thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question is \"how do I detect a phenomenon which by definition I am not equipped to detect\". One answer is to enhance your natural detectors, and/or use outside detectors. By way of analogy, one uses a microscope to enhance vision to detect otherwise invisible microbes. For instance, many make use of \"science writers\" to translate unintelligeable-to-most descriptions of physical phenomena into practible wrappings. If after using the provisional new knowledge it actually works in practice, you may presume they are smarter than you because the information was falsifiable - yet worked in practice.  Another way is to write down the predictions an individual may make and then see if they come true while rating the prediction on this basis \"the value of a prediction is inversely proportional to its likelihood\". If someone says \"the sun will set tonight\" it is an excellent prediction, but since it is extremely likely its value is extremely low. If however, someone in 2004 predicts that housing prices will collapse catastrophically in 2006 and that a good time to consider buying would be winter 2009, then this 2004 prediction would have gone against most opinions of the time, it would have been time precise and it would have been accurate. I made such a prediction and acted upon it. I have made many such predictions. BUT... Here is the biggest limiter to determining if someone is significantly smarter than you (or almost everybody). You will not want to listen to them or believe them - in fact, their insights will likely irritate you or make you angry. Therefore, one of the key ways to discover someone smarter than you is to pay very close attention to those who may be dismissed by others or seem irritating or socially inept. They live in a world where they are viewed as irrelevant and socially useless from a utility theory standpoint (until they become wealthy). An analogy would be \"would dogs that cannot understand more than 30ish words think a dog that understood english was smarter? There's no way they could know that!\" The only way to detect such a thing would be to consider the halo of events around them...hmmm they seem to be out of harm's way more than the average canine, and they get alot of food too...I dunno why, but I think I'll pay a bit more attention to them. Another method. Find isolated people. Consider for instance how many people you will really know in your lifetime. Perhaps 200? Honestly, more like 20. Consider further that those with IQ's of 150 and above will be one in 10,000 to one in 10 million. The great great odds are that you will never meet even one such person in a standard human lifetime, but ALL the people they will meet are folks such as (perhaps) yourself so they will likely never meet someone as smart as themselves just based on the odds. Therefore, as children, such individuals will feel insane, isolated, literally alien and unable to place themselves in a social situation feeling like \"I look like everyone else - what is wrong with me\". This causes the social death or literal death of many of them. Those who survive such silent and hidden gauntlets will learn to keep their alienness to themselves as a self protective measure. This is changing a bit now that Quora et al exist. If such an individual survives childhood, adolescence and middle adulthood, then you can detect them by their ability to hide in plain sight. They will have sayings like Christ, Buddha, Mark Twain, Tesla, Feynman, Steve Allen, Steve Martin, Macchiavelli. They will have a tendency to refer to original writings (\"I was reading the article that Tesla wrote in 1905 for Century Magazine the other day and, it was interesting that...\") rather than quoting other pundits who make a living obscuring truth and knowledge. If you exhibit curiosity, then they will ask you \"stupid questions\" to find out how awake you are, and to help you become awake which you/most will find irritating and of no value...questions like \"what IS music?\", \"I noticed a tree in my backyard engaging in preemptive combat with a newly planted tree. It's been growing branches to shade the other tree over the last 3 years... want to see it?\" or \"Why are there 27 synonyms for Worry but only 1 for Optimism in English? What are the effects of such an imbalance to civilization?\" They will ask \"when was the last time you pulled your mobile cave to the side of the road and watched a sunset? Did you realize that no human can produce such beauty and for the life of me I can't figure out a \"survival of the fittest reason why I can't stop myself from looking at such profligate, pervasive, dynamic non-linear amazingness that's just \"out there for free all over the planet all the time every stinking day - isn't it gosh-all amazing?\" They will also remark that 1,000 cars drove by during that golden hour so they could hurry home to watch tv and saw nothing. The truly intelligent know there is no money, that life is the key resource, because it allows learning, that time exists in our perception because life is (now needlessly) limited, that the pursuit of \"perfection\" to escape criticism leads to completely perfect misery but love of self, God and fellow humans can expand good to infinity. They will be glad to tell you the truth for free, but you will not want to hear it. That is the final answer to your question. ",
