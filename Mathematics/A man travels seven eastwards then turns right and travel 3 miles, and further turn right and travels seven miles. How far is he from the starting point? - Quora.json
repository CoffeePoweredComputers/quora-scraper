            "answer_text": "Two right turns (or two left turns) is equivalent to an about face, also known as a reversal of direction. A man who travels seven miles in an eastward direction, then three miles southwards after turning right, then turns right again is now traveling in a westward direction. He has reversed his course and is retracing his steps, albeit displaced by three miles to the south. Answer: He is three miles southwards of the starting point. In this submission the words eastwards, southwards, and westwards mean the compass headings 90 degrees more or less, 180 degrees more or less, and 270 degrees more or less, respectively. Right or left turns, however, are turns of exactly 90 degrees. Three right turns ( or three left turns), each preceded by traveling a distance of one block, plus traveling a distance of one block more, will take you around the block, i.e. return you to your starting point on an urban grid. In terms of your heading or direction of travel, three right turns is equivalent to one left turn; three left turns is equivalent to one right turn. Is it grammatical to say, \u201cTwo right turns is\u201d ? In the usage above in which \u201ctwo right turns\u201d can be considered a unitary action, it is all right. But \u201cThere are two right turns ahead, in 600 feet and then a mile down the road,\u201d is also correct. ",

            "answer_text": "Some minor assumptions: he's on level ground and when he turns, he turns 90\u00ba (a right angle). So he travels seven miles east, turns right and travels three miles south, then turns right and travels seven miles west. He has traced out three sides of a 7 x 3 mile rectangle and is three miles from his starting point. ",
