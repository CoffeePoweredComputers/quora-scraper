            "answer_text": "The Fundamental theorem of game theory, or the Minimax theorem*, is stated as: Every finite, zero-sum, two-person game has optimal mixed strategies. An example of such a game is rock-paper-scissors, heads up poker or pitcher vs. batter in baseball. The statement means that for any such zero sum game, meaning, a game between two people where if one wins [math]x[/math], the other loses [math]x[/math], there exists an optimal mixed strategy such that a player using that strategy cannot do better (if playing against an opponent also using an optimal strategy). For example, in rock-paper-scissors, an optimal mixed strategy is to randomly throw one of the three with equal probability. This is an unbeatable strategy, IF the other player adopts their, equivalent, optimal strategy. If your opponent throws rock every time, there is obviously a better one. For a little more advanced example, let\u2019s look at a simplified game of heads-up, one card poker. That is, each player gets a card, player A bets, and player B can call or fold. The highest card wins. What seems like a reasonable strategy for player A? Betting every ace is obvious. Betting kings and queens also seems quite good. But what about a 2? If your opponent has a 3, would they really call a bet? Then maybe you should bluff sometimes when you have a two. But maybe not all of the time, so you bet too much and start getting called by 6\u2019s. I don\u2019t know what the best strategy is, but by the fundamental theorem of game theory, one exists. In general, an optimal mixed strategy is a set of moves with associated frequencies. It\u2019s quite nice that such a result is proven, even if it is extremely hard to find such strategies for sufficiently complex games. *Proved by certified super genious John von Neumann. ",
