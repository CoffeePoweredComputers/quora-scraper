            "answer_text": "form a right angle triangle with the direction of the hypotenuse being 37 degrees North of East. The hypotenuse is 5 meters long. The second leg of the triangle runs East - West and has length A. The angle between the second leg and the hypotenuse is 37 degrees. The third leg of the triangle runs North - South and has length B. The angle between the second leg and the third leg is 90 degrees. This is the length we want to determine. The angle between the third leg and the hypotenuse is 180\u201337\u201390 = 53 degrees. Not important to solving this question. Length B/length of the hypotenuse = Sin 37 degrees. Length B = Sin 37 degrees X length of the hypotenuse Length B = 0.6018 X 5m Length B = 3.01m. So the person walked 3.01m North. 3.0m is probably close enough. Not asked for but if we wanted to calculate how far East the person walked we could do it in a similar manner. Length A/length of the hypotenuse = Cos 37 degrees Length A/ length of the hypotenuse = 0.7986 Length A/5m = 0.7986 Length A = 5m X 0.7986 Length A = 3.993m. So the person walked 3.993m East. 4.0m is likely close enough. A quick check of our lengths can be done because we know that for a right angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So in this case, 5 squared = 3 squared + 4 squared. 25 = 9 + 16. 25 = 25 Looks good! ",

            "answer_text": "Using Ken Price's answer to A person walks 5m in the direction 37\u00b0 north of east. How far north had he walked?, and since the person is walking, I think you should round the numbers. Thus: He walked 5 meters, thereby going 3 meters north and 4 meters east. This now looks like the classic 3\u20134\u20135 right triangle with integral sides, so if the angle were given more precisely, you\u2019d probably come even closer to 3 and 4. The triangle is so small relative to the radius of the Earth that the correction for curvature would be much much smaller than the size of the walker\u2019s foot. ",
