For other loss functions mentioned this question: MSE (mean squared error): it is usually used by regression problems but not logistic problem.1\u20130 loss: well, this one is indeed used as a loss function of logistic models but it is non-differentiable! Usually we choose another loss function like hinge loss.The following contrast 1\u20130 loss with hinge loss [math]L_{hinge}(s) := max\\{0, 1-s\\}[/math]  For a perceptron algorithm, every time we pick a training example \u2014 call it [math](x_t, y_t)[/math] \u2014 misclassified by [math]w^{t-1}[/math] and update using: [math]w^{t} := w^{t-1} - \\bigtriangledown L_{hinge}(y_tx_t^Tw^{(t-1)})[/math] Because it is misclassified, we have [math]y_tx_t^Tw^{(t-1)}<0 [/math] so, [math] L_{hinge}(y_tx_t^Tw^{(t-1)}) = 1 - y_tx_t^Tw^{(t-1)} > 0[/math] so [math]\\bigtriangledown L_{hinge}(y_tx_t^Tw^{(t-1)}) = L_{hinge}'(y_tx_t^Tw^{(t-1)}) \\cdot y_tx_t = -1 y_tx_t[/math] So the update is [math]w^{t} := w^{t-1} + y_tx_t[/math] ",

The intuition behind this is as follows. The perceptron only updates the weight when the output produced is different from the target labels. Therefore, if the label is -1 and the output is also -1, the loss for this data is zero. However, if the label and output are different, then the loss function will return 1. ",
