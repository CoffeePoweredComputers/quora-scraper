            "answer_text": "V P Q R S are sitting in a line So there are five seats _1_ _2_ _3_ _4_ _5_ We will divide our question in small bits. Bit 1: P is third to extreme right end ( Means if you see the seats, P is sitting at third seat from right i.e. in the middle) __ __ P __ __ Bit 2: V is second to left of P ( Means Two seats to left of P i.e. First position) V __ P __ __ Bit 3: Q is to right of P. V __ P Q __ Bit 4: R is third to right of S. ( Means S must be at second position after V so that R can be at last position i.e third right of S) Finally the correct seating order is : V S P Q R The immediate neighbor of V is S. P is sitting in middle. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 5 people. P is 3rd to the right end. That itself is enough to know P is 3rd and hence in the middle We could also solve for other positions V is second to the left of P So, V is in 1st position from left Q is to the right of P. Hence Q is in 4th position from left R is third to the right of S. Only vacant positions are 2nd and 5th. So S is 2nd and R is 5th. So their position from left to right is VSPQR Answer is P in the middle ",
