            "answer_text": "Today tunnel boring is much different than even 10 years ago. Today various types of Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) are used to excavate tunnels through a variety of soil types ranging from soft mud to hard rock. The most complicated tunnels are those that go through a variety of soil types with large fracture zones in between. Huge technology advances have benefited TBMs. For example, 10 years ago a 20\u2032 diameter tunnel for a subway would expect to result in 3 to 4 inches of settlement at the surface. New tunnel methods and grout technology have reduced settlement to imperceptible levels. A TBM excavates the soil with a giant cutting disk. Various methods are used to remove this excavated soil. Then robotic arms place large precast concrete segments to form the inside of the tunnel. The TBM then pushes on these concrete segments to move forward. The TBM and trailing (supporting) gear are often 300 feet long or longer. Conceptually tunneling is pretty simple. Technically and logistically it is complicated. You can think of a tunnel as a production line that moves. With an automobile production line, the cars (product) moves along the production line. With a TBM, the tunnel walls (the product) are stationary and the production line (TBM) moves. This movement can be many miles long without access shafts. I look forward to additional technological advances. Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cThe Boring Company\u201d will likely bring great technological advances to tunneling. ",

            "answer_text": "A few years back, explosives and different hand tools were used for creating passage underneath the earth surface and through mountains. This method required more time, greater effort and also cause environmental pollution. To overcome these drawbacks, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel introduced tunnel boring machines in the 19th century. Tunnel boring machines are used for creating circular cross-section in the desired diameter by drilling through earth surface. Cutter Head, Grippers, Conveyors, Erector, press frames, etc\u2026. are important parts of tunnel boring machine. The part close to the earth surface is cutter head and breaks rocks and drill the surface to make the required passage. Tunnelling and ring building are the two important phases of tunnel boring. The hydraulics implemented in this machine will push the cutter head forward and once after tunnelling a particular area, the tunnelling process will stop. Then begin the ring building phase and here the pre-build concrete curved segments are placed and locked precisely close to the previous ring and with the last concrete segment. This will provide protection to machine and workers. The mentioned phases will repeat alternatively. ",
