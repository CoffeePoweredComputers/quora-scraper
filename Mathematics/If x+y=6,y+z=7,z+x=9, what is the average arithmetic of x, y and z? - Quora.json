            "answer_text": "You certainly don\u2019t have to do this, as Mohtashim\u2019s answer has proven, but you could solve the system of equations for the values of x, y, and z, and simply take the average of those values. For example, if we add the first two equations, we get: x + y + y + z = 13 We already know that x + z = 9, so we can substitute to yield: 2y + 9 = 13 2y = 4 y = 2 Now that we know the value of y, we can return to: x + y = 6 By substitution we have: x + 2 = 6 x = 4 By the same process we can solve either of the equations for z by substituting the value of either x or y. y + z = 7 2 + z = 7 z = 5 Now that we know that x = 4, y = 2, and z = 5, we can sum their values and divide by 3 to get their average. 4 + 2 + 5 = 11 11 divides by 3 is 11/3, or approximately 3.67.
