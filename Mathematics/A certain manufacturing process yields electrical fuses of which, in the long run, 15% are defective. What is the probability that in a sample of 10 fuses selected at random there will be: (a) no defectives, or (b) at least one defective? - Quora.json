If his/her answer seems too precise to you, let me explain: Probability that a fuse is intact is 0.85 and that it is damaged is 0.15 . We have no issues on that right? Now , for no defectives, we need to be sure that : The first one is not defective and the second one is not defective and the third one is not defective and\u2026.and the 10th one is not defective. Which gives the probability of 0.85*0.85*0.85*\u2026.*0.85 = (0.85)^10. Probability that atleast one is defective : 1 - (0.85)^10 ",
