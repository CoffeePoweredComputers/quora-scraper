            "answer_text": "Hi! I feel your pain. I too have an IQ of 165 and I have always been awful at math. For that matter, I never felt that I was really experiencing anything too terribly exceptional other than that most things came very easily for me. On the other hand, things really have become interesting over the last 10 years. I don\u2019t mean to highjack your thread here, but I\u2019m telling this story for a reason. I had an extremely traumatic childhood beginning at age 9, when my parents started things off with divorce. They were prominent people and progressive so they trundled us kids, I was the youngest, off to a Stanford PhD for testing to see how we would stand up to what at that time was a pretty rare thing. My family was over educated with my maternal grandmother setting the bar: she received her PhD in philosophy from Cornell at 22 as a Sage Scholar (after her BA at age 18). Not bad for a woman born in 1890. I went through a lot of testing and the psychologist, a peculiar looking woman with a distinct mustache and slightly crosseyed, I swear, you really can't make this stuff up, got pretty excited. Before you could say Stanford-Binet, the rest of the kids were ushered out of the office (okay, after about a week) and I was left in an awkward situation with a LOT of testing and the assurance that in life I could do or become whatever I wanted. I relate that so you know my bona fides. Unfortunately, thereafter a truly astounding sequence of bad events left on the street in Berkeley during the counter culture era of the late 1960\u2019s. I had stopped doing homework in 4th grade and became truant and dropped out of high school. My parents were institutionalized. The good news is that intelligence lets you survive just about anywhere. Being quick witted means you are generally pretty entertaining with a sense of humor. I joined the enlisted ranks of the army during Viet Nam. They offered to send me to preparation academy and West Point. I declined. I matured late and didn\u2019t even shave when I enlisted on my 18th birthday. When I was discharged I used the GI bill and went to a junior college. After 2 years I was offered admittance to every university to which I applied. When i got my degree, I was offered admittance to every law school to which I applied. ( The LSAT that year was a surprise as the first and only time they included a section of math-I wasn't expecting that) Law was my math work around. Here\u2019s the thing though, I probably would have been fine if I worked at math, but everything else was so easy by comparison. Someone here took a shot at defining intelligence. Let me tell you what it really is: pattern recognition. And just as important, recognizing what isn\u2019t a pattern even though it may appear to be. Sounds a lot like math, doesn\u2019t it? I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail when I retired 10 years ago and everything changed. I had a lot of time to think. With all that time and so many miles, my mind sifted though the knowledge that I had accumulated and constant insights and occasional epiphanies occurred. It began in earnest after a week. For the last 10 years since, I\u2019ve been seriously reading. Although I enjoy literature, I concentrate on nonfiction beginning with cosmology, through anthropology, genetics, linguistics, the pleistocene, the paleolithic, the neolithic, the bronze age, ancient civilizations, philosophy, etc.; besides, there\u2019s not enough worthwhile literature available when you reach my age. I have attained what I consider to be a good understanding of the world and the meaning of life. In fact, I suspect that I have greater understanding without math, as contradictory as that sounds. Man brings to the table an individually variable skill set based on our genetic diversity. Evolutionarily, we are still by and large hunter gatherers predominately governed by emotions and designed to exploit the environment in a tribal societal context. Understanding life is based on understanding how nature, society, reasoning, is based on the principal of feed back in deterring out comes. All without math. Mark Twain said that he never let his schooling interfere with his education. Coupled with this is that people don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t mistake an education as being learning a lot about a single subject or area. Specialization limits knowledge and true understanding. Everything is interconnected. To be \u2018specialized\u2019 is to know only a little about the greater whole. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not the kind of a question someone with an IQ 165 typically asks. What IQ test did you take? When did you take it? How old were you the time the test was taken? Who gave the test? Lets us consider the basic parts of an IQ test: (1) Verbal Intelligence (2) Mathematical Ability (3) Spatial Reasoning Skills (4) Visual/Perceptual Skills (5) Classification Skills (6) Logical Reasoning Skills (7) Pattern Recognition Skills Well, math has strong relationships with logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and spacial reasoning. So, if you are really bad at math, then you are highly unlikely to be very good at logical reasoning, pattern recognition, or spacial reasoning. That would mean ~14.2857% of your IQ test would be bad, ~42.8571% would be mediocre and the last ~42.8571% would have to be so outstanding that it gave you an IQ of 165. So, something doesn\u2019t add up. Granted that when I took an IQ test back in the 1970s I only ranked 144 which is far less than 165, I scored best in logical reasoning, mathematical ability, spatial reasoning and pattern recognition. Verbal intelligence is where I did the worst. Of course, since IQ is based off age and now I\u2019m old, I am not sure I want to take an IQ test again. Let\u2019s see, dividing the score by 2,489 years\u2026 , just kidding, I am not that old. Now, there are many forms of intelligence and IQ tests really don\u2019t capture all those forms. People can be quite brilliant in some areas while being rather dumb in others. Intelligence is a very complicated thing we are still working hard to learn how to fully understand and engineer it. ",
