            "answer_text": "This is fairly easy. Here is an explanation, illustrated with the example of how we would find the number of factors of 360. First step: Break the number into its prime decomposition. 360 = (2^3)(3^2)(5^1)=8*9*5 Second step: List the powers (exponents) of the various primes in the decomposition. In this example, the powers (as shown in the first step) are 3, 2, and 1. Third step: Add 1 to each of the powers listed in the second step. In this example, this gives (3+1), (2+1), and (1+1), or 4, 3, and 2. Fourth/final step: Multiply together the numbers from the third step. This gives you the total number of factors. In this example, 4*3*2=24, meaning that there are 24 distinct factors of 360. The process is actually so easy that you might wonder if it really works. So lets verify the process by listing all the actual factors of 360 to see if there are really 24 of them. Here are the 12 pairs of factors, totaling 24 in all. 1, 360 2, 180 3, 120 4, 90 5, 72 6, 60 8, 45 9, 40 10, 36 12, 30 15, 24 18, 20 Practice on a few other examples and you may never forget this simple method of calculation.
