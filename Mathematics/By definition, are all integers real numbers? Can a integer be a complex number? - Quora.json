            "answer_text": "You can think of the domains of numbers under discussion here as being arranged in concentric circles. The innermost circle contains the integers, 0, 1, 2\u2026 and -1, -2\u2026 The next circle contains the rational numbers, numbers that can be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers with no common divisor. Integers are rational numbers where q = 1. Next circle up contains the real numbers. Ever rational number is real, every integer is rational and therefore real. Outermost, at least for the purpose of this discussion, are complex numbers, numbers of the form x + iy, where x and y are real and 'i' is the imaginary unit. Real numbers are complex numbers where y is equal to zero. So all integers are real numbers and complex numbers. An integer is a complex number x + iy, where x is an integer and y is zero. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition, are all integers real numbers? Can a integer be a complex number? I would not say \u201cby definition\u201d for this. Normally, the the integers are identified with a certain subset of the real numbers, namely {\u2026 -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026}. Once this identification is made (often tacitly) then yes, the integers are real numbers. Similarly the real numbers can be identified with the complex numbers with imaginary part zero, e.g. the integer 5 is the complex number 5 + 0i. Once this identification is made (often tacitly) the real numbers, and hence also the integers, are complex numbers. ",
