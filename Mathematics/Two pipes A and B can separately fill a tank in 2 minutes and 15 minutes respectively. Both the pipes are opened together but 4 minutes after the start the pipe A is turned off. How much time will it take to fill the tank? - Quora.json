            "answer_text": "Pipe A alone fills the tank in 2 minutes, so 4 minutes after the start, the tank is already full and overflowing. Hence there is no more time required to fill the tank. In reality, the tank will be filled in less than 2 minutes because a second tap, tap B, is also opened. Let V be the volume of the tank. Then for every second, tap A pours in V/120, because it takes 120 seconds to fill the tank. Similarly, tap B will pour in V/900 every second. Therefore if the two taps are opened, they fill the tank at a rate of (V/120 + V/900) per second. That is V(1/120 + 1/900) or V(102/10800). So if this is the fraction of the tank filled every second, then the number of seconds to fill the tank is 10800/102. That is 105 88 seconds or 1 minute 45.88 seconds. ",
