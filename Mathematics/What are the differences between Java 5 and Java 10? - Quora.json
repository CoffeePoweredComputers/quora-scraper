            "answer_text": "The differences between Java 5 and Java 10 are really just too much to list here. For one, Java 5 reached the End Of Service Life (EOSL) in November of 2009 and is no longer supported. Hopefully no one is still using that version. If you want to choose one of the later versions between 6 and 10, 8 stands out as being a significant change with the introduction of Streams and Lambda Expressions. I would suggest if not sure which version to use for devleopment, I would recommend Java 8 (JDK), assuming your platform is running Java 8 runtime. ",
