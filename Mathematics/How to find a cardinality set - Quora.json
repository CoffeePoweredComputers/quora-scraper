If your set is finite, just count its elements :) If it is infinite\u2026 well, it depends on the way it was constructed. One useful fact is that the union of a countable collection of countable sets is countable. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is difficult to answer in general unless you are presented an especially simple example. For example, let F be the set formed by the union as n goes from 3 to infinity of integer triples (x,y,z) such that x^n + y^n - z^n = 0. Finding the cardinality (with proof) of F took a few centuries. ",
