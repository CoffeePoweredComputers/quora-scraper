            "answer_text": "Two three-digit numbers can not add more than 999 + 999 = 1998 We take for 'a' the value of 1: a = 1 We take for 'd' the value of 8: d = 8 For 'c' we can take values \u200b\u200bfrom 0 to 9 If we take the value 9, then cdc = 989 Then abc + cdc = 1b9 + 989 = 1b98 We have a = 1, c = 9, d = 8, b =? We lack 'b'. What is the value of 'b' if 1b9 + 989 = 1b98? If we take b = 9, then 199 + 989 = 1188: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 8, then 189 + 989 = 1178: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 7, then 179 + 989 = 1168: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 6, then 169 + 989 = 1158: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 5, then 159 + 989 = 1148: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 4, then 149 + 989 = 1138: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 3, then 139 + 989 = 1128: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 2, then 129 + 989 = 1118: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 1, then 119 + 989 = 1108: (does not end in 98) If we take b = 0, then 109 + 989 = 1098: (yes it ends in 98) So if abcd = 1b98, only if we take b = 0 would it be congruent, since none of the addends where b \u2260 0 gives result 98 in its last two digits, except in the case of b = 0. Then the numbers a, b, c and d would be: a = 1 b = 0 c = 9 d = 8 The number in question: 1098 ",
