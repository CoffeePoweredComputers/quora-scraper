            "answer_text": "The basic formula for your WIP manufacturing is as follows: WIP = WIP inventory at beginning of period + WIP purchased during the period \u2013 WIP inventory at end of period + Labor Costs + Manufacturing Overheads Here we have a table that shows the WIP costs over June (in the context of a bicycle manufacturer). This takes care of the first part of our equation before we get to labor costs and manufacturing overheads.  Each assembly item is being calculated separately to give the total WIP costs at the end of the month. If we zone in on handlebars, for example, we can see that the business started with $323 worth of handlebars in June and ended up with $212 worth at the end of the period. Within this period $543 worth of handlebar material was purchased, and presumably, much of it used in production. 323 + 543 \u2013 212 = $654 And once the calculation is done for all the assembly items, we can add them all up to give our total material cost. Here it came to $1964. Now we just must add on the labor costs and manufacturing overheads. For labor costs, we are considering any labor that is having a direct effect on production. These could be your workers, engineers, and welders or whoever is involved in assembling parts on the production floor. It\u2019s important to make a distinction between indirect and direct labor costs because indirect labor costs will be accounted for in your manufacturing overheads. Manufacturing overhead costs include:Indirect labor (such as security and cleaning personnel);Indirect materials (glues, tapes, repair parts, etc);Utilities (rent, water, gas, electricity, etc); andDepreciation (on equipment and machines).So, let\u2019s fast-forward our calculations and say that our total labor costs came to $1650 for June, whilst manufacturing overheads came to $750. Of course, your business accountant will be very happy if your numbers ever come out this round. But anyway, now we can use our formula and bring all the pieces together. WIP = WIP inventory at beginning of period + WIP purchased during the period \u2013 WIP inventory at end of period + Labor Costs + Manufacturing Overheads Therefore: WIP = 1964 + 1650 + 750 = $4364 If you want to read more into WIP inventory, be sure to check out How to Calculate and Reduce Your WIP Manufacturing Costs.

            "answer_text": "Depends on the type of inventory you want to display. Is it a Supermarket? A Kanban? a JIT inventory or just a Localized inventory based on Demand? The typical inventory companies use for WIP in production, manufacturing, industrial plants is a Supermarket. Most places do not call it a Supermarket. Because with SM\u2019s there is an actual process in creating one and it has its own set of parameters. Usually, the production is planned and that automatically builds they WIP through a backflush and companies just track the locations of WIP as it is processed through the system. To determine a standard Supermarket (This can used for starting a Kanban as well) Find Safety Stock: Standard Deviation (STDEV) * Service Level - If you need help with these, use Khan Academy for an easy explanation) Minimum Stock (MIN) - Lead time + Safety Stock Maximum (MAX) - MIN + (MIN/2) ",
