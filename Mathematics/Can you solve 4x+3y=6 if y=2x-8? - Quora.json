            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026 if you have two variables, you need two equations to solve it. Just as if you have three variables you need three variables to solve it. Now the way you have it set up will work. You can just substitute y for 2x-8 in the first question and solve for x. Once you have x you can plug that value in for x in the second equation and solve for y. However there is another way that is a bit easier some of the time. 4x+3y = 6 2x-y=8 (I just rearranged the equation so that it can have this form. This is valid and equal to the second equation you gave me. I just subtracted y from both sides and then added 8 to both sides. Now I can make adjustments to any equation as long as I make the same adjusts to both sides. So for the second equation i am going to multiply both sides by 2. 4x-2y=16 (this is the exact same equation as the second) Now notice what I can do. I can subtract my first equation with this equation. Doing so gives me 5y = -10. Dividing both sides by 5 I have y = -2. Now I COULD plug y into my equation. But guess what. I could do the same thing in trying to get y. Just change the 2nd equation by multiplying by 3. 6x-3y=24. I can do the same thing but now it is better to add. Add the first equation to this equation together and get. 10x = 30. Solve for x and get 3. I often times find this easier to work out than just solving for the variable. However this doesn\u2019t always work out cleanly. Take the following two equations. 5x+3y=7 17x+11y=2 Here the numbers really don\u2019t work out well to multiply them. Here it is better to just solve for y in the first equation then substitute for y into the second equation. ",

            "answer_text": "4x + 3y = 6. Given that y = 2x - 8, substitute 2x -8 for y in the first equation. This gives: 4x + 3(2x - 8) = 6. We have eliminated y so we can now find x. The next step is to simplify the equation 4x + 3(2x - 8) = 6, this becomes 4x + 6x - 24 = 6, which then becomes 10x - 24 = 6. Now add 24 to both sides of 10x - 24 = 6. This results in: 10x = 30. Divide both sides by 10, this produces the result that x = 3. At this point we have found one of the two unknown values, x and y. To find y, look back to the first equation in the first line, that is 4x + 3y = 6. We know that x= 3 (See the end of the second line). So substituting 3 for x in 4x + 3y = 6 gives us 12 + 3y = 6. Subtract 12 from both sides and the result is: 3y = -6. Divide both sides by 3. This reveals that y = - 2. The answer is that x = 3, and y = - 2. ",
