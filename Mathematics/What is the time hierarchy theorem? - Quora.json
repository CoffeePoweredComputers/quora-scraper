If  is  then the limit of  goes to zero, as  goes to infinity. See What is the difference between big O notation and little o notation in asymptotic notations? \u201c is a proper subset of \u201d means that there is at least one element in  that is not in . A \u201ctime-computable\u201d function just means that  can be computed in time , when  is given in unary. This omits uncomputable functions, as well as functions like , which aren\u2019t the upper bound of any Turing machine. (A machine which runs in time  could not even finish reading its input.) So, the theorem says that given some reasonably-behaved function , there are decision problems which take time , and not some lower time complexity. It guarantees the existence of \u201chard\u201d decision problems for any such . For example, if , then the theorem says  We can then replace  by anything which is asymptotically slower-growing, such as  or  or . Dividing by the logarithm gives an order of growth that is \u201cinfinitesimally\u201d smaller than . So, while we don\u2019t know very many lower bounds for specific problem, we do know that there are decision problems \u201cout there\u201d that require time  but no smaller, or , or . There aren\u2019t any gaps (among time-computable functions) where we can write a time bound but no decision problem exists that occupies that time bound (at least, not more than a logarithm-sized gap.)
