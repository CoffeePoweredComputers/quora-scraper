            "answer_text": "What am I reading? You literally defined them yourself\u2026 A proper subset cannot be equal to a set it is derived from, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be a proper subset, it would just be a subset. A proper subset is defined as a set; for example {3,5}; that is part, not whole, of another set; for example {6,3,5,7,2} Similarly, a subset can be the set itself, it doesn\u2019t have to be just a part, but it can be\u2026 only a proper subset cannot be the original set. Now then\u2026 to answer your question literally\u2026 Is it possible? yes is it always? No Because according to the question, you are assuming {2,1} =/= {4,7} therefore {2,1} c {4,7} which is not true at all. (I can\u2019t remember which sign is which for proper subset vs subset, so if I\u2019m wrong in the sign, I meant \u201csubset\u201d) Lastly, let me define \u201cequal\u201d to you, because you might be confused\u2026 when two sets are equal, they have exactly the same items in its set. Order does not matter in a set, so {3,6,4} = {4,3,6} equality denotes subsets\u2026 but not proper subsets. If I could shove some English down your throat too, there\u2019s a reason the word \u201cproper\u201d is in the name. ",
