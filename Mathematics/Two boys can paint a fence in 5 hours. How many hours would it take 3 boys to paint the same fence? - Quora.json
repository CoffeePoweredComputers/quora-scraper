            "answer_text": "3 teenage boys who knew each other well? 8+ hours. The extra buddy would cause them to find reasons to paint blindfolded, or take more breaks and look \u2018hot\u2019 when a pretty girl or three walk by. They may run out of water/snacks and have to call for \u2018aid\u2019 from mom/dad/cousin, etc. Then they\u2019ll find a good joke, and find numerous ways to extend it. Fart jokes, pee jokes, girl jokes, guy jokes. Somebody\u2019ll mention video games, sports, or TV shows. Uh oh. A few hours later they\u2019ll look at the fence and finish things up quickly. Tip: Don\u2019t pay by the hour. Don\u2019t pay until after quality review of the product in daylight and not evening nor night. Rule of thumb is more teen boyz in the hood don\u2019t necessarily scale for more efficient work. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Typically, all these type of word problems are solved the same way. First find how long it takes for one entity (boy in this case) to do the job without any help. What is it? 2.5 hours, 5 hours, or 10 hours? Then figure out how much of the job is done by our one boy in one unit of time (in this case one hour) Is it 2/5th of the job, 1/5th of the job, or 1/10th of the job? Use the time it takes to do part of the job to work your way to the answer. Good luck! ",
