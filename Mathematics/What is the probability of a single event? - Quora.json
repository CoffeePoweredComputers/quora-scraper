            "answer_text": "The probability of an event is equal to the number of possible outcomes in which that event occurs divided by the number of total possible outcomes. For example, lets look at the probability of drawing a card from a deck and getting a seven. [math]P(7)=\\frac{favourable outcomes}{total outcomes}[/math] Since there are four sevens in a sack of cards we know that there are four different cards we could pick (or outcomes that could occur) in which the event would be satisfied. We call this a favourable outcome. Since there are fifty-two cards in the deck, we say there are a total of fifty-two possible outcomes, since it's possible for any one of those cards to be chosen at random from the deck. So [math]P(7)=\\frac{4}{52}=\\frac{1}{13}[/math] This means that if we randomly pulled a card from the deck, looked at it, and replaced it, and did that fifty-two times, we could expect to get a seven around four times.
