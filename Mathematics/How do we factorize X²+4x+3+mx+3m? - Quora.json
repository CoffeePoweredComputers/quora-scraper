            "answer_text": "Well, try using quadratic formula to factor [math]x^2+4x+3 [/math]to get [math](x+1)(x+3)[/math]. Then, [math]x^2+4x+3+mx+3m = (x+1)(x+3)+m(x+3)[/math]. Now, since [math](x+3)[/math] is the common between two terms, thus it equals [math](x+3)(x+1+m)[/math]. Now, the factors of this equation is [math]x=-3[/math] or [math]x=-m-1[/math]. ",
