            "answer_text": "Many Computer Science Departments offer courses in Algorithms and Complexity. Several will also offer courses in Computational Game Theory if the faculty have the capacity to teach that. Otherwise, there may also be scope to take Game Theory classes from the Mathematics or Economics Departments as an \u2018outside option\u2019. I think a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science may be your best bet. original question: What Bachelor degrees will include Game Theory and Complexity Theory? ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on which university one attends, you may find these addressed in the economics curriculum.   Game theory is a topic in economics, and complexity theory is used in some economic research.  And one would need a pretty decent mathematics background to do work in these areas.  (So perhaps another approach would be to major in math, and minor or take courses in economics.) ",
