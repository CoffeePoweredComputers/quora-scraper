            "answer_text": "1. Recognize that your brain is the most powerful supercomputer ever invented. It will generate answers to any question you ask it, and it will unhesitatingly implement any command you give it. Your brain is programmed by the words you think or say out loud. So, if you tell your brain \"I suck at math\", it will believe you and behave accordingly. However, if you ask it questions like, \"How can I enjoy the process of getting better at math?\", it will generate numerous answers. So first thing, stop running the script \"I suck at math\"; it's like shooting yourself in the foot if you really want to get better. 2. Recognize that it's not your fault that you think you are bad at math, it's the fault of a poorly designed education system, and possibly well-meaning but uninformed parents who mistakenly believe that you are growing up in the same world that they did and that you should be held to the same standards and expectations that they were (hint: you're not, and you shouldn't). Math is an innate human ability that all people have, and like any other skill it can be improved with practice. It doesn't make any logical sense to say that an acorn is \"bad\" at being an oak tree, and it doesn't make any sense to say that a student who has not yet developed their math skills to a high degree is \"bad\" at math either. 3. Spend more time practicing. If you're not getting the results you want, you obviously have to do something differently, and this is one option. Khan Academy has excellent free self-study resources for preparing for the SAT, as does Varsity Tutors: Learning Tools - Varsity Tutors 4. Improve the quality of your practice. This is how you get better results without increasing the time spent. The best way to do this is to hire a professional tutor or academic coach, who will not only make learning the material much faster and easier, but also help you improve your process so that you will be able to learn more efficiently on your own as well.

            "answer_text": "We mainly use the ACT in my state, so I can only speak about it from that point of view. When you take your test, you score on a scale of 1 to 36 which shows your proficiency. There is no passing, but the better you do, the more favorable your options for college will be. If you are asking how you can get better at math, then the only answer is to study basics of math taught in high school. If you understand them, then that will determine how well you do. If you do not understand the math then the pressure will make a difference in your score. This is why I am not an advocate of those who want to study specifically for a certain test like the ACT. I would much rather be judged on how well I do on the topic, so that I am placed at a level for which I have the most comfort, so that it can facilitate future learning. ",
