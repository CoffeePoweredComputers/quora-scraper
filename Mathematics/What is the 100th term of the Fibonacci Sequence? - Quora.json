            "answer_text": "The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),And the 5 is (2+3),and so on!Similarly we have to calculate the 100th term so for this we have a rule we can write the rule: The Rule is Xn=Xn-1+Xn-2 where: xn is term number \"n\"xn-1 is the previous term (n-1)xn-2 is the term before that (n-2)Here n=100 So we can write the rule as X100=X100-1+X100-2 = X99+X98 =135301852344706746049+218922995834555169026 =354224848179261915075 So this is the 100th term of Fibonacci Sequence ",

            "answer_text": "There is an explicit formula for the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence. It is[((1+\u221a5)/2)\u207f - ((1-\u221a5)/2)\u207f]/\u221a5.Since |(1-\u221a5)/2| < 1, ((1-\u221a5)/2)\u207f is very small if n is at all large. So you can simply take the integer closest to ((1+\u221a5)/2)\u207f/\u221a5.The 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is thus very nearly ((1+\u221a5)/2)^100/\u221a5, which any good calculator will tell you is almost exactly 354224848179261915075.
