            "answer_text": "E is between A and F. When placing B between D and C, TWO possibilities are there. B being in middle of D and C in CLOCKWISE direction, or ANTICLOCKWISE direction. Once you select an option, say anticlockwise, then place E and A in anticlockwise position ( only option left, with first assumption), then last placing of F comes on LEFT of D. (here \u2018left\u2019 meaning in anticlockwise next to D), which is against given data. Hence you rearrange D, B, C in clockwise direction, fill in the remaining letters and you get E in middle of A and F. ",
