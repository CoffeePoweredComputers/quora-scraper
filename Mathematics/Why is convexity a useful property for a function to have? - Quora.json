            "answer_text": "Adding onto Fred Richardson's answer: Here's a dumbed down version of convexity (how I first understood convexity) and why it is good to have that property when we're doing optimization. Here's an visualization of a convex function: Convex:  In this figure you can clearly find a minimum.. as other answers here say.. any minimum you find is your global minimum. Not convex:  As you can see in this figure.. if you optimize this function.. you cannot be sure that you've correctly found the global minimum. So in our example above.. if you hit the minimum on the right (shown) you're in a local minimum, but if you hit the minimum on the left you're in global minimum. And in such cases where you start matters... Source & Pic. Courtesy: Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course ",
