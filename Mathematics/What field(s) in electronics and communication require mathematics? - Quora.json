            "answer_text": "Basic of knowledge of maths is required in every semester .There are many places where one need to solve mathematical equations to understand .Let me give you a systematic answer. The subject which require mathematics application are 1.Digital Signal Processing: This is one of the toughest paper in ECE stream.If you are comfortable with maths,you will find DSP very easy , like i find it . Those who struggle in maths are bound to struggle in DSP. 2.Systems and Signals : This paper also requires sound knowledge of mathematical principles .Although easy than DSP but still you need to have a through knowledge of transforms ( you will study in second sem maths ) 3. Electromagnetic Theory: A sound knowledge of curls , application of derivatives, various theorems which are taught is required to clear this with satisfactorily grades. 4.Image processing : To excel in image processing you need to able to play with various equations . 5. Semiconductor Devices :This is a paper where one can only understand the behavior of semiconductor devices if and if only one is able to do use mathematical skills to an extensive use . There are many other paper which require maths knowledge . Maths is engineer\u2019s tool .Don\u2019t be afraid of it .Enjoy it .Read standard maths book .Maths is fun !! Trust me . ",

            "answer_text": "The average knowledge of maths is enough to survive. In 1st year it self only you have a subject related to complete maths that are M1 and MM. For these subjects i am telling you if you done good at intermediate maths thats so much adiquate to you.so you dont worry about maths. Coming to the other subjects related to maths I\u00f1tigration and differentiation plays important role in these subjects.if you don't have that much of goodness in these two fields don't get scared. You can learn in 1st year it self then you can play your own game with that my friend. If you konow basics of mathematics it's not a matter to choose electronics. ",
