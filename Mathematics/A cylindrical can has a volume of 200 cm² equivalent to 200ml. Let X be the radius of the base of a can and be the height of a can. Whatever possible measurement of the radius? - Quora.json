            "answer_text": "First of all, I assume you mean cm^3; that is cubed, not squared. Then the area of the base of the can is x^2pi The volume then is x^3p1=200 or x^3=200/pi my calculator gave pi as 3.1415926536 and ended it there; I realize it will go on forever. 200/pi then is 63.6619772368 (again could go on forever) therefore x, the radius and the height is just under 4, since 4^3 is 64. A more precise one has it as just under 3.993. Darn, I\u2019m doing your homework again. ",
