            "answer_text": "There are Many ways to solve this but i try to give less complex by taking suitable variable values. Let total volume of tank be (Lcm of 18 and 24) Ltrso total volume be 72 ltr so volume filled by tap a in 1 minute= 72/18 = 4 ltrvolume filled by tap b in 1 min = 72/24 = 3 ltr Now tap a is kept open for 12 mins and tap b is kept open for x mins ( x<12)and the tank is filled. so 12*4 + x*3 = 72ltr\u21923x = 72\u201348\u2192x= 24/3 = 8mins So tap b should be closed after 8th min and tap a should be open for 12 mins to fill the tank hope it helped.:) ",

            "answer_text": "If both pipes work together total time to fill the tank will be calculated as below. 1/18+ 1/24 part in 1minute 7/72 part in 1 minute 72/ 7 minutes will be taken if both pipes work together. Now pipe is to be filled in 12 minutes & not in 72/ 7 minutes A can fill 1/24 part in 1 minute Let both work for t minuutes.Then Tank filled is 7t/ 72part Remaining part is 1\u20137t/72= (72\u20137t)/72 Remaining time is 12-t A can fill 1/24 part in 1 minute So in 12\u2014t minute it will fill (12\u2014t)/24 part So (12\u2014t)/24= (72\u20137t)/72 36\u20133t= 72\u20137t 4t= 36 t = 9 minutes. Both will work together for 9 minutes & then B will be closed to fill the remaining part in 3 minutes by A. B to be closed after 9 minutes. Check.answer as below. 7t/72 part is 7*9/72= 63/72 part in 9 minutes by both together. Then B closed. A fills 3/24 part in 3 minutes. Total part filled then will be 63/72+ 3/24= 72/72 = 1 full part.

            "answer_text": "Solution of the given problem is shown below, Let V denotes the total capacity of the given tank.It is mentioned that(i) Two pipes A & B can completely fill total capacity V of the tank in 18 and 24 minutes respectively. Hence,(ii) Pipes A & B alone in 1 min can fill the tank up to fractional amounts V/18 & V/24 respectively.(iii) Both pipes A & B are opened simultaneously and then let T denotes the time (in min) after which pipe B will be needed to close to fill the tank completely in 12 minutes.Hence from (ii) & (iii) we get following relation,T*(V/18 + V/24 ) + (12 - T)*V/18 = Vor T/24 = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 or T = 24/3 = 8 (min) [Ans]",

Hence in 12 minutes, pipe a can fill = 12*1/18= 2/3 rd part. Hence remaining = 1\u20132/3= 1/3rd part to be filled by pipe b. Time taken to fill 1/3 rd part by pipe b = (1/3)/(1/24)=24/3=8 minutes. Thus pipe b should be closed after 8 minutes if the tank to be filled completely in 12 minutes. HTH ",
