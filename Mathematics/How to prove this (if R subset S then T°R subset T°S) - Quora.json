This means exactly that some yy exists such that: (x,y)\u2208R\u00a0and\u00a0(y,z)\u2208T(x,y)\u2208R\u00a0and\u00a0(y,z)\u2208T Then because R\u2286SR\u2286S we can conclude: (x,y)\u2208S\u00a0and\u00a0(y,z)\u2208T(x,y)\u2208S\u00a0and\u00a0(y,z)\u2208T which means exactly that: (x,z)\u2208T\u2218S(x,z)\u2208T\u2218S Proved is now that R\u2286SR\u2286S implies that T\u2218R\u2286T\u2218ST\u2218R\u2286T\u2218S.
