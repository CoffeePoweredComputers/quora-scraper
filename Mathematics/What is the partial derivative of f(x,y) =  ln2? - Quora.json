            "answer_text": "Yes it will be zero in both cases because f is not varying for any change in the values of either x or y. In other words, f(x,y) is a CONSTANT function. You can look at it this way to grasp the logic:Basically the derivative of any function gives us an idea about how the function behaves depending on the values taken by the variables(In this case x&y). The partial derivative of a multi-variable function indicates how the function behaves when the value of only one of the variables changes keeping the other variable constant.In the above case, the behaviour of the function f is not affected by the values assumed by both the variables x and y. Thus we can say that the partial derivative of f wrt. both x and y is 0 ",
