            "answer_text": "Another approach is to start with a graph: Desmos graph It pretty clearly shows one solution, x \u2248 2.506 If this is not good enough, Newton\u2019s method will quickly refine it from a good starter. I find it better to take the natural log of both sides in such an equation, then f = x\u00b7ln(x) - ln(10) f\u2019 = 1 + ln(x) Iterating x = x-f/f\u2019, two iterations give 10 figures x1 = 2.506 184 149 x2 = 2.506 184 145 My 10 digit calculator can do no better If you don\u2019t have graphing software, a few trial values and bisection will get you off to a good start. Trying 2 and 3, 2 is too small, 3 is too big, and 2.5 is pretty close, at least a good starter. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer is x = 2.5062 SOLUTION Given x^x=10 x^x - 10 = 0 = f(x) Now we have to find f'(x) f'(x) = x^x (1 + log(x))  The solution of x^x =10 can be find using numerical methods. Here I am using Newton\u2019s Method Taking x(0) = 2  Here I did five iterations. For more accurate result more iterations is needed The solution of x^x = 10 is x = 2.5062 ",
