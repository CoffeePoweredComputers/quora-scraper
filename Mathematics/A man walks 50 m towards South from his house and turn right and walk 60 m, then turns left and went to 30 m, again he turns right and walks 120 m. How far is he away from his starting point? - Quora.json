            "answer_text": "Vector 1 = 50 m southward ; vector 2 = 60 m eastward; vector 3 is equal to 30 m southward and vector 4 = 120 eastward. Adding these 4 vectors gives the resultant R as equal to 197 m directed to 336 degrees or 24 degrees from the eastward direction. After the first right turn the person faces east , after the next left turn, he faces south, and finally he faces east after turning right. He is 197 meters from his starting point.  ",
