            "answer_text": "The apple laptops are surely useful for any CA students What's not useful is the Mac Os sierra, as this OS does not support our basic accounting softwares (Tally) and also many government offline tools (GST amd Income tax portals) Now i have an Apple macbook too. I installed the Windows 10 Os officially and enjoy the hardware of Apple and the software of windows. Alos i use Mac OS sierra for various other activities (majorly browsing the web) Apple macbook gives 12 hrs battery life. No other laptop can compare to that. Hope that helps ",
