            "answer_text": "All Casio calculators are allowed in GCSE exams, providing you have no programs stored in the memory. If the case has formulae written inside, you must not take the case into the exam. You are allowed to program your calculator during the exam, if you see that as a good use of your time. It's a GCSE, not rocket science! Just make sure you've had plenty of practice with the same calculator. ",
