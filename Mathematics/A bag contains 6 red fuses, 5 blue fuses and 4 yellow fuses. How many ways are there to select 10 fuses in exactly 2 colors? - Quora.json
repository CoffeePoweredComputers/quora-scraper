            "answer_text": "There are 15 fuses of 3 colours (6 red, 5 blue & 4 yellow). If 10 fuses are selected which are of exactly 2 colours, then there will be 3 combination of colours (i) red & yellow (ii) red & blue and (iii) blue & yellow. But the possible combinations will be red & yellow and red & blue. Combination of blue and yellow is ruled out because total number of fuses of these 2 colours is 9 ( 5 blue & 4 yellow). So, the number of selection of 10 fuses of red & yellow colour is (6 red and 4 blue) 6C6\u22174C4=16C6\u22174C4=1 and selection of 10 fuses of red and blue colours (6 red and 4 blue or 5 red & 5 blue) is 6C6\u22175C4+6C5\u22175C5=5+6=116C6\u22175C4+6C5\u22175C5=5+6=11 Hence, total number of selection of 10 fuses of exactly 2 colours will be 1+11=12.1+11=12. Please see if this solution has any slip. ",
