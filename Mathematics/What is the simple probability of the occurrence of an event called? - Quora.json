            "answer_text": "This would be the marginal probability, since this is the only event we are worried about and it is not conditioned on any other event. Joint probabilities are probabilities of multiple events occurring at the same time. Conditional probabilities are probabilities of an event given that another event already occurred. Bayesian probabilities are special conditional probabilities that can be determined from prior probabilities and a flipped conditional probability. For example if you know  and , you can compute the bayesian probability . ",

If you throw three dice, what are the chances that at least two of them will be the same? For what might be a more scholarly answer to this question, please see the other answer that had already been posted when I wrote this reply. .
