            "answer_text": "I think if a sequence and series approaches a definite value such series and sequence are called convergent otherwise divergent. For example: a sequence is given as 1,1/2,1/3,1/4,\u2026.. up to infinity so by seeing this you can say that its going on decreasing such as\u2026 1,0.5,0.3,\u2026. and you will be cent % sure that it will never became negative. and if this sequence approaches to infinity then this the reusult of this sequence must be approach at zero.Hence it is a definite number so we call that above sequence is convergent.similarly, 1,2,3,4\u2026\u2026 it will not approaches at any fixed number so it is divergent.

            "answer_text": "Converges comes together, Diverges grows apart. In math the sum of a geometric series will converge, approach a limit, if the common ratio less than 1. As an example: 100 + 50 +25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + \u2026 Converges to 200. The formula for the point at which it converges to is: Sn=t1 X (1-r^n)/(1-r). Where n is the sum of all terms, t1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But if the common ratio is greater than 1 then the series will diverge, not approach a limit. As an example: 1 + 1.5 + 2.25 + 3.75 + 5.065 + \u2026 is not bounded by any limit so the sum of this series diverges. ",
