            "answer_text": "-First you must understand what needs to be solved.-In a truth table, you set up a series of variables each identified with a letter or a symbol (A, B, C etc).-Then you write the state of every combination of variable logic Boolean variable, ex. 1 for TRUE, 0 for FALSE.-You determine on the output section where a TRUE or FALSE condition is required.-Then you write the sum of the \u201cminterms\u201d of the outputs which have a TRUE value. If ALL outputs are TRUE, then the system is called a TAUTOLOGY. If ALL FALSE, the it is called a CONTRADICTION.-By using Boolean logic math, you then minimize the minterms to get the simplest form of output the system will have. There are many techniques: Karnaugh maps, digital Boolean equation solvers, de DeMorgan simplification and many more.-Using basic logic gates (ANDs, ORs, NANDs, NORs, NOTs, XORs, XNORs, etc) you construct the circuit. You can also use PLDs and FPGA, and Verilog.-Using the truth table constructed earlier then you TEST the system logic using a breadboard, logic gate ICs, logic switches and LEDs for output indicators (manual-old way\u2026still useful) or by using simulation software like Proteus.
