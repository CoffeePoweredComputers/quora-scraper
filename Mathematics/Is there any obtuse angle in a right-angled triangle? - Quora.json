            "answer_text": "NO\u2026as sum of measure of all angle in a triangle is 180\u00b0. Now, in right angle angled triangle one of the measure is 90\u00b0, so the sum of remaining two side is 90\u00b0. Also, in triangle no angle can be of 0\u00b0. So,we can conclude that, remaining two angle has to be acute angle\u2026it cannot be neither right nor obtuse angle. Thankyou.. ",

            "answer_text": "No. As it is a right angled triangle one of the angle must be 90\u00b0 and since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0 ,the sum of the other two angles must be 90\u00b0. So it can't be possible to an angle go beyond 89\u00b0. ",
