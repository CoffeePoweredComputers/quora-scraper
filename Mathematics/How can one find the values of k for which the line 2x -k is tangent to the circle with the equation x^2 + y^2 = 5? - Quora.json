            "answer_text": "The equation of the given circle, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5,  is in standard form and tells us that the center of the circle is at the origin, i.e., at the point (0, 0), and has a radius of r = \u221a5, and the equation of the given line is y = 2x \u2012 k is the slope-intercept form for the equation of a straight line, i.e., y = mx + b, where slope m = 2 and y-intercept b = \u2012k. As the first step in finding the desired, exact values of \u201ck\u201d for which the given line y = 2x \u2012 k is tangent to the given circle,  we\u2019ll consider the equation of the given circle and solve for y in terms of x as follows: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 y\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 5 y\u00b2 + x\u00b2 \u2012 x\u00b2 = 5 \u2012 x\u00b2 y\u00b2 = 5 \u2012 x\u00b2 Now, taking the square root of both sides, we have: y = \u00b1\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) Consequently, we have: y = \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) , a semicircle, is the half of the given circle above the x-axis, and \u2026 y = \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2), a semicircle,  is the other half of the given circle below the x-axis.  At the point of tangency or intersection, (x, y), between the given circle and the given line,  the circle and the line have a point in common; therefore, at that point, their x-values or coordinates and their y-values or coordinates will be the same, i.e., equal; consequently, we can set the two y-values equal to each other and solve for \u201ck\u201d as follows:  (1.)  For the case of semicircle y = \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2):              y = y  (Equality is reflexive, i.e., for any real number a, a = a) \u221a(5\u2012 x\u00b2) = 2x \u2012 k   \u221a(5\u2012 x\u00b2) + k = 2x \u2012 k + k  \u221a(5\u2012 x\u00b2) + k = 2x + 0 \u221a(5\u2012 x\u00b2) + [\u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2)] + k = 2x + [\u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2)] 0 + k = 2x + [\u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2)]       k = 2x + [\u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2)] k = 2x \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) is the generic value of k for which the given line y = 2x \u2012 k is tangent to the given circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 above the x-axis. (2.)  For the case of the other semicircle: y = \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2):                 y = y (Equality is reflexive, i.e., for any real number a, a = a) \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) = 2x \u2012 k   \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) + k = 2x \u2012 k + k  \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) + k = 2x + 0 \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) + \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) + k = 2x + \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) 0 + k = 2x + \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) k = 2x + \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) is the generic value of k for which the given line y = 2x \u2012 k is tangent to the given circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 below the x-axis.  We now have the two generic values of k:  k = 2x \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) and  k = 2x + \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2). These two generic values of k correctly imply two tangent lines and, consequently, two  points of tangency with the given circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5, i.e.,  we actually have two tangent lines, not just one; however, in order to determine the exact values of \u201ck\u201d,  we have to know the x-coordinates of the two points of tangency since the two generic values of \u201ck\u201d are in terms of the x-coordinates of the points of tangency. We know that the slope of each of the two tangent lines is m = 2 since both are represented by the given equation: y = 2x \u2012 k.  We also know that the slope of a tangent line to a curve is equal to the slope of the curve at the point of tangency (x, y), and the slope of the curve at the point of tangency is equal to the value of its function\u2019s first derivative at that point, i.e., the slope m of  the curve at the point of tangency (x, y) =  dy/dx.   (NOTE:  Even though the given circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 does not represent a function, implicitly it represents two functions, that is, each of its two semicircles: y = \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) and y = \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) explicitly do represent functions!) So,  to find the x-coordinates of the two points of tangency, (x, y), we need to first use implicit differentiation to differentiate the implicit equation of the given circle, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5, with respect to x in order to give us a formula for dy/dx which is equal to the slope of the circle at any point on the circle (except on the x-axis), in particular, at the two points of tangency: Now, differentiate both sides of the equation for the given circle:  x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 with respect to x as follows: d[x\u00b2 + y\u00b2]/dx = d[5]/dx d[x\u00b2]/dx + d[y\u00b2]/dx = d[5]/dx 2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0 2x\u2012 2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0 \u2012 2x [2y(dy/dx)]/2y = (\u2012 2x)/2y dy/dx =  \u2012x/y Now, since our two tangent lines, y = 2x \u2012 k,  have a slope of  m = 2, we now let dy/dx =  \u2012x/y = 2 in order to find the x-coordinates of the two points of tangency where circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 also has a slope of m = 2. dy/dx =  \u2012x/y = 2;  Solving for y, we have: (\u2012x/y)y = (2)y (1/2)(2y) = (\u2012x)(1/2)  (Equality is symmetric, i.e., if a = b, then b = a) y = \u2012x/2  (this equation expresses the relationship between the x- and                    y-coordinates at the points of tangency) Now, substituting y = \u2012x/2 into the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 for y,  and solving for x as follows: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 x\u00b2 + (\u2012x/2)\u00b2 = 5 x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2/4) = 5 (4x\u00b2/4) + (x\u00b2/4) = 5 (5x\u00b2/4)(4) = 5(4) (1/5)(5x\u00b2) = (1/5)(20) x\u00b2 = 4 x = \u00b12 Therefore,   x = -2   and  x = 2  are the x-coordinates of the two points of tangency.  The corresponding y-coordinates are:  For  x = -2  For x = 2 y = -x/2                                    y = -x/2   = -(-2)/2                                  = -(2)/2   = 1                                            = -1Thus, the two points of tangency are: (-2, 1) and (2, -1). Therefore,  the two desired, exact values of \u201ck\u201d for which the two lines y = 2x \u2012 k are tangent to the given circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 are calculated as follows: For  k = 2x \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) ,  which is the generic value of \u201ck\u201d  for which the given line y = 2x \u2012 k is tangent to the given circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 above the x-axis at the point (\u20122, 1), we have: k = 2x \u2012\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2)       = 2(\u20122) \u2012 \u221a[5 \u2012 (\u20122)\u00b2]    = \u20124 \u2012 \u221a[5 \u2012 (4)]    = \u20124 \u2012 \u221a1    = \u20124 \u2012 1 k = \u20125 and ... For k = 2x + \u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2) ,  which is the generic value of \u201ck\u201d  for which the given line y = 2x \u2012 k is tangent to the given circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 below the x-axis at the point (2, \u20121), we have: k = 2x +\u221a(5 \u2012 x\u00b2)       = 2(2) + \u221a[5 \u2012 (2)\u00b2]    = 4 + \u221a[5 \u2012 (4)]    = 4 + \u221a1    = 4 + 1 k = 5 Note:  The two parallel lines\u00b9 that are of the form y = 2x \u2012 k and that are tangent to the given circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5 are: (1.)  y = 2x \u2012 k        y = 2x \u2012 (\u20125)       y = 2x + 5 intersects the given circle at the point of tangency (\u20122, 1),     and \u2026 (2.)  y = 2x \u2012 k        y = 2x \u2012 (5)       y = 2x \u2012 5   intersects the given circle at the point of tangency (2, \u20121). \u00b9 The two tangent lines y = 2x + 5 and y = 2x \u2012 5 are parallel to each other because they have equal slopes, i.e., m = 2.

            "answer_text": "This is quite a simple but pretty problem. We want to find all of the points on a circle of radius [math]\\sqrt5[/math] centered at the origin where the slope of the tangent line is 2, and from there, we can plug that point on the circle into the equation [math]y = 2x-k[/math] and solve for [math]k[/math]. Since every point on a circle has a tangent line perpendicular to the radius, the slope of the tangent line is just the negative reciprocal of the slope of the radius at that point. Remember that slope is just [math]\\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}[/math] and our circle is centered at the origin, so the change in [math]y[/math] and [math]x[/math] will just be the x and y values themselves. [math]m_{\\text{radius}}=\\dfrac{y}{x}[/math] And since the tangent line is perpendicular\u2026 [math]m_{\\text{tangent}} = \\dfrac{-x}{y}[/math] So we just want all points on the circle [math]x^2+y^2=5[/math] that satisfy [math]\\dfrac{-x}{y} = 2[/math] Isolating [math]x[/math] in [math]\\dfrac{-x}{y} = 2[/math], we get [math]x = -2y[/math].
