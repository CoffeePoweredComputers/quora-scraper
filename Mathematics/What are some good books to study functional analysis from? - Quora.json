            "answer_text": "It depends on what you want to study. If you are talking about basic functional analysis, then you can read: Functional Analysis by Walter Rudin But Rudin's book is dense. If you want something simpler, you can read:  Introductory functional analysis with applications by Erwin Kreyszig. Note: I 'll add some more names soon. ",
