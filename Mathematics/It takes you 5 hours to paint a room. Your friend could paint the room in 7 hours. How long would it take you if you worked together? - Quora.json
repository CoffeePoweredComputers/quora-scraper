More interestingly this reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals turns up in many places \u2014 e.g. the \u201creduced mass\u201d in the Kepler problem, calculating U-values for multiple glazing, in the reduced variance of the Kalman filter. It's closely related to the \u201charmonic mean\u201d, a cousin of the standard (arithmetic) mean and the geometric mean. ",
