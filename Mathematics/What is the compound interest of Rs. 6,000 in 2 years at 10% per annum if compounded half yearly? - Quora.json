            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s try this; 6000 invested for two years with semi-annual compounding would involve 4 compounding events. At 10%, you would only realize one half of the annual yield at each event. So, what if we split the interest rate in half? So, we could create an equation like this: R = 6,000(1+i)^4 R= 6,000(1.05)^4 R = 6,000((1.2155) = 7,293 Or, we could see if we are right by doing long multiplication. Such as: 6000(1.05)(1.05)(1.05)(1.05) 6000X1.05=6,300 6,300X1.05=6,615 6615x1.05=6,945.75 6,945.75X1.05=7,293.04 Interesting! ",

            "answer_text": "The formula goes like this: Future value = Present Value *( 1+ r/n)^nt Where, r = yearly rate of interest n = Number of compounding periods a year. t = number of years. Plugging in the values, FV = 6000 * ( 1+0.10/2)^(2*2) FV= 6000 * (1.05)^4 FV = 6000 * 1.21156 FV= 7293. So the accrued compound interest is 7293\u20136000= 1293. ",
