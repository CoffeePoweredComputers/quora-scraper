            "answer_text": "When I was in high school, I thought I was good at math. Then I went to college, and found that the people around me were way, way better. I would sit with them working on physics problems and they would just say, \u201coh, yeah, look this is the answer\u201d, and I would still be trying to understand the problem. I wold then sit there staring at the problem for another half hour, and then realize that there was no point in working with this other person, because their level was so far above mine, and go to my room to work by myself. But, even at this time I hated the idea of genius and was convinced that there were concrete methods and algorithms that everyone could learn to solve every problem that people had successfully solved given the right tools and experience. So what did I do, sitting in my room, staring at a physics or math textbook by myself? Concreting: I once had a professor tell me \u201cabstract algebra isn\u2019t abstract, it is concrete\u201d. His point is that while the problems in front of you seem abstract, they are derived from much more concrete problems. But sometimes, people don\u2019t tell you the more concrete cases, and what is concrete differs from person to person anyways. If torque doesn\u2019t make sense, start playing around with a bike wheel. If Taylor series don\u2019t make sense, start plotting finite Taylor approximations on graphs. If convergence of functions on the complex plane doesn\u2019t make sense, then work through convergence of real numbers. The hardest part is figuring out some way of making it concrete which actually implies something about the original problem. Tutors and fellow students are great resources for this, even when professors are completely unhelpful.Linking: Deeply understanding the connections between formulas is critical to working out more complex problems. Luckily, this one is fairly easy if you have the patience. You just have to ask the question: If you change something over here, how does it change something over there? If you chance the capacitance of a capacitor of a circuit, how does it change the voltage equations? If you change a particular quantity of an element of a matrix, how does that affect the inverse of a matrix? Also, what stays the same? What stays the same, if instead of asking for an inverse to a matrix, you get asked for the characteristic polynomial? What does this imply? At first, many of the links you try to make will be really useless. But then, you will start guessing a little better.Thinking backwards: When you sit down and solve a problem, there is some stabbing out in the dark sometimes. So links that don\u2019t go anywhere, or some concrete analogies that turn out to be worthless. But I believe we should always be working towards and understanding where minimal flailing is required. Where you can steadily progress from a problem to a solution. To train this ability most effectively, you must think backwards. This means after you solve a problem, and are convinced that the answer is correct, try to forget that you ever had the right answer, and resolve it using some of the more fundamental insights you gained. If it is more complex, resolve it part by part, starting from the last step, and working backwards, and trying to see how the steps you took made sense, or if now you understand that there is a better way of solving it. If you see a better way, then just start solving it that way. I\u2019ve always thought that this was by far the best way of learning anything abstract, but I feel that this was proven by the fact that the AlphaZero (the board game AI that holds records in Chess, Go, and Shogi) learns in roughly this manner. However, it is also requires a rather high level of discipline, requiring you to really believe that your understanding is what is most important, and not actually solving problems. And it can be overdone, I know one person who took this too far, and spent far too much time on basic problems, instead of working up to more difficult problems. He is a true master of easy problems, but he didn\u2019t want that.Now, I believe that these three alone are good enough to get you through a respectable undergraduate institution as a math or physics major. But after a few years, when I started becoming extremely passionate about algorithms, I wanted to go further and really start making some original math to support my ideas. So it became clear that there was one more critically important idea: 4. Structured abstraction: This is really what math is all about, but usually you aren\u2019t expected to do it yourself. The idea is that when you run into a complex problem there often some hidden, abstract sub-problem, that if understood, and understood in a way that is clear, precise, and expressible, will make your solution make so much more sense. This is not a learning method, as much as a conviction that you need to explore abstract problems no one has taught you or even considered before. I was trying to come up with an algorithm that had a 5/3 approximation upper bound on a really awkward version of the traveling salesman problem, and then prove that the algorithm worked. Pretty much everyone else in the class gave up really fast. I didn\u2019t know how to proceed either. But I just started trying things, and verifying if they did what I thought they did. The verification process used all my prior learning I acquired from years of following the first 3 points. And as I was solving parts of the problem, I was thinking backwards to what got me to more or less successful ideas. And eventually, I fought through to a result which my professor thought worked. ",
