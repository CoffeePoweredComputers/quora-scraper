            "answer_text": "There are parts of real analysis and linear algebra that you cannot do without when learning functional analysis. You should be familiar with the following. Basic set theoryFunctions and RelationsRigorous definitions of limits and continuityVector spacesLinear and bilinear mapsBasic measure theory and Lebesgue integrationI strongly suggest that if you want to actually learn linear algebra, real analysis, and functional analysis that you find people proficient in the field to help you. Reading out of books is unlikely to be enough. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think so. With out real analysis it's very tough to digest functional analysis. There are several applications of real analysis found in functional analysis also. First of all we need basic limit of sequence of real analysis specially for working knowledge which we apply in functional analysis. We need idea of distance function i.e. metric space which is similar with topological space, needed in functional analysis. Most of the cases idea of linear algebra mainly vector space needed for functional analysis. But without real analysis we can't study functional analysis. ",
