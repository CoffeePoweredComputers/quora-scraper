            "answer_text": "your question : By selling 120 oranges, a person gains a profit that is equal to the cost price of 20 oranges. What is his profit percentage? . this is all a matter of carefully writing up the problem. let\u2019s say that : P is the sales price per orange C is the cost per orange M is the margin per orange And we define profit percentage as M/P. So : P = C + M for 120 oranges, 120P = 120C + 120M. we are told that the profit for 120 oranges is 20 oranges, therefore : 120M = 20P now we can calculate M/P, by first dividing the above equation by 120, then by P: M = (20/120)P M/P = 20/120 so M/P = 1/6 and M/P = 16.67%. now some (not so) fun facts : The salesman is selling 120 oranges ; his profit margin is 20 oranges. Suppose 3 oranges get stolen, perhaps 5 others cannot be sold because they are rotten, 2 more fall on the ground and roll away ; all of a sudden the salesman has only 110 oranges to sell, but his cost remains the same; his profits all of a sudden went down from 20 to 10 oranges. Profit margins can decrease real fast when some of the goods to be sold disappear. good luck ! ",
