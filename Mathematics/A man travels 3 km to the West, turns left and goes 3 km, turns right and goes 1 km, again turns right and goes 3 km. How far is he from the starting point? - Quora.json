            "answer_text": "To solve these kind of questions, we firstly need to draw this:  Then we can proceed keeping this compass as our reference,  Here we traveled 3km towards west, then,  We traveled 3km after turning left, then,  We traveled 1km after turning right, then,  We traveled 3km after turning right, So, now we can assume that we traveled the path PQRST:  And distance between T and Q is 1km, Here, we are needed to measure the displacement of the man i.e. the distance between his starting and ending points which are P and T respectively. According to the figure, displacement=PQ+QT=3km+1km=4km So, the man is 4km west of his starting point. ",
