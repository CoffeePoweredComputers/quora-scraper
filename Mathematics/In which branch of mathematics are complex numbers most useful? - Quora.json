            "answer_text": "Complex numbers are everywhere, and it is interestingly different from that of the reals. since complex numbers is an abstract, the non-mathematical applications of the real numbers are legion, for instance, you are likely to meet them in electromagnetism (when dealing with oscillating currents). The mathematics field which deals with the complex plane is called Complex Analysis. If you learn this subject, you will learn, among other things, amazing properties of some functions defined on the complex plane. You will also see some nice theorems about integration of functions along a path in C. Complex numbers can even make stunning and beautiful images. The Mandelbrot set is the classic example of such fractals. when you consider Quaternions it is algebraically too rich for a directly depictive application of the full structure and it is an applications in 4-dimensional space and so on.

In the fields of electrical engineering, particularly communications systems, control systems, power transmission, antennas, etc. and quantum physics, mathematical transforms like the Fourier transform, Laplace transform, Z transform, etc. are used to describe various phenomena, which requires being able to deal with complex numbers.
