            "answer_text": "Normally the answer is yes because 991es plus is a non-programable calculator. But to make sure I would suggest you search or inquire to the exam provider on what calculator brands and models are allowed. For example, here in the Philippines the Professional Regulation Commission only recently banned the use of 991ES and 570ES (it's alternative minus the solar panel) and many other non-programable calculators for unknown reasons. What we have is a handful of old models with basic functions. ",
