            "answer_text": "Let the Cost Price (CP) = \u20b9100 Profit % = 25% So the value of Cost Price after profit becomes 125%. Selling price(SP) = \u20b9130. We can say that the value of SP is 125% of CP, right? So = (130/125)*100 = 26 x 4 = 104 (CP) Now new SP = \u20b9182. The difference between the new SP and CP is = 182 - 104 = \u20b9 78 Profit percentage = (78/104) x 100 = 75% answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Let us assume cost of the watch is Rs. x. => x*1.25 = 130 => x = 104. If the same is sold for Rs. 182 the profit will be Rs. 182-Rs. 104 = Rs. 78. This would mean that the profit percentage will now be 78/104 = 0.75 or 75%. This implies that there would be an additional gain of 50% (75% - 25%) if the selling price is changed from Rs. 130 to Rs. 182. ",
