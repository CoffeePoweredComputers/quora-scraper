            "answer_text": "What you are looking for is the square root of [12,345,678,987,654,321]. Start by breaking the number into groups of 2. 123 45 67 89 87 65 43 21 The last two numbers will be key, more on that later. Sometimes with large numbers such as this, you just have to start by estimating using a range. Since we're talking 12 quadrillion, that's not easy. However, since I know that 123 (first set) is between [math]11^2[/math] and [math]12^2[/math], The first two digits are probably 1 and 1 (since 123 is very close to [math]11^2[/math] or 121). Next, you can work the number like long division, subtracting the square of the digits you have found, then multiplying by 5. This will then get us the next digit. This looks like so: [math]123 45 ...[/math] [math]11_______[/math] [math]-121[/math] [math]  2*5=10[/math] I apologize for the formatting, I\u2019m doing the best that I can with Quora math. The next step is a bit tricky to explain, but basically you take the square of the difference (2 in this case), multiply that by our first digits so far (11), and double that. Then, subtract the original difference (2 again) by the tens digit of that number (22, so 2) to get 0. The 0 then goes on to the next digit, like so: [math]123 45 ...[/math] [math]    0[/math] Then we continue by dropping the 4 and subtracting by the ones digit of the 22 we got earlier (2). You get 2 and then you\u2019re back to multiplying by 5. Now back to the last number; since the last digit is 1, the ones digit of our square must be either 1 or 9. You can figure this out by finding the square of numbers 1\u20139 and knowing the ones digit of each resulting square. For example, [math](4^2)=16[/math], so the ones digit is 6. By doing this, you find out that only 1 and 9 have a 1 in the ones digit. Therefore, the last digit of your square will be one of those numbers. Disclaimer: I\u2019ve never actually tried this method with a number this large before, so I\u2019m probably doing a terrible job of explaining it, as I\u2019m struggling to work through the problem myself. This is a very difficult concept to master but I imagine learning to do so was not your intention in the first place anyway. To cut a dreadfully long series of steps short, you end up with 111111111 as the root of your number. ",

Now, to get into the solution part of the problem, every time you find question like this which starts with 1 and progresses in the series as 1234\u2026.., then the answer of such a question will always consists of only 111\u2026.n times. and value of n depends upon the maximum number available in the question. like in 12,345,678,987,654,321 the maximum single digit available is 9. So the answer will have 9 times 1 i.e., 111,111,111. 111,111,111*111,111,111 = 12,345,678,987,654,321. ",
