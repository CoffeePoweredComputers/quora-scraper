            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A Depends on your gait and age I would dare to offer this conjecture, a little bit. 400 meters can be between 5 minutes and 8 minutes. An adult with an average stride can do 400(447.445 yards, 1312.4 feet or roughly .25 miles-1/4 mile) meters in about 5 minutes. A shorter person like my sister who is 4\u20322\u2033 did 400 meters in about 7 minutes. I based my calculations on statures. All the children in my family participated in track and field events. These calculations also don't take into consideration the ages of participants. Power walkers could possibly travel the distance in a shorter time. A strolling walker might take longer. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets say you take about 3 seconds to brisk walk ten meters. You are going to take about 30 seconds to brisk walk 100 meters,plus 1 or 2 seconds as you inevitably slow down a little. 100 meters in 31 seconds. You are going to slow down even more over the course of 200 meters,as fatigue starts to set into your body. So,you take about 33 to 34 seconds to complete the next 100 meters. 200 meters in 31+33 seconds(64 seconds) You then realise that you have another 200 meters to complete,but you start to tire down and consequently slow down slightly more. Note:You are still trying to brisk walk,albeit you are ever so slightly slower than just now. You take about 68 to 70 seconds to complete the final 200 meters. So,first 200 meters in about 64 seconds next 200 meters in about 68 seconds. You take about 132 seconds,or 2 minutes 12 seconds to complete 400 meters at a brisk pace. ",
