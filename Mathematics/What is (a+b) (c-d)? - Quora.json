            "answer_text": "(a+b)*(c-d) is a simple mathematical problem of multiplication. first step: First step is to open the bracket into its simplest form .To do this we have to multiply \u2018a\u2019 with the second bracket and \u2018b\u2019 with the second bracket. We simply have to apply distributive property. thus we get to the step , a*(c-d)+b*(c-d) second step : Open the brackets, ac-ad +bc-bd this is the final answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Given, (a+b)*(c-d) According to Distributive law -> multiply a number by a group of numbers added together, or -> do each multiply separately then add them So multiplying the first two terms with the remaining two terms, (a+b) * (c+d) =>a*(c+d) +b*(c+d) So, the a* can be \"distributed\" across the c+d, into a*c and a*d =>a*c+c*d+b*c+b*d It can be written as, ac+cd+bc+bd ",
