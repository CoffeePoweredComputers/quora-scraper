            "answer_text": "If A can paint the house in 12 days he paints 1/12 of the house per day. In 8 days he therefore paints 8/12 or 2/3 of the house, meaning in the same time B painted 1/3 of the house. A paints twice as fast as B, 2/3 of the house to 1/3 of the house. Therefore, it would take B twice 12 days or 24 days to paint the house himself. ",
