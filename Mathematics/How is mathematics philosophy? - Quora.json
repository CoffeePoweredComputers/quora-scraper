            "answer_text": "Well, Mathematics answers the questions about Metaphysics. Usually, Mathematics have a lot to do with the limits, infinity, logic, and paradox. In fact, some ancient Greeks philosophers believed that the nature (or essence) of everything is the number. That means, the fundamental logics (Mathematics) is the essence of the universe. This view soon influences other Schools of Philosophy. For example, Stoicism understand the nature of universe is something called \u201clogos\u201d which structured the whole universe. This is highly similar to the view that number is the very essence of everything because both number and logos are the very logical things and they are believed as the way universe (=everything) function. Other school of Philosophy also have different understanding of Mathematics in terms of Philosophy. For example, Plato believed that Mathematics is the low-level knowledge although it is bases upon reasons. (This is a very interesting philosophy to know about because Plato\u2019s understanding of reasons soon became a foil of Aristotle\u2019s understanding of experience-based reason. And later, Thomas Aquinas gave more in-depth philosophical argument about God\u2019s existence as a very energy form instead of a being. I\u2019m sorry, I know this can be confusing and I realized that my writings are a little bit confusing. But all I want to say is that all of this have to do with Mathematics. I personally believe that Mathematics is by nature a brach of Philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is the closest thing there is to Philosophy, in terms of process that is. You first have a statement that you think is truth, explains something or gives some answers or utility. Then you place all of your arguments next and then logically construct some kind of reasoning using those arguments. The end point of your reasoning should be the statement you started with. Thats how process work in mathematical theorems as well. Just replace statements in a spoken language i.e. English or French and replace them with The Language of Math i.e. Numbers, Mathematical Symbols and Operations. ",
