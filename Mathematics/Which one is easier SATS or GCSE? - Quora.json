            "answer_text": "I assume you means American SATs (which you sit at 16/17) and not British SATs (which are a completely different test that you sit at 11). \u201cHarder\u201d is a difficult question to answer. SATs, everyone sits the same test and it is graded on a scale from 400 - 1600. GCSEs everyone sits a different number, sits different subjects, and they are graded from 1 - 9. Both sets of exams can be used to shape their respective academic populations into a bell curve. But whether one is harder or not depends upon equivalency. Only a few hundred people in the entire UK will get straight \u201c9\u201ds on their GCSEs. Only a few hundred people in the entire USA will get a perfect 1600 on the SAT. This paper comparing the relative bell curves is interesting (because it compares UK students who did both), but it says largely what you would expect it to say: that the results form a bell curve. https://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/44412/44412.pdf Last point to mention: a more interesting comparison would be to compare GCSEs to SAT subject tests. Those are way more subject specific, and can be more readily compared as like for like. Overall (particularly in the science subjects) it appears that the SAT subjects are pitched at a higher level than GCSEs - closer to A/S level, but not as high as A-level. ",
