            "answer_text": "Using the first part of the question, we can calculate the hourly labor of one single painter, assuming every painter paints at the same rate. The equation would be 10\u20225\u2022x=500 with x being the square meters of wall a single painter can paint in one hour. By dividing on both sides we get that x=10. Now, using the result from the above equation, we can set up a similar calculation but this time we are looking for the number of painters it will take. 8\u202210\u2022n=600, with n being the amount of painters. By again dividing on both sides we get that it will take 7,5 painters. ",
