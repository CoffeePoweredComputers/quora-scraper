            "answer_text": "First proof (by induction): Check for [math]n = 0: 3^0 > 0^2[/math] true Check for [math]n = 1: 3^1 > 1^2[/math] true Assume that for [math]n = k[/math]: [math]3^k > k^2 \u2026 (1)[/math] We will show that for [math]n = k+1[/math]: [math]3^{k+1} > (k+1)^2 \u2026 (2)[/math] We multiply both sides of [math](1)[/math] by [math]3[/math] and we take: [math]3^{k+1} > 3k^2 \u2026 (3)[/math] It is obvious that if we prove that [math]3k^2 > (k+1)^2[/math], then we will be done. Indeed for any integer [math]k>1[/math], we have: [math]k > 1+1/(2k) => 2k^2 > 2k+1 => [/math] [math]3k^2 > k^2+2k+1 => 3k^2 > (k+1)^2  ... (4)[/math] Now, by [math](3)[/math] and [math](4)[/math], it follows that: [math]3^{k+1} > (k+1)^2[/math], therefore the proof is complete. Second proof: Consider the function [math]f(x) = 3^x - x^2[/math]. By taking the first derivative of [math]f(x)[/math], we obtain: [math]f\u2019(x) =  (3^x)ln(3) - 2x \u2026 (1)[/math] Now, by [math](1)[/math] we conclude that for every [math]x>0[/math] we have [math]f\u2019(x)>0[/math], therefore the function [math]f(x)[/math] is genuinely increasing for every [math]x>0[/math] and hence for every nonegative integral value of [math]x = n[/math], we take [math]3^n > n^2[/math]. Third proof: Since we want to prove that [math]3^n>n^2[/math], this means that we need to prove that: [math](2+1)^n > n^2 \u2026 (1)[/math] Now, by Newton\u2019s binomial we take: [math](2+1)^n = 2^n+n2^{n-1}+\u2026+1 \u2026 (2)[/math] Evidently, [math](2+1)^n > 2^n+n2^{n-1}+1 \u2026 (3)[/math] Now, we observe that: [math]2^n/n+2^{n-1}+1/n > n => 2^n+n2^{n-1}+1 > n^2 \u2026 (4)[/math] Therefore, by [math](3)[/math] and [math](4)[/math] the proof follows.
