            "answer_text": "The word \u201cbetter\u201d is a subjective term. Those others answering this question to say they think the non-metric units are better base that on three things, usually: They are more familiar with the non-metric units. Well, if they used the metric units for a while those units would become familiar also. So this is a bit of circular logic: I don\u2019t use it because it\u2019s not familiar and it\u2019s not familiar because I don\u2019t use it.Many great things have been accomplished using non-metric units. True! But many great things have been accomplished using metric units as well. It should not escape notice that 95 % of the people in the world use only the metric system in their everyday lives and surely they accomplish great things, too.Non-metric units get compared to body parts and so they seem \u201cmore natural\u201d. Well an inch is roughly the length of the first bone in your thumb or finger and a centimeter is roughly the width of that digital segment. A foot relates (very roughly!) to the length of your foot (check it for yourselves, ladies!) and a decimeter is roughly the width of your palm. \u201cA (U.S.) pint\u2019s a pound\u201d and \u201ca kilogram\u2019s a liter\u201d\u2014both good rules of thumb for water. One could go on and on about this.So, why do I think the metric system is better? I have undertaken the effort to use it and so it has now become familiar. I would rather scale things by multiplying by 10, 100, or 1000 (just move the decimal point) than by 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 32, 5.5, 16.5, 1760, and 5280\u2014especially recalling when to use which of those weird factors! And, lastly, it makes it easier to communicate with the 95 % of the world that uses only the metric system. If I were in business to produce or sell things, that would be an even better reason! So, to me, those who tell us why they don\u2019t use the metric system are just saying that their real reason is \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d ",

All of these were based on the imperial system. I don\u2019t think anyone can say metric is better. It\u2019s just a different system for measurement, no better, no worse. ",
