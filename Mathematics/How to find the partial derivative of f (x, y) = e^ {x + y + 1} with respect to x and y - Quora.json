            "answer_text": "A good way to learn partial derivatives is to leverage the fact that you already know how to take derivatives involving constants. When I teach partial derivatives, I sometimes tell my students to literally replace the variables being held constant with a symbol that your brain is used to recognizing as a constant. So instead of [math]\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}e^{x+y+1}[/math], think of it as [math]\\frac{d}{dx}e^{x+\\pi+1}[/math]. How would you differentiate that? Easy, right? [math]\\pi+1[/math] is a constant and you could use the chain rule. The answer is [math]e^{x+\\pi+1}[/math] of course. Now just change the [math]\\pi[/math] back into a [math]y[/math], and you're done! (If you use this method, just make sure you don't combine the [math]\\pi[/math] with any other constants. Or use [math]k[/math] instead of [math]\\pi[/math]. Before long, you'll be able to keep it as [math]y[/math] the whole time). ",
