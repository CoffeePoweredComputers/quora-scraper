            "answer_text": "If someone says that and you have reason to believe that they know what they\u2019re talking about, then there must be some additional constraints or assumptions (e.g. maximum entropy) that have been left implicit. It\u2019s easy to find large numbers of counterexamples in the form of two or more distinct distributions with the same mean and variance. (See e.g. Martin Jansche's answer to Is it possible to convert a beta distribution into a normal distribution even with a small alpha and beta?) Tell me what mean and variance you want and I can easily construct a distribution with two point masses, as well as a normal distribution with the given mean and variance. That tells you that mean and variance are not enough to uniquely determine a probability distribution. ",

The function with P(-Sqrt(3))=P(Sqrt(3)) =1/6 and P(0)=2/3 matches the first five moments of the Normal Density, The mean and variance of a uniform density from -Sqrt(3) to Sqrt(3) are the same as that of the Normal Density.
