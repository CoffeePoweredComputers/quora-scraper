            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the rate at which you increase your rotational speed. Rotation speed is typically measured in RPM (revolutions per minute), \u00b0/sec (degrees per second), and radians/second. Let\u2019s think about a speed of 1 rpm, or 360\u00b0/minute. Since there are 60 seconds per minute, that\u2019s also 6\u00b0/sec (since 360/60 = 6). Now, let\u2019s say that you\u2019re starting at ZERO speed, and it takes you 2 seconds to get to that boringly slow speed of 6\u00b0/sec: (6\u00b0/sec)/(2 sec) = 3\u00b0/sec/sec, or 3\u00b0/sec^2 [edited to correct a typo] Angular acceleration becomes important when you have a high-inertia object (a car, a car tire, or a giant rotating stage) and you have to get it spun up to speed in a short amount of time. Dealing with just changing the speed of rotation (such as spinning up a car tire, or bringing the giant rotating stage for KA at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas up to speed): Torque = [angular inertia] * [angular acceleration] ",

            "answer_text": "The rate of change in angular velocity, of course! Hmm, what\u2019s angular velocity? The rate of change in angular position. Hmm, this is getting weird. If you rotate around a circle in an hour (positive direction), your angular velocity is 2*pi radians/hour. If that angular speed changes, you would have angular acceleration. OK? ",
