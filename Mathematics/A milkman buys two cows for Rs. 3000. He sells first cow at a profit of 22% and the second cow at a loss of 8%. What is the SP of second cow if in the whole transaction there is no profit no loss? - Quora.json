What is the SP of second cow if in the whole transaction there is no profit no loss? Let purchase price of first cow be x, therefore purchase price of the second cow will be 3000 - x. Sale price of 1st cow = x + 22x / 100 Sale price of 2nd cow = 3000 - x - 8 (3000 - x) / 100 As per statement 3000 = x + 22x/100 + 3000 - x - 8 (3000 - x)/100 3000= x + 22x/100 + 3000 - x - (24000 + 8x) /100 3000=x + 22x/100 + 3000-x -24000/100+ 8x/100 3000\u20133000 + 240 = x + 22x/100 - x + 8x/100 240= 22x/100 + 8x/100 240 = (22x + 8x)/100 240= 30x /100 Cross multiplication 30x = 240 \u00d7 100 30x=24000 x = 24000/80 x = 800 Sale price of 2nd cow = 3000 - x = 3000 - 800 = Rs 2200 Answer the sale price of 2nd cow is Rs 2200 ",
