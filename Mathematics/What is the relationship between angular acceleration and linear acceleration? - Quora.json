            "answer_text": "Hi. Recall that linear acceleration requires a force, as per F = ma, to achieve a constant velocity (unless thereafter acted upon by external forces to decelerate an object). Angular acceleration such as a mass on a string whirling around a fixed point, or a \u2018merry-go-round\u2019 twirling, produces a \u2018fictitious\u2019 force that feels to one in the rotating reference frame like it wants to fling you off of it. This type of acceleration can continue indefinitely (in the absence of external forces). Indeed there is a force on the string holding the mass on the string in a circle, or a central force, like gravity, holding an object in an orbit, but no force is necessary perpendicular to the radius and parallel (tangentially) to the motion. This centripetal acceleration is proportional to m*w x (w x r), where the w is an omega - for angular velocity - a vector perpendicular to both the tangential line of motion and the radius \u2014 along the z-axis from the center. The r is a radius vector, which changes in a sinusoidal way in a fixed reference frame, but its magnitude remains constant. The x\u2019s here are cross products which adhere to the right hand rule. Note that working out the right hand gyrations (avoid physical therapy from trying this too much) gives one a vector that points opposite the r vector. Another, entirely different type of acceleration requires a force to increase the angular velocity, w, of the rotating mass. A linear force with a component parallel to the circular path of motion would provide a d^2w/dt^2. Note that this adds an entirely new level to the complexity of the question, and I\u2019m presuming that it is not in its original purview. Imagine this as someone on the side of the merry-go-round that grabs a bar each time around and slings it faster tangentially. It would involve a force in the fixed reference frame that is timed to act when an orbit completes, or a force, like a jet, rocket, or a rotating deflating balloon that is continuous along the circular path in the rotating frame.

            "answer_text": "There actually isn\u2019t a strong relationship between the two, since the two are almost entirely different. Physicists simply screwed up by naming them in very similar fashions. Linear acceleration is the translational acceleration felt by an object. When linear acceleration is applied to a body, the entire body is affected by the acceleration (or the force) at the same time. Angular accleration is the rotational acceleration felt by an object about an axis. When angular acceleration is applied to a body, parts of the body experience acceleration different from acceleration in other parts of the body. However, the entire body feels the same torque applied to it about the axis at the same time. Typically, when we relate the two, we consider it in cases of a cylinder or circular object rolling under the influence of some force. In such a case, typically the linear acceleration is equal to the radius of the object times the angular acceleration. This is just a special case, but it\u2019s the most common one. ",
