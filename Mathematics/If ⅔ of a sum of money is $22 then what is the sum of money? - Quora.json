            "answer_text": "This question is too easy for anyone in science or engineering, let alone math. (For accounting students, too.) But I was an English major who many years ago used to tutor simple algebra. So let me assume the question is serious and answer it. Here are the simple steps. First decide what you\u2019re trying to find and make that object x. In this case, you\u2019re looking for the \u201csum of money.\u201d So let x = the sum of money Then, using x for the sum of money, translate the first clause (the statement) into an equation. In this simple example, algebra is just a very simple language. So 2/3*x = 22 (I\u2019m using an asterisk for \u201ctimes\u201d because of the typing mode. You don\u2019t really need a times sign here if you are able to put the 2 over the 3, which I can\u2019t; but it\u2019s all the same.) Now that you have an equation with one unknown (x), you can just solve the equation. Here\u2019s step-by-step: Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction. (You can do just about anything not involving 0 to one side as long as you do it to the other side.) So now you have 2x = 66 Now divide both sides by 2 to see what x equals. (Of course 1x is just written as x.) x = 33 Now see if you can say the answer in terms of the original question. So, \u201cThe sum of money is $33.\u201d ",
