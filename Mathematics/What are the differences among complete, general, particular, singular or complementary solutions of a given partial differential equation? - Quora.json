            "answer_text": "Complete solution: Such solutions satisfy the given differential equation as well as consist of as many arbitrary constants as there are independent variables. Particular solution: For particular values of arbitrary constants, the solution is called particular solutions. General solution: Often we eliminate arbitrary functions from the relations [math]  \\phi(u,v)=0[/math] where  [math]u[/math] and [math] v[/math] are two independent functions of [math] x[/math],[math] y[/math] and [math] z[/math] to obtain a pde. This [math] \\phi(u,v)=0[/math] is said to be the general solution. Singular solution: The equation of the envelope of the surface represented by the complete integral of a pde is called singular solution. It differs from particular solution in the sense that it cannot be, in general, be obtained from the complete integral by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants. (same thing follows in case of ODEs). ",
