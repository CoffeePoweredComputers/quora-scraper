            "answer_text": "You want to isolate w so you can start by subtracting 4 from both sides. This gets you: -w= 9\u20134 -w=5 If you work from here to get rid of the negative sign by multiplying (or dividing) by -1 (-1) x (-w)=(-1) x 5 You get w=-5 There is another way to solve this if you don't like multiplying by negatives. Start by adding w to both sides you get: 4 - w + w = 9 + w w on the left will cancel out with -w leaving: 4 = 9 + w You can now subtract 9 from both sides. 4 - 9 = 9 + w - 9 -5 = w w = -5 Which is what we had before.

            "answer_text": "Hey Paul. To start with, I like to get rid of the negative sign preceding the variable by adding w to both sides of the equality. Next I would subtract 9 from both sides of the equality and you should be left with the variable w set equal to the answer. Keep track of your signs and be confident in your work. Remember, the answer is never more important than the method used to find it. Cheers. ",
