            "answer_text": "There is no precise conversion between SI and imperial units but the nearest practical conversion is 1.0W = 3.412 BTU/hr assuming 100% thermal efficiency. Note - BTU and Watt are not comparable units. BTU/hr can be expressed as Watt or BTU can be expressed as Joules. BTU is not time dependant nor is Joule. Both BTU/ hr and Watt are units of energy/time. ",
