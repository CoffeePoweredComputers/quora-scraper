This is probably the purest form if it is allowed. [math]\\overline{A\\oplus B}, \\neg(A\\oplus B)[/math] Literally, \u201cNot ( Exclusively A or B)\u201d. This is true exactly when A and B are not different, which is when they are the same. There might be other candidates I can\u2019t think of as well. Writing things in simplest form isn\u2019t an entirely clear task, and you could make a solid argument that this expression is in its simplest form already. ",

            "answer_text": "Boolean algebra finds its most practical use in the simplification of logic circuits. If we translate a logic circuit\u2019s function into symbolic (Boolean) form, and apply certain algebraic rules to the resulting equation to reduce the number of terms and/or arithmetic operations, the simplified equation may be translated back into circuit form for a logic circuit performing the same function with fewer components. If equivalent function may be achieved with fewer components, the result will be increased reliability and decreased cost of manufacture. To this end, there are several rules of Boolean algebra presented in this section for use in reducing expressions to their simplest forms. The identities and properties already reviewed in this chapter are very useful in Boolean simplification, and for the most part bear similarity to many identities and properties of \u201cnormal\u201d algebra.
