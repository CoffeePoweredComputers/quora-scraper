            "answer_text": "As other people have said, this property is usually regarded as axiomatic. But here is an intuitive argument that your claim is true. We consider three cases: integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. Let some counting numbers [math]x[/math] and [math]y[/math] be given. Make a grid of apples that is [math]x[/math] by [math]y[/math], somewhat like this picture:  Now rotate it by 90 degrees and observe that the number of apples doesn\u2019t change. QED. For real numbers, you would get a solid rectangle with height [math]y[/math] and width [math]x.[/math] Again, rotating by 90 degrees doesn\u2019t change the area.  For complex numbers [math]x[/math] and [math]y[/math], there is again a fairly simple geometric meaning to multiplication which makes it clear that multiplication is commutative. Complex numbers: multiplication  ",

For example, if  and  are integers and multiplication is defined as usual, then  is indeed equal to  for all integers  and . However, if  and  are  matrices and multiplication is the matrix product, then  in general. ",
