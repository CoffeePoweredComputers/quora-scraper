            "answer_text": "To even get an approximate answer, you need to know the latitude of his starting point. If that starting point is 3/pi km (approximately 0.955 km) north of the south pole, he will be at his starting point after going east for 6 km. (Circumference of circle = 2 * pi * radius, hence radius = 6 / (2 * pi).) When he turns right and goes 3 km, he crosses over the pole, following a line of longitude, ending up approximately 2.045 km north of the pole and 180\u00b0 farther east than his starting point. Now, when he turns right, he will be going east again. But the question didn\u2019t specify whether he continues eastward (following a line of latitude) or whether he maintains a constant heading or whether he stays on a great circle. Assuming he continues eastward, he will stay approximately 2.045 km north of the pole, but be 3 km farther east. The circumference of the circle of latitude he is on is 2 * pi * (3 - 3/pi) km, which equals 6 * pi - 6 km = 6 * (pi - 1), or approximately 12.850 km, so he will have gone 3 / [6 * (pi - 1)] of the circle. Multiplying by 360\u00b0 for the full circle gives approximately 84.050\u00b0. Now he turns right again, heading south again, crosses the south pole and ends up at his original latitude, but 180\u00b0 farther along the \u201csmall circle\u201d of latitude. Hence, he will be approximately 84.050\u00b0 east of his starting point, at the same latitude. The length of the chord, c, of the circle with radius r = 0.955 km and angle a = 84.050\u00b0 is given by c = 2* r * sin(a/2), or approximately 1.279 km. Hence, while he will be 3 km east of his starting point, he will be about 1.279 km away along a great circle. Oh, you might ask, why use plane geometry for the circumference and chord length calculations, when your point is that the answer depends upon the fact that the earth is round? My answer is that that was not my point - well, not entirely. With distances as small as 3 km, the errors in using plane geometry will be smaller than the size of his foot, so a planar approximation will suffice for almost all purposes. If the starting point is well away from the poles, a planar approximation to this problem as stated would give a quite satisfactory approximate answer. But the initial movement direction was given as EAST, and east is a direction in a spherical coordinate system, in which the lines of latitude are small circles whose radii get smaller as you approach the poles and the lines of longitude converge so much that they even meet at the poles. The locations of the poles are arbitrary*, but where they are is critical to navigation problems! *Since they are arbitrary, the poles can be placed wherever you want. That\u2019s why \u201cconvenient\u201d locations are chosen. How about the spin axis, for example, if the round body for which the coordinate system to be defined is a planet or a moon? How convenient is it that so few people live in those cold climes?! One more thing. If the man is well away from both poles, the third leg cancels out half of the first leg, so the distance between the starting point is just the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, the two sides of which are both 3 km long. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the hypotenuse is the square root of the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Hence, c = 3 * sqrt(2) km, which is approximately 4.243 km. ",

            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t answer by using maths (UK based we recognise plurals so don't say \u201cmath\u201d) Draw it on a piece of paper. From your starting point use a ruler and draw a line 6cm long towards the right (East) of the page. Then turn 90 degrees or right - NO? - ok so point your ruler to the bottom of the page and draw another line, from the end of the first, 3cm long. Take a deep breath - go for pizza or whatever as you have been working SO hard. Ok - you are now back and need to draw another line - I know, I know, they set you such hard tasks for your homework- but bear with me. You need to draw one more line. OK - you are now at the bottom of the last line you have drawn so you need to turn right again. Wow - which way is that? - it could take you off the page hmm? NO, NO, NO. Imagine you were actually travelling DOWN the last line you drew and THEN turned right - yes? So using that imagination do you go towards the centre of the page or off the edge? Oh dear - I am afraid not - you go towards the centre - but nice try. So from the bottom of your last drawn line you draw another 3cm line at 90 degrees towards the CENTRE of the page. Now then using your ruler you measure the distance from the end of the last line you drew to the starting point. Voila! Handy hint - swap cm to km when you hand your homework in. As I have said before I truly despair at the educational system that sets such questions. ",
