            "answer_text": "Sometimes most of the users have experienced this problem when opening video files, maybe the root cause of the error 0xcc00d36c4. For these many reasons I suggested using good quality antivirus. For example, Norton Antivirus. Antivirus may occupy some part of your memory. But it will keep your computer free from viruses. And update your antivirus every 3 months. And scan the whole PC with your antivirus at least once a month. Scan something after downloading it from the internet. As mentioned above, if your video file is damaged or corrupted or lost due to Harddisk crash. If you can't find the file, there is no reason to despair. Files deleted by multiple third-party software can be restored even if the entire drive is formatted. You can do this using popular software like Recoverit Media Recovery. Watch the video on how to repair damaged or corrupted video files.  I hope it will be helpful. Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "The reason for your video showing a 0xc00d36c4 error could because of your video. Either it doesn\u2019t support a specific format or it\u2019s too outdated. Another reason could be your video file is corrupted. Then a virus can also be the reason. But the most reason for this error is if a Codec that is required to play the file is not installed on the computer. The way you can fix it- By using the VLC Media Player, if the VLC Media Player doesn\u2019t work then you need to use some paid software like Wondershare and Recoverit Data Recover. But I\u2019ll recommend you the best and that is Recoverit Data Recover for this solution. You can check out this following video for further processing:  Thanks for watching! ",
