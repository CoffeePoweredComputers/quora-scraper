Then, you\u2019d use the Law of Cosines: c = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos\u03b3 c = 61^2 + 60^2 - 2\u00b761\u00b760\u00b7cos(45\u00b0)\u2248 46.314 meters ",

            "answer_text": "It would be impossible to tell unless you know the angle that he started walking in, but if you assume that it is a right triangle then you can use pythagorean\u2019s theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where 61m is c and 60m can be a or b. When you plug it in you find that the answer is 121 so he would be 121m from his starting point. ",
