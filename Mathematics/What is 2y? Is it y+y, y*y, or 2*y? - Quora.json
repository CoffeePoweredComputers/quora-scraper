            "answer_text": "In algebra, when you mush together a letter and a number - or two or more letters for that matter - there is an implicit multiplication. For example, [math]abc=a \\times b \\times c[/math] [math]5x^2y = 5 \\times x^2 \\times y[/math] [math]2y = 2 \\times y = y+y[/math] As a side note, and a lot of people get this wrong: an asterix is not a universally accepted symbol for multiplication. It is often used in computing or documents because of a lack of alternative, but strictly speaking it does not represent multiplication. Using the classic [math]\\times[/math] or a dot ([math]\\cdot[/math]) is much better (just type \\times and \\cdot respectively and use Quora's inbuilt maths formatting). ",

I can refer to the apples as such, or I can refer to these apples as a letter (y will do for now). I have y apples. its easier to refer to it this way. My friend has twice the amount of apples as me. Without saying all of that, we can simply say I have y apples. My friend has 2y apples. 2y is the same as y + y. If I wanted to say that my friend has the amount of apples I have squared, I would say my friend has y2. but the two has to be a small two and I have no clue how to do that on a keyboard ",

Multiplication is nothing just repeated addition of numbers.
