            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s see. According to Wikipedia The Pentagon is the world's largest office building, with about 6,500,000 sq ft (600,000 meters squared) of space, of which 3,700,000 sq ft (340,000 meters squared) are used as offices So it depends if you means the whole grounds or just the buildings. A regular pentagon shape is a bit harder to find the answer for as each pentagon doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s own wikipedia page. If you consider a regular pentagon (i.e. a pentagon with all sides the same length), it\u2019s composed of 5 triangles meeting at the center. The area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height, so if you know the distance from the edge to the center (the \u201capothem\u201d or a) and let the side length be s, the area of a pentagon is 5 * 1/2 * s * a = 5as/2 If you only know the side length, we can divide up one of our triangles in two at half the length of the side to the center. Since we know one side (along the edge is 1/2 s) and we know the degrees in the center vertex (360/10 triangles = 36 degrees), it follows that tan(36) = a/(1/2 s) = 2a/s And therefore 2a = s*tan(36), so a = 1/2 s * tan(36) And thus going back to combining the 10 triangles, the area is 10 * ( 1/2 * a * (1/2 s)) = 5/2 as Substitute in our equation for a, area = 5/2 s * 1/2 s * tan(36) = 5/4 s * s * tan(36).

            "answer_text": "assuming it is a regular pentagon (all five sides are the same, namely L), in that case - the pentagon is 5 equilateral triangle with sides L. So the area of a regular pentagon is 5 times the area of an equilateral triangle of sides L. Cut the equilateral triangle into two right triangles. the hypotenuse of the right triangle would be L, the base would be L/2 To find the altitude (call it \u2018a\u2019) use the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 = L^2 - (L/2)^2 or a=L*(3/4)^.5. the two right triangle can be arranged into a rectangle of area= a*L/2. So the area of a regular pentagon is 5 * a *L/2 . ",
