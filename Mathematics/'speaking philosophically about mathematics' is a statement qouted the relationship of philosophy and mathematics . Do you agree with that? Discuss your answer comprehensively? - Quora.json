Discuss your answer comprehensively?\u201d \"speaking philosophically about mathematics\" is NOT a statement. It\u2019s a way of announcing you\u2019re going to take a philosophical point of view of maths. As one can have a philosophical point of view of almost anything, that doesn\u2019t make it a very specific relationship of maths and philo. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no, philosophy and mathematics are both based on reason. mathematics takes known exact facts and data to analyze further, but philosophy mostly takes assumptions and limited data to prove a point that may be related to more than that. Read Ethics from Spinoza, he states that philosophy should be analyzed just like mathematics with principles and exact proofs to make results, however he has difficulty to prove things written in the second half of his books which objects with the same statement he mentioned. However every math problem might have a connection to a real life situation, but you can never prove that they work exactly like each other. You can say that by a high percentage of chance, the situation acts in similar behaviour. Also read the difference between empiricism and rationalism if you are interested. ",

            "answer_text": "The term philosophy refers to wisdom (philosopher = lover of wisdom). The general idea is how mathematics (a symbolic formalized language) is used concerning other sciences where the sciences are formalized with specific terms. The mathematical expression A + B = C can be used in any science as a formalization of the postulate (A + B), which through the axiom (=) becomes the result C. The inverse relation is not always true (ie C can be equal to N + M). The idea to postulate is to find the elements A and B so that they and only they give this result. In mathematics, such examples are the numerical values \u200b\u200bof \u03c0, \u03c6 and several other such constants, regardless of the numerical coefficients applied to the measurements of the length of the circle and its diameter. There is a major difference between numerical coefficients and numerical values. I don't know what it's for, but you have to pay attention to the terms you use and especially to their meaning and context. ",
