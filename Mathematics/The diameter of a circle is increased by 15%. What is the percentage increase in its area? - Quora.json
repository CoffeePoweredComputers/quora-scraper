Therfore area is directly proportional to the square of the diameter, if diameter is multiplied by amount then area will be multiplied by  From this the percentage increase is area is  And for the value given in the question   Percentage increase is area is  ",

            "answer_text": "This question seems to reappear with differing values of the percent increase of radius or diameter. Maybe it is time to solve it in general for a p% increase in radius or diameter. Here, r = radius. To convert to diameter one merely substitutes d/2 = r. Start with the area of the reference circle having radius r, called area 1. area1 = Pi r^2 Compute the area of a different size circle with radius increased by +/- p %. Expressed as a fraction, the increased radius is r2 = r * (1 + p/100). area2 = Pi ((1 +p/ 100)* r)^2 = (1 +p/ 100)^2 (Pi r^2) = area1 * (1 +p/ 100)^2 Compute the percent increase (decrease if p < 0) and call it pinc. Multiply the fractional answer by 100 to convert back to percent. pinc [p_] = 100 (area2 - area1) / area1 = 2 p + p^2/100 Evaluate pinc[p] for p = +15%. pinc[15] = 32.25% as shown by two earlier answers, and illustrated by the dashed lines on the Graph below.  The function, pinc[p], works for positive or negative p indicating radius increase or decrease. It is plotted above for +/- 100% change in radius. A little thought will reveal that a 100% decrease in radius results in a point, not a circle, so that limiting value is not a realistic value for p. ",
