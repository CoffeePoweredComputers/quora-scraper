            "answer_text": "There is a vocabulary problem here. Mathematical platonism is simply mathematical realism, and it has few relation with Plato\u2019s Platonism, even if I suspect this one came from Pythagorus \u201cplatonism\u201d or \u201crealism\u201d about the natural number. In philosophy of mathematics, you can defend realism for the natural numbers, which entails realism on integers and rationals, but remain skeptical on the realism about sets and functions (second order realism). Now, if you assume the hypothesis of digital mechanism in cognitive science, this needs arithmetical (first order) realism, and this leads to a theology close to the neopythagorean and the neoplatonist of the first 500 years. The theology remains pure mathematics, and even if you are a machine, it can only be used with some maximal precautions, as most of its truth are not assertable without making the machine inconsistent. Like in taoism, the wise remain silent, only the fool talk. No scientists doubt about the existence of the numbers and of most of their relations. Some scientists believe that there is also a *primary* physical universe, but we can remain skeptical, as there has never been any evidence for any sort of primary matter. That is speculation, but as mechanism and this materialism have been shown constructively incompatible, we can test them, and until now, it is the immaterialist mechanism which win. Nature behave exactly like mechanism predicted: it looks like a statistics on infinitely many computations, as it should. Not yet any evidences for Matter (Aristotle primary matter). Of course, since religion have been separated from science, and related to politics, the scientists are not yet really listen to. The belief in some Matter is still widespread. The subject is even still taboo in one third of the academies, I would say. ",

            "answer_text": "The mathematics that expresses itself in the universe is real, for how can something not exist and still affect real things? Such mathematics is also logically consistent, because the universe is not observed to contradict itself. Other mathematics, for example set theory, is possibly unreal, and we have no grounds for believing that it is logically consistent. That mathematics is real and expresses itself in the universe, is entirely consistent with Platonic philosophy. The fact that nobody has come up with a convincing argument as to how Platonic forms influence the universe does not invalidate Platonic philosophy, for there may be a means which is beyond human comprehension. However, there is also a means for forms to influence the universe which is within our comprehension. Only, it violates the Platonic principle that the relationship between forms and things is a one way street, so it is a halfway house between Platonism and Aristotelianism. The means may be stated briefly as follows: the universe is a quantum system, obeying the most fundamental law of QM, namely that a quantum system contains the same information only once. This is the principle which dictates the role of symmetry, and also produces entanglement.mathematics and natural law are also part of the universe, and are as such quantum phenomena.if a mathematical pattern occurs spontaneously in the universe, then that is a case of the same information. In the quantum system which is the universe, it will therefore come in to existence as a form.any change to the pattern will change the form, and therefore affect all instantiations of it.This approach to mathematics has an additional advantage that it prevents mathematics from being affected by Russell\u2019s Paradox, which is concerned with self-referencing leading to nonsense. Take as an example a French village, in which Jacques the barber shaves a man if and only if he doesn\u2019t shave himself. Jacques can neither shave himself nor refrain from shaving himself. If seemingly valid mathematical statements can lead to logical contradictions, we cannot trust mathematics. The above approach avoids this because there is no means by which quanta can refer to themselves, either directly or indirectly. ",

            "answer_text": "If we consider that mathematics is real, must we necessarily accept the Platonic philosophy? No, we could instead look to Aristotle. Platonic realism is dualistic. There is a realm of things and then a realm of forms. Mathematical objects exist in this realm of forms. The problem with Platonism has always been how to explain the relationship between these realms. How does the world of forms interact with the physical world? Aristotelian realism says that the forms are in things as qualities. The color green exists where there are green objects. There are not two worlds, there is one, and things like mathematical patterns are part of this world. What is your most convincing philosophical position on the existence of mathematics? Place your hands together as in prayer or namaste, and observe how everything matches up. That is called symmetry, and we exist because of it, not the other way around. I think of mathematics as the study of number and pattern, and patterns precede people. Nature unfolds in patterns. We exist because of certain kinds of patterns and later come to discover them. Humans are not the inventors of number or pattern. Animals other than humans demonstrate number sense. Collections, such as a flock of birds, exist naturally, and collections of different sizes will have different geometric properties. Nature self-categorizes and unfolds in patterns. Nature is intrinsically mathematical. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I think mathematics is \u201creal\u201d in a suitable sense, but I think Platonism takes its understanding of \u201creal\u201d the wrong way. There are a number of distinct issues that are sometimes lumped into the more vague overall question of whether mathematics is \u201creal\u201d. Philosophers recognize that in order to make progress they need to refine their concepts beyond such generalities. My impression is that philosopher have a hard time with this. \u201cRealism\u201d is one term I\u2019ve seen used by professional philosophers trying to get at the idea that mathematics (or some other domain) is talking about something that is \u201creal\u201d. This is a technical use of the word \u201crealism\u201d that does not match the colloquial sense in which a \u201crealistic\u201d view is an accurate or plausible view. Michael Dummett was one of the philosophers most famous for his efforts at resolving realism vs. anti-realism disputes in different areas (mathematics especially). Dummett pointed out similarities between the debates between realism and anti-realism in different domains. I suspect that there is more widespread interest in the dispute between moral realism and moral anti-realism than with the dispute between mathematical realism and anti-realism, and many people will have heard of questions about realism in such a context. Religious people try to argue against moral relativism, by which they mean roughly anti-realism with regard to morality. Many readers have probably witnessed this kind of debate. The discussion of morality is generally quite a mess, though, isn\u2019t it? I respect professional philosophers when they make an honest attempt to help sort out the issues. I once saw a paper that differentiated between four different kinds of moral \u201crealism\u201d. One was the claim that moral statements (\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t kill dolphins\u201d) are factual statements (not always correct of course). Another position was the claim that a moral statement is a description of a state of affairs. And so on. I\u2019m not trained as a philosopher and I find reading this kind of material difficult partly because of the number of nuanced distinctions that the philosophers try to make. [Edited to give a different example of a moral statement.] The discussion of realism vs. anti-realism with regard to mathematics seems like a similar kind of mess, although people tend to have less of an emotional stake in it. I\u2019m not a Dummett scholar, but from what I\u2019ve read of his books and papers, I get the impression that as he got older he gradually got to be less optimistic about realism vs. anti-realism being successfully resolved. One of the ways people will define \u201cPlatonism\u201d in mathematics is as the claim that mathematical objects \u201creally\u201d exist. Let\u2019s set aside what \u201creally\u201d means here for a minute. I consider the mere existence of mathematical objects to be much less of a problem than it typically is regarded as being. I like a line of argument Dummett pursued in defense of the existence of abstractions. In one of his papers, for example, he talked about what it means to say that the equator exists. (Sometimes people refer to unmarked lines like the equator as \u201cimaginary\u201d lines, which always sounds sort of odd to me. As far as I\u2019m concerned, having it drawn in chalk wouldn\u2019t make it any more of a \u201creal\u201d line in space.) He argued that our knowing the meaning of the various sentences which refer to the equator is sufficient for us to be justified in saying that the equator exists. I think this argument was inspired to some extent by Frege, who treated the sentence as a fundamental unit of meaning (and regarded the meaning of component parts of the sentence as being given by the way they contributed to the meaning of the sentence as a whole). So I don\u2019t think the existence, per se, of mathematical objects is as much of a problem as people have tended to make it. We can say while speaking mathematically that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and suspect also that there are infinitely many twin primes. I don\u2019t think we need to speculate then about whether prime numbers are \u201creally\u201d existing in some more powerful sense. They\u2019re not physical objects. They exist in a meaningful sense. It seems though that people tend to use \u201cPlatonism\u201d to mean a somewhat stronger claim than just that mathematical objects exist. Sometimes the phase \u201cPlatonic realism\u201d is used, and generally \u201cPlatonism\u201d seems to imply some kind of strong realism. As a person who favors constructivism, however, I see a strong contrast between this kind of realism, and merely considering mathematical objects to exist. I consider the existence of mathematical objects as tied to the meaningfulness of the language used to talk about them. Realism is hard to define (and probably has no single good definition) but seems normally to view the meaning of language to be somehow \u201cindependent of us\u201d. The Platonist feels an inclination to consider a question like the twin prime conjecture already to have an answer, grounded in some way in reality, even if we are not involved in any way. But I consider the meanings of the things that we say to be our own fabrication, and that we can\u2019t really divorce ourselves from the truth without depriving it of meaning for us. Among the criteria Dummett considered for realism are acceptance of the law of excluded middle and bivalence. The law of excluded middle says that for each proposition P, \u201ceither P or not P\u201d holds. Bivalence says that there are two truth-values that statements have, true and false. He decided that someone could accept the law of excluded middle in a domain while being an anti-realist, or rejecting it as a realist. It does seem however to have some degree of salience. Mathematicians tend to think of the law of excluded middle as an obvious deductive rule. Mathematicians who are realists about mathematics tend to accept the interpretation that one of the two alternatives, P or \u201cnot P\u201d, is already true, whether we know or even can know which one it is. This is one of the most direct ways in which typical realist philosophies of mathematics have a dissonance with constructivism. One can have a constructivist philosophy of mathematics and deduce consequences of the law of excluded middle, but it is a little eccentric. More often one wants to interpret \u201cA or B\u201d in a way that is better tied to the possibility of determining that A holds or that B holds. In this way we add to the meaningfulness of mathematics. One can circumvent all this to express constructively what one typically means by \u201cA or B\u201d in non-constructive mathematics, but isn\u2019t it nice to have the more meaningful claim as the default? Formalism is also generally deemed a kind of anti-realism. I wouldn\u2019t argue if someone wanted to call their brand of formalism a \u201crealist\u201d view, but formalism does one of the things that Dummett once described as usual for anti-realism. It attempts to reduce the truth of mathematical statements to something else. They are perhaps just tokens in some kind of game, or perhaps they stand for the possibility of providing a formal proof. So to a typical formalist, the proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis settles it as a question. To me, though, it has a status much like the twin prime conjecture, although the twin prime conjecture is likely to be provable from accepted axioms while the continuum hypothesis isn\u2019t. I find it hard to say in just what sense it is that I think \u201cis the continuum hypothesis true\u201d is a meaningful question. It is just that \u201cis there a function from the countable ordinals onto the real line\u201d seems like a real question to me (and I think the answer is \u201cno\u201d). I consider myself very much not a formalist because of issues like this. [As a constructivist one has to be somewhat careful with questions like the continuum hypothesis, because it is usually formulated by people who assume that the axiom of choice and law of excluded middle are true, which makes different formulations equivalent to each other. There are multiple possible constructive formulations, which are not necessarily equivalent. I believe I\u2019ve seen a constructive development of ordinal numbers, and that the way I\u2019ve phrased it is a reasonable construal of what people mean by saying the continuum hypothesis is true. Even if we liberalize what we mean by \u201cfunction\u201d I suspect the answer is still \u201cno\u201d. Obviously I can\u2019t offer a plausible axiom which validates my opinion here.] ",

All the concepts of truth, of philosophy or applicable to the degree of certainty relative to scientific knowledge, come from mathematical truth, the only invariable and indubitable certainty. Succinctly, materialism, which is the last phase for the construction of a solid philosophy, is based on scientific knowledge. And the scientific knowledge acquired by scientific work, is based on the idealization of mathematical models that not only describe the phenomena of the immediate experience of the senses, but predicts events accurately, and predicts intrinsic properties of matter. Since our knowledge of matter is more extensive and precise since we stop investigating nature with only the senses and the reflection, and we begin to employ these idealizations, we can suggest, with a lot of sense, that there exists a certain mathematical structure underlying the physical nature.

Mathematics exists, somehow, in some sense, and is useful. That\u2019s what really matters. It\u2019s possible that various different philosophical stances on the situation might themselves prove useful, but that\u2019s a very secondary matter compared to the utility of mathematics itself. Plato\u2019s stance on the matter is far from the only possible philosophical stance on it. I\u2019m very interested in certain philosophical stances on the nature of mathematics, but that\u2019s only because I\u2019m inclined to explore the possible utility of them. The utility of mathematics itself is beyond question, if we value our lives and the things we can get done on the basis of innovations derived using mathematics. ",
