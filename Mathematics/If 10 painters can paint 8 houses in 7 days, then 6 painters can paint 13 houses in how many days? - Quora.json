            "answer_text": "Suppose 6 painters paint 13 houses in x days We are given that 10 painters paint 8 houses in 7 days Hence 10 painters can paint 1 houses in (7/8) days. (NOTE:- no. of houses painted is directly proportional to no. of days) Now, 1 painter can paint 1 house in (7/8 * 10)=(70/8) days. (NOTE:- no. of painters is inversely proportional to no. of days) Now 6 painters can paint 1 house in ((70/8)/6)= (70/48)days Further, 6 painters can paint 13 houses in ((70/48)*13)= (910/48)days= 18 days and 23 hrs. Hence 6 painters take 18 days and 23 hrs to paint 13 houses. Hope it helps:-)\u2026..!!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "In questions like these, the first thing that you should try to do is to find out the total amount of work in terms of Man-Days or try and figure out efficiency on a unit basis.  In this question, we are given that 10 painters can paint 8 houses in 7 days.  => 10*7 Painter-days are required for painting 8 houses => 70/8 painter-days are required for each house.  We need to paint 13 houses, so total amount of work to be done = 13*70/8 painter-days. We have 6 painters available.  Time required = Work required / Resources available = (13*70/8) / 6 = 18.96 days So, it will take approximately 19 days to finish painting the houses.  ",
