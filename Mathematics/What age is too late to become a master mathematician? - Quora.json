            "answer_text": "A favorite example of mine is Paul Erdos. It\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t wait to become a \u201cmaster mathematician\u201d until he was older, but he continued to demonstrate an ability to make advances in mathematics until the day he died, at age 83. If you have what ever it takes to be a master mathematician, or can develop it, it\u2019s yours to do with as you wish. And as to whether you have or can develop it, there is simply no way to know unless you try. If you love math, try. ",
