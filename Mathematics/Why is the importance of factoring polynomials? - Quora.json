            "answer_text": "Factoring polynomials itself is not incredibly important. It is merely a method for solving a particular equation which may arise in certain applications. However, you\u2019ll find that polynomials show up in a lot of mathematics. For example, a linear differential equation has eigenvalues that are roots of its auxiliary equation. This is a polynomial and finding the roots of this polynomial allows you to solve the differential equation. Likewise, the eigenvalues of a matrix are solutions to a polynomial known as the characteristic polynomial. I suppose I would be remiss to not mention the Taylor Series of a function. An analytic function can be represented as a polynomial. In some cases a nasty function can be approximated by a truncated Taylor Series because solving polynomial equations is far easier than the alternative. This has many applications in physics and numerical analysis. ",

            "answer_text": "To find out the root It has been a well-established logic that goes like this: If [math]AB=0[/math] , then either A or B is 0, or both. In general, if [math]ABC...=0[/math], then what I should say is that they can\u2019t be all nonzero. To find out the root, one may consider the possibility that A is 0, B is 0, and so on. If you factor polynomials, then you can find out the roots of the polynomial quite easily, just by rendering the factors 0. To study number properties Give you an example on this: Prove that 9^999\u20131 is divisible by 8. So you need to factorize! How? [math]a^{999}-b^{999}=(a-b)(a^{998}+a^{997}b+...+b^{998})[/math] In this case, just substitute a = 9 , and b = 1, then the logic is that the a-b is of course suggesting that 8 is a factor, but you also need to consider the long bracketed expression is not zero, and it isn\u2019t, so there you can prove it.
