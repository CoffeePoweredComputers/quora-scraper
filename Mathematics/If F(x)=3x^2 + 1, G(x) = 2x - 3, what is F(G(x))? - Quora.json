            "answer_text": "Good question. This problem is part of a series of function composition and decomposition. Given: F(G(x)) or f o g, where F(x) = 3x^2 + 1 and G(x) = 2x - 3. So, to start, you can go right in to the solving but for my explanation, I will first substitute G(x) with 2x - 3. Therefore, I get:F(G(x)) = F(2x-3)Since this is F(G(x)) and what we have is F(2x - 3) we can (and must!) plug-in 2x-3 for x, no matter how strange this might seem. We acquire the following:F(2x-3) = 3( 2x - 3)^2 + 1From here, we can simplify or leave the answer as is.Our final answer is therefore: 3( 2x - 3)^2 + 1",
