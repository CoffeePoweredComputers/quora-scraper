            "answer_text": "They deal with two different problems. Nyquist\u2019s theorem deals with the maximum signalling rate over a channel of given bandwidth. Shannon\u2019s theorem deals with the reconstruction of a signal from a finite number of samples. Since the results are similar, people often associate Nyquist\u2019s name with the sampling theorem. But this is not correct. For an explanation of Shannon\u2019s sampling theorem, see: Nikhil Panikkar's answer to What is the Nyquist (Shannon) sampling theorem? Nikhil Panikkar's answer to Why is the Nyquist(Shannon) sampling rate exactly 2 times the maximum frequency? Where is the proof for that constant 2? Here I will explain Nyquist\u2019s theorem. Consider a rectangular pulse used for On-Off keying(ASK) as for example, in a telegraph:  The spectral characteristics of the pulse should match that of the channel. If the pulse spectrum is broader than that of the channel, then it will be attenuated. The inverse relation between the time and frequency domains implies that the pulse would be spread out in the time domain, causing pulses in adjacent symbol periods to overlap - a phenomenon called intersymbol interference. This makes detection difficult. Shown below is the ISI arising from using a rectangular pulse to represent the symbols. The frequency spectrum of the rectangular pulse is a sinc whose frequency spectrum extends up to infinity. Any bandlimited channel will hence attenuate it, causing the signal to spread out in the time domain.   Nyquist proposed using a bandlimited pulse for transmission, instead of a a time-limited pulse. This would shift the problem of intersymbol interference to the time domain(thus rendering filter design easy.)  But then, how would you deal with ISI in the time domain? Nyquist obeserved that, the zero crossings of the sinc pulse, occur at a spacing of t = 1/2B seconds . So if the sinc pulses are transmitted at a rate of 2B pulses per second, then the peak of each sinc pulse, will occur at the first zero crossing of the preceding sinc pulse, making them easy to detect. This is the Nyquist theorem, that the maximum number of bandlimited pulses that can be sent through a channel of bandwidth B, in a second is 2B. This rate is the maximum possible, because we\u2019ve used a pulse whose bandwidth is exactly equal to the channel bandwidth. If we use a pulse with a smaller bandwidth, then the time domain sinc will get broader, scaling up the location of the zeroes and hence decreasing the signalling rate possible. ",
