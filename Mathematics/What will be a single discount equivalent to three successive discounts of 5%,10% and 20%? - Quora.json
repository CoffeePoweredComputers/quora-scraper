Let selling price be \u20b9100 First Discount 5% = 5 \u00d7 100/100 = \u20b95 Price after first discount = \u20b9100 \u2013 5 = \u20b995 Second discount 10% on price after first discount = 10/100 \u00d7 95 = \u20b99.50 Price after second discount = \u20b995 \u2013 9.50 = \u20b985.50 Third discount 20% on price after second discount = 20/100 \u00d7 85.50 = \u20b917.10 Price after third discount = \u20b985.50 \u2013 \u20b917.10 = \u20b968.40 Single disocunt combining all three discount will be = 100 \u2014 68.40 = \u20b931.60 As selling price taken was \u20b9100 therefore discount will be 31.60% Answer: Single disocunt combining all three discount is 31.60% ",

            "answer_text": "The three successive discount means first one discount then second and so on. Let us assume the first discount is 5%, second 10% and lastly 20%. ( In practice I see that discounts are offered on the printed price during sales in reverse order ie first 20%, next 10% and lastly 5%.) Let us say the price is 100. After a discount of 5% the price becomes (100\u20135)= 95. On this 95 a discount of 10% the price becomes 95-9.50=85.50. Again on this price of 85.50 a discount of 20% the price becomes 85.50\u201317.10=68.40. Thus the final price after the successive discounts is 68.40 on an initial price of 100. Therefore the net discount on a price of 100 is 100\u201368.40=31.60%. If the successive discounts are offered the other way the prices will be first 100\u201320=80; next 80\u20138=72 and 72\u201314.40=57.60. The final net discount in this case will be 100\u201357.60=42.40%. ",
