Say we are looking for real-number solutions: we then have [math]x (\\frac{3}{4}x) = 10800[/math] Multiplication on the real numbers is commutative: [math]x (x\\frac{3}{4}) = 10800[/math] And associative: [math](x x)\\frac{3}{4} = 10800[/math] [math]\\frac{3}{4}[/math] has a (right-) multiplicative inverse [math]\\frac{4}{3}[/math], so use it: [math]((x x)(\\frac{3}{4})\\frac{4}{3} = 10800 \\frac{4}{3}[/math] Associative property again: [math](x x)(\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{4}{3}) = 10800 \\frac{4}{3}[/math] We know what multiplicative inverses do: [math](x x)1 = 10800 \\frac{4}{3}[/math] We know what [math]1[/math], the multiplicative (right-)identity does: [math]x x = 10800 \\frac{4}{3}[/math] We haven't forgotten how to do arithmetic with fractions, and we know what [math]{}^2[/math] means: [math]x^2 = 14400[/math] [math]x^2 = (-x)^2[/math] (true in any ring), so if [math]x[/math] is a solution, so also is [math]-x[/math]. [math]x = \\pm \\sqrt{14400} = \\pm 120[/math] ",
