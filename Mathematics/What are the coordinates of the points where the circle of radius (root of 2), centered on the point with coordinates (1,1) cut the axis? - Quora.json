            "answer_text": "The equation of a circle centered at (1,1) and with radius sqrt(2) is square(x-1)+square(y-1) = square (sqrt(2)) when the circle cuts the y axis, x=0. substituting x=0, we get y = 2 or 0. When the circle cuts the x axis, y = 0. substituting y=0 we get x = 2 or 0. Hence we find that the circle cuts the axes at (0,2) and (x,0). Note that the circle passes thru the origin (0,0) also. ",
