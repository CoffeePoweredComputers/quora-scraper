Indeed, since 1777=(177)111777=(177)11 you can first calculate the remainder of 177=410338673177=410338673 modulo 35 which is 3, and then you calculate the remainder of 311=177147311=177147 modulo 35 which is 12. With Excel, the formula to calculate the first remainder is 17^7 - 35*INT(17^7/35) and the formula to calculate the second remainder is 3^11 - 35*INT(3^11/35). Easy! ",
