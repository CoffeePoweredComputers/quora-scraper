            "answer_text": "Assuming everything is one part, The question is: The number of prime factors of (3\u00d75)\u00d712(2\u00d77)\u00d710\u00d710\u00d725 The result is: 63,00,000. The last digit of 6300000 is 0, which means it is even. Therefore 6300000 is divisible by 2: 6300000 = 2\u00d73150000 The last digit of 3150000 is 0, which means it is even. Therefore 3150000 is divisible by 2: 3150000 = 2\u00d71575000: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d71575000 The last digit of 1575000 is 0, which means it is even. Therefore 1575000 is divisible by 2: 1575000 = 2\u00d7787500: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d7787500 The last digit of 787500 is 0, which means it is even. Therefore 787500 is divisible by 2: 787500 = 2\u00d7393750: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d7393750 The last digit of 393750 is 0, which means it is even. Therefore 393750 is divisible by 2: 393750 = 2\u00d7196875: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d7196875 196875 is not divisible by 2 since 196875 is odd and 2 is even: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d7196875 (196875 is not divisible by 2) The sum of the digits of 196875 is 1 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 36, which is divisible by 3. This means 196875 is divisible by 3: 196875 = 3\u00d765625: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d765625 (65625 is not divisible by 2 since 196875 is not) The sum of the digits of 65625 is 6 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 24, which is divisible by 3. This means 65625 is divisible by 3: 65625 = 3\u00d721875: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d721875 (21875 is not divisible by 2 since 65625 is not) The sum of the digits of 21875 is 2 + 1 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 23, which is not divisible by 3. This means 21875 is not divisible by 3: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d721875 (21875 is not divisible by 2 or 3) The last digit of 21875 is 5, which means 21875 is divisible by 5: 21875 = 5\u00d74375: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d75\u00d74375 (4375 is not divisible by 2 or 3 since 21875 is not) The last digit of 4375 is 5, which means 4375 is divisible by 5: 4375 = 5\u00d7875: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d75\u00d75\u00d7875 (875 is not divisible by 2 or 3 since 4375 is not) The last digit of 875 is 5, which means 875 is divisible by 5: 875 = 5\u00d7175: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d7175 (175 is not divisible by 2 or 3 since 875 is not) The last digit of 175 is 5, which means 175 is divisible by 5: 175 = 5\u00d735: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d735 (35 is not divisible by 2 or 3 since 175 is not) The last digit of 35 is 5, which means 35 is divisible by 5: 35 = 5\u00d77: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77 (7 is not divisible by 2 or 3 since 35 is not) The last digit of 7 is not 5 or 0, which means 7 is not divisible by 5: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77 (7 is not divisible by 2, 3 or 5) No primes less than 7 divide into it. Therefore 7 is prime: 6300000 = 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d73\u00d73\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77 There are 5 copies of 2, 2 copies of 3, 5 copies of 5 and 1 copy of 7 in the product: Answer: 6300000 = 2^5\u00d73^2\u00d75^5\u00d77 There are 13 Prime factors, of which 4 are distinct.
