Using that information, you can just replace your OR gates with 2 NOR gates. The end result will look like this (I made it in paint, so it won\u2019t look pretty):  ",

So we just need to invert it a second time. But a inverter, or NOT can be implemented by tying the inputs of a NOR together, so this could be implemented using two gates from a 74x27 (triple 3-input NOR gate), e.g.:  ",
