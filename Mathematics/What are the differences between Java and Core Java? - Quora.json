            "answer_text": " Java is a programming language, which has been influenced by the C language. It derives much of its syntax from C and C++, however it has fewer low-level facilities than either. Java is a general-purpose programming language that is designed to have fewer implementation dependencies as compared to previous languages. It is concurrent, class-based, and an object-oriented language It is intended to let application developers \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. JAVA Java is hypothetically everywhere, thanks to its readability and simplicity. From mobile applications to websites, game consoles to datacenters, from mobile phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere. Millions of devices throughout the world use Java as a core programming language. Even all native Android apps come built-in with Java and several companies use Java as server-side scripting language for backend development. Many applications and websites require you to install Java because it\u2019s fast and secure. What started out simply as an Internet language has become one of the most versatile cross-platform programming languages ever developed. The best part it runs on literally any device without the need for recompilation, hence the slogan \u201cWrite once, run anywhere\u201d. CORE JAVA It\u2019s the most basic version of Java which sets the foundation for all other editions of Java plus a set of related technologies such as CORBA, Java VM, etc. Core Java refers to a collection of libraries rather than just the programming language. It\u2019s the purest form of Java primarily used for development of general desktop applications. Simply speaking, it refers to the subset of Java SE technologies which consists of both general purpose API\u2019s and special purpose API\u2019s. It provides the core functionality of Java with the deep knowledge of the Java language itself. The main difference between Java and Core Java is that Java is a programming language, while Core Java refers to a computing platform.

            "answer_text": "Java is a multipurpose and general computer programming language that is, class-based, object-oriented, as well as concurrent and it has been specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. The language has been intended to let application developers use the basic feature that it has been touted for \u201cwrite once, run anywhere\u201d (WORA), and this means that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java with the implementation of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) without the need for recompilation. Core Java, this is the most basic and the most standard version of Java that you can encounter. It\u2019s also called the student's level java and is taught in schools. It is the purest form of Java, a basic foundation for all other editions. The language mainly consists of a wide variety of general-purpose APIs (like java.lang, java.util) and it also contains many special-purpose APIs. J2SE is mainly used to create applications that run under the Desktop environment. It consists of all the basics of Java: the language, primitive data types, Arrays, Streams, variables, Strings Java Database Connectivity(JDBC), and much more. This is the standard, from which all other editions came out, according to the needs of the time.  The main difference between Java and Core Java is that Java is a programming language, while Core Java refers to a computing platform. Core Java is commonly used as slang to refer to the Java Platform Standard Edition. A computing platform allows the developed software to run. It contains computer architecture, operating systems, and Runtime libraries. It also contains hardware architecture and a software framework, as well as an application framework. There is three main computing platform released by Sun Microsystems, which was eventually taken over by the Oracle Corporation. The computing platforms are all based on the Java programming language. These computing platforms are: Java SE, i.e. Java Standard Edition. It is normally used for developing desktop applications. It forms the core/base API.Java EE, i.e. Java Enterprise Edition. This was originally known as Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, or J2EE. The name was eventually changed to Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Java EE in version 5. Java EE is mainly used for applications that run on servers, such as web sites.Java ME, i.e. Java Micro Edition. It is mainly used for applications which run on resource-constrained devices (small scale devices) like cell phones, most commonly games.Java SE or Core Java, as it is commonly known is one of the most widely used platforms of the Java programming language. It is based on the object-oriented Java programming language. It is mainly used for the development and deployment of portable applications for desktop and server environments. Essentially, Java SE is a platform specification. It defines a wide range of general-purpose APIs. This includes Java APIs for the Java Class Library, as well as the Java Language Specification and the Java Virtual Machine Specification. ",
