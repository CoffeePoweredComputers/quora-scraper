            "answer_text": "Cardinality in graph theory refers to the size of sets of graph elements that have certain properties. For example, a matching in a graph is a set of edges, no two of which share a vertex. The cardinality of a matching is the number of edges it contains. Optimization questions might relate to cardinality. For example, it\u2019s easy to construct small matchings\u2014after all, [math]\\emptyset[/math], the matching with no edges, is a perfectly good one. But it\u2019s harder to construct large matchings, so an interesting question is: given a graph, what is the cardinality of the largest matching? Contrast that with the weighted matching problem: given a graph and nonnegative weights on the edges, what is the matching with largest total weight. The vertex cover problem asks for a set of vertices such that every edge is incident to one of the vertices in the set. Large covers are easy, so the interesting optimization question is: what is the cardinality of the smallest vertex cover? Compare with the minimum-weight cover problem. ",

            "answer_text": "Cardinality is usually given by some integer. It can represent a number of things. For example cardinality of a set is number of elements in a set. In terms of graph theory, this can mean node or edge set. Also, cardinality can be used along side some of other common terms. For example node degree or cardinality. ",
