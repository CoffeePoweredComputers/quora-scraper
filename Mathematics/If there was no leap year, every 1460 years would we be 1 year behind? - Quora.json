            "answer_text": "The uncertainty in exactly what you mean by \u2018behind\u2019 leaves some aspects of this open to interpretation, but the basic idea is that the year would be \u2018adrift\u2019 by about one year over that time. And this is close to what happened to cause the current Gregorian calendar to be introduced. When Julius Caesar decided to re-organize the Roman calendar, things were a bit of a mess. [And no, not because they counted years backwards in BC.] The original Roman calendar had 365 days and no leap years, and so it was drifting. The Roman year was supposed to start at the vernal equinox in March, but lacking a leap day every 4 years, their New Years Day was falling one day further from the equinox every 4 years. After a few centuries the calendar was disconnected from what the seasons were doing, and so was not a good guide for agriculture and management of things that needed to connect to seasonal activity. As this is the entire purpose of a calendar, things were getting a bit messed up. So Julius re-organized the calendar. He changed the months, so that they alternated between 30 and 31 days (the Romans though odd numbers were lucky and even numbers unlucky, so they alternated those months), juggled things a bit to get the start on the vernal equinox, and named a month with 31 days after himself (July). You will note that the original names of the months September, October, November and December include Latin numbers, and really mean \u2018Seventh-Month,\u2019 \u2018Eighth-Month,\u2019 \u2018Ninth-Month\u2019 and \u2018Tenth-Month,\u2019 as they were those months if you start in March. February got a day cut off and the leap day inserted at its end every 4 years. Julius Caesar\u2019s successor, Augustus, tweed it a little more by adding a day to his birth month to make it have an odd number of days, and taking one more from February to compensate. He also renamed his birth month after himself, so we have August with 31 days, and February with 28 (plus one in leap years). This Julian calendar was rather better, and it worked for quite a few hundred years, but there was still some annoying drift going on. Smaller than before, but still shifting the days about with respect to the equinoxes. By around the late 16th century, this was becoming a nuisance, so as the only body with any level of control over the European world was the Roman Catholic Church, they undertook to look into it. The found that the year wasn\u2019t exactly 365.25 days long, but a little less. That \u2018little less\u2019 had been accumulating and was now throwing the calendar off the seasons by a couple of weeks. So they tweaked the Julian calendar. They decided to move the start of the calendar away from the equinox (which was a sensible move, as it would move around by a day or two on the new calendar) and start it at about the beginning of the church\u2019s year, which was Christmas. They decided that they would keep the same months as the Julian calendar, and do all the adjustment in February. So the year now began with January, and the four months at the end of the year just had to put up with mis-numbering. The critical changes were to have one day fewer every 100 years, which means that century years are not (in general) leap years. That still wasn\u2019t quite right, so they added one extra day every 400 years. This made the calendar work comfortably within a day of the seasons, and it will only drift off because the current approximation isn\u2019t quite right some time around 3500 AD, and only then by a day. So it works for about 2,000 years. So the rule now is that every year whose number can be evenly divided by 4 is a leap years and get a 29th of February, except if it is an even \u2018century\u2019 year (e.g., 1700, 1800, 1900, etc.), when it only gets a leap day if it is evenly divisible by 400. So 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not leap years, but 2000 is. The new calendar was named the Gregorian calendar, since Pope Gregory was the guy running the church at the time it was released, and every one was encouraged to shift, and synchronize their calendars to the church\u2019s one. This took some time to implement, the last major country to change being Russia, which didn\u2019t shift until after the Communist Revolutions in 1917. At this point, there were a couple of weeks off the Gregorian calendar, which leads to the question of whether the various revolutions are October or November Revolutions, as there were two different calendars going at the time: the Russian Julian calendar and the rest of Europe on the Gregorian calendar. Everyone had to drop a couple of weeks with the shift, which was implemented at different dates in different countries (over a period of decades!), which naturally led to some confusion and angst, but humanity managed to survive and carry on. So if you are comparing dates of various events and using contemporary records, you may find that views from different countries use rather different dates around this period. So the \u2018behind\u2019 of your question is really the question of synchronizing the calendar with the seasons, and the fact of the Earth\u2019s year (time for one trip around the Sun) not being an exact number of days is what causes the drift that the Gregorian calendar is designed to compensate for.

            "answer_text": "Our CALENDAR would have shifted. But the year, as defined by the time it takes our planet to orbit the sun would be pretty much the same. Also, as a leap year every four years causes an overshoot (the Gregorian skips 3 leap years over a 400 year period). So\u2026in 1460 years the Julian would slip 365 and the Gregorian would slip about 354. The main take away here is the earth is going to do what the earth is going to do. If we want our calendar to match the earth, we gotta adjust it appropriately. If we don\u2019t, it won\u2019t match the earth. The days on our calendar will slip. But again, the year one experiences\u2026the days one experiences across the seasons will be the same no matter what the calendar shows. ",

            "answer_text": "Close, but about 1506 years. The Julian calendar is a bit off; the Gregorian calendar only has 97 leap days in 400 yrs (and isn\u2019y QUITE perfect either.) Using the 97/400 figure and the tropical year gives about 1506 years to be a year in error. Using best estimate of tropical year (but it slowly changes over time) 365.242189 days/0.242189 days gives 1508 years. ",
