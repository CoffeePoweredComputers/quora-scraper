            "answer_text": "Imagine learning to drive a car in middle school. The drivers-education teacher set up traffic cones in a parking lot to practice driving in a straight line, making turns, signaling before making turns, perpendicular parking, parallel parking, etc. The students also have written tests in traffic laws. However, they are never allowed to drive in traffic, because they are too young for drivers' licenses. The 8th-graders would have a little excitement in operating a powerful machine, but most of the class would be boring. That is what math classes are like. A better written analogy written by Paul Lockhart is A Mathematician\u2019s Lament (https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). Of course, children know that driving a car opens up interesting places to visit. They travel by a car driven by their parents. My two daughters learned the elegance of mathematics simply from hanging around me. My younger daughter told me, \"You treat mathematics as art.\" They tutored their classmates in high school and college, because they had no fear of mathematics. Sadly, most families do not learn to treat mathematics playfully or artistically, because the boring math classes have been around for generations. I was an exception because my father was an engineer who gave us children science kits, such as Lectron electronics sets (Raytheon Lectron - Wikipedia) and Estes model rockets (Estes Industries - Wikipedia). I learned the math along with the science. Some mathematics is so amusing it is called recreational mathematics (Recreational mathematics - Wikipedia). Another childhood influence on me was Martin Gardner's collections of Mathematics Games articles (a few at Mathematical Association of America and more diverse material at Martin Gardner Home Site). Other mathematicians such as Ian Stewart continued Martin Gardner's tradition.

I agree, there\u2019s no mystery, nearly all mathematical problems have been solved, you just need to apply the formula that someone else came up with. I\u2019m not sure I can convince you, but there are certainly useful and common applications of mathematics. Of course, with the existence of the internet, you can always ask \u201cHow long does it take to do 80 miles at 70 mph?\u201d on quora. Certainly 40 other people have solved their homework that way.

Mathematics is not irrelevant numbers, and no one is pretending these \u201cirrelevant numbers\u201d will solve everyday problems. A lot of everyday problems are solved by very relevant maths. Think about it, you can pick anything in the world, and if you look close enough, there is an insane amount of math that went into its creation. Math is also the foundation of the sciences and technology. Without math at some level, Quora would not exist for you to use today. Sorry about my rant, but try to understand why math exists, and how much it helps your life before dismissing it as irrelevant, useless or difficult. ",
