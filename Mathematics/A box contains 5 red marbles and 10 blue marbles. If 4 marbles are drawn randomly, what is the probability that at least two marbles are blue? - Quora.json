            "answer_text": "I concur. It is 12/13. It is the sum of the probabilities of 4 blue, 3 blue, and 2 blue. 4: 10/15 * 9/14 * 8/13 * 7/12 = 2/13 (or 14/91) 3: 4*(10/15 * 9/14 * 8/13 * 5/12)= 40/91 (where 4 is the number of possible positions for the red (first, second, third or fourth) and 5/12 represents the probability of drawing a red. If you had the red in the third position, it would be 10/15 * 9/14 *5/13 * 8/12, so it\u2019s the same thing. 2: 6*(10/15 * 9/14 * 5/13 * 4/12)= 30/91 (6 possible positions for red: first/second, first/third, first/fourth, second/third, second/fourth, third/fourth) The sum is 84/91, which is 12/13. There is an easier, shorter alternative as well. That is found by calculating the probability that less than 2 marbles (1 or 0) is blue and subtracting from 1. To do that, find the sum of the probabilities of 4 red and 3 red marbles: 4: 5/15 * 4/14 * 3/13 * 2/12 (I wrote them as 1/3 * 2/7 * 3/13 * 1/6 to make it easier to handle) = 1/273 3: 4*(1/3 * 2/7 * 3/13 * 5/6)=20/273 (where 5/6 represents 10 blue marbles out of 12 remaining and 4 is the number of possible positions). Sum is 21/273 =1/13. 1- 1/13= 12/13 ",
