            "answer_text": "Honestly, if your mother is saying or implying you are stupid, that is not OK. It is not your parents\u2019 role to tear you down, and doing so causes lasting damage to self-esteem and confidence. Each person has their own strengths and weaknesses. And each person grows in their knowledge and ability at their own pace. Personally, I\u2019m really quick at math and can do lots of things others can\u2019t \u2026 but I never try to imply that anyone is stupid or slow or lazy because they can\u2019t find the square root of 77 in their head. That wouldn\u2019t be helpful, nor would it be kind. That person might be able to make a layup shot in basketball, something I tried and tried and tried but never accomplished. That person might be able to remember the faces and names of people he just met, something I simply cannot do. I expect that you have some strengths, whether you know them now or not. Your parents should work with you to build up your strengths and productively make progress on your weaknesses. ",
