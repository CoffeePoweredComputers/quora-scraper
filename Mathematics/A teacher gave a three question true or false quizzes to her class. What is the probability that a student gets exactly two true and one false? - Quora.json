            "answer_text": "The question doesn\u2019t make sense. I suspect that where you say, \u201cexactly two true and one false,\u201d you really mean, \u201cexactly two right and one wrong.\u201d But maybe you mean to ask whether the student gets exactly two questions for which the correct answer is \u201ctrue.\u201d Or maybe you mean to ask whether the student answers exactly two questions \u201ctrue\u201d regardless of whether that is the correct answer. None of that helps us answer the question because we don\u2019t know what the questions are. We don\u2019t know if they are hard. If this is a social studies class, and the questions are about conflict of laws, and are written in Latin, then the student may get them all wrong. Maybe you meant to stipulate that the student is guessing at the answers, and therefore has a fifty percent chance on each one. And if you further stipulate that are interested in exactly two correct answers out of three, then we can do the problem: The odds are the same as flipping a coin three times and getting exactly two heads: 50% is the odds of the first coin being heads. If it is heads, then we don\u2019t care what the second coin is; so there is a 100% chance that it will be either heads or tails. Then, the third coin has to be the opposite of what the second coin was, and there\u2019s a 50% chance of that. 50% x 100% x 50% = 25%. Now there was also a 50% chance that the first coin was tails. If it was, the second and third coins have to be heads. So, 50% tails, 50% heads, 50% heads. 50% x 50% x 50% = 12.5% Now we add together the odds of getting exactly two heads starting with a heads and the odds of getting exactly two heads starting with a tails: 25% + 12.5% = 37.5% Now I check my answer against the others. They all agree that the answer is 3/8, so we\u2019re good. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no way to know. There are 8 ways to answer 3 TF questions. Of those, 3 have two T and one F. So, 3/8. But that\u2019s nonsense. There is no way to know because students don\u2019t guess randomly, so the probability depends on the correct answers to the three questions and the difficulty of the test. ",
