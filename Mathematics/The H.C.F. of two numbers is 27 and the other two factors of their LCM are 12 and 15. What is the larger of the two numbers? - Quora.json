            "answer_text": "The H.C.F. of two numbers is 27 and the other two factors of their LCM are 12 and 15. What is the larger of the two numbers? LCM is always certain multiple of HCF and since we have been given that the HCF is 27 and other two factors of LCM to be 12 and 15, we con conclude that HCF is 27*12*15 = 4860. As such there are several possibilities with regards to two numbers such that their LCM is 4860 and their HCF is 27, as shown below: 27 and 4860 108 and 1215 135 and 945 243 and 540 You can see, larger of the two numbers is naturally different per your choice of 2 numbers. Pick your pair and accordingly you will get the larger of the two numbers. ",
