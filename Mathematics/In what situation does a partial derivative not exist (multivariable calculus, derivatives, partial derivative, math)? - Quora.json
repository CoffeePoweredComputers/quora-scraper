            "answer_text": "I am struggling to see the relevance of the word \u201cpartial\u201d in your question. Suppose z=f(x,y), and we are wondering whether \u2202z/\u2202x exists at a particular point (x\u2081,y\u2081). Then define g(x) = f(x,y\u2081), and ask yourself whether g\u2019(x\u2081) exists. If one of these derivatives exists, so does the other, as they are the same thing. Conversely, if one of these derivatives does not exist, then nor does the other. Or am I missing something? ",
