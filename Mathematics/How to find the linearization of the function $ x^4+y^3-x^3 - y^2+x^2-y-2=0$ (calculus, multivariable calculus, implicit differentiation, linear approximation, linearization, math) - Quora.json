            "answer_text": "(1) It forms a surface. In 2-D calculus y=f(x), a linearization is a tangent line. So in 3-D, you will get a planar equation that is tangent to the surface at that point. YOU NEED AN (a,b) or location around which to be linear/tangent to your surface. But roughly L(x,y) = f(a,b) + f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b) ",
