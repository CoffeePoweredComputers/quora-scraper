            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat is three million six hundred and forty eight thousand nine hundred?\u201d The \u201cand\" in the middle is a very popular colloquial word used to indicate addition of two numbers is to be done, with the first number to be added indicated before the \u201cand\" and the second number to be added indicated after the \u201cand\". Before the \u201cand\" we have \u201cthree million six hundred\", for which standard integer numeral form is 3\u202f000\u202f600. After the \u201cand\" we have \u201cforty-eight thousand nine hundred\" for which standard integer numeral form is 48\u202f900. Therefore, the sum is: 3\u202f000\u202f600 +\u202f\u2007\u202f\u200748\u202f900 = 3\u202f049\u202f500 \u201cAnd\" is appropriate in numbers only to indicate addition or the separation between the integer and fractional parts of a number; otherwise ambiguity arises.

            "answer_text": "It's a number. I can't find anything special about it, so it's probably not a famous number. It's higher than 3 million, so that would be 3,000,000. The next part is 600 thousand, so that's 600,000. Then it's 40 thousand, which is 40,000. Then 8 thousand, so that's 8,000. Finally, you have 9 hundred. Which obviously is 900. Add them all together and you get 3,648,900. 3 million, 648 thousand, 9 hundred. ",
