            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a good one that comes out of Evans\u2019 PDE book:  I share this because it is among the most elegant problems I have seen in the book and in my partial differential equations coursework. It says that a solution to the Dirichlet Boundary Value Problem for Poisson\u2019s Equation is a minimizer for a certain energy functional (see the picture) among all twice continuously differentiable functions which have the given boundary data. The proof isn\u2019t terribly hard to follow but it is quite beautiful and worth the time of every advanced undergraduate/graduate math student to see at least once, even if analysis/PDE isn\u2019t the area of specialty. It is also a foundational concept in the calculus of variations and in the more modern fractional PDE theory. A fellow grad student at the University of Tennessee says he uses this principle frequently in his research in fractional calculus. [1] L.C. Evans \u201cPartial Differential Equations\u201d 2nd Edition, American Mathematical Society, 2010. NOTE: I wrote a bit about the uses of Evans and some other popular PDE books.

What is the paths that the flies follow. Now if you want to make the problem a bit more interesting, imagine a cubic room with flies in each of the 8 corners and they fly towards the left hand fly in the opposite corner ( floor-ceiling, ceiling-floor).
