            "answer_text": "3. Using the BODMAS - UK (Brackets, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction) order of operations. Also known as PEMDAS - US (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction). The answer is 3 because BIDMAS - Brackets, indices, division, multiplication, addition and then subtraction. Division is first so 4 divided by 2 = 2 and then you have to do the addition which make the equation 2+ 1. So when added together 2 + 1= 3! So the answer is 3. (4/2)+1[math](4/2)+1[/math] First 4 divided by 2, then add 1 to the result. Doing this, we get: 4 / 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 So the required answer is 4 / 2 + 1 = 3. HINT: Please read the working out because it will help you with other sums! ",

After this ADD 2 to 1, since adding is the next thing after division in P.E.M.D.A.S 4). 2+1=3 The final answer is 3. P= Parenthesis E= Exponents M= Multiplication D=Division A=Addition S=Subtraction OR G= Grouping items example, parenthesis ( ) and brackets [ ] E= Exponents M= Multiplication AND division from LEFT to RIGHT S= Subtraction AND addition from LEFT to RIGHT ",
