            "answer_text": "As usual with proof by induction, show that the statement is true for n = 1 (or n = 0, if you like); assume it is true for n = k; then show that in that case it is true for n = k + 1. Here we\u2019ll take n = 0 as the starting point: 1 x 2 x 3 = 6 so that is OK. Assume n = k works, so assume 6 divides (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3) Then put n = k + 1, which gives us (k + 2)(k + 3)(k + 4). We can rewrite this as (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3) + 3(k + 2)(k + 3). Then the first expression is assumed to divide by 6, and since either k + 2 or k + 3 is even, the second expression divides by 6 also. Hence if n = k works, n = k + 1 does also, which is the standard proof by induction. Since we know n = 0 works, we have shown that in that case so does n = 1, and in that case so does n = 2, and so on without limit. ",

The number is divisible by [math]2[/math] or not / even or not.The number is divisible by [math]3[/math] or not.Now let's assume that the number A. [math]n[/math] Is Even ie [math]n=2k[/math] ie [math]n+2=2(k+1)[/math] ie [math]n+2[/math] is divisible by [math]2[/math] B. [math]n[/math] Is Odd ie [math]n=2k+1[/math] ie [math]n+1=2k+1+1=2(k+1)[/math] ie [math]n+1[/math] is divisible by [math]2[/math] C. [math]n[/math] Is divisible by [math]3[/math] ie [math]n=3k[/math] ie [math]n+3=3k+3=3(k+1)[/math] ie [math]n+3[/math] is divisible by [math]3[/math]. D.
