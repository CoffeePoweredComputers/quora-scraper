            "answer_text": "There is a quarter for each of the 50 states. There is also one for DC and for Puerto Rico, making 52. There are more, however. In 2010, the USA started a project that would add 56 more quarters. They've nearly finished it, having currently added 50 of them. There is also the generic quarter. Currently, there are 103 quarters, but in 2021 there will be 109. Edit: I am assuming you meant types of quarters (with unique designs), not the literal number of quarters that have been manufactured. ",
