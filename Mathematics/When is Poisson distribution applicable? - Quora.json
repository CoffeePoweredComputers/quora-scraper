            "answer_text": "The Poisson distribution expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time and/or space if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. As a result the distribution is often used in counting processes where the average rate of the events happening is known and individual events occur independently of each other. Examples include: # of phone calls received by a call center per hour, # of decay events per second from a radioactive source etc. Source: Poisson distribution ",
