            "answer_text": "What math classes should I take to preform well on the SAT?I am debating about taking Algebra 3, Probability and Statistics, or Pre-CalculusI haven\u2019t taken that in 50 years or tutored anyone in 35 years so my impressions would likely be irrelevant. However, simply do this: Go get a sample test (any of the decent SAT study guides should have one) that allows you evaluate your weaknesses by subject. Take the test until timed conditions (couple hours at most) without pre-study. See where you weaknesses over lap with you prospective courses subject matter. Also consider if you weakness can be easily addressed with self-study and consider you secondary level weakness remaining against the likely value of the classes. For instance if you are terrible at Statistics questions but there are only a small percentage of those or perhaps they are all pretty elementary you might defer the Statistics class. ",

            "answer_text": "Currently, the math component of the SAT heavily favors what would fall into the three-course algebra sequence (Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and what is referred to in various schools as either Algebra 3 or Precalculus; as your school seemingly offers courses by both names, you should ask a teacher/counselor at your school what differentiates those courses). SAT aims for 33% of the content on the exam to fall into what is called \u201cHeart of Algebra\u201d (Algebra 1 and a lot of Algebra 2), and another 28% into \u201cPassport to Advanced Math\u201d (topics such as non-linear functions, which you would see a lot of in Alg3/Precalc). So, take Alg3/Precalc? Not so fast. Most of the remaining SAT content is categorized as \u201cProblem Solving and Data Analysis\u201d \u2014 and Data Analysis is, essentially, a typical Probability and Statistics course. Since your math class decision will be heavily influenced by what best prepares you for the SAT, you best course of action is to purchase an SAT study guide (College Board publishes an excellent one which we use in the prep course I help teach; the ones from Barron\u2019s, Kaplan and Princeton Review are also very good), read through the math sections, and take a practice exam under simulated test conditions (no distractions, adhere to time limits, etc.). The study guides have SEVERAL practice exams, so burning one as a pretest won\u2019t hurt your overall prep. ",
