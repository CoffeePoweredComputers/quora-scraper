            "answer_text": "Euclid\u2019s Postulates were a set of rules Euclid believed to be so fundamental that they could not be proven using any other basic rules. Essentially, to prove something, you need to make assumptions, as otherwise you have nothing to start with. For Euclid, these assumptions were as follows: 1. A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points. 2. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. 3. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center. 4. All right angles are congruent. 5. If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines are not parallel, and must intersect. Everything else Euclid did was based on these postulates, and proven as long as these are correct. Additionally, anything you prove using these postulates can also be used in future proofs, as it is equally true. These are the building blocks for what is known as \u201cEuclidean Geometry\u201d; essentially, geometry on a rectangular plane. Euclid himself believed that the fifth postulate, the so-called \u201cParallel Postulate\u201d, could be proven using the other four postulates (making it a theorem, not a postulate), but it turns out to be a crucial part of what makes this Euclidean. Take it away, add a different postulate, and you can get hyperbolic geometry, which is a completely different field of geometry. ",
