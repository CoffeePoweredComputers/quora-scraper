            "answer_text": "AC+ BC + BA\u2019 details you can use a brute force method where you expand out all the terms which I will do later or you can use a more intuitive method The intuitive method ( I use A\u2019 for A not) For this expression (A +B)(A\u2019 +C)(B+C) to be true all terms in parenthesis must be true if A is true the first term is true and C makes the second and third terms true So you have (A)(C)(C)= AC being an answer But the first term is true if B is true and As makes the second term true, the B term makes the third term true So (B)(A\u2019)(B) = A\u2019B is also an answer If B is true and C is true all three terms are true (B)(C)(B+C) = BC Thus AC+ BC + A\u2019B makes the above statement true The brute force method works as follows expand the first two terms (A +B)(A\u2019 +C)(A+ B) = ( AA\u2019 +AC + BA\u2019 + BC)(A + B)now AA\u2019=0 expand again (AC + BA\u2019+ BC)(A+B) = AAC + BA\u2019A + ABC +ABC +BBA\u2019 + BBC AAC = AC, BA\u2019A =0, BBA\u2019 = BA\u2019, and BBC = BC, two ABC terms are redundant AC + ABC +BA\u2019 +BC AC(1 + B) + BA\u2019 +BC = AC + BA\u2019 +BC same as we got earlier ",
