            "answer_text": "Let M denotes the marked price of the given article. Let P1 & P2 denote the prices of the article after first & second discounts respectively. It is mentioned that the marked price of the given article is Rs 800. So we have M = 800 \u2026\u2026 (1) It is mentioned that the first discount is 25%. So we have, P1 = (1 - 0.25)*M = 0.75*M = 0.75*800 [from (1)] or P1 = 600 \u2026\u2026 (2) Let X% denotes the second discount. So we have, P2 = (1 - X/100)*P1 = (1 - X/100)*600 [from (2)] It is mentioned that the price of the given article is Rs 540 after two successive discounts. So we have from above, (1 - X/100)*600 = P2 = 540 or 1 - X/100 = 540/600 = 0.9 or X/100 = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1 or X = 10 Therefore the second discount is 10%. [Ans] ",
