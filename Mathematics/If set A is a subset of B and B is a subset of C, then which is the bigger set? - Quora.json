            "answer_text": "If A is a subset of B, it is still possible for the set A to be the same as the set B, so it is quite possible that all three sets in this question (A, B, and C) are identical \u2014 in which case, none of them are \u201cbigger\u201d than the others. However, if A is a \u201cproper subset\u201d of B then A is \u201csmaller\u201d than B (because A will contain some elements that are not elements of B). if we re-word the question, inserting \u201cproper\u201d in front of the word \u201csubset\u201d, then the question would read: \u201cIf set A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, then which is the bigger set?\u201d and the answer is \u201cC\u201d. Note also that infinite sets have somewhat different behavior, and the term \u201cbigger\u201d cannot be used to compare the \u201csize\u201d of infinite sets (such as the number of even number or the number of primes). However, I\u2019m assuming that the question assumed finite sets. I might add that radical notions such as the above (i.e about sets that could be proper subsets of themselves) once got a post-graduate math student kicked out of school by his professor. That student, Georg Cantor, is now well known for his works on infinities, but nobody remembers the Prof. ",

            "answer_text": "Since you have claimed that they are subsets, I'll be assuming that there is no possibility of them being proper subsets. In this case, C would be the biggest set as it has the most elements in it. Followed by B then A. n(A) <= n(B) <= n(C) Edit: Thanks Graeme Foster for pointing out the error:) ",
