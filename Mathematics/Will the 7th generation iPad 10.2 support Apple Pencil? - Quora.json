            "answer_text": "Yes just like the 6th Gen. iPad (9.7\u2033), the new 7th Gen. iPad also supports Apple pencil (first generation). But don\u2019t get too excited about the 7th Gen. iPad. Apart from the display size (10.2\u2033) and support for Apple smart keyboard, there is no difference between the 2019 and 2018 iPads. Both have same A10 Fusion chip, 2 GB RAM, no true tone display, 1.2 MP front camera, 32GB storage in base variant. If I were you I would go with the iPad Air (2019) as it has better internals and 64GB storage. So I\u2019d suggest you to ignore it and go for Air. I have also discussed this in my Apple event 2019 video:  ",
