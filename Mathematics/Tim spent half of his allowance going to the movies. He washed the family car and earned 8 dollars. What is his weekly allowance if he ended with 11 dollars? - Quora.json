            "answer_text": "2020\u201310\u201329: Maybe it was a long time ago and he had $2 left of his birthday money. Otherwise he tended to live pretty much week to week off of his allowance and small sporadic earnings. (Which were not large enough to report on taxes. In fact he had never earned enough yet to pay taxes anyway.) And maybe he spent $1 at the movies, because it was \u201cbuck night\u201d at the drive in, and his girlfriend shared her pop and popcorn. And to keep it simple she even drove and paid for the gas and paid her own $1 to go to the movie. She kept things simple like that because she wanted to watch the movie from the front seat and not feel like she owed Tim anything. (Even though he occasionally did wash her car for free. About the only \u201cgenerous\u201d thing he would do without having to be asked. But enough about Diane. Word is she eventually got back together with Jack.But I digress.) So the $1 Tim spent at the movies means his allowance was $2. But he only had $1 of that left. He earned $8 washing the family car, as we have been told. So that makes $9.But he ended with $11? Where did the other $2 come from? Oh, yah, remember? There\u2019s the $2 remaining from his birthday money. His 17th. Which was a couple months before, on April 1. So the math checks out. His allowance is $2. (Actually it \u201cwas\u201d $2, \u2026 back then. It\u2019s been a while. Tim no longer gets an allowance, but he has a small inheritance.) At the rate Tim was going his parents were concerned that he would never move out, or even own his own car. And that\u2019s probably why they never increased his allowance. But Tim eventually grew up and is living a relatively normal life. Relatively, considering that he moved to the city, where his \u201cpersonal life\u201d is personal, and he is just liberal enough to be on the city council. Fortunately for Tim he \u201cgrew up\u201d before the age of video games, (and social media! But I digress \u2026 ) ",

It\u2019s not clear that he is only spending from one week of allowance, he could be saving or have made more over time, so the problem is not solveable. If you said \u201cWhat is his weekly allowance if he started with 0 this week and ended with 11 dollars?\u201d then you can tell that he made 22 dollars this week and the 8 dollars amount is irrelevant or just the last thing he did. Otherwise you simply can\u2019t tell, the question is written wrong or missing a vital detail. ",
