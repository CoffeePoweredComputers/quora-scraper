            "answer_text": "First, i\u2019ll mention here, how do the following 2 Set Operations, differ from each other. \u2018Complement' & \u2018Difference' For finding the \u2018 Complement' of two sets, one set should be super set, & the other should be its sub set. Then we select the elements , which are present in super set but not in sub set. This forms the complement of the sub set. But there is no such restriction while finding the \u2018 Difference' of two sets. We may find the difference of any 2 sets X & Y, one may be subset or may not be subset. X-Y = the set of elements, which are present in X but not in Y. Now, To Prove: ( A - B) = B' - A' Let, U = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} A = { 4, 8, 9, } B = { 1, 3, 7, } Therefore, A' = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, } ( elements present in U but not in A) B' = { 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, } ( elements present in U but not in B) So, B\u2019 - A' = { 4, 8, 9, } ( elements present in B' but not in A' ) And, A- B = { 4, 8, 9, } ( elements present in A but not in B ) [ Hence Proved] ",
