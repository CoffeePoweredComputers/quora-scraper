            "answer_text": "Hi, I have taken the SAT twice, and scored a 760 once and a 800 once on the math section so I\u2019m well suited to answer this. The simple answer to this is VERY. It\u2019s very easy to score a perfect 800. The SAT is just a combination of basic level maths, with most of the questions involving formulas instead of thinking, this is why almost all students who take any kind of accelerated or hard math courses in their high school will most certainly score an 800 or atleast get quite close to it. If you do math on a regular basis for school, then you should be good to go. Just make sure your extra careful, there are often confusing questions. All the best :) ",
