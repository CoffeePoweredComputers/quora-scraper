            "answer_text": "I personally used the skills garnered in an Algebra 2 and Geometry class. The one thing I was always good at was proofs in Geometry, but my 450/800 on the math SAT portion was an accurate reflection of my math self esteem coming into college (thankfully the ACT went better for me).  I took symbolic logic 1, but this was a strictly proof type of class.  Don't be silly like me and think that because Philosophy doesnt require math or science that this is an indicator of a blow off major. I remember having this attitude and putting off Gettier's 3 page paper critiquing justified true belief.  I was sorry for that...pop quiz that day in my TOK class!  I think the one thing that would make philosophy more intuitive is a beginner's math proof course (Proof analysis?). A lot of the courses before hitting the middle to end of Calc 2 focus more on process and memorizing how to solve certain types of problems. If there were a way to integrate proofs into the curricula.. Anyway, you need higher levels of math usually if your focus is very seriously interdisciplinary (something like philosophy of science or math). It's not something required by an undergrad philosophy curriculum ",

            "answer_text": "As everyone else who has academic background in philosophy has said in one way or another, math is not used in philosophy. One might study math in philosophy, and often does as an example of a priori knowledge. One might need to know some math if they want to do philosphy of science and understand the science they are studying. In logic as well, one does not need to know math, although it is a similar discipline. There is a branch of logic called mathematical logic which crosses into math but studies the logical foundations of math and math proofs. Some fields of math also cross into philosophy and logic, include set theory, number theory, type theory, category theory, and topology, to name a few. So the division can get a little fuzzy. But many contemporary philosophers, depending on their field, interest, epistemology, style, skills, and so on, barely even use logic in philosophy. I suspect that more mathematicians use logic and philosophy in math than the other way around. ",

            "answer_text": "(not a professional philosopher) I would imagine it varies massively by which areas you specialise in.  I encountered very little formalisation in ethics and political philosophy, some to a moderate amount in philosophy of religion and quite a lot in philosophy of mind.  I imagine there is lots in philosophy of physics, philosophy of maths (obviously). I had studied maths up to GCSE level.  I found the maths in degree level microeconomics challenging, but none of the formalisation in philosophy especially so.  But then, I didn't do especially formal modules and never went beyond first order logic. ",

            "answer_text": "Varies drastically.   In a sense all maths and languages are based on the same logic with the same flaws.   Many philosophers look at the fundamentals and the general landscape.  Others are far more detailed in their understanding.   Either way, most philosophers worth their salt have the mental capability to pick up the advanced maths and physics they need as they go.   I personally scored a 780 on SAT-M (out of 800) and took roughly six semesters of calculus (Differential Equations II and several specialized classes) and countless amounts of physics along with my philosophy and business disciplines.
