            "answer_text": "To solve this, best way is to re-write equation in form of y=mx+c so, first equation will becom y=2x-7/2 m1=2 second equation y=4x+3 m2=4 For being parallel, m1 should be equal to m2 For being parallel, m1*m2 = -1 Since, the equation does not follow any of the two criteria. We can say that lines are neither perpendicular nor parallel Graphical solution is given below.  ",

            "answer_text": "Neither parallel nor perpendicular. We can deduce that by following methods easily. 1. We have equations: [math]4x-2y =7[/math] [math]4x-y =-3[/math] Comparing with these two [math]a_1x + b_1y = c1[/math] [math]a_2x + b_2y = c2[/math] We know that two linear equations intersect if [math]\\frac{a_1}{a_2} \\ne \\frac{b_1}{b_2}[/math] [math]\\frac{4}{4} \\ne \\frac{-2}{-1}[/math] It means they have unique solution. (Further knowledge: if[math]\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{c_1}{c_2}[/math] then we have infinite solutions(coincident lines). if [math]\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{b_1}{b_2} \\ne \\frac{c_1}{c_2}[/math] then we have no solution(lines are parallel)). 2. We know that if product of two slopes is [math]-1  [/math]then we say that two slopes are perpendicular and if the slopes are same we say they are parallel or may coincide. In our case slope of [math]4x-2y =7 [/math] is [math] m_1 = 2  [/math]and for [math] y=4x+3 m_2=  [/math]is [math] 4  [/math]and their product is not [math] -1  [/math]and they are neither equal so they are intersecting. 3.Also you can plot them and figure out if they are intersecting parallel or perpendicular. So as you can see below they are neither intersecting nor parallel.  ",
