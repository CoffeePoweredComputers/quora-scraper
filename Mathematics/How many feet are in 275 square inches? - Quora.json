            "answer_text": "First, You didn't say what shape the 275 sq\" was, so I'm assuming a rectangle. Secondly, you needed a measurement of one side or a diameter. Since I assumed a rectangle, if one side is .001\" long then the other side would be 275,000\" or 22,916 ft or 4.34 miles. If you use 10ft (120\") on one side then the other side would be 2.29\" or .19 ft. Please think of what you asking and have it make sense before you publish it. ",

            "answer_text": "How many feet are in 275 square inches? A lot go through my mind when I look at this question. A home work question? A question arising from a practical situation? A question from a curious wandering mind? A riddle? If square inch does not seem like the right unit when you have 275 of them, then you want to use square foot, not foot. 1 square foot = 12 in x 12 in = 144 sq in 2 square feet = 288 sq in So we know 275 sq in is just under 2 sq ft If you ask google, you will get 275 sq in = 1.91 sq ft.
