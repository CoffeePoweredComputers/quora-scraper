            "answer_text": "\u201cOnly sometimes, still, no doubt, It\u2019s hard to see, it all works out\u201d A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sidesA right-angle triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle A right-angle triangle says nothing specifically about line lengths of the lines. So obvious;ly a right-angle triangle is also a scalene triangle. Unless it isn\u2019t. Of course, that\u2019s hardly surprising. Nearly every triangle is a scalene triangle. It\u2019s almost like saying every honey bee is a worker,. Unless it isn\u2019t. So what are the alternatives? I can think of isosceles triangles and equatorial triangles. Obviously no equilateral triangle can be a right-angled triangle, since you can\u2019t have three right angles in a triangle, at least not in Euclidean geometry. How about an isosceles triangle? Can a right-angled triangle also be isosceles? Only if you can find a way to make a triangle with a right angle and two equal sides. There\u2019s gotta be a way\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Right triangle has one 90 degree and two 45 degree angles. And that means two angles are the same size. Scalene triangle is a triangle where no angles are the same and al of the sides are different lengt. For example you have triangle with 60, 40 and 80 degree angle. So if i put it together - Right triangle has 2 angles the same size and scalene triangle has all the angles in different sizes. ",
