            "answer_text": "Two sets are said to be disjoint if they have no element in common. Equivalently, disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets,( as they have no element in common) while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not.(as the element 3 is in common). The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. In figures;  First consider the case where the sets A and B are disjoint. In that case, The number of elements in the union (A\u222aB) is simply the sum of the number of elements in A and the number of elements in B: |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B|. [ |A|\u2192no of elements in A and other notations mean similar]. But if A and B overlap, then the latter formula does not hold because, we are counting the elements in the intersection (A \u2229 B) twice. Compensating for that leads to the given formula: |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| \u2212 |A \u2229 B|. [ Note : n(A U B) is also denoted as |A U B| ] In above figure of Disjoint sets; Elements in (AUB)=elements in (A)+ elements in (B). In above example, union of disjoint sets is; Element set in A + Element set in B ={1,2,3,5,7,9}. ",

Union in set theory means the combination of elements of A and B but without repetition. Hence n(A union B) represents the number of elements in the union set. Since they both are disjoint sets and have no elements in common the number of elements in the union set will be the sum of the number of elements in A and number of elements in B. using formula it can be explained as follows: n(A U B)= n(A)+ n(B)- n(A intersection B). since n(A intersection B) is 0 the formula can be reduced as n(A U B)= n(A)+ n(B)- 0 which is same as n(A U B)=n(A)+ n(B) ",
