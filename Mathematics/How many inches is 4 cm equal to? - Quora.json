            "answer_text": "That depends on the frame of reference but in general and with imperial metric it\u2019s around 1,5748 inches. for example Napoleon is both 5\u20322\u2033 and 5\u20326\u2033 but either is only around 170cm I would advice you to use Google or Computational Knowledge Engine in the future both can easily calculate this for, Google might be the better choice here since google can understand more variations and forms of what you want to achieve due to it being geared towards understanding you while wolfram alpha demands proper notation. \u201c4cm in inches\u201d would already make google give you the correct answer without linking to any url ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of good answers. Multiply by 1 (with units attached). The identity in question is that an inch is DEFINED as 2.54 cm. So both (1 inch/2.54 cm) == 1 == (2.54 cm/1 inch). You\u2019re converting from cm, so you want the \u201ccm\u201d units to be on the denominator so it will cancel out. 4 cm = 4 cm X 1 = 4 cm X (1 inch/2.54 cm) = 4/2.54 inches. You can do the arithmetic any way you like. ",
