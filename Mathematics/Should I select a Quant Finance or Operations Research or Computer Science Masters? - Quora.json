Based on your goal to\u201d setup a firm specializing in analytics for the high tech sector (think health, space exploration)\u201d and since you already have an MBA, I recommend the following: Statistics with R to give you a solid statistics foundationBusiness Analytics to give big data analytics for all business professionals, including those with no prior analytics experience.Business and Financial Modeling is designed to help you make informed business and financial decisions that first course is Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling. (It is not clear if you need to complete the rest of the specialization.)In a nutshell, I have sent you back to Wharton to pick up enough background to pursue your goal. When you complete the three recommendations, you will have enough information to make a well informed decision, whether or not you pursue a graduate certificate such as Stanford Quantitative Methods in Finance Graduate Certificate or another degree beyond the MBA such as a DBA or a PhD in Quantitive Finance. Bottom line: I do not recommend any master\u2019s degree program. Instead I have given you a path where you can pick up enough background to pursue your goal of \u201csetting up a firm specializing in analytics\u201d. The Stanford Certificate would be a specialization in Statistics. Note: It would have been helpful if you have given me a link to your MBA program so I can better assess your background. ",

            "answer_text": "This might sound surprising to you, but if you want to work on Quantitative Finance, you should major in Computer Science rather than actually in Quantitative Finance. Investment banks love to hire engineering and CS students rather than finance for these positions due to the difficulty of the major and the universal aspect of quant skills. ",
