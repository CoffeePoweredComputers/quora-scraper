Fine, but you must think we are gods to know what actually are the weights of those pumpkins. Sorry, just had to add my comments and hope others will be able to respond to your question. ",

It will cost you the combined weight (in pounds) of the three pumpkins times 0.75 (in dollars). Not knowing the weight, that\u2019s the best I can do. ",
