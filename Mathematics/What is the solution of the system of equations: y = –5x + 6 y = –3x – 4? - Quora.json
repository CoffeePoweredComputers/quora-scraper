            "answer_text": "The first equation is y=-5x+6y and the second equation is y=-3x-4. Add -6y to both sides of the first equation and get y-6y=6y-6y-5x. Do the arithmetic and you get -5y=-5x. Divide both sides of this equation by -5 and you get y=x. Now use this result in the second equation (that is, insert y=x). This yields x=-3x+4. Now add +3x to both sides of that equation and get x+3x=3x-3x+4. Once again do the arithmetic and get 4x=0+4 or 4x=4. Divide both side of this final equation and the result is x=1. So the answer is y=x=1. ",
