            "answer_text": "\u201cSure\u201d is a ridiculously high bar. I can\u2019t be sure where my socks are. I took them off a while ago and threw them in the laundry basket, but the cats or my fiancee\u2019 might have moved them since. So asking for \u201csure\u201d is never reasonable. We can, however, be highly confident (just not \u201csure\u201d) that there is \u201ctrue randomness\u201d in the sense of events that cannot be predicted by any amount of antecedent information. Consider radioactive decay. We know that atoms of long-lived radioactive isotopes are not just similar to each other, but identical. That is, there is literally nothing that could tell them apart under any circumstances. God\u2019s own self could not tell us the difference between one radon atom and another. We know this not because we are simply making random stuff up, the way philosophers do, and asserting our prejudices as fact, but because the partition function of ideal gases\u2014which is the count of the number of ways the energy in the gas can be partitioned among different states\u2014does not obey the form prescribed for distinguishable particles: For three particles (each of which can be in one of three possible microstates) and no multiple occupancy, there would be one microstate of the system for indistinguishable particles and no multiple occupancy, namely the microstate a, b, c. However, there would be six such microstates for distinguishable particles. Thus if we count microstates assuming that the particles are distinguishable, we would overcount the number of microstates by N !, the number of permutations of N particles. \u2014 from http://stp.clarku.edu/notes/chap6.pdf So that\u2019s very strong evidence that particles are really indistinguishable, not merely fairly similar. And while the partition function sounds like a pretty esoteric animal, it is important to calculating things like heat capacity and entropy, which are relatively commonplace. This isn\u2019t some fancy theoretical beast, but something our very lives depend upon: if all the currently indistinguishable particles in the universe suddenly became distinguishable we would quite likely die. So when we take a collection of radon atoms, every single one of them is identical. Again, not just similar, but identical. But they all decay at different times. Since there is nothing\u2014literally nothing\u2014that can be used to distinguish the atoms, it follows from this that their decay is \u201ctruly random\u201d, and not merely caused by something so complex we can\u2019t get our fuzzy little heads around it. So hopefully that answers your question. It is worth raising the further question, though, which is: why does this matter to you? Consider the above argument. It is as straightforward as I can make it, but it still uses a good deal of stuff that wasn\u2019t known until the 20th century. Although the fact of indistinguishable particles does have some profound real-world consequences, we had to delve into the realms of some pretty esoteric theory to demonstrate this because the existential consequences of true randomness in everyday life are nil. That is why this debate has gone on for centuries and had to be finished by scientists asking hard questions of the universe rather than philosophers interrogating their imagination. So why do people care so deeply about this question? True randomness is a fact about reality that has made zero impact on anything until the 20th century. If you choose to disbelieve my argument above and go on incorrectly believing that reality is not truly random, it will not change a single decision you make in any walk of life other than pure physics. If you were teaching thermodynamics or quantum mechanics that would be bad. In every other respect it makes no difference. We know this, because if it did this question would have been settled long before those fields of study were invented. So why does it matter? ",

            "answer_text": "Before we jump too far down the \"quantum mechanics as the basis of physics and is random\" argument rabbit hole, I want to clear some things up. Now technically, randomness does NOT exist. Everything in the universe, so far as we know, follows deterministic rules (yes, even you quantum physics!) (edit- the idea here is that the observed phenomena in \"our\" version of the universe, though best modeled by statistical equations, must always occur in the same manner as it has: certain possible outcomes occur because of some driving force (and while this mechanism could be \"dice\", it seems more likely a deterministic layer belies this phenomena (\"God doesn't play dice\") rather than other (equally likely, statistically speaking) possibilities- due to some innate driving factor. An extended interpretation of the multiple worlds theory can also be interpreted as the space of possible universes being definite (though the given observation of any particular state of the universe being \"random\". Since in this model, all states contribute to all future states, these phenomena aren't when considered holistically, random.)  The problem comes down to us being able to perceive these phenomena. At a certain point, us simply perceiving a situation effects it. This is known as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and is definitely worth checking out. The uncertainty principle pretty much says that to know a particle's position with certainty n, a wave of equal or greater fidelity must be applied to n (which in turn modifies its expected trajectory in an unpredictable manner). Quantum mechanics treats different possibilities statistically because of the uncertainty principle (you can't measure excitation in a field without measuring, and thus exciting, the field). (And BTW, though not directly related to the question, something can come from nothing- well, a something and an anti-something. If you are interested, check out virtual particles and annihilation of particle-pairs. This is also the science behind Hawking black hole radiation!) ",

            "answer_text": "Under our current best knowledge of the universe, the clicking of a Geiger counter is essentially and fully random. No superintelligent being and no advance in physics is expected to be able to predict it. At school in the 1960s, I was taught that there were two sorts of random numbers: pseudo-random numbers: apparantly random numbers generated by very complex mathematical algorithmsquasi-random numbers: apparently random numbers generated by unpredictable physical processes, such as the fall of lottery balls(Or it may have been the other way around.) However, Quantum Mechanics, our best current theory of the universe, stipulates absolutely random events, via Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle. Some events are not only unpredictable, but absolutely unpredictable \u2013 if anyone at all knows these events in advance, even God, that changes the events so they do not happen. And these are not necessarily very small events. The clicks of a Geiger counter, triggered by single beta-particle emissions, are random in this sense. There have been strenuous and unsuccessful efforts for nearly 100 years to eliminate this essential randomness from our physics. It does seem to be a feature of the actual universe. Prior to Quantum Mechanics, our theory of physics was deterministic. If you knew every state of every particle in the universe, with total precision, you could predict the entire future unfolding of the universe. However, the universe is a chaotic system. Even the slightest ignorance about a single particle quickly amplifies to an ever greater unpredictability of the consequences. Not knowing about the butterfly wing leads a week later to not being able to predict the hurricane. Given that we can\u2019t ever know anything exactly, the deterministic system provides essentially random outcomes. ",

Things that are merely pseudo random are deterministic. Events that are said to be objectively and inherently unpredictable will always be unpredictable (regardless of how much knowledge we have). These types of randomness are indeterministic, that is, un-caused. There is absolutely no way to distinguish between what seems random at a given moment from a truly random event. Subjectively speaking, from our limited perspectives, they are both unpredictable in the present moment. So at any given moment, we cannot discern pseudo random events from truly random events. However, pseudo random events may possibly be revealed to be predictable at a future date. We do know for a fact that pseudo randomness exists. The history of science is replete with examples of events that were once thought to be truly random but were later found to be only pseudo random (seemingly random). If more knowledge becomes available, events can later be found to be pseudo random. We don\u2019t actually know if true obejctive and indeterminate randomness exists in the physical world. How could we know? Objective randomness is an idea which cannot be confidently proved. Pseudo random events have the potential to be discovered. I\u2019ve known quite a few people who claim that true indeterministic randomness exists in nature. What they fail to understand is that there is no way of knowing what we don\u2019t know. If something seems truly random, we can never be sure if it is merely pseudo random or truly random. People have lived their entire lives believing that things were random. And centuries later the events were found to be predictable, deterministic and pseudo random. Quantum physicists have reached no consensus about whether underlying reality is deterministic or random. True indeterministic randomness is unfalsifiable. This should be a red flag. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it seems like there are two concepts under discussion: (1) true randomness and (2) unpredictability.  Science presupposes causal determinism, meaning it presupposes that any state is completely determined by preceding states. This kind of a system is incompatible with true randomness, which Yohan John herein defines as \"the absence of structure or pattern\" because the absence of structure or pattern implies that a given state is unaffected by a preceding state, not to mention completely determined by a preceding state. Even if you could allow a fraction of true randomness within a deterministic system - in the hopes of some sort of compromise -  the effects could branch out in unpredictable ways (as discussed below) and the ultimate goal of tracing all effects to their causes would be impossible - resulting in an non-deterministic system. Essentially science would be doomed to a paradox if it admitted to having truly random components. Whether science is correct in presupposing that the universe is deterministic, I think is beyond the scope of this conversation because for many of us, our main way of understanding the universe is through science. The question must be answered using methodology outside of science or induction and the correct answer may be difficult to grasp or accept or may be useless to many of us.  One conclusion we can make, however, is that if the universe is not deterministic or that there does exist true randomness, then science is fundamentally wrong. And I imagine many of us do not want this. Nonetheless pseudo-randomness is possible in the form of unpredictability within deterministic systems. Chaos theory provides a mathematical explanation for how unpredictability can arise in a system that is sufficiently complex.  An example of such a chaotic system, taken from wikipedia, is the double pendulum. Small differences in the initial conditions of a chaotic system result in unpredictable outcomes. And this is still within a deterministic system.    Thus, within scientific discourse randomness means either a very complex pattern that has yet to be discerned or a chaotic system that will never be discerned, but not true randomness.  Tl;dr true randomness cannot be proven scientifically because it would be paradoxical, however concepts like unpredictability and chaos have already been proven to exist. ",

            "answer_text": "To explain this, let me construct an imaginary version of the most basic RNG possible. I'm going to describe it as completely as I can, but the exact details (or whether they are possihble) are less important than the imaginary result. Say you have a disk spinning on a frictionless axis, so that it will maintain the same angular velocity indefinitely. A line having no width, passing through its center, divides the disk into halves labeled 0 and 1. A sensor mounted next to it can determine where a fixed point, that is next to the rim of the disk, is at any instant in time. You press a button to determine the instant, and the result shows up on a display as a 0 or a 1. The point is that the number you get depends on the spin rate, and any knowledge you have about the position of the disk at known time(s) in the past. Press the button once without any prior knowledge, and you get what can only be considered to be a random 0 or 1. Press it a second time, at a precise time interval after the first, and you get another (because you don't know the spin rate). But the two values give you some information about the spin rate - there are some ranges that it can be in, and others that it can't. So the third time you press the button, you might be able to say one result is more likely than the other. And the more times you press it, the better your knowledge becomes. Eventually, you can be almost certain of the result. But to person who doesn't have that knowledge, it is just as random to them as your first result was to you. \"Random\" can be considered to be a measurement, much like length or time. But what it measures is intangible - it measures your lack of information about a system. \"True randomness\" can be defined as the lack of any knowledge that would allow to you favor one result over another.  By this definition, it does exist - but only for those who lack the knowledge. The facts themselves always exist, whether or not anybody knows them, and even if they can't be known by any means. Everything happens for a set of reasons, even television static and radioactive decay. So nothing can be \"truly random\" in the absolute sense. Any seeded RNG that a computer uses is just a more complicated version of the disk I described above. Your ability to treat it as \"truly random\" - even though it cannot be in the absolute sense - depends on your purposes, and how you break the link to past information by re-seeding. ",

Cause and effect is an inherent property of time and space and a presupposes \u201carrow of time\u201d This whole area is moot, so I will not get diverted to relativity here. True randomness is simple an uncaused effect. In other words a First Cause. I capitalize this because this would be (and is) another way of defining God. True randomness does not exist without a First Cause. God (for the sake of arguement) by definition is the First Cause. He is uncaused and eternal\u2026again BY DEFINITION\u201d. Let us accept this definition to avoid \u201cendless regression\u201d or as Lawrence Kraus references \u201cturtles all the way down\u201d God is not caused and therefore the ultimate RANDOM. Or shall we say appearence of random (arbitrary would be another descriptive word for this) God can act two ways 1) in response to His creation within a cause and effect system that He created. He can interact with us. Or 2) He can create without any antecedent cause. He can act in this way whenever He wishes. When he acts \u201cwithout cause\u201d ,He is exercising His unique characteristic of RANDOM. He is actually acting from His own character \u2026 BEING. We are given a clue Or allusion to this in Genesis when Moses asks God for His name. God's answer alludes to His BEING\u2026simply that\u2026 IAM THAT IAM GOD IS\u2026that is it. He has no cause and is eternal being\u2026 but with characteristics He has shared. Although God has an infinite quality He defines Himself in finite ways for our benefit. He has even confined Himself to a human body I'm Jesus Christ. Bottom line: God can initiate anything and inject it into creation as He being the unique cause. This would appear random, arbitrary, possibly supernatural and or miraculous. He minimizes this in His created world on a classical physic scale, but maximises this random on the quantum level. Quantum superposition is the set of divine possibility. This collapses in both causal and a- causal dynamics ",

            "answer_text": "Theoretically yes. In practice or if you consider a real life physical scenario/world it would be impossible to replicate randomness to it\u2019s fullest extent. This is because the theoretical/mathematical premise behind true randomness considers all possible outcomes having the exact same probability of happening. Only God or some sort of divinity could achieve this. Although this doesn't contradict the theory that \"randomness\" can be measured. Can one understand, explain and predict a certain outcome of happening? As i stated before, you could actually measure \"randomness\", but to explain why something happens exactly the way it happens, would be more difficult, if not completely impossible. Independently of a outcome distribution type being more random or less random, it would not be expected that a human being could actually understand, explain and predict a certain outcome distribution type or a certain sequence of happening. We as human beings are limited in our capabilities, intelligence, comprehension, etc. Possible outcome distribution types or sequences are influenced and conditioned by an almost infinite group of factors and variables. To fully understand why something behaves the way it does, one would have to simultaneously embrace and dominate all these variables. Admitting true randomness would be synonymous of admitting that there are no variables or external factors that are influencing and restricting the outcomes. That is why true \"randomness\" is a theoretical concept, because in a real physical world/scenario it would be incomprehensive that a generation of outcomes wouldn't have any conditional or influential elements or variables. It would be almost as being in a complete empty void. In order to measure randomness the specific sequence is not relevant. Any possible sequence will have the same probability of happening if we consider our premise to be true. Randomness can only be measured through the outcome distribution type of a certain sample/set. You have several possible outcome distribution types. Some outcome distribution types could prove themselves being \u201cmore\u201d likely random or \u201cless\u201d likely random. Even if you theoretically consider something truly random, the most likely random outcome distribution type would not prove randomness 100%. This happens because since there are several possible outcome distribution types and every single outcome distribution type is associated with several possible sequences, no single sequence can represent being 100% or 0% random.Thus theoretically, although we could consider something truly random, we would never be able to prove it 100%.

            "answer_text": "Let's try to attack this from an interesting point of view. First of all, let us look into what statistics is. In short it is a means to making decisions when we have incomplete information. This is why statistics is very useful today; our everyday world is full of systems where we simply haven't got tools that are powerful enough to efficiently collect and model the entire problem. Pretty much everything except for very specific problems are of this character. From this point of view, what would randomness be? It is anything where the model either can't collect information, or simply makes an approximation for efficiency. Tossing dice may very well be possible to model completely, though it requires either a bizarre setup that is rarely viable in the real world, or, some fantastic capability to gather information about the process, on the fly. The simple solution: Dice are random! Great, now we can assign probabilities for outcomes instead of trying to predict the precise outcome that will happen. Another example would be to predict an outcome that depends on previous outcomes; one could speak of the probability of getting the same result twice in a row when rolling dice. Again, the underlying \"problem\" is the same: We lack information so we call the results random and introduce probabilities to the best of our abilities so that they predict reality well. At this point it is useful to notice something. Statistics helps us make decisions when we lack information. Introducing randomness in the model is precisely a way to admit \"I don't have enough information regarding X, so I'll consider X to be random.\" Randomness is synonymous with incomplete information. More often than not, it is a way of saying \"I don't know.\" However, to say that something is really inherently random is the same as saying that the information is not only unavailable due to us being sloppy or having bad tools, it is to say that the information doesn't exist. This is precisely what quantum mechanics predicts regarding our world. Some properties about particle Y (that we may take for granted) simply does not exist, until Y interacts with its surroundings and that particular information becomes apparent. Either that, or there are hidden variables (that break locality! this is generally frowned upon). ",

            "answer_text": "This looks like a pointless, unanswerable metaphysical question, but in fact it is rather poignant. The Fundamental Assumption of Statistical Mechanics, for instance, is: \u201cA system in thermal equilibrium is a priori equally likely to be found in any one of the fully-specified states accessible to it.\u201d This is a pretty strong statement of randomness, and yet its consequences are magnificently borne out empirically as well as theoretically. Who, upon first hearing this assertion, is not suspicious? Surely the atoms remember their history and know where they are supposed to go next! We save our credibility in this example by the sneaky stipulation of \u201cin thermal equilibrium\u201d. But consider an analogous principle applied to Economics: If it were true that an economic system (such as a country and its net wealth) obeyed the equivalent assumption that all financial transactions are basically random, then one could define an \u201ceconomic temperature\u201d (measured in e.g. dollars) and predict a Boltzmann distribution of the annual income of citizens. Except for some flattening at the low end (due to social assistance) and an extended tail at the high end (due to a localized failure of the assumption of randomness, I think) that is exactly what we have in every country practicing \u201cfree enterprise\u201d. And yet no Economist would ever entertain the outrageous premise that produces this outcome. One of the fundamental assumptions of Economics is that all participants are \u201cintelligent agents\u201d attempting to maximize their own profits. So randomness has profound consequences, but how can we directly test for it? Every computer has a random number generator in its software. It turns out to be extremely difficult to generate truly random numbers. Google it! ",

            "answer_text": "One has to be careful here. The word has several meanings and the meanings are important in different ways. One definition has to do with how short a program can produce the series of values. The longer the program necessary, the greater the degree of randomness. A good illustration of this is the degree of compression one can get by putting the string of values through a data compression program. Random data should come out with effectively no compression at all.  No matter what compression procedure is applied.However, it is not always clear that there is no such procedure that could compress the data if you just know the right one. For example, suppose I give you a string of say, a billion digits that pass ever test for randomness that you can find. This means that you can't get by with less than a billion digits right?Well, maybe not quite; suppose I cheated and chose the first billion digits of Pi? then I could write a program of maybe a few K to generate the billion digits, perhaps a million-fold compression, right?As long as no one knew the trick however,  it remained random.But the other side of the coin is that this defines a random string as the one that contains the maximal possible amount of information.Another way of defining randomness is that no matter how many digits of your string you know, you have no way of predicting the next digit with any better chance of guessing correctly, than if you had had no clues so far. Now, in physics there are indeed classes of random behaviour. The best-known is quantum randomness, such as the decay of radioactive atoms. Given a number of such atoms of the same isotope, there is no way to predict which one will decay next.  There also classes of behaviour called chaotic behaviour, in which it is not practicable to predict what happens next, such as the fair tossing of a coin. In mathematics there are calculations that produce series that cannot be predicted unless you can find something that will correlate with the function that produced them. For example, some classes of transcendental numbers (such as Pi), but even very large classes of simple real numbers (such as roots or logs of various numbers, such as primes) can give you series that are effectively random to anyone who does not know the means used to generate them. And the real world?  Well certainly. For example the previously described approaches are in the real world. But some examples of turbulent flow for example can be highly random. But then, many things that one normally takes for random turn out to be highly non-random, including badly-planned random value generating software. For many years the random generators in many programming languages gave such poor results that you could see patterns when using them to cover a computer screen with dots. Nowadays they usually are better, but it took decades for that to happen. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a couple of aspects to your question\u2014unpredictability and randomness. Your question is about proving something is or is not random in physical reality, right?  If you mean logically deduced, no.  There is no deduction that can prove anything at all about physical reality. You can move from physical reality to models of physical reality, and within a model you can make deductions.  Quantum physics is a model of reality, and it predicts that there are random things.  Newtonian mechanics is a model of reality, and it predicts everything is determined in the future given an initial state. Even in Newtonian mechanics, determining the future does depend on knowing the present exactly.  We cannot know the present state exactly.  There are chaotic dynamical systems based on Newtonian mechanics, and that means that if you're just a little off from the present state, then you won't be able to determine the future state to any useful degree of accuracy; the future is unpredictable.  Asking for something to be truly random usually means asking more than it be just unpredictable.  You want a sequence of digits (or more generally outcomes of any kind) where each digit has the same frequency and the digits that appear are independent of the preceding digits. A formal definition of that can be made in terms of information theory. I suspect that you can create a chaotic dynamical system that will produce a random sequence of digits given that the initial state of the system is known only to a certain accuracy.  Perhaps this is well known to experts in the field. ",

            "answer_text": "Edited:  A truly random outcome is from a choice of more than one truly equally likely events.   How do we guage the likelyhood of an event? How is the choice of outcome made? This is the problem I have with randomness.  1. How do we guage the likelyhood of an event?  We model it with probabilities. Given that a probability is a guess, there must be some margin of error even for the most predictable of events. The problem with comparing two of more events with very similar likelyhoods is that even a teeny tiny difference in the error margin makes one event more likely than another = not random. Possibly more important is that this is a model, it has applications but it is not the real world. 2. How is the choice of outcome made?  When you try to drill down to the root causes of any randomness generator's results, there are always factors which are responsible for causing the result.  To take an example from your question, taking the results from a camera taking photos of a TV screen's static noise. So drilling down, the factors involved are :- the instant the camera takes the shot- the interpretation of background radiation on the screen. The decision on when to take the photo is not random - it is decided. The background radiation has causes. Drilling down further, current theory suggests that the cause of this is the result of electromagnetic waves from aeons ago. These waves have a cause, they originated from somewhere. Most importantly, they originated from somewhere at a precise moment with precise properties. This is no more random than the hand of a clock moving. It moves because of the causes that make it move. The 'noise' that is seen is definitely the result of an unfathomable complicated intricate system at work, but it is an assumption to call this random. I personally think there is no such thing as true randomness but I am fascinated to see if anyone can back up the assertion that there is such a thing. It is a matter of belief. ",

            "answer_text": "A fantastic question. As it turns out, randomness must be defined as the absence of structure or pattern. But as you might be thinking, just because we haven't found a reliable pattern yet doesn't mean we won't find one in the future. So all processes we label as random are \"apparently\" random. A committed determinist can always claim that in some future golden age of science all types of randomness, including quantum weirdness, will be banished. But until we actually reach that elusive final stage in the development of science, all we can say is that randomness seems to be a feature of the universe. For a broad exploration of the concept of randomness, including an explanation of the mathematical definitions of randomness, see this essay I wrote recently. Randomness: the Ghost in the Machine? | 3 Quarks Daily [I've linked to relevant books and Wikipedia articles.] For more on the specifics of quantum randomness, you'll really have to read up on Bell's theorem and the ongoing debate surrounding quantum indeterminacy. I found a Quora answer that is very helpful: What does Bell's inequality mean, in layman's terms? ",

            "answer_text": "Let's answer your question in light of Steven Shapin's guide to scientific epistemologies post-Darwin:  operationalism: the meaning of a proposition consists of the operations involved in proving or applying it. instrumentalism: scientific concepts and theories are just useful tools that allow one to explain and predict, but need not be assessed by their truth-as-correspondence-to-reality. phenomenalism: science can and should be disengaged from any talk of what lies beyond or behind appearances --- scientific knowledge is grounded not in \"reality\" but in sensations. positivism: metaphysical speculations are scientifically illegitimate, and sense-data are the only proper objects of knowledge and criteria for judging it. conventionalism: scientific theories are conventional claims to be assessed by their simplicity and utility and not by their truth-as-correspondence. pragmatism: when metaphysics comes up, change the subject, and insist instead on the intelligibility and propriety of truth considered simply as what works. probabilism: familiar in science since the seventeenth century, but now increasingly stressed to distinguish the legitimately modest quality of scientific certainty (about theories) with the vaulting ambition of dogmatists, speculative philosophers, and theologians; and finally falsificationism: best known through Karl Popper's claim in The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1934) that scientific generalizations can never be verified but only falsified, and that, therefore, legitimate scientific method can never establish the Truth of theories. From Steven Shapin's _The Scientific Life: A Moral History of a Late Modern Vocation_, pp 27-28. (See Has the evolution of scientific thought killed the need for philosophy?  Use at least one philosopher and metaphysics in your answer. for a bit of context.) In this light, randomness is a model and often a very useful one.  As a scientist I'm content with maximizing utility and leaving to the philosophers whether or not actual randomness actually exists.  I don't have the tools to answer that question. ",

            "answer_text": "First I need to clarify what your intent is in using the conditions of Mathematics vs Physics vs the real world.The real world that we live in is chaotic (which is often confused by a lot of people to take it to imply randomness), in our effort to make some sense of the world we live in, we have come up with Physics - to try to study and determine some of the underlying principles and theories.  In trying to work out the principles and models, we developed Mathematics as a tool to help us conceptualize, calculate and predict potential outcomes.   To me Mathematics is merely a subset of Physics which is a subset of our real world - I can't really see why you need to define them separately for your question. Next I need to clarify what you intend to mean by \"randomness\" - is it indeterminacy? Is it unpredictability? Is it something that is totally unexpected? IMHO, we do not know enough of our real world to conclude that there isn't any true randomness that may exist somewhere in the unexplored parts of our universe.  Our tools for measuring things aren't perfect as such there still exist levels of indeterminacy that can cause people to consider that some form of randomness occur (i.e. we can't predict the movement of a particular air molecule but we can predict the movement of a lot them (e.g. wind)).  When we determine the spin of an electron we have to effectively destroy its spin in doing the measurement.  Mathematically, there are still sum figures we haven't quite worked out e.g. Pi, what is the largest prime number, is Infinity really infinite? My conclusion?  So far as far as I am able to discern, there is no real randomness, just things we have yet to figure out ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. Let's take the case of the cliched example of a random event - rolling dice. When you a roll a die, the outcome is one of 1,2,..,6 being generated 'randomly'. But let's zoom in and look at if it really is so by doing a 'controlled' rolling. Say, you start with the side showing '5' and just drop it as is on the board, the number will not change. Now, drop it so that there is exactly one turn to the side showing '6', and you will see a '6', quite deterministic-ally. Similarly, do some other controlled rolls and check. It doesn't seem so random after all. One of the main reasons we call events like the above 'random' is that our human senses can not process the exact movements in the die when it is rolled or the exact state the die was in before it was rolled, or the other variables like  - the human-hand force/torque with which its rolled, the medium in which its rolled, and the obstacles along its path, etc.  But say, we record this motion on a camera and record all these variables, then the event is a direct outcome of a set of physics laws, more than a subject of randomness. Same applies to other phenomena. We call those events as 'random' which we can not gauge with our senses. There is no true randomness, the world is governed by physics, it sometimes is just beyond our natural scope. ",

The probabilities are calculated using Schrodinger\u2019s wave equation. It also appears that the act of observing a quantum particle influences its speed and location. In the famous 2 slits experiment it has been interpreted from results that a single quantum particle can be in 2 locations simultaneously. However there is no known way of proving this. It is also held that the speed and location of larger (macro) objects can only be determined to a level of probability. However the probability of a macro object being in 2 locations simultaneously is extremely low which would explain why we do not observe rocks splitting into identical twins. Quantum particles cannot be observed directly but only by observing their interaction with other quantum particles. Although quantum particles such as electrons are thought of as solid matter they are also observed to behave as waves. Currently nothing is known about the composition of a wave (i.e. we do not know what is waving). Nothing is yet understood about the details of how a force is instigated and propagated in a specific direction. It may be that cause and effect is true throughout the universe including the quantum space and that in time the details will become clear. ",

            "answer_text": "Recently, researchers have created a true random number generator using static random access memory cells printed with a special kind of ink containing carbon nanotubes.  Unlike software based random generators which depend on initial seed values with some mathematical operations performed on them, these SRAM cells generate random bits based on fluctuations in thermal noise. The SRAM contains two inverters. These pair of inverters must produce complementary outputs. Initially the inverters are turned off and external voltage is applied to force a output of 1 in both the inverters. When the SRAM cell was powered again one of the inverter's output has to become zero, which was unpredictable, since the switching state of the inverter depends upon thermal noise. The type and amount of noise also affects the switching state. The downside to this random bit generator is that all charge must be dispersed before generating the next random bit, and the speed of generation of random numbers is low. Considering your question, thermal noise cannot be predicted theoritically, and you can assume that true randomness exists untill someone proves thermal noise at a point can be theoritically calculated with great accuracy.

            "answer_text": "First we have to define true randomness. Randomness in general means the lack of pattern and predictability in a series of events. Statistical analysis does not care about whether randomness is true or fake. True randomness is a property of a single event. True randomness means that the event is a product of a natural source of entropy. Fake randomness, a.k.a. pseudorandomness, is the product of a deliberate choice or an algorithm deliberately chosen. From that definition we can make only one logical deduction: True randomness exists. Even if all the apparent randomness we can see were actually decided by someone, even then true randomness would exist. It is logically not possible to fake randomness without knowing what true randomness would look like. In addition, it would be impossible to decide anything without a randomly generated list of options to choose from. Next time you are rolling some dice you can either accept that the results are truly random or you can believe that they are decided by God. But, if you choose the latter, you must understand that this God of yours must roll some virtual dice of his own in order to decide your dice rolling results. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are many events in nature that are truly random. Here\u2019s an example based upon radioactive atoms. Put 1000 radioactive atoms in a container with a detector that measures when an atom decays into smaller atoms. Let\u2019s say these atoms have a half-life of 1 minute. This means that in a minute, each atom has a 50\u201350 chance of decaying. Thus, about 500 of these atoms will have decayed in a minute. But the exact number of atoms that decay in a minute is literally impossible to predict. Therefore, you can manipulate such values to generate truly random numbers.  It\u2019s interesting to look at this in more detail. Take one of these atoms and put it into a detector. As I said above, if its half-life is 1 minute, it will have a 50\u201350 chance of decaying in the first minute. Let\u2019s say it does not decay in the first minute. Then in the 2nd minute it still has a 50\u201350 chance of decaying. There\u2019s a very, very tiny chance that this atom will not have decayed after a million years. But if it did not, it will have a 50\u201350 chance of decaying in the next minute. One way to look at this is to realize that atoms that decay are not like being pregnant, where the fetus in a woman\u2019s body is continually growing (under normal circumstances). There are no observable changes in this atom, no matter how long it\u2019s been around. And then, one moment, it just decays. Goodbye sweet atom. We\u2019ll miss you. ",

Infact, I saw this recently which got me thinking about this:  This is my imagination about randomness, I do not claim what I have said  is factually correct wrt any physical science. But from the little I  know, it makes me believe nothing can be truly random. I believe true randomness cannot exist. Everything has a pattern - some kind of regularity, we might not be able to comprehend it completely, but does not mean there isn't. If you look closely and get into the details, you see a pattern everywhere. Nature is the topper of this list. There are fractals and recursions everywhere. Number theory is one of those theories we can use to prove it, infact. I think this absence of randomness is because of the nature of time. Time is not random. Time is a deterministic quantity and it has a direction and it can be well measured(ofcourse gravity and other space time variables come into picture). Because every function is wrt time, we lose the idea of randomness. There are bounds- time, space, gravity etc, which are acting variables in any function that you want to design. Hence nothing can be truly random, with time, with space - we will always see a pattern. ",

There are whole libraries filled with studies how ideal random systems should behave (when the distribution is known and not known).  In nature there is a very strong experimental evidence that subatomic processes are truly random, not due to lack of information about the exact state of system, but fundamentally random.  This quantum randomness is different from the  classical models where randomness in nature is introduced due to measurement errors. A perfect experiment could guess all the winning numbers in a Monte Carlo casino.  Not so in quantum mechanics.  Of course, there still are measurement errors in every experiment, but even if a perfect experiment would exists, then still the results can be random.  This all is in contrast with computing.  Generating random numbers on a computer is a hard problem, which makes or breaks encryption the better the random number generators are. ",

Lava lamps are certainly chaotic and atmospheric noise probably is too. Therefore random seeds based on these events would probably fall on a collector curve if enough samples were taken. Then there is the problem of sample length: 64 bits is too small a register size for chaotic sampling of this sort. Next is a signal-to-noise problem. If chaotic noise overlays a random signal, as in the case of the Geiger counter, then do you generate truly random seeds? So if the question of true randomness has to do with numerical methods, then that is a separate question from asking about randomness in, say, quantum events. Any method of finite measurement will fail to prove randomness at the quantum level, because of the vast difference of scale between Planck terms, which determine quantum events, and measurements which are based on particle physics.

We often condescendingly say that something is \u201cjust random\u201d, meaning we do not care about its cause. We should rather say, we do not understand the cause of the phenomenon. Maybe we are not yet able to understand it. Maybe we are in principle not smart enough to understand. Or perhaps it is just an elementary phenomenon itself. If the latter, true randomness, did not exist, most of theoretical physics would be in serious trouble. Quantum theory relies on its existence. It not only effects physics, but mathematics as well. The deepest insight into the nature of randomness is Kolmogorov complexity. It defines random objects as objects that cannot be compressed. But unfortunately one cannot prove that something is random! Therefore, it is very hard to produce objects that pass statistical tests of randomness. Even though, those tests are non-exhaustive. With radio telescopes, we can catch signals from deep space. Some could be communication signals of alien civilizations. Even if they pass all imaginable tests of randomness! ",

With this logical endpoint in mind, then the end result of all systems is a uniformity. If you continue to disperse 10,000 marbles \u201crandomly\u201d, eventually they will arrive at an equilibrium in which each marble is equidistant from each other marble. Therefore, the end result of the dispersion will go through thousands of pattern permutations until absolute uniformity is achieved.

First of all, let us see how randomness is defined.According to Oxford:Randomness is adjective of random which means Made, done or happening without method or conscious decision. True randomness, which can also be called as absolute randomness, are oxymoron terms. Absolute/True means something that is definite in nature. It is affirmative.Randomness on the other hand is lack of definite pattern. These are contradictory terms which are combined together to form oxymorons. So if we go by definition then we are trying to find a definite pattern for lack of definite pattern which I believe cannot exist. ",

Random can also mean \"unpredictable\" => then [math]\\pi[/math] can be calculated so apparently it is predictable. Now for the real world. Humans clearly can't predict a lot. So we have to take something bigger, something that knows more. If the universe can predict itself, then real randomness doesn't exist. So question is about determinism? Because if the universe is determined, then from the known data, the next value clearly follows. I lack here anything to answer that properly, but let me play around a bit:To my understanding the future already exists, we just haven't reached it yet. If this is true, the universe can always predict the future.  \"Unpredictable\" randomness would not exist but patternless randomness still could. ",

Pseudo-random events have patterns that eventually repeat and this is why they can later be uncovered to be deterministic and predictable.

Both types of randomness will not initially exhibit any pattern, and will thus seem unpredictable by observers. But if a pattern rises to the surface after some time, the event can be confidently labeled as pseudo-random. ",

This means, for example, that an atom will definitely decay in one world and definitely not decay in another - nothing random about that - but not even a being of infinite intelligence with access to all the facts can predict which outcome you will see.

Quantum mechanics is the closest we have for an explanation, but it is a polarizing field of study because our understanding of it is built on interpretation of experiments. In quantum mechanics, the wave function allows us to compute the movements of particles. The uncertainty principle is that in a very small scale, there is a limit to the precision of measurement. We have the many worlds interpretation and the copenhagen interpretation which assumes particles behave probabilistically. The interpretation is that the wave function predicts the probability of movement. The movement is considered random but constricted to a certain range of values. Then we have the revised Einstein interpretation and De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory which supports determinism. In the De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, each particle starts at a fixed place and the wave function is a property or a natural trait that determines where the particle will move. The uncertainty principle is considered a hidden variable, that we do not know yet, but is ultimately deterministic as well. ",

As such you can (hypothetically) conduct an experiment in exactly the same way (beyond our capabilities of measure) and still get different result. All that's left is constructing an apparatus capable of measuring the result, which would vary depending on what's actually being observed. I suppose one could base a mathematical model on this as well.  One example of such experiment would be based on the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment.
