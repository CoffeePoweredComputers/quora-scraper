            "answer_text": "I would say there are four reasons people are harsher on math than other subjects. The people, scolding you most likely have had trouble with math in their lifetime, and do not want the same for you.Because modern people are raised to hate math, causing teachers and others to push them uncomfortably to succeed.The teacher hates math or teaching math himself or herself and will teach harshly because his income depends on it.These problems have always existed to a minor level but grew exponentially when new math was implemented into the US teaching curricula. These new ideas of Math were complex and different and brought new terminology into the system. The parents who were usually the people who helped their children with homework freaked out because they did not have a clue what the material meant. Teachers themselves did not know the material and were teaching on a vague idea of how it worked. Many people failed miserably, however, there were those students that were able to comprehend the material and excelled in the class, leading others to believe that math was something that you were either good at or not. This growing and complaining about mathematics spread down through generations as students believed subconsciously that they could not succeed because their parents could not. Math is an important subject and new math was an awesome concept; the government did try to improve the system but ended up making the curricula worse as a result. Final notes: The reason new math was created was to create more intelligent mathematicians and engineers to cause the US to have an advantage during the cold war, and the space race. ",
