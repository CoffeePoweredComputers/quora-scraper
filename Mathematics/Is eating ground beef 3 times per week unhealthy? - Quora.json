And the cholesterol you eat is not the cholesterol in your blood. Don\u2019t worry about cholesterol in food. Just ignore that. Stop thinking of any food in terms of how \u201cunhealthy\u201d it is. That, in and of itself, is unhealthy. ",

            "answer_text": "Anything in moderation won\u2019t kill you. The question should be focused on portions rather than type of foods. The WHO issued a report that processed meats are carcinogenic (bacon). Ground beef is not processed red meat, and the WHO says that it has health benefits if you eat it in moderation. Separately, there is a study showing that ground beef is more likely than any other meat to contain feces and, therefore, must be cooked at high temperature and to well-done. Look up red meat benefits, there are plenty. Just don\u2019t eat too much- portion control. ",
