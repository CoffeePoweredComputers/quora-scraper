            "answer_text": "To understand the absolute value function, it is extremely important to understand the notion of absolute value of a number. So, what does the absolute value of a number represents? Well, it represents the magnitude of that number, or in layman terms, it represents the distance of the number from zero on number line. Hence, absolute value function or a modulus function acts as an operator which takes inputs in form of numbers and provides their absolute value. Few examples of finding the absolute value of a number on number line:  Definition: The absolute value parent function, written as f(x) = |x|, is defined as  Graphically, it can be represented as:   Note :One thing you can notice here is that it cannot have a negative value as it represents only the magnitude of the number.

            "answer_text": "It is function [*] that takes aways minus signs from a number.  It is typically denoted by vertical lines || so that |3| is the absolute value of 3 which is 3 (which means it didn't do anything).  |-5| is 5.   This is useful because sometimes you don't care what sign a number is.  For instance if you're answering \"What is the biggest change in your bank account?\"  May be you have  deposits of $100, $150, $200 and  withdrawals (which are negative) of $50, $200, and $500, so your bank statement might say  $100,-$50, $150, -$500, $200,-$200.    And if you sorted them you get -$500, -$200, -$50, $100, $150, $200 but if you sort the absolute values you get $50, $100, $150, $200, $200, $500and $500 is the biggest change in your bank account and would answer the question.  One important aspect is that you need to do everything inside the absolute value before eliminating the minus sign.  So |-4+5| (which is equal to 1) is not equal to |-4| +|5| (which is equal to 9). [*] A function is an object that takes a number and gives out another number in a predictive way. ",
