            "answer_text": "(I initially saw this question to be one of those spam questions about maths that you can answer in your head so will answer that one later) First some real advice. Mathematics is a subject where, a lot of the time, later elements build on something you\u2019ve already been taught. If you\u2019re struggling with something you may need to review the foundations you\u2019re trying to build upon. As Anam Khan said in his answer You can do it, concentrate, learn and practice. If you reach a point where it\u2019s not making sense try to take a step back and see if you can work out why you don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 it and review the foundation again. (Now my original answer) It depends on the day you start and what time you give to this. If we assume you start on a Monday and work from Monday to Friday on this 30 days from then will give you 22 working days so you will need 4.09 marks per working day. If you start your 30 days on a Saturday then you will only have 20 working days which means you will need 4.5 marks per day. If you\u2019re working every day then you only need 3 marks per day. Start as soon as possible and do some of the work at weekends as well. ",
