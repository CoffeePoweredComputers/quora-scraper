            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, How many multiples of 3 are there among from 100 to 200? For this, we should use a simple method rather than creating and writing A.P or writing multiples. First, we just need to find the smallest and largest number divisible by[math] 3 [/math]within the range then,Subtract smallest from the largest number and divide it with 3 as it is the difference between each number.Then add a[math] 1[/math] to obtain the correct result this is because of subtraction of the smallest number multiple of [math]3.[/math]Now, follow these steps smallest number [math]= 102[/math] largest number [math]= 198[/math] Now, subtract:[math] 198 - 102 = 96[/math] then divide with the difference between each number[math] = \\frac{96}{3} = 32[/math] Now, lastly add [math]+1[/math] to it for [math]102[/math] which gets subtracted from the series[math] = 32 + 1 = 33.[/math] That\u2019s it, In the case we haven\u2019t met before, I\u2019m Krishna Singh Thanks!

            "answer_text": "There is a trick that i learned a while ago in my younger days. If you want to know whether a large number is a multiple of 3 without having to actually divide it to find out, you can do this: step 1: Add all the digits in the number step 2: If the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, then the number is a multiple of 3. Example: 23781 Step 1: 2+3+7+8+1=21 Step 2: 21 is a multiple of 3, therefore, 23781 is a multiple of 3. Now, with this in mind, you can go through the numbers from 100-200 and find out how many are multiples. Another way to go about this, as mentioned by many others, is to find the first multiple of three that is greater than 100 and then, add three to the number and keep going till you reach the limit. Example: first multiple is 102 102+3=105 105+3=108 108+3=111 and so on and so forth. ",
