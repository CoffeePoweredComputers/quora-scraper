            "answer_text": "Degree of the given equation is 2. So given equation is a quadratic equation.(Degree of a polynomial - Wikipedia). So equation can be written in the form of (x+a)*(x+b) Where (x+a),(x+b) are factors of the equation. So by expanding we get x^2+(a+b)x+ab. By comparing the above equation with the given equation we get a+b=-1, ab= 4 We know that (a-b)^2=(a+b)^2\u20134ab So we get (a-b)^2=(-1)^2\u20134(4) (a-b)^2=1\u201316 (a-b)^2=-15 (a-b)=\u221a-15 So a-b=+\u221a15i or -\u221a15i So a+b=-1 and let a-b=\u221a15i Adding both equations we get 2a=-1+\u221a15i So a=(-1+\u221a15i)/2 and substituting a in the above one of the equation we get b=(-1\u2013\u221a15i)/2 Similarly by taking a-b=-\u221a15i we get a=(-1-\u221a15i)/2 and b=(-1+\u221a15i)/2 So the factors of the given equation are (x+(-1+\u221a15i)/2) and (x+(-1-\u221a15i)/2) ",
