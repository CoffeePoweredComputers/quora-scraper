            "answer_text": "Numerology as we know is divided into two parts. One is followed in east and another is followed in west. Both the systems have their advantages and disadvantages. Eastern NumerologyIn this, letters are assigned values from 1\u20138. No letter has been assigned the value 9 since ancient Hindus felt that 9 is complete in itself and represents the Almighty therefore no number can represent the almighty. The below mentioned books follow this methodology. Book of numbers by CheiroAnk Vidya by Gopesh kumar ojhaA complete guide to numerology by BK ChaturvediWestern NumerologyThis method was developed in ancient Greece. Here the numbers are assigned vakues from 1\u20139 in a cyclic order. A is represented by 1, B by 2 till I which is representsed by 9. Then J is given value 1 and the order follows. This method is easier to learn. Books that follow this method are Numerology by Matthew Oliver Goodwin, Two volumes. This is a complete book to learn about numerology.Numerology by Tom monte and Hans Decoz. This is more of a reference book.I have read the above books and found both the systems to be correct. Eastern methods needs more time to learn and interpret. The planets are assigned rulership to numbers. So it becomes more difficilt to interpret. Western methods are easy to learn and interpret. PS: i will keep on adding books to this list when i will read them and find them useful since most books are a mere copy or reproduction of some earlier written book. Till then the above mentioned list is complete in itself to help you understand numerology.Numerologers like M Kattkar, AV Kapil, Harish Johari along with others have written books on this subject. You can read them as well. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a practicing Christian; it says so on my profile. Why am I being requested to answer questions when my profile clearly states that I am a Christian? I cannot violate my conscience by referring people to practices my God, Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ condemns. Since you requested me to answer, I will answer as a Christian with a few of the Bible verses that condemn numerology (adultery can also mean spiritual adultery): Deuteronomy 18:10-12 King James Version There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee. Romans 1:24-25 New American Standard Bible (NASB) Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. 1 Corinthians 6:9\u201311 Common English Bible (CEB) Don\u2019t you know that people who are unjust won\u2019t inherit God\u2019s kingdom? Don\u2019t be deceived. Those who are sexually immoral, those who worship false gods, adulterers, both participants in same-sex intercourse, thieves, the greedy, drunks, abusive people, and swindlers won\u2019t inherit God\u2019s kingdom. That is what some of you used to be! But you were washed clean, you were made holy to God, and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. ",
