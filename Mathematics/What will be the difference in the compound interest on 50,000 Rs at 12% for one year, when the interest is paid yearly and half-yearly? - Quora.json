            "answer_text": "Lets calculate the two and see what the difference is, using the formula of future value i.e. P x (1+r)^n, where P is principal amount, r is interest rate and n is period Annual payment FV = 50000 x (1.12)^1 = 56,000 Half yearly payment FV = 50000 x (1.06)^2 = 56,180 So, the compounded interest is higher in case of half yearly payments by Rs. 180. This is logical because in this case we have received interest during the year and therefore there is an additional amount on which interest has been applied as at year end (i.e. we received Rs. 3000 at half year, so additional interest would be the interest on this amount i.e. 3000 x 6% = Rs. 180) ",

            "answer_text": "When interest is compounded annually i.e. yearly, the value at the end of the year will be (50000x12)/100+50000= 6000+50000= 56000. When compounded half yearly, the interest is calculated once in six months and added back to principle. In this case, interest after six months equals (50000x12)/(2x100)= 3000. This amount added back to principle. Now, new principle is 50000+3000= 53000. After 6 months, again interest is calculated on this new principle, i.e.53000. Now interest = (53000x12)/(2x100) = 3180. Total interest in second case is 3000+3180= 6180. Rs.180/- is the difference between the two. ",
