            "answer_text": "That's exactly the point: when it is not obvious (or even impossible) to  prove a proposition for an arbitrary , we use induction.Also, it is important to  note that we don't substitute  for  and  prove the proposition - that would be redundant, since it's just a  change of variables. Actually, we assume it for a certain   (weak induction) or for all  (strong induction), and use these assumptions to prove the same proposition for . We also prove it true for a base case, usually for k = 0 or 1. ",
