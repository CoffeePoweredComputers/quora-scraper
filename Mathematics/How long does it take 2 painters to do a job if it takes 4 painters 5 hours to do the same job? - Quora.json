            "answer_text": "This question highlights the difficulties of simplifying real world problems. The math answer is simple. A painter does x amount of work. If the job takes 4 painters 5 hours, then the job involves 20h of work. Therefore, 2 painters should take 10h. However, as someone who has worked in construction quite a bit, including as a owner of a small painting business, there is a lot of relevant info that is not taken into account. The first major consideration is that the members of a construction crew almost never contribute an equal amount towards completion of a job. This is simply a result of experience, motivation, and character. A crew of 2 who are equal partners with similar experience should be close, but when have you ever seen a construction company with 4 equal partners who all show up to the same site? Yeah, that doesn\u2019t happen. Typically, the most experienced painter will be the foreman. He might be an owner in a small company, or he\u2019s a designated supervisor for the site. The responsibility for the job rests on him. In a crew of 2, he\u2019ll probably do most of the work, but in a crew of 4 he\u2019ll spend a considerable amount of time making sure the other 3 are not messing things up, reporting to the higher ups, and dealing with the customer. In a crew of 4, the number 2 guy is going to be the workhorse. His only responsibility is to crank out the work. He might be supervising number 4, but if he\u2019s not doing the most work, you\u2019re not getting your money out of him. Number 4 is entry level. He has little to no experience. You get your money out of number 4, first, by not paying him very much. Second, he\u2019s the guy that has to do the worst jobs that require the least skill. He\u2019s going to haul the tools and materials the most; he\u2019s going to clean the brushes. He\u2019s going to run (simple) errands because his time is the least valuable. He\u2019s going to do the dirtiest work, the most physically demanding. But a lot of the time he\u2019s going to be doing the same job as everyone, just a lot slower. Finally, number 3 is going to range between number 4 and number 2, depending on the luck of the hiring process and what the company can afford. In a crew of 4, you always want a competent number 1, an expendable number 4, and a skilled number 2. A lot of crews will end up with a number 1 & 3 number 4s. That\u2019s not a good situation. There\u2019s not enough experience to keep things moving. Your number 1 can\u2019t get much done with all the babysitting he\u2019s doing, and the number 4s are constantly prone to making expensive mistakes. If you hire a college painter company, the only thing you get are number 4s. The site supervisor is a number 4 on their first or second season of painting, with as little as a week of training. A second significant consideration is the principle of diminished returns. In economics, the principle of diminished returns states that as your incrementally increase a single factor of production (such as labour), you get a decreased incremental production boost. Suppose we take the 5h job with the 4 painters as an example. Let\u2019s say they\u2019re painting the walls on a single floor of a house. Imagine the boss says, we need to finish this job in 1h, so we\u2019re sending 20 painters. Obviously 20 painters aren\u2019t going to be able to move and work effectively. With a fivefold increase in labour, you\u2019re probably only going to see about two to three times the productivity. Even with only a small increase in labour, there are going to be times when one worker has to wait for another, whereas a single worker never has to wait. In some work, two workers will be more productive per labour hour than a single worker. This is because many tasks take less than half the time with two people working together. For example, many construction jobs require direction from someone with a different vantage point, saving the worker doing the work from having to spend time double checking that things are going as needed (for example, operating machinery with a spotter). However, many tasks will suffer from even a single additional worker, particularly if both workers are number 4s. Number 4s are notoriously unreliable to output a consistent rate of production. They tend to have little motivation (compared to other workers), and they tend to not have a clear expectation of the amount of work that can be done in a set amount of time. They work until the job is done, and slow work pays the same as quick work (often more), because they\u2019re paid by the hour. A single number 4 working alone on a simple task will usually be more productive than two number 4s working, and chatting, together. Together they will slow down and take more frequent and longer breaks. This is another reason college painters will be a disaster. Not only will they do a terrible job, but they\u2019ll take forever to get it done. Now, let\u2019s go back to the initial scenario. 4 painters take 5h to do a job. How long will it take 2 painters to do the same job? Almost no two jobs are the same. We\u2019re either talking about identical projects, like apartments, or the 2 painters are coming back to redo the same job that college painters destroyed. Let\u2019s consider both scenarios. Similar jobs - i.e. identical housing unitsThe 2-man crew very likely has a higher average skill level than the 4-man crew. It may include a single experienced painter (number 1) and a number 4, but even so, the principle of diminished returns suggests they will be more effective than the 4-man crew. The math suggests that 2 workers should take 10h to do the job. This will be the maximum allowable, but we know it will be less than this, for the above reasons. Let\u2019s assume a 10h work day, so the 4-man crew is finishing a single unit per day.One thing we haven\u2019t considered yet is break times. An employer has to pay for breaks, so a 10h job includes 1h of paid break time and 9h of actual work. Let\u2019s assume the work day starts at 7:30 and ends at 5:30. Lunch time is usually taken from 12\u201312:30. With 15 min breaks in the morning and afternoon, that\u2019s almost 4h before lunch and almost 5h after lunch. Break times and quitting times will affect what workers try to complete. If a crew can complete a job in a full day, they will probably also complete a job that\u2019s 10% more work in a full day, and they will stretch a job that\u2019s 10% less work into the same day. This is a natural result of the way we gauge our progress and increase or decrease our effort to meet expectations. So the 4-man crew is actually completing 9h of work for 2 units, or 4.5h of work (instead of the 5h reported in the question).Now, while the 4-man crew has 9h to work with, in which they will complete 2 units, the 2-man crew is roughly productive enough to complete a single unit in a day, but a break time that is slightly earlier than half the day will push them to complete half the work in 4h (with a 15 min break - although many 2-man crews won\u2019t even bother). This leaves half the work for the last 5h, which is too much extra time to stretch out the job, especially if there are multiple units to complete. Therefore, the 2-man crew is going to likely complete the unit and start on the next one in the extra hour. Overall, it should take 8h of actual work for the 2-man crew. The extra hour will roll over 7 days before ending the 8th day with the completion of the 9th unit. Counting 10h days for 8 days, we\u2019re going to have 80h, divided by 9 units, we get a result of 8.89h per unit vs the 10h for the 4-man crew.Same job - fixing a college paint jobThis is also a common scenario, but the scope of work is now going to be different. The fix is going to involve (a) cleaning up spills and splatters, (b) touching up surfaces that were painted over by unsteady hands, such as roller marks on the ceiling, (c) sanding and repainting surfaces with lumps, lines, drips (d) scraping peeling paint (due to improper surface prep) and patching/smoothing the surface, properly prepping and repainting, and (e) repainting surfaces with no major flaws besides just not getting enough paint the first time.Keep in mind that the amount of work accomplished by the college painters is not equivalent with the amount of work done by actual pros. College painters cut corners by improper surface prep (or none at all), insufficient splatter protection, and hasty work with insufficient paint coverage or other defects - and it still takes an unreasonably long time for them to accomplish this. A job that is completable by 4 college painters in 5h would probably only take 2 pros a comparable amount of time (5h) to do properly. So that would be one answer - it would have only taken about 5h for 2 painters in the first place.But fixing a college job will take additional time. Not only do the surfaces have to be re-coated after sanding defects, but additional time must be taken while cutting in edges by hand to touch up the mistakes. Extra time must be taken to clean surfaces that were splattered. Depending on the extent of damage, the time will vary, but we can reasonably expect the 2-man crew to devote a full day to fixing everything. This will include commiserating with the owner over the terrible job that was done. Altogether, it would be reasonable to expect that 2 painters will do the same job in 9\u201310h, or, about what was expected by the initial math equation (hey, sometimes math gets lucky).",
