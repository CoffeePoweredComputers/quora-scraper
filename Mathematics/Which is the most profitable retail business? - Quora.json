            "answer_text": "This entirely depends on what exactly you do in retail, when you start, what sort of raises you get etc. I used to work in retail, I started in high school and worked it through college and a bit beyond. By that time I was making around $15 an hour and that was around the time of the recession. For that time it was a decent amount of money (I actually made a decent side profit because I had money to invest in things few could buy when they lost their jobs). Keep in mind I was just a run of the mill employee, so had I chosen to stick with retail I probably eventually would have gone into management and made far more. If you intend to make a living doing it keep in mind what the lowest paying positions are when applying and realize the hours and shifts are pretty lousy. It\u2019s generally a good job to have during college or similar because most retailers have flexible hours. ",
