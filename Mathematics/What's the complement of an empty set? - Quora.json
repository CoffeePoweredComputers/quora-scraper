            "answer_text": "When you discuss \u201ccomplement\u201d you have to be talking about two sets; that is, a proper question is, \u201cwhat is the complement of A in B?\u201d and an improper question is, \u201cwhat is the complement of A?\u201d Then the answer to the question, \u201cwhat is the complement of the empty set in B?\u201d is exactly B. In general, the complement of A in B consists of all elements of B that are not in A. If A is the empty set, then since A has no elements of B, the complement of the empty set in B consists of all elements of B, as noted above. When you are operating in a situation where it is clear what the universe is, then you can ask the question, \u201cwhat is the complement of a set A?\u201d For example, if you are talking about the students in your class, you can ask what is the complement of the set of students who received an A on Assignment 6, and everyone will understand exactly what you are talking about, it is the set of students in your class who didn\u2019t get an A on Assignment 6.

If you thought that the complement of the empty set would be something different, or something tough to define, then you should realize that you have the same issue when talking about the compliment of any set. Let . What is the compliment of ? Well, we do not know, because we do not know what field we are talking about. It could be  or it could be . Or anything else \u2014 it depends on the context. The same goes for the complement of the empty set. ",
