            "answer_text": "see its a fact that there are majority of math phobia suffering students who want to score well for that as others have suggested u ma score well applying those . but i would suggest a very important thing on the basis of my experience. first thing is that ur concepts must be crystal clear. next thing you must just be very good in theoram and postulates and then comes the last one which is practice when you practice with all your concepts clear and remembering your theorams and postulates your half problem is just solved and now as u go on solving more and more questions u\u2019ll get to know where u r weak and where u need to focus more. the last thing i would like to tell is try studying smarter instead of studying harder. and all the best.
