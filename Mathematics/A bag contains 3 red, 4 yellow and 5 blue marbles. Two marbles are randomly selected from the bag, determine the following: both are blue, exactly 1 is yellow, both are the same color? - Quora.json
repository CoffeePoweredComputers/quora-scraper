            "answer_text": "3+4+5=12 Both are blue: (5/12)*(4/11). Exactly one is yellow. It is the sum of two events (blue, nonblue), (nonblue, blue), the probability is (5/12)*(7/11)+(7/12)*(5/11). Both are the same color. It is the sum of both blue, both red, and both yellow, the probability is (5/12)*(4/11)+(3/12)*(2/11)+(4/12)*(3/11) ",

            "answer_text": "These are straightforward combinatorics problems. Note that there are 12 choices on the first selection and 11 on the second so overall 12x11 = 132 combinations. To find how many of these have exactly 1 yellow we (1) find combinations where first is yellow and second is not - this is 4*8 = 32 and (b) where first is not yellow and second one is - this is 8*4 also 32. So total probability is (32+32)/132 = 16/33. The other two problems can be solved by similar analyses. ",
