            "answer_text": "I would have just said the number or maybe that it\u2019s a four letter word, NOT a three letter word\u2026 Why do the answers on Quora need a gazillion paragraphs? We don\u2019t get any extra credit for stretching out the answer to the point that nobody still bothers to read any longer and move on to a different question\u2026 or maybe do something else completely unrelated\u2026 like the dishes. Or housework. I think this is a third or fourth grade [Catholic School] math lesson. I cannot recall because the Catholic church at the end of my street closed the school after third grade and for fourth grade, I had to go to a different Church\u2019s school three blocks away, and I can\u2019t recall if I learned multiplication in third grade or fourth grade! But I aced math most of my higher-educated life on virtually everything except trigonometry; I even got exempt from taking the final exam Senior year. That was at another Catholic school, an all-male high school. You would almost think I\u2019m pushing Catholic schools! I\u2019m not pushing anything actually. But on to the answer to the question, FINALLY! In 3rd or 4th grade, whichever it was, we were taught that no matter what the number, whenever it\u2019s multiplied by ZERO, you will always get the same number! So, if you multiply this number (pssssstttt\u2026ZERO!) by any other number the answer will be the same! The number is ZERO! Wouldn\u2019t you rather have had me just say ZERO, or 0, right from the start? ",
