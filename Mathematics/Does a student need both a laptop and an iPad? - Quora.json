            "answer_text": "Neither. Unless you\u2019re a university student, you don\u2019t need a laptop. In fact, even if you\u2019re a university student, unless you\u2019re studying IT or need it to run some specific program required by the class, it\u2019s best if you leave your computer at home. You\u2019re less likely to get distracted. A high school student can either use the computers that are at the school or at home, they don\u2019t need personal computers like one needs clothing, food, drink of to bathe. Not the same thing. Do not confuse \u201cneed\u201d with \u201creally, really want\u201d. In fact, learning how to use other resources besides computers is very rewarding. Ever heard of books? Encyclopediae? But if you\u2019re buying, I\u2019d recommend a laptop over a tablet. A laptop has replaceable parts whereas tablets usually don\u2019t and laptops usually have a longer life as well (mine has served me for 5 years and I\u2019ve only replaced the harddrive). I went through high school with a tabletop computer and it was totally fine. I have three years worth of notes to show even today. It didn\u2019t hinder me in any way. ",

            "answer_text": "tl;dr: wait till you know what you NEED before buying it. It depends on what the student will be studying. They certainly don\u2019t need to buy a laptop OR an iPad before they know that it\u2019s something they actually need. In most cases, they will only need one, and a laptop will be more practical than an iPad. People tend to get laptops that are larger and heavier than they want to carry around with them, so then they get an iPad because it\u2019s small and light. If this is the case, you\u2019re better off getting a desktop and an iPad. I prefer to have a small laptop - like a Macbook or Macbook Air - and a screen, keyboard, and mouse that stays on my desk. I bring the laptop along if i need to take notes, I plug it in when I\u2019m at home. If you\u2019re a graphic art student, you\u2019ll probably need to run Photoshop or other art programs, that require a laptop. ",
