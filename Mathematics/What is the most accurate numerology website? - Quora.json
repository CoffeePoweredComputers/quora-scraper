            "answer_text": "Numerology calculations are simple arithmetic \u2014 addition and subtraction \u2014 so there is no excuse not to be accurate. My guess is that virtually all numerology websites that do numerology calculations with software have 100% accuracy. After the calculations are interpretations. Interpretations are subjective \u2014 the numerologist\u2019s attempt to describe the energy that the calculated result represents. Because interpretations are subjective, some websites will be more accurate for some people and other websites will be more accurate for other people. One website might even be more accurate for a certain person\u2019s question about their finances and a different website more accurate for that same person\u2019s question about their love life. The reason for that is because interpretations indicate tendencies or likelihoods. Which means they are all accurate, but that some tendencies and likelihoods will play out and others won\u2019t. The ones that will and will not play out often have to do with the person\u2019s implementation of free will in what they do and don\u2019t do. Actions are what create the future. The future is malleable, not predetermined. The website that interprets your numerology most like your free will would indicate is the website that is the most accurate for you. Will ",

            "answer_text": "Although it is the least popular system, many modern day numerologists are convinced that Chaldean numerology is the most accurate system there is. ... Whereas the Pythagorean and Kabbalah systems base their formulas on the numbers one through nine, Chaldean numerology focuses on one through eight. Numerology uses numbers to predict about future. For example, based on your date of birth, your pattern of life can be judged and even your estimated age and major life events. Each period of your life is under a certain number which narrates your challenges of life. ... Numerology is to help you understand your career.
