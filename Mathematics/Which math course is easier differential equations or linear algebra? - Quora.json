            "answer_text": "I strongly disagree w/ Tom.   It really depends on: A) the content (both courses can be taught more from an applied perspective, emphasizing methodologies, or from a theory perspective, emphasizing theorems and proofs); B) the text (does it emphasize methodologies or theory, and what level of mathematical maturity does it assume of the reader); C) the instructor (any approach can be made comparatively \"easy,\" or \"ball-bustingly\" hard, and the instructor can be very helpful, or really leave it to the student to \"sink or swim\"); and D) the student (is s/he more comfortable w/ executing algorithms, or seeing relationships and figuring out ways of proving things, how does this align w/ the approach of the course, text, and instructor, and how well-prepared is s/he).  In other words, IMO, there is no even remotely generally true answer to this question: both subjects can be \"easier\" or \"harder,\" depending on the four widely-varying variables above. (That said, there might be a statistically valid answer, i.e., there may be empirical results showing that, adjusted for the variables above, but especially for the level of student preparation, which subject do students tend to perform better in.  If that's the kind of information/answer you want, I would suggest asking again, re-phrased something like: \"are there cross-school, national, or international data on the comparative performance of students in LA vs. ODE's, and if so, what, if any, statistically significant difference(s) does that data suggest?\") ",

            "answer_text": "While it depends on the individual student and classes, I would guess that on average Linear Algebra is much easier;  that was my experience.  It was by far the easiest math class I took at MIT, but it can be done at many different levels.  One problem with Differential Equations is that, to a newcomer, it looks like an unfinished subject.  When I took diff eq's, nobody explained to me that I would be battling differential equations every single day in a physics career, that nobody knows how to solve most of them, and that the class is meant to give you what bits and pieces have been found so far.  I wish someone had told me that I would later want every single scrap of knowledge, every hint and clue taught in that class.  It just looked like a hot mess to me.  Also, a critical problem with differential equations is, even if you know exactly what you are doing, it can take 15-30 minutes to work one problem.  There simply isn't time to acquire enough practice to get mastery.  Except for proofs, most linear algebra problems are much faster, even if there can be a lot of tedious arithmetic.  ",

            "answer_text": "I can definitely answer this considering I have finals in both of them in a week from now. I'm going to say it depends on the type of linear algebra course you take. If it's a 4000 level course that would follow a first course in abstract algebra, I am going to say that course will be much harder than a standard undergraduate course in ordinary differential equations. In undergrad, ODEs are generally quite computationally focused and while there will be some elements of theory (such as the uniqueness and existence theorem) there won't be any real proofs to worry about. You'll just be solving problems that say \u201cfind the general solution,\u201d \u201csolve this IVP,\u201d or \u201cplot the general solution in a vector field/phase portrait.\u201d Now for Linear Algebra, assuming it's not a 4000 level course, will likely be harder but not by any absurd amount. Linear algebra just tends to be more conceptual. Most likely it will still be a computational course but there will be proofs (they aren't too bad though). I'm currently on mobile waiting for my guitar ensemble to start so later on I'll elaborate. But I hope in the meantime this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I would say they're roughly equal in difficulty.  Differential equations will require more memorization of techniques, but you might find them very intuitive. There will be very few proofs.  This is probably because they're too advanced for a first course.   Linear algebra is a bit different.  You will have to memorize some algorithms and there will be proofs.  If this is your first proof based course then you may find it difficult.  Linear algebra, depending on how it is taught, can either be an abstract class or very applied.   If I had to choose, I would say that linear algebra is harder.  I should also mention that linear algebra is the language of applied mathematics.  So if you're interested in ODEs you will need to become intimate with linear algebra eventually.  You'll never escape it.  It might be wise to embrace it sooner rather than later.   ",

There's comments here suggesting it's remarkably easy and others that suggest otherwise.  They are roughly the same in difficulty, but two very different areas.

The theory behind DEs runs very deep and requires quite a few constructs (duality, tangent spaces, etc) to treat as rigorously as we do linear algebra. On the other hand linear algebra has many results from abstract algebra, and without a good grounding in the subject the motivations might not be immediately apparent. So to summarize, LA is very definition driven while ODEs is very formula driven. ",
