            "answer_text": "If you want to be able to estimate these kinds of problems accurately, here's a nice approach.  (For your specific problem, [math]p=0.0[/math], [math]n=250[/math], and [math]k=10[/math].)  If the trials are independent and success on a trial has probability [math]p[/math],  then the probability of no successes in [math]n[/math] trials is [math](1-p)^n[/math].  Now, let us write [math]k=np[/math] so that our probability becomes [math](1-p)^{k/p}[/math].  As [math]p\\to 0[/math], this probability limits to [math]e^{-k}\\approx 10^{-0.434\\cdot k}[/math].  Since your value of [math]p[/math] is small, this limit is a good approximation.   So your answer is about [math] 10^{-4.34}[/math] which s a little more than 0.00004 (because it is close to the cube root of 100 times ten to the power of -5).  Of course, this is only an approximation.  Exact calculation reveals that the true answer is a little less than 0.00004, but our approximation gave us a good estimate that we could do in our head. ",

            "answer_text": "This kind of problem can be solved using a binomial distribution function analysis as follows. Let (a +b)^N = N!{\u03a3 [a^(N-j+1)][b^(j-1)]/[(j-1)!][(N-j+1)!]}, with a = .96, the chance of non-occurrence and b = .04, the chance of occurrence. 1 \u2264 j \u2264 (N+1) where N, in this case = number of events = 250 and j-1 = number of non-occurrences, which in this case = 0. Therefore, the probability of 0 non-occurrences after 250 actions = 250![(.96)^250][(.04)^0]/(0!)(250!) = .0000369\u2026.,about .0037%. The forgoing expression offers the means to determine a comprehensive range of outcomes for a comprehensive range of inputs and is rather more than is needed to respond to this question. A simpler approach would be to say that if an event has a .96 probability of non occurrence subject to a certain action, then the probability of continued non-occurrence after 250 such actions would = .96^250 = .0000369\u2026., about .0037% exactly as determined above.
