            "answer_text": "A permutation of a set [math]X[/math] is a function which maps [math]X[/math] to itself in a one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) fashion. For example, if [math]X = \\{ a, b, c \\}[/math], then there are exactly six permutations of [math]X[/math]. One of them is the identity function [math]a \\mapsto a, b \\mapsto b, c \\mapsto c[/math]. I leave it to you to write down the remaining five. If [math]X = \\mathbb{N}[/math], then there are [math]2^{\\aleph_0}[/math] permutations of [math]X[/math]. I wouldn't try to write all of these down if I were you. ",

One of the easiest ways to formalize the idea of a permutation is to define a permutation of a set to be any bijection from the set to itself. ",
