            "answer_text": "Math. The more hard core math you know the more clear your eventual philosophical thinking of math will be. Don't miss this opportunity to formally study what is a real number and what's an infinite set. People who don't take undergrad math major courses simply aren't well positioned to reason philosophically about math. You should go as technically deep as you possibly can, then the philosophy will make a lot more sense. In particular, although set theory is the foundation of twentieth century math, there are alternatives starting to percolate at the research level. Homotopy type theory, intuitionist logic, topos theory. There's a lot of influence from computer science into axiomatic systems and formal proof systems. All these things influence the modern philosophy of math. In short, go as hard core as you can into the math and computer science. You can't really philosophize about things you don't know. ",

            "answer_text": "At the undergraduate level, taking a double major in both math and philosophy is a good option. Having the experience with both perspectives will be helpful if you decide to go on to graduate school and pursue an academic career. Or if you decide to seek other employment, the wide range of skills reflected by both majors will again be helpful.  If you have to choose only one major, philosophy or computer science might be better choices considering your interests than math. Math departments rarely offer much pure logic. The closest you might get is a course in set theory, but even that is rarely seen below the graduate level.  ",
