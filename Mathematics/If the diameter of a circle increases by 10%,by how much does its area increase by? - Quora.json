            "answer_text": "Whatever we increase the diameter by, we also increase the radius by the same length. By this logic, we know that if the diameter is increased by 10%, then so is the length of the radius. Since we don\u2019t know the length of the radius of the original circle, we can assign it to the variable [math]r[/math]. This means that the length of the new radius is equivalent to [math]1.1r.[/math] Then, we can substitute the value of the new radius in the equation [math]\u03c0r^2[/math] to find the percentage increase in the area. Solving for this expression, we get [math]1.21\u03c0[/math]. This tells us that the total area of the circle increases by 21% when the diameter is increased by 10%. [math]\\boxed{21 \\%}[/math] ",
