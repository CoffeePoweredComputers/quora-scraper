            "answer_text": "Over the 10 days, the 12 guys work a total of 960 hrs, so that is now the known value of the work. By multiplying the new number of hours (15) by the revised time period (8 days) we arrive at the hours per man achievable - 120 hours.If we then divide the total number of hours for the job by the per man hours, we arrive at total number of men required - 960 / 120 = 8. However, that's on paper!In the real world this solution to productivity often results in missed milestones.Firstly, even assuming its permissible to work 15hr shifts in your industry, the additional break periods required make consistent progress difficult & thus tasks need a lot more planning & management.In most cases the 8 day timeframe would tip many into needing an extended downtime before the end of the project, so an additional pool of men would be needed to cover. This is a recurring problem highlighted by the golden triangle of money & time vs resources If the money is reduced it means the resources cant be increased or perhaps even reduced, so the time has to give way.If the time has to be reduced then the cost must be increased to compensate. In the given example, two sets of 12 x 8hr day men is probably your best solution depending on the environment.This way you could either overlap them or work a 16hr double shift. In any event you achieve a 192hr man day, so the same set of work now only takes 5 days & nobody had to work additional hours. Of course it cost more, but then more people were employed, felt valued & were a part of the money chain. You decide what's the more important. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, it's not possible. Adding people slows down the work, for a whole lot of reasons. The new workers have to be trained on the project by the existing workforce, which reduces the time available to actually get productive work done.More workers require more management. More management increases the time taken up by meetings, dealing with employee problems, etc.The work environment is more crowded, resulting in less efficient organization of tools and materials. In effect, the more people around you sharing the same basic set of resources, the longer it takes for any one person to actually find and use the resources they need.Coordination now takes more time than before, and there is a greater risk of productivity-reducing personal conflicts, differing work styles, etc.The 15 hour workday dramatically reduces everyone's efficiency. More mistakes are made, more work has to be repeated. There are more sick days.If you really want to get the job done more quickly, reduce the size of the workforce instead of increasing it. Hire only the most experienced workers, ideally people who already know how to work together as a team due to past experience. And never add new people in quantity to a project that's already underway. That is a recipe for disaster. ",

            "answer_text": "We know this: 12 men : 8 hours/day : 10 days x men : 15 hours/day: 8 days Lets try and reduce the number of variables which can be done if we eliminate a common factor between the two. For this lets see how many days 12 men would take to complete the work if they worked 15 hours instead of 8. Now we know that if 12 men work harder, they will complete work quicker. So the rate of work and the duration are inversely proportional. So 8 h/d : 10 15 h/d : y days Then y = 8 *10/15 = 80/15 = 16/3 days. Now we can refactor the first set of equations as : 12 : 15 : 16/3 x : 15 : 8 We can eliminate 15 because its the same. 12 : 16/3 x : 8 Since x men take more time than 12 men, x must be lesser than 12. Therefore 8*x = 12 * 16/3 or x = 12 * 2/3 = 8 men. ",

Many types of work actually proceed more slowly when you add new staff because new staff requires training, which reduces the productivity of the senior staff doing the training. As a software engineer, I can tell you that new staff is always a cost center at first. ",
