            "answer_text": "Here it goes :- A proper subset of a set A is a subset of A that is not equal to A. In other words, if BB is a proper subset of A, then all elements of B are in A but A contains at least one element that is not in BB. For example, if A={1,3,5} then B={1,5} is a proper subset of A. The set C={1,3,5} is a subset of A, but it is not a proper subset of A since C=A. The set D={1,4} is not even a subset of A, since 4 is not an element of A. Subset sign :  Proper Subset sign:  That is the main difference. ",

            "answer_text": "Subset: A set is A said to be a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B and we write it as A\u2286B. Proper subset: A non-empty set A is said to be a proper subset of B, if and only if all the elements of set A are in set B and atleast one element of B is not in A. It is represented as A\u2282B. eg. Let A={1,3,5} and B={1,3,5,7} . Then, every element of A is in B but A\u2260B. Therefore, A\u2282B. Hope this helps. Have a good day !!! :) ",
