As per order operation rule PEDMAS P = Parenthesis E = Exponents D = Division M = Multiplication A = Addition S = Substraction A-(C+D) for (C+D)=B A-B is the answer For example, A = 10, C = 3, D = 6 Then, first solve (C+D) = (3+6) = 9 so B = 9 Now A = 10 A-B = 10\u20139 = 1 is the answer. Or with A-C-D, = 10\u20133\u20136 = 7\u20136 = 1 ",
