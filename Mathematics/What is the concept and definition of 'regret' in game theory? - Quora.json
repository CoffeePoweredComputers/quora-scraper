            "answer_text": "Consider a penalty shootout in football: It's a zero sum game. Suppose striker is following a mixed strategy of shooting left, half the time and shooting right, rest of the time. Now, optimal strategy for goalie is to jump left, half the time and jump right for rest of the time. But, in any particular strike, If striker strikes left and goalie jumps left, then there is a goal. And goalie then regrets why he jumped left. But that regret is only ex post.
