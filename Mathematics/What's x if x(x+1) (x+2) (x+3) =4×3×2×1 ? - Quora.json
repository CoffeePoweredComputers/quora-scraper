            "answer_text": "[math]x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1[/math] By inspection, [math]x = 1[/math] is a solution, since the RHS is a product of consecutive integers, with the smaller number being [math]1[/math], and the LHS can be seen as a product of consecutive integers, with the smaller number being [math]x[/math], for [math]x[/math] integer. Rewriting the equation as: [math]x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) = (-4) \\times (-3) \\times (-2) \\times (-1)[/math] we see that [math]x = - 4[/math] is also a solution. However, [math]x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) - 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1[/math] is a polynomial of 4-th degree. Hence, it has 4 roots. We have found two. Consider [math]y = (x + 1)(x + 2) = x^2 + 3x + 2[/math] and notice that [math]x(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x = y - 2[/math] The equation becomes: [math]y(y - 2) = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1[/math] or simply: [math]y^2 - 2y - 24 = 0[/math] The roots of this polynomial are: [math]y = -4, \\ y = 6[/math] This gives: [math]x^2 + 3x + 2 = - 4, \\ x^2 + 3x + 2 = 6[/math] or simply: [math]x^2 + 3x + 6 = 0, \\ x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0[/math] We know that [math]x = 1[/math] is a solution of one of the equations above. Notice that the first equation doesn\u2019t have positive solutions. Therefore, [math]x = 1[/math] is a solution of the second equation (this is easily verified). On the other hand, the product of the roots of a polynomial is equal to [math]-4[/math], therefore the other root has to be [math]x = -4[/math]. This one was already found. We only need to find the solutions of the first equation. [math]x^2 + 3x + 6 = 0 \\iff x = \\dfrac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{-15}}{2}[/math] The solutions of the first equation are complex: [math]x = - \\dfrac{3}{2} - i \\dfrac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}, \\  x = - \\dfrac{3}{2} + i \\dfrac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}[/math] The solutions of the equation [math]x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1[/math] are: [math]x_1 = -4[/math] [math]x_2 = 1[/math] [math]z = - \\dfrac{3}{2} - i \\dfrac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}[/math] [math]\\bar{z} = - \\dfrac{3}{2} + i \\dfrac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}[/math] ",
