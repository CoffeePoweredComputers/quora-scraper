            "answer_text": "Let [math]A[/math] be some matrix with the LU decomposition, [math]A = LU \\tag*{}[/math] Then the LDL decomposition of [math]A[/math] would be of the form [math]A = LDL^{T} \\tag*{}[/math] We can accomplish this by extracting the pivots of [math]U[/math] in order to construct the diagonal matrix [math]D= \\text{diag} \\left[ U_{11}, \\dots, U_{nn} \\right][/math]. From there, we can notice that [math]U[/math] can be written as [math]DL^{T}[/math]. Now, we could stop there since LDL decomposition is closely related to Cholesky decomposition, but we can take things even further if [math]A[/math] is positive semi-definite. Specifically, consider [math]\\sqrt{D} = \\text{diag} \\left[ \\sqrt{U_{11}}, \\dots, \\sqrt{U_{nn}} \\right][/math]. This allows us to write [math]A = LDL^{T} = \\left( L \\sqrt{D} \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{D} L^{T} \\right) \\tag*{}[/math] If we let [math]R = \\sqrt{D} L^{T}[/math], then we can further write [math]A = R^{T}R = R R^{T} \\tag*{}[/math] .. which is exactly the Cholesky decomposition.
