Numerology is a vast science that works parallel to our day to day life, even if we accept it or not. Numerology is a number\u2019s vibration. It involves your date of born, birth month, year and sum of a complete date.

His speech includes Hope for people and for the prosperity of the nation. In his speech, he urged people to switch off lights and light candles on 5 April 2020, at 9.00 pm for 9 minutes. He said, this is done to invoke hope within countryman & specially to poor people 9 is a Karmic number, who\u2019s ruler is Mars. Its strength here represents care for each other, and nourishment for the world. When this number rules, it provides care, even though one has to fight through to provide care. It also represents doctors, surgeons, and fighters too. The focus is on number 9 by lightening candle at 9.00 pm for 9 minutes is increasing the strength of the country, magnifying hope, increase care and nourishment within the nation. This is to be done to enhance power within the nation to fight and win CORONAVIRUS (by maintaining social distancing i.e. main cause of spreading virus) The increasing strength of no. 9 by lightening candles at 9 pm for 9 minutes on April 5 may increase the strength of Mars to some extent to increase nourishment, care, and fighting spirit for the nation. Similarly, there is interpretation of every number. Hope this helps!!!
