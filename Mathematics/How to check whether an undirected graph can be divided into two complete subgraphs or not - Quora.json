            "answer_text": "If you are not intimately familiar with any of the following terms, look them up on Wikipedia: Complete graphCliqueConnected Component (Undirected)Vertex DegreeAdjacentPartitionJust to make your question clear, do you mean \u201chow do we know if the graph is exactly two connected components, where each component is a complete subgraph\u201d? Then read the claims below. EDIT: Finding cliques is much harder, I now realize, and that must be the original problem the question was asking. I\u2019ll think about the problem and try to find a new solution but I won\u2019t post it here. Claim 1: If G is a graph with two connected components G1 and G2, and G1 and G2 are complete graphs of size m and n, then every node of G1 has degree m - 1 and every node of G2 has degree n - 1 . Thus each node in G has either degree m - 1 or degree n - 1(This is obvious). Claim 2: If G is as described in claim 1, there is no node u with degree m - 1 and node v with degree n - 1 such that u and v are adjacent (unless all the nodes in both connected components have the same degree. In this case, proceed with the following claims). Claim 3: If G has two connected components G1 and G2 of size m and n and any node of G1 has degree < m - 1 or any node of G2 has degree < n - 1, then either G1 or G2 is not a complete graph (By definition of complete graph). Claim 4: If G has two connected components G1 and G2 of size m and n and every node of G1 has degree = m - 1 and every node of G2 has degree n - 1, then G1 and G2 are both complete graphs. I deliberately wrote this post as a series of insights about the structure of the desired graph instead of a description of an algorithm so that you have to do the hard work yourself. Enjoy. Bonus problem: Generalize the problem to n connected components, where component C_i is a complete graph of size s_i. (Shouldn\u2019t be hard if you get the 2 connected component case.) ",
