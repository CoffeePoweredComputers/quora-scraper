            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a straightforward algorithm for solving linear congruences via the Euclidean algorithm for greatest common divisors, but with small coefficients, ad hoc methods work fine as well. If we view the equation [math]5x+22y=18[/math] modulo 5, it becomes [math]2y \\equiv 3 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{5}, \\quad y \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5}, \\quad y=-1 + 5t, \\quad t \\in \\mathbb{Z}.[/math] Substitute [math]y=-1+5t[/math] into [math]5x+22y=18[/math], do some simple algebra, and get [math]x=8\u201322t,[/math] so the general solution is [math]\\boxed{x=8\u201322t, \\quad y=-1+5t}[/math] These two results give all solutions as [math]t[/math] ranges over all integers (obviously there are infinitely many solutions). But perhaps it should be noted that there is no uniqueness for the solution formulas. For example, we can change both occurrences of the parameter [math]t[/math] by any 1\u20131 onto function of the integers and get different but just as valid parametric formulas using [math]f(t)[/math] in place of [math]t[/math]. These formulas will look different but output the same solution pairs. We cannot simultaneously have [math]8\u201322t>0[/math] and [math]-1+5t>0[/math] for any integer value of [math]t[/math], since this would require [math]\\frac15 < t < \\frac{4}{11}[/math], so there are no solutions with both [math]x[/math] and [math]y[/math] positive. The first few solutions [math](x,y)[/math] for [math]t=0,1,2,3[/math] are [math](8,-1)[/math], [math](-14,4)[/math], [math](-36,9)[/math], [math](-58,14)[/math]. The slope of the line is [math]-5/22[/math], so each time [math]x[/math] goes up (or down) by 22, [math]y[/math] goes down (or up) by 5. ",
