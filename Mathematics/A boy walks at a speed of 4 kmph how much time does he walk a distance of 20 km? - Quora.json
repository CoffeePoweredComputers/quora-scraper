You mean point A to point B? 20km.. at 4 kph walking speed\u2026 Well, if he was REALLY worried about being late for something at outset that would be 5 hours walking plus 2 x 15 min breaks,(few 10yr olds could walk that long without a rest-short legs) + 1 hour 20 minutes totally distracted aimlessly by something \u2018COOL\u2019, like a rabbit path into the bushes,deer track etc, 15 minutes having a dump and picking nose in bushes, so probably about 7 hours 10 minutes and I doubt he could tell you why he was late. WITHOUT any urgency at outset, arrival time would be only slightly longer.. (An \u2018urgent\u2019 start would wear off at the first distraction,and realisation of broken deadline would sap the worry- Late is Late : whats another day grounded?) Boys, eh? ;#} Pretend to be Annoyed, its not his fault really. ",

            "answer_text": "A boy walks at a speed of 4km/hr. How much time does he take to walk a distance of 20km? Answer 6.5 hours. Along that stretch of 20km the boy has two stops. The first is to stop at his Aunt\u2019s house to pick up some money. But he has to wait 1/2 hour for his Aunt to stop gossiping on the phone so he can ask for the money. The other stop is at the grocery store, but he has trouble finding the things his mother told him to get, so that adds an hour. Maybe subtraction will be easier for you than division :-P ",
