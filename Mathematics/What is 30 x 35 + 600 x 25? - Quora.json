            "answer_text": "You can evaluate the given numerical expression, 30 x 35 + 600 x 25, by using the correct order of operations as explained below: \"Here is a summary of the ideas pertaining to simplifying numerical expressions. When evaluating a numerical expression, perform the operations in the following order. (1.) Perform the operations inside the symbols of inclusion (parentheses, brackets, braces) and above and below each fraction bar. Start with the innermost inclusion symbol. (2.) Perform all multiplications and divisions in the order in which they appear from left to right. (3.) Perform all additions and subtractions in the order in which they appear from left to right.\" \u00b9 Therefore, using these rules, we evaluate the given numerical expression as follows: 30 x 35 + 600 x 25 = 1,050 + 600 x 25 = 1,050 + 15,000 = 16,050 is the result or final answer. \u00b9 Jerome E.
