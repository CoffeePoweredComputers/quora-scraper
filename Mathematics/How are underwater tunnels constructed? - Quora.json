            "answer_text": "Imagine a tin can sealed at both ends, like a can of vegetables. Now dig a trench on the bottom underwater and line the bottom with stone that ramps up at say seven degrees to a beach above water. Starting on the beach lower several tin cans so they fit together end to end and weld the outside end edges together. As you are doing this successively deeper in the water, start opening the end of the can we will call a bulkhead as you would to get the vegetables out of the end of the can. Always have the outside welding a can ahead of the one you are opening the lid on. Do this until you have a string of cans running underwater in an arc from daylight on one end to daylight on the other end. Now build the road or track bed inside the can. You have just built a hole in the water, also known as an underwater tunnel. Scale up the iron cans to a diameter of about 10\u201314 meters (30\u201342 feet), put the road bed on a platform so the area under the platform can act as a sump to pump water from,mostly from rain, add a ceiling chase for electrical and ventilation ducts, build a huge fan at each end to move air through the tunnel and you have a common method for one of the most expensive necklaces ever built.

            "answer_text": "Here are a couple construction methods for underwater tunnels: The BART Transbay tube was generally constructed by:- preparing a pad on the floor of the San Francisco Bay, - placing and connecting tunnel segments in the wet, - placing ballast on the tunnel, and - pumping water out of the tunnel. The Channel Tunnel between England and France was constructed with the use of tunnel boring machines (also known as TBMs).  TBMs drill through soil or rock while simultaneously placing structural segments behind the drilled cavity.   Some links: Channel TunnelA History of BART: The Project BeginsTunnel boring machine ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways in which you can construct underwater tunnels:One way of building them is to floats the tubes into position using boats, sink them and then get divers to seal the pieces together. After this pump the water out of the tubes and you have a tunnel.  Another way is to dig down so deep you reach below the sea and potentially dig a tunnel through the rock how you would a mine. There shouldn't be any affect from water as there will be a thick layer of stone above the tunnel keeping you away from water. If the rock / soil is not able to keep water out you can pump compressed air into the tunnel so the pressure inside is greater than the outside and then proceed to seal the inside with concrete and steel lining.

            "answer_text": "There are lots of ways, many involving boring machines, but I will mention how the George Massey Tunnel south of Vancouver was built.  This is the site of the crossing. In the foreground you can see 6 rectangular structures. These are the tunnel sections made out of reinforced concrete. The sections were laid in pairs so 3 sections would make up the north bound lane and three the south bound lane. When they were completed, the pit they were built in was flooded and the retaining wall to the river removed. The sections were then floated into place and then sunk into the river where they fell into a channel dredged for them. Each section was connected to the others, the channel was backfilled burying the sections, and then the water was pumped out. Incidentally, the tunnel marks the lowest point of any highway in Canada, being lower than sea level. ",

It involves the tunnelers working in the shield removing material and replacing with the tunnel wall e.g. brick. Gradually moving forwards. The principle is used in modern subterranean tunnelling but using a large boring machine and precast concrete rings to create the tunnel wall. ",
