            "answer_text": "Two ways: R = (R1 x R2) / (R1 + R2)R = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2) On a calculator: input R1, press 1/x, then press +, input R2, press 1/x, press =, then 1/x. If you have more resistors of various values in parallel, just continue inputting their values and pressing 1/x after each, and press = when you got all of them, and then 1/x. Very simple, and fairly fast.",
