            "answer_text": "We can use a basic concept which formulated as: Selling Price i.e SP Cost Price i.e CP Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit; Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price; Now, calculating percentage as below Profit Percentage = { ( Selling Price - Cost Price )/ Cost Price } x 100; Or, SP = CP {1 + (Profit/100)}; \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 Let SP is 100X And CP is the sum of the cost involved in the article before selling, here CP is the sum of purchasing cost and repairing cost; i.e 380 + 20% of SP; = 380 + {(20/100) x 100X} = 380 + 20X So, as per above formula \u2014\u2014 1 100X = (380 + 20X) {1 + (20/100)}; 100X = (380 + 20X ) (120/100); 5X = (19 + X) (6/5); 25X - 6X = 114; 19X = 114; X = 6 So, Selling Price is Rs. 600 ",
