            "answer_text": "ALWAYS start by visualizing the problem. Picturing 39 people might be difficult, but you can picture 3\u20135 people, cooperating on one little section of road, right? Watch a little time-lapse in your head. Over 5 hours, they get a certain amount of work done. Figure that happens many times over, as you have many such squads. Okay, now remove a couple of those 3\u20135 person squads, but make them spend an extra hour that day. Uh-oh! According to local labor law, they now need a paid lunch break!Oh, hey, fixing a road is hard work. The workers are tired by the time they get into the sixth hour of the day.Wait, for some reason, with fewer people on the task they worked faster (because it\u2019s less crowded) or slower (because they had a special time-saving machine that can only be operated with exactly 39 people).Maybe these bullets are true, or maybe they aren\u2019t. Since the question doesn\u2019t say one way or other, you need to make assumptions. You need to be aware of the assumptions that you makeYou need to state your assumptions with your answerThe Number You Want: Check it out: Dimensional analysis. 39 people * 12 days * 5hrs/(day) = 2340 person-hours 2340 person-hours/(30 people * 6hrs/day) = 13 days. All I did was blindly set up the units so that they \u201cwork\u201d. In other words, I make sure I put a number in the numerator or denominator so that all the units cancel out, and I\u2019m left with an answer in \u201cdays\u201d. The Correct Answer Thirteen days, assuming a person-hour is the same in both scenarios. In other words, I\u2019m assuming the above bullet points don\u2019t apply, and a worker gets the same amount done per hour in either scenario. That\u2019s what my dimensional analysis assumes; that I genuinely can apply the work rate from the one scenario to the other scenario. It\u2019s not an unreasonable assumption in this case, but it still needs to be stated. Why am I harping on assumptions? There are an awful lot of answers on this site that DON\u2019T state their assumptions. They make it look like you can blindly charge into the arithmetic. What if the question had suggested that each worker instead works 30 hours per day? The assumption-free answers would be setting you up for failure. ",

            "answer_text": "It is actually very simple, just calculate the man days/hours required to complete work in such a question. In this case, it is more relevant to calculate man hours, so 39 men can complete work in 12 days (=12*5 = 60 hours). So total 39*60=2340 hours are required to complete. Now equate this with other side. 30 men working 6 hours a day, so we have 180 manhours available each day. We had 2340 manhours of work and 180 manhours/day available. We can divide and get answer. This is the basic concept of an such question Now for any sort of competitive exam, we should always try to equate 2 sides and practice solving such kind of question in our mind. I did it quickly as follows 39men*12days*5hours = 30men*x days*6hours x days = 39*12*5/(30*6) ",
