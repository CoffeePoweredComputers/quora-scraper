            "answer_text": " Ever a homework staple, I\u2019m glad to see we\u2019re still painting houses to this day! Now, naturally, when painting a house, you\u2019ll want it to be one unified colour; it would hardly do to have half a dozen tints across the house. The issue here is that Sally\u2019s paint of choice is a smidge lighter than John\u2019s preference. Ever perfectionists, the two insist on having a unified palette, and a heated debate arises as to which paint to use. John eventually concedes defeat, just wanting to get the whole thing over with, and asks to borrow some of Sally\u2019s paint; but having just been in a big tiff, she refuses, so he has to go out and buy some of her preferred paint type. While out, he decides to pick up a coffee, after all, it\u2019s clearly going to be a long day. Time elapsed: Roughly one hour. With this out of the way, John and Sally quickly notice that around the back there is a big mold issue; they\u2019d be remiss in their duties if they paint over that mess. They call up the owner and tell him he\u2019s going to need to call them back in once he\u2019s dealt with the mold issue. Fortunately, the owner happens to be good friends with Pete, who has a lot of experience cleaning up after such mold issues, and the process is delayed by only one day. However, the new partnership between John and Sally gets even nastier overnight, with their earlier arguments sparking ever more antagonism. Time elapsed: One day. The hour wasted earlier is no longer relevant, as they start up at the same time in the morning. The two finally get to work in earnest. Sally, feeling increasingly guilty for letting her pride get in the way of a good professional relationship, decides to go out and buy both of them some lunch. Unfortunately, unaware of her attempts to make amends, John is outraged to see her leaving him to do all the work; and while she\u2019s gone, in a peal of rage, he decides to cover the area Sally had been working on with paint remover. Sally returns, and upon seeing what he had done, threw John\u2019s meal at him and walked home. Later that day, the two formally end their ill-fated cooperative business. John, already in a very bad mood, takes his anger out on the walls; his paint style, usually so professional and well managed, becomes vigorous and angry. Still, he finishes the job, and goes home.  Time elapsed: One day, and 8 hours. The next morning, John and Sally both wake up to a barrage of angry messages. Between the paint removal on Sally\u2019s section, and John\u2019s angry poor work on the project, the house looks even worse than when they started.  The owner demands they start again from scratch; but both of their schedules are already filled for the next few days, as they had not expected this one to take so long. Sally, well and truly done with this whole mess, forfeits her share of the payment, and explains that she will be leaving the painting to John in favour of resuming her standard efficient practice. It\u2019s almost two weeks before John can finally return. Without their poor co-operation, he cleans up the mess in two hours, and then starts repainting. Due to the scale of the house being very large, John found that he couldn\u2019t quite cover all of the second floor in his standard six hours, however. I mean, obviously houses of different dimensions take different times to paint, it\u2019s not like you can just cover everything from a small apartment to a mansion in the same timeframe. He comes back first thing in the morning, and finishes it off. Total time elapsed: Two weeks, one day, and 2 hours.Just copy in this entire answer. Your teacher will be sure to give you high marks for this. ",
