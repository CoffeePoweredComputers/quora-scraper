            "answer_text": "Original Question: A fruit seller sold 32 mangoes and was left with 13 mangoes. How many mangoes did the fruit seller have in the beginning? The ambiguity in this question is a bit perplexing, to be honest. How many mangoes did the fruit seller have in the beginning? At the beginning of what exactly though? Is it at the beginning of the universe? I'm pretty sure it's safe to say he had no mangoes at that point. Is it the beginning of his life? I'm still fairly certain he didn't have any mangoes to sell just yet. Is it the beginning of his career as a fruit merchant? Now we're getting somewhere. Assuming he ordered a shipment of X mangoes at the beginning of his career, and has sold 32 mangoes in his entire career, simple arithmetic would lead us to believe that X is indeed, a grand total of 45. Unfortunately, we do not know which \u201cbeginning\u201d you are talking about. We don't even know if he's an honest businessman or not. For all we know, he could've sold a few mangoes and eaten a couple of them by himself. Maybe he cheated an old blind lady who came over to purchase some mangoes. Lord knows that the fruit selling business is neither exciting, nor lucrative. But I digress. To answer your question, he had at least 45 mangoes to sell, of which he sold 32, and still has at least 13 still left to sell. ",
