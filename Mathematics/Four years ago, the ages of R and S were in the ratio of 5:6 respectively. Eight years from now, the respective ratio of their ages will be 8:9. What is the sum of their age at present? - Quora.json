            "answer_text": "Friends\u2026! Four years ago, the ages of R and S were in the ratio of 5:6 respectively. Let the present ages of the two be R years and S.years Four years ago their ages were R- 4 and S - 4. The ratio of their ages was 5:6. Accordingly (R - 4)/(S - 4) = 5 / 6 Criss multiplication 6 (R - 4) = 5 (S - 4) 6R - 24 = 5S - 20 6R = 55 + 24 - 20 6R = 5S + 4 Multiplying the equation with 3 18R = 15S + 12 \u2026Eq..1 Eight years from now, the respective ratio of their ages will be 8:9. Eight years from.now their ages will be R + 8 and S + 8. Their ratio will be 8/9 (R + 8): / (S + 8) = 8 / 9 Criss multiplication 9 (R + 8) = 8 (S + 8) 9R + 72 = 8S + 64 9R = 8S + 64 - 72 9R = 8S - 8 Multiplying the equation with 2 18R = 16S - 16 \u2026Eq..2 Equating Eq..1 and Eq. 2 15S + 12 = 16S - 16 15S- 16S = \u201416 - 12 \u2014S = \u201428 S = 28 years Substituting the value of S in Eq..2 18R = 16S - 16 18R = 16 \u00d7 28 - 16 18R =.448 - 16 18R = 432 R = 432/18 R = 24 years Thus present age of R is 24 years and present age of S is 28 years . Sum of their ages = 24 + 28 = 52 years Answer: Present age of R is 24 years and present age of S is 28 years and sum of their present ages is 52 years ",
