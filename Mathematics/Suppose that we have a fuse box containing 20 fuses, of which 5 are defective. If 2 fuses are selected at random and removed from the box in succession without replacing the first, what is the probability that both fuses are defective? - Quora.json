            "answer_text": "Second verse, same as the first. P(B\u2223A)=4/19 because when given that you have selected one defective fuse ... If you've done combinations, you see that there are (53)=10 ways to choose any 3 of the 5 defective fuses. There are (203)=1140 ways of choosing 3 fuses at random from the 20 fuses. ",
