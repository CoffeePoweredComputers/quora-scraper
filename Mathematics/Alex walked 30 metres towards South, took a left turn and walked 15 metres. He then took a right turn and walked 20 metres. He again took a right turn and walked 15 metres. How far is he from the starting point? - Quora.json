            "answer_text": "The answer to this question depends on the angles at the turning point therefore to measure the exact distance travelled one need to mention the magnitude at turning point. As the question is specifically asking the distance between initial and final point so to ascertain that we need to draw up the whole path covered as a figure and then calculate the distance between both points.
