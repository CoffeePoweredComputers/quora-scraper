            "answer_text": "No idea about your class 10 syllabus, it varies from country to country. But in general, I suggest you think differently. Rather than asking what is the \u201cmost difficult\u201d to the people, ask to yourself what is the \u201cmost exciting\u201d chapter. That way, you like math or not, at least your mind has something to look forward to, and that is going to earn you a lot of positive down the line. If you like math, you are going to be a winner. If you are afraid of math, you are at least going to be a healthy survivor. Most importantly, you are going to like math more than before, no matter how good you are at it. And not only math, this applies for every subject, regardless of your love and expertise in the subject. ",
