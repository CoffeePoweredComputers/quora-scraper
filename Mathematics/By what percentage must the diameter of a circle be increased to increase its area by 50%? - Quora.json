            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with a formula relating area A and diameter D. Area is usually expressed in terms of radius R as A=pi*(R^2). Diameter in terms of a radius is expressed as D=2R. So, R=D/2. We can substitute this into a formula for area A as follows. A=pi*(R^2)=pi*[(D/2)^2]=pi*(D^2)/4 From this we can resolve it for D, thus expressing a diameter in terms of an area: (D^2)=4A/pi D=sqrt(4A/pi) If area is increased by 50% (that is, new area B=1.5*A), the new diameter will be E=sqrt(4B/pi)=sqrt(4*1.5*A/pi)= sqrt(1.5)*sqrt(4*A/pi)=sqrt(1.5)*D So, new diameter E=sqrt(1.5)*D, the increase in diameter from old D to new E is E-D=[sqrt(1.5)-1]*D. Expressed in percentage relative to D, this is [sqrt(1.5)-1]*100%, which is approximately 22.47%. So, we need to increase a diameter by approximately 22.47% to increase the area by 50%. ",

            "answer_text": "Forget all those fancy formulas. Forget that it\u2019s about a circle. The answer will be the same whether it\u2019s a circle, square, triangle, or any other shape. Area (a 2-dimensional measurement) is proportional to the square of length (a 1 dimensional measurement). In the case of a circle, length is represented by radius or circumference. For a square it\u2019s the length of a side. If you want to increase area by a factor of 1.5 (a 50% increase), increase lengths by a factor of sqrt(1.5), or about 1.225 (about 22.5%). ",
