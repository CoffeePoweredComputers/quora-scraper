The easiest way to find the radius is dividing the diameter (the largest chord in the circle) by 2 i.e half of diameter. Another method. When area is given. Radius= sqrt (area/pi) Source: area =pi\u00d7 radius \u00d7radius. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot measure the radius of a circle, since you do not know its center. However, you can determine the center of the circle. Suppose you place a bottle or jar cap on a sheet of paper and draw the circle by running a pencil round the edge. You have a circle but the center is not known. Draw two chords of the circle, taking care that they are not parallel but form an acute or obtuse angle. Draw the perpendicular bisectors of the two chords. The point of intersection of these perpendicular lines determines the center of the circle. With a scale measure the distance from the center to any point on the periphery of the circle and you have its radius. ",

How you manipulate it depends on what information is already given, but the area is pi*r^2, the circumference is pi*d, and the diameter is 2r, so you can find the radius from any of those pieces of information. Example: you know the circumference. The circumference is pi*d. Therefore, you divide the circumference by pi to get the diameter, and then divide the diameter by 2. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on how the circle is presented to you. If you are given its Cartesian equation in the form x^2 +y^2 + 2g.x + 2f.y +c =0, then its centre is at (-g,-f) and its radius is \u221a(g^2 +f^2 -c). If it is given as (x-a)^2 +(y-b)^2 =r^2, and so clearly the centre is (a,b) and the radius is 'r'. If the polar equation is r = a, then the radius is |a|. The vector equation of a circle with centre at a and the position vector of an arbitrary point on the circle being r has an equation |r -a| = k has a radius k. A similar formula holds in the complex plane: |z-a| = k, for a circle with centre at z=a and radius k. On the other hand if you are given a circle as drawn on a plane, just draw two chords in it, take their perpendicular bisectors and the point of intersection of these is the centre of the circle and the distance of the centre from any point on the circumference of the circle is its radius.

Construct right-angle bisectors to these chords using a straight-edge and compass. Where the bisectors intersect will be the center of the circle. Draw a line from the center of the circle to the edge. This will be the radius and you can measure with whatever tool is most appropriate (ruler, yardstick, tape measure). ",

Well, it depends on what equipment you have! For a small circle use a micrometer.For a large circle use a tape measure - anchor the zero end on the perimeter and walk the other end around it. Note the maximum - that is the diameter.For medium circles - improvise!",
