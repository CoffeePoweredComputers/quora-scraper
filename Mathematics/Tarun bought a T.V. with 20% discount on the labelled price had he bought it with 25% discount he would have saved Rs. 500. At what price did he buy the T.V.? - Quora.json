            "answer_text": "Let the M.R.P. (Labelled Price) be x Discount1=20x/100 Cost Price1 =M.R.P. - Discount1 Cost Price1 =x - (20x/100) - (1) Cost Price2=M.R.P. - Discount2 Cost Price2=x - (25x/100) - (2) Cost Price1-Cost Price2=500 -(3) (As per question) On substituting the value Cost Price1 and Cost Price2 from equation (1) and (2) to equation (3). x - (20x/100) -(x-(25x/100)=500 x - (20x/100) - x + (25x/100)=500 Both the x gets eliminated (25x/100) - (20x/100)=500 5x/100=500 5x=500 X 100 x=(500 X 100) / 5 x=100 X 100 x=10000 Therefore, M.R.P.=x= 10000 Tarun\u2019s Cost Price at 20% Discount =M.R.P. - Discount1 Tarun\u2019s Cost Price at 20% Discount =10000 - 20% of 10000=10000 - 2000 = 8000 Therefore the cost price for Tarun is Rs 10000  Cross Check Discount1=20% Discount=2000 Discount2=25% Discount=2500 Their difference is 500. Hence Proved Tarun purchased the TV at Rs 8000 ",

            "answer_text": "Let me answer it in a very simple way: A difference in discount of 5% would have saved Rs 500, so we need to find a number whose 5% = 500, let that number be x (original price of TV) So, 5% of x = 500 5/100 * x = 500 => x = 10000 So, the actual cost of the TV is Rs. 10000 and he bought the TV at a discount of 20%, so he bought the Tv for Rs. 8000 ",
