            "answer_text": "I can give you a specific problem that my company has experienced that has been solved with a subset of statistics. We were founded after our CEO realized that anyone who employs remote teams (and for this purpose we can include outsourced employees) relinquishes a lot of control. As a manager (and this is especially true when you get into the outsourcing fiasco) you pay a set amount of money for a team to give you a specific product. The problem is that the employees you pay for are often unskilled and overworked. They\u2019re even shared between multiple clients. That means the people you\u2019re paying are working maybe a third of their time on your project. These circumstances just don\u2019t make for a good product (or a good situation from a humanistic approach, but don\u2019t get me started on that). So the problem is that there\u2019s no trust in these relationships. Remote workers could leave their desk for 5\u20136 hours and you would never know. Doesn\u2019t seem like something that could be solved by statistics, right? And yet, that\u2019s exactly what people are doing. There are other variants, but my company uses a software called Worksmart. It tracks employees (what apps they\u2019re working, how productive they\u2019re being, etc) and shows how they\u2019re doing in comparison to one another. They can see all of this, too. So if they see that statistically, Daniel has the most productive days, they can see what he\u2019s doing and try to emulate them. The software uses metrics to track how everyone is doing. It\u2019s solved a huge portion of the problems our CEO was first noticing. I use it (and so do all the rest of our workforce, including the CEO himself) and it\u2019s incredibly helpful. ",
