            "answer_text": "Let W denotes the whole amount of work required to complete the whole given job. It is mentioned that 30 workers complete W in 36 days. So we find that 1 worker in 1 day completes the amount of work = W/(30*36) It is mentioned that after 30 days, some workers joined and completed the job 2 days earlier. Let N denotes the number of new workers joined. Hence, we find that 30 workers in 30 days completed a part of W and after that N number of new workers joined and then (N + 30) workers completed the remaining part of W in 4 days (= 36 - 30 - 2). So we get the following equation, 30*30*W/(30*36) + (30 + N)*4*W/(30*36) = W or 5/6 + (30 + N)/(30*9) = 1 or 30 + N = (30*9)*(1 - 5/6) = (30*9)/6 = 45 or N = 45 -30 = 15 [Ans} ",
