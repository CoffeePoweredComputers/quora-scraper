            "answer_text": "281 energy is mostly about relationships. It is about coexistence, companionship, belonging, and being valued as a beautiful person. You bring a lot of positivity to the people who constantly surround you with love. These are your family and friends. To achieve the full potential of this energy, just sit back and relax for a moment because you deserve this time to yourself. Imagine the moment as a reservoir of energy, a river in an autumn flood flowing in its fullest. Thinking to much about the past or future restricts you from reaching your highest potential. And sometimes its as simple as letting go of things that you are holding on to, in order to realize your greatest potential. You are loved unconditionally, not for what you do, but in spite of who you are and what you do. ",
