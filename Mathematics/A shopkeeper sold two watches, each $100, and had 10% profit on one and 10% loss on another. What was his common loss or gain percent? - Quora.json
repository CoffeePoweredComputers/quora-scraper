            "answer_text": "Selling price(SP)of watch no1= $100 Selling price(SP) of watch no 2 = $100 PROFIT on watch no1 = 10% ie, $10 profit on $100 cost price(CP) Since, CP + PROFIT = SP 100 + 10 = $110 When SP is $110 , then CP is $100 Therefore, when SP is $100, then CP= (100x100)/110 = 1000/11 So, CP of watch no1 = $1000/11 \u2026\u2026\u2026....(1) Now LOSS on watch no2=10% ie, $10 loss on $100 CP Since, CP \u2014 LOSS = SP 100 - 10 = $90 When SP is $90 then CP is $100 Therefore, when SP is $100, then CP= (100x100)/90 = $1000/9 So CP of watch no2= $1000/9\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(2) Now, Total SP of both the watches= 100+100= $200\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(3) & Total CP of both the watches = 1000/11 +1000/9 = $ 20,000/99\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(4) Here, \u2026.(4) is >\u2026.(3) ie, CP > SP So, shopkeeper has to incur LOSS CP \u2014 SP = LOSS 20,000/99 \u2014 200 = ( 20,000 \u2014 19800)/99 = $200/99 LOSS LOSS% =( LOSS/ CP) x 100 LOSS% = (200/99) \u00f7 (20,000/99) x100 = (200 x 99) / (99x 20,000) x 100 = 1% ANS 1% LOSS Showing the method in short : CP of watch1 = {(100cp) / (on 110sp)} * 100sp = 10,000/110 = 1,000/11 CP of watch 2 = {(100cp) / (on 90sp)} * 100sp = 10,000/90 = 1,000/9 Total CP = (9thousand + 11thousand)/99 = 20thousand/99 So, loss = (20thousand/99) - 200 = 200/99 So, loss% =( loss/cp) * 100 => (200/99)/ (20thousand/99) * 100 = 1% & The shortest method is: . . . Just apply the formula.. If SP of 1 = SP of 2 & profit% on 1 = Loss % on 2 = x, Then, overall loss% = (x/10)\u00b2% This formula can be derived\u2026. ",
