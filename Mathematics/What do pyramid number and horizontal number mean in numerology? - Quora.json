The practice of Numerology is based upon the firm statement of Pythagoras, \u201cThe world is build upon the power of numbers. The entire universe is composed of mathematical patterns and all things can be expressed in numbers, which correspond to universal vibrations. These numbers determine our personalities, destinies and fortunes of individual.\u201d There are many types of Numerology; the most popular forms are the Kabbalah, the Chaldean and thePythagorean.

Kabbalah Numerology Kabbalah Numerology is originated from Hebrew mysticism and is based on the Hebrew alphabet. Kabbalah Numerology has only 22 vibrations because of the different alphabet. Kabbalah, which means knowledge that comes through the mind and soul, interprets only meaning of names. We always call it as Name Numerology. Chaldean Numerology  Chaldean numerology, sometimes known as \"Mystic Numerology\", is probably the oldest system of numerologyknown. Chaldean numerology is originated in Babylonia at the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers near the Persian Gulf. In Chaldean Numerology, the numbers assigned to the letters are not determined by alphabetical order, but instead by the vibration of each specific letter. It differs from Pythagorean numerology in that it does not assign the number 9 to any letter, although 9 can occur as the final sum. The number nine is thought to be holy and sacred and is therefore held apart from the rest of the numbers. Chaldean numerology analyzes both name (Name Numerology) and date of birth (Birthday Numerology). Rather than analyzing your birth name, however, Chaldean numerology analyses the name you are most commonly known by. It is considered to be more accurate the Pythagorean system, however, Chaldean numerology is less popular because it is more difficult to master. Pythagorean or Western Numerology  Pythagorean Numerology is by far the most commonly used system of numerology in the west. Part of its popularity arises from the fact that it is easy to learn how to translate numbers and master their meanings. It was created by the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who was born around 590 BC. Like Chaldean numerology,Pythagorean numerology analyzes both the name (Name Numerology) and date of birth (Birthday Numerology) and the interaction between the two. However, unlike Chaldean numerology, the numerology numbers are assigned to letters in sequence. It uses the numbers 1-9. The numbers 11 and 22 are considered to be master vibrations and are not reduced.
