            "answer_text": "This is a wonderful use case for dovetailing. You can interleave which axes you increment, thus covering every possible set at some point in the list. In this case, the axes are \"integers included in the set\" and \"size of the set\". So we continually increase the set of integers we are including in the subsets we are listing, and for each of these we will iterate through the possible sizes of sets. In other words, we will list all sets using the number 1, then all the sets including 1 and 2, then all the sets including 1 and 2 and 3, etc. And within each of those steps, we will list all the sets of size 1, all the sets of size 2, all the sets of size 3, etc. Integers included: 1. Size: 1.So begin with all sets including the integers 1 and of size at most 1. That gives us just {1}. Integers included: 1, 2. Size: 1.   <- incremented integers included, put size back to 1.Next do all sets including the integers 1 and 2 of size at most 1. That gives us {2} (because we skip repeats, and have already done {1}). Integers included: 1, 2. Size: 2.   <- incremented size.Next do all sets including the integers 1 and 2 of size at most 2. That gives us {1, 2}. Integers included: 1, 2, 3. Size 1.   <- incremented integers included, put size back to 1.Next do all sets including the integers 1, 2, and 3 of size at most 1. That gives us {3} (again skipping repeats). Integers included: 1, 2, 3. Size 2.   <- incremented size.Next do all sets including the integers 1, 2, and 3 of size at most 2. That gives us {1, 3}, {2, 3} (again skipping repeats). Integers included: 1, 2, 3. Size 3.   <- incremented size.Next do all sets including the integers 1, 2, and 3 of size at most 3. That gives us {1, 2, 3}. Integers included: 1, 2, 3, 4. Size 1.   <- incremented integers included, put size back to 1.Next do all sets including the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 of size at most 1. That gives us {4} (again skipping repeats). Integers included: 1, 2, 3, 4. Size 2.   <- incremented size.Next do all sets including the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 of size at most 2. That gives us {1, 4}, {2, 4}, {3, 4} (again skipping repeats). And so on... The above process yields the following sequence so far:{1}, {2}, {1, 2}, {3}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, {4}, {1, 4}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, ... One can see that any finite set of integers would show up in this sequence if you continue it long enough. Use this ordering to define a bijection between N and the finite sets of integers:1->{1}2->{2}3->{1, 2}4->{3}... And thus, the set containing all finite sets of integers is countable. ",

(It happens to be 773 in decimal). Where the nth digit from the left is a \u201c1\u201d if n is an element of the set, and \u201c0\u201d otherwise. Note all such numbers are finite, as a finite subset must have a largest element. Every subset corresponds to one number, and every number corresponds to one finite subset of N. This is a direct bijection between natural numbers and the finite subsets of N, proving the latter is countable. ",
