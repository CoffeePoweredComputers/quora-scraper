            "answer_text": "No, for continuous cases. A qualified yes for a finite set. (Of course, one can add the probability of the game not being played so something has to happen.) For example, one can imagine an experiment of throwing a dart at a target. All this is idealized but that makes the math easier (and more useful in some cases.) The probability of hitting the bullseye is proportional to area of the bullseye. (One normalizes things by assuming a really big backing of the target so no darts hit that target. Now consider hitting a given point rather than just falling into a target. The probability of hitting any given point is zero. However, the dart must hit some point. To make things weird, we consider the probability of hitting a point with irrational coordinates. This probability is one. However, there are rational points which could be hit (though with probability zero.) Thus the probability of hitting an irrational point is one, but this doesn\u2019t exhaust all possibilities. One resolves such cases by treating probability as a measure (a generalization of meters, feet, gallons, board feet, hectares, liters, etc.) Then, sets of measure zero an be ignored in calculations. These are borderline cases but the math has been done (over the last 200 years) and everything works out ok. ",
