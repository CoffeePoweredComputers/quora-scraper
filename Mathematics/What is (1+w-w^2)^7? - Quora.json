            "answer_text": "What is (1+w-w^2)^7? Well, on the face of it, expanding this we would obtain a polynomial expression of degree 14. But, I suspect that this isn\u2019t want you are after. If 1, w and w^2 are the cubic roots of unity (it would have helped if you had stated this), then: [math]1 + w + w^2 = 0 \\rightarrow 1 + w - w^2 = -2w^2[/math] Thus [math](1 + w - w^2)^7 = (-w^2)^7 = -w^{14} = -w^2[/math] [[math]w^0[/math] represents the complex number 1+0i = 1; multiplying this by w is equivalent to an anticlockwise (counterclockwise) rotation of 120\u00b0 on the argand-plane, thus [math]w^{14}[/math] represents a rotation of [math]14 \\times 120^{\\circ} = (4 \\times 3 + 2) \\times 120^{\\circ} = (4 \\times 360^{\\circ} + 240^{\\circ} \\equiv 240^{\\circ}[/math]] Converting [math]-w^2[/math] into \u2018Cartesian\u2019 format, we have: Answer: [math]\\frac {1}{2} + \\frac {\\sqrt{3}}{2}i[/math] ",
