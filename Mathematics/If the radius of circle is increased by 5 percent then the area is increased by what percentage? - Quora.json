            "answer_text": "Here is a quick way of giving an approximate answer to this and similar questions. Area is proportional to radius squared. For a small increase in radius of [math]\\delta x[/math], the increase in area will be approximately double that, in this case, [math]2\\times5[/math]%[math] = 10[/math]%. (The volume of a sphere would be roughly tripled.) This can be seen if we consider the original radius as [math]1[/math] and the new radius as [math]1+\\delta x[/math]. Thus the radius is multiplied by [math]1+\\delta x[/math] and the area by [math](1+\\delta x)^2[/math]. But [math](1+\\delta x)^2=1+2\\delta x+\\delta x^2[/math] and for [math]\\delta x<<1[/math], [math]\\delta x^2<<2\\delta x<<1[/math] so [math]\\delta x^2[/math] may be neglected. In other words, [math](1+\\delta x)^2\\approx1+2\\delta x[/math] and so if [math]\\delta x[/math] is [math]5[/math]%, then [math]2\\delta x[/math] is [math]10[/math]%. Volume increases as the cube of the radius, so we would have [math](1+\\delta x)^3=1+3\\delta x+3\\delta x^2+\\delta x^3)\\approx1+3\\delta x[/math], since for small [math]\\delta x[/math], [math]\\delta x^3[/math] is even smaller than [math]\\delta x^2[/math]. Note that the method applies for shapes other than circles and spheres, such as triangles, rectangles, cubes, pyramids etc. or indeed any shape that increases in the same proportion throughout. ",
