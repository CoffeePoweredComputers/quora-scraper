            "answer_text": "See the approach I took in Paul Olaru's answer to How can I prove A + B= (A union B) - (A intersection B)? and apply a similar one (universe is A union B, turn each set into a formula, then check that the formulas are equivalent). Alternatively you can do an equivalent proof without doing boolean formulas directly (just take the 4 cases, which are (x not in A and x not in B), (x not in A and x in B), (x in A and x not in B), (x in A and x in B) and go from there).
