            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t seen anything to the contrary- that you can\u2019t become great using math as a basis. Genius, however, is a product of learning, innovation, measurement and inspiration. Usually these are found in individuals in great quantities, from birth. If you aren\u2019t already interested in math you are incredibly unlikely to become a master of science. *Could is a very subjective quantity, that never takes into account motivation. It should also be noted that there are fields of science that do not include high level math. However, there are very few fields of science that do not involve basic math! As such, if you truly want to follow science, you can and should learn basic algebra. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, 99.99999% of the population is in the same boat as you and will never become like Einstein. The objective isn\u2019t to be Einstein, but rather to follow your passions. If you just so happen to be interested in pursuing mathematics, go for it. No one will stop you. See how far this interest will take you. Run with it. That, in my opinion, is the approach you should be taking. The first step, though, in making progress towards this seemingly impossible goal is to pick up a math textbook and get started. You\u2019re not going to wake up one morning as a math-whiz. Work your way up from the basics. ",
