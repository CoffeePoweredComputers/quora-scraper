            "answer_text": "It would take the Metric system changing to do what few things the Imperial (more accurately; Customary, the US doesn\u2019t use standard Imperial) still does better. Despite what many like to try and claim, Metric is just as arbitrary as Imperial, it\u2019s just designed in a way to where it\u2019s easy to convert within its own system instead of growing naturally based on how people used things day to day. Yes, Imperial is much harder and is somewhat confusing (to those not used to it). However, this is because that Metric is easy to understand and learn by design. It works in a base 10 system of measurement, every step up or down is a done so by a factor or divisor of 10. Imperial on the other hand doesn\u2019t; why? Because it works on a base of 12 and 16. Why is that important? Because 12 and 16 has better fractals than 10. 10 can be divided up evenly into 1, 2, 5, and 10. 12 on the other hand goes into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, while 16 goes into 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Those extra steps in between the endpoints are important if you\u2019re trying to get easy fractions out of a number (1/4, 1/3, etc). To see this in action, here are the \u2018digits\u2019 of each base; Base10: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Base12: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B Base16: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F Base10 10 in Base12 and Base16 is A. Base12 10 in Base10 is 12 while in Base16 is C. Where this gets especially confusing, and one of the biggest arguments against Imperial and for Metric, is that despite the math essentially including extra digits the digits used is still the standard base10 numeric system. However, people also tend to forget they use base12 every day\u2026 just look at your clock. We measure time in base12, 24 hours a day separated into 2 12 hour blocks, each hour separated into 12 sections of 5 (60) minutes, with each minute being 12 sections of 5 (60) seconds. For examples; There are 12 inches in a foot, there are 3 feet in a yard, and there are 5280 feet (1760 yards) in a mile. That last one is the odd one out, and where I see the biggest cries against (\u201cwhy should I have to remember 5280,1000 is much easier so therefore metric better!\u201d), but even that has it\u2019s reasons which make that argument silly. Mainly because the mile is based on chain, link, and furlong and not feet and yards (10 links make a chain, 100 chains make a furlong, and 8 furlongs make a mile) but ended up being described in feet and yards after those measurements became obsolete. Take this video for instance;  This is a satirical video making fun of the funny conversions in the imperial system, I genuinely thought is was funny and I did have a laugh. Ignoring all the units brought up not in use by anyone since the 1800s, a funny thing to note is that pretty much every conversion is done with one of the fractals of 12 and 16. Likewise for volume, there are 4 ounces in a gill, 2 gills make a cup, 2 cups make a pint, 2 pints is a quart, and 4 quarts equate to a gallon. It sounds like silly and arbitrary conversion, and it definitely is\u2026 but there is a point to it. The gallon is the way it is because that was the size of the containers used to measure wine. The quart was roughly the amount of dry goods (grain, flour, etc) people would purchase at a time. The pint was, well a pint\u2026 it has always been about the size of a tall drink and that was always what it was intended to measure. Gill is a strange one, as in reality it\u2019s only ever used in alcohol distillation and really is just a fancier way of saying half-cup. Ounce though, that was was designed from the start to be a measurement of volume based on weight, 1 ounce equating to 1/16 pounds (which coincidentally puts 1 pint at 1 pound). Teaspoon and Tablespoon are then defined as a fraction of an ounce (1/6 and 1/2 respectively), and those are there because they\u2019re very useful for cooking. Weight is actually a pretty easy one. As just stated, 16 ounces make a pound, 100 pounds make a hundredweight (duh), and 20 hundredweights make a ton. \u201cLong ton\u201d is actually one of the places the US\u2019s Customary diverges from Imperial as a hundredweight in Imperial is defined as 8 stones instead of 100 pounds, with 1 stone being 14 pounds, with the \u201clong ton\u201d being 20 hundredweights as measured by stone. Thank Britain for that one (hint; they still use it). Et cetera et cetera, I could keep going but this is starting to get excessively long. And no, before anyone gets stupid in the comments; I\u2019m not saying Imperial is better than Metric. In most situations Metric is better and is much easier to use day to day. I am not disputing this. However, 90% of the complaints I see of Imperial comes from people that don\u2019t even bother to try and learn the system let alone try to understand why it\u2019s still used. Hint; there\u2019s a reason a number of metric units are international standards (like Knots, Nautical mile, Grain, et cetera). However, what really get\u2019s me rialed up are argument like; \u201cImperial bad because it was made by cousin f**kers and is arbitrary, and Metric good because it is \u2018scientifically defined\u2019 (by itself with arbitrary numbers)!\u201d - Actual argument made by a source I actually expected to be objective, critical, and fair. It didn\u2019t help that the title made it sound like it was actually going to be examining what each system did and why, but then just was a 16 minute video of \u201cHa ha, Imperial cousin f**kers, metric numba 1!\u201d. This all compounds with the fact that most people who pass the highschool level in the US will be fluent in both metric and imperial. The military, industry, sciences, and others all generally use metric. So why must we switch to using only metric and why not everyone else also learn imperial? Is it too hard for you? If us \u201cstupid Americans\u201d can learn both, what does that make you if you can\u2019t? ",

            "answer_text": "An Act of Congress. Congress simply has to get over their 1988 policy that metric is preferred but metrication must be voluntary. No nation has successfully metricated in that manner. Some kind of \u201cMetric Board\u201d would have to be recreated (there was a useless one staffed with half opposition, half supporters, decades ago). That would help remaining sectors develop metrication plans and timetables, but have some power to require it. ",
