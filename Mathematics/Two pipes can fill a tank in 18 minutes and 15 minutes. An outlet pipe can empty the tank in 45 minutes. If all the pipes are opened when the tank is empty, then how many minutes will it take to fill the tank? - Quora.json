            "answer_text": "Given, Two inlet pipes with capacity to fill a tank in 18 minutes and 15 minutes; and 3rd pipe is an outlet pipe which can empty the tank in 45 minutes. Since, when all the pipes will be open at the same time, the time taken over all to fill the tank will be calculated as follows: [math](1/18)+(1/15)-(1/45)[/math] Here 1/18 is pipe 1\u2019s rate of filling the 1 unit of tank in 18 minutes, 1/15 is pipe 2\u2019s rate of filling the 1 unit of tank in 15 minutes, and 1/45 is pipe 3\u2019s rate of emptying the 1 unit of tank in 45 minutes The answer after calculation will be: 9/90 = 1/10 = 1 unit of tank/10 minutes So, it will take 10 minutes to fill a tank.

D 100 litres divide by 12.221 litres per minute = 8.18 minutes. E Empty Rate is 100 litres in 45 minutes = 2.222 litres per minute S = Summary 12.221 litres per minute filing rate - 2.222 emptying rate = 10 litres per minute = 10 minutes to fill the tank. Answer: It would take 10 minutes with all valves in the open position. ",
