            "answer_text": "The two equations kx+2y=5kx+2y=5and 3x+y=13x+y=1 represents two straight lines. For the equations to possess no solution, they must be parallel and not coincident. For this we must have: \u2223\u2223\u2223k321\u2223\u2223\u2223=0|k231|=0 \u27f9k\u22126=0\u27f9k\u22126=0 \u27f9k=6\u27f9k=6 Look at the graph. It will be clearer.  Here the blue line represents 3x+y=13x+y=1 and the red line 6x+2y=5.6x+2y=5. ",

            "answer_text": "Assume that these equations are in a simultaneous equation form. As x=(1-y)/3 and k=3(2x+1), after substituting the value of x into the second equation, it will become k=3[(2\u20132y)/3+1]=2\u20132y+3=5\u20132y in terms of y. In terms of x however it is equal to k=5\u20132y (since y=1\u20133x) k= 5\u20132(1\u20133x)= 5\u20132+6x=6x+3 ",
