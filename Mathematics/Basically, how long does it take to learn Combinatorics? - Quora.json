            "answer_text": "Combinatorics is a beast. Borrowing (and paraphrasing) from wikipedia : \u201cAspects of combinatorics include counting the structures of a given kind and size (enumerative combinatorics), deciding when certain criteria can be met \u2026, finding \"largest\", \"smallest\", or \"optimal\" objects (extremal combinatorics and combinatorial optimization), \u2026\u201d Given the generality of the notion of counting structures - combinatorics intersects with a huge number of other fields (algebra, geometry, \u2026). Many of those intersections lead to sub-fields of combinatorics each with their own techniques / machinery / tricks for counting. Without a focussed sub-area of combinatorics or an upper bound on how much of the field you want to cover - it would take a lifetime. Bounding the amount of material by selecting one standard text in the subject - could probably get through that within a year (a typical semester course will cover half a textbook). Stanley\u2019s, Enumerative Combinatorics I understand is a classic and I would love to dig into Tao/Vu Additive Combinatorics. ",
