            "answer_text": "The cardinality of a finite set it's just the number of elements of the set, but when we are dealing with an infinite set, the nocion of cardinality change to measure how big it is compare to another infinite set. Two set A and B have the same cardinality if and only if there exist a biyective function such that maps every element of A to every element of B. This can be applied to compare the cardinality of a infinte set with respect to the set of the natural number, so if we can maps every element of a set with every natural number is because they have the same cardinality, and therefore is said to be a countably infinite set, otherwise is said to be an uncountably infinite set. The elements of our set are: {1}, {1,2}, {1,2,3}, and so on, this means that we can map the element {1} to 1, the element {1,2} to 2, the element {1,2,3} to 3 and in general the element {1,2,3,\u2026,n} to [math]n[/math], so there exist a biyective function that maps every element of our set to the natural numbers, and therefore the cardinality of this set is countable infinity.

It\u2019s very beautiful in many ways.",
