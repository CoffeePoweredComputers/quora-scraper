            "answer_text": "SP of 9 oranges = CP of 12 oranges => SP of 12 oranges = 12 x 12/9 = CP of 16 oranges. So, Profit on 12 oranges = CP of 4 oranges. Profit \u2105 = (4/12)100 = 100/3 % Again, Profit on 12 oranges = CP of 4 oranges. => Profit on 5 oranges = CP of 5(4)/12 oranges => Profit on 5 oranges = CP of 5/3 oranges =>Discount on 10 oranges = CP of 5/3 oranges => Discount% = {(5/3)/10}100= 50/3 % Therefore percentage point difference between profit % and discount % = 100/3 % - 50/3 % = 50/3 % ",
