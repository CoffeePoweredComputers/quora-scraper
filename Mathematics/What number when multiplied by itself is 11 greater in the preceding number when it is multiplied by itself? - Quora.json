            "answer_text": "We have observed that difference between the squares of adjacent numbers is equal to the sum of those adjacent numbers. It is also equal to (2 \u00d7 smaller number) + 1. That is, 1^2 - 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 2\u00d70 + 1 2^2 - 1^2 = 2 +1= 2\u00d71 + 1 3^2 - 2^2 = 3 +2 = 2\u00d72 + 1 9^2 - 8^2 = 9 + 8 = 2\u00d78 + 1, etc. In the given problem question, let \u201cx\u201d & \u201c(x + 1) be the two adjacent numbers the difference between whose squares is 11. Then, as per the above observation, (x + 1)^2 - \u00d7^2 = (x + 1) + x = 2x + 1. As per the data in the question, 2x + 1 = 11. That is, 2x = 10. That is, x = 5, and (x + 1) = 6. Thus, the greater number = 6 is the ANS. (Note: 6^2 - 5^2 = 36 - 25 = 11 = 6 + 5 = 2\u00d75 + 1) ",
