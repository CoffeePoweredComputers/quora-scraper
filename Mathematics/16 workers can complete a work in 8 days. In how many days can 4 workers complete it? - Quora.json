            "answer_text": "While the previous answers are also correct they assume it is labor work. I\u2019d love to ask the question what kind of work are we talking about? For example take Software Engineering. It is (and by extension writing code) at its core is about problem solving. There is a funny thing about trying to solve problems: it does not scale linearly. Linear in this case means that for every extra worker thinking about the problem does not mean it will be solved that much faster. In fact there is a common saying \u201cThere are too many cooks in the kitchen\u201d which we say when there are a lot of people disagreeing on a solution to a problem. The more engineers you assign to solve the same problem the more diminishing the effect is. For example if you have 2 engineers and you add two more you get more value out of the combined effort of your workers than say you had 6 of them and you add 6 more for a total of 12. What do you do with big problems then? How do we solve those? Much like when you build a house you have to break the problem down and let those problems be solved one after another or at the same time if it is possible. You can\u2019t put the windows in while you are still building the walls but is completely possible to paint the inside and outside at the same time. Fun fact you can apply this to your own things at home too - your life is a big project after all. If you know how to break your problems down to parts you can manage then you\u2019ll have a much easier time with practically anything you need to solve. ",
