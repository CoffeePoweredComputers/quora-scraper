            "answer_text": "Let length of the train be (x) m When the train passes the platform Distance covered would be length of the platform + length of the train. D = 200 + x T = 10 se. S = d/t =200 + x / 10 Hence the first eq. Is formed. Similarly, when the train passes the telephone post. The total distance covered would be equal to the length of the train. Here we neglect the width of the post because it is too small and has a neglegible effect on the value. D = x T = 5 sec S= x/5 \u2026.. eq. 2 Equating eq. 1 and 2 we get, 200 + x = 2x X = 200m Putting the value of x in eq. 2 will give us the speed of the train. Therefore, Speed of the train = 40 m/s Hope found me helpful. ",
