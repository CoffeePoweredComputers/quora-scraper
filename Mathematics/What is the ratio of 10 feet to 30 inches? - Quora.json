            "answer_text": "First, you need the units to be the same for both values; \u2018feet\u2019 or \u2018inches\u2019, it doesn\u2019t matter. For example, there are 12 inches in 1 foot. So restate the problem: 10 feet/30 inches is the same as (10 feet x 12 inches/foot) / 30 inches, which simplifies to (120 inches / 30 inches), or (4 inches/ 1 inch) Therefore, the ratio is 4:1 (Note that it works the other way, too: 30 inches x (1 foot / 12 inches) = 2.5 feet So the ratio (10 feet : 2.5 feet) still simplifies to 4:1 ",
