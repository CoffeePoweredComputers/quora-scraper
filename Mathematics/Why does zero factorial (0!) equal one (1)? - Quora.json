            "answer_text": "I don't know. It is probably so because a lot of people don't like sauce and still seem to have lunch. There are restaurants where you combine your meal. You choose one item per category. The items are not obligatory. \u2018No sauce\u2019 is also a valid choice. In case of 0!=0 the combinations of different choices would be zero. Nobody could eat at that restaurant. That is clearly not happening. Then again I can clearly see that not choosing sauce is also a valid choice. It might be implicit (i.e. not listed on the menu) but it is an accepted choice nevertheless. So not choosing is really also choosing and therefore can't be zero (Does this mean that atheism is a religion?). What if I choose everything else and right before choosing between different sauces I will lose my ability to communicate and get kicked out of the restaurant for being rude? Then there is no food for me. The fact of getting kicked out should mean that 0! is 0 (because I am hungry)? Of course there is food for other people who can communicate. For them there is no 0! (even if they choose not to eat; someone has made a non-choice and that is also a choice). So within the system called \u2018the restaurant\u2019 choices and non-choices (that are also choices) are happening. And I suppose 0! can only be viewed within a system. But how exactly can 0! exist within a system? What is it? Whatever. This problem is too difficult for a simple mortal. Edit: After reading some opinions I see that there are three schools of thought. School 1. 0!=1 School 2. 0!=0 School 3. No idea. It is good to think that 0!=1 Edit: If non-choices are also choices then why does 1!=1 exist? Doesn't every choice come with a non-choice? 1!=1 seems to be true. I have one way of putting an apple to a group. However, there is also a non-apple that is being ignored, i.e 2!=2. The groups are: 1. apple and non-apple; 2. non-apple and apple. I guess in case of dying (of natural causes) 1!=1. Death does not come with non-death. Unless time is not important. But even then only one group (non-death and death) would be correct. Surely group 2 (death and non-death) is wrong? Unless we somehow remain alive after death because death cannot exist without non-death? In that case death would be 2!=2 just like an apple that comes with a non-apple. So why does 1!=1 even exist? Because choosing is sometimes compulsory and not choosing is not allowed? This should surely mean that 1!=1 is evil, totalitarian and the opposite of free will? What is the minimum requirement for free will? 2!=2? Of course in case of a break of 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000\u2026.1 seconds what is eating a non-apple and an apple? Clearly it completely looks like eating an apple? Therefore there is really free will in 1!=1? Or no? Edit: It is not possible to move something that doesn't exist to a group. Not moving it to a group is possible (actually automatic; we do not move things that do not exist). Not moving is also moving. Therefore 0!=1 This sort of makes sense. ",

            "answer_text": "To paraphrase the usual answer, there is only one way to do nothing. But if [math]0![/math]  was assumed to be [math]0[/math] in our mathematical system and someone asked why, an equally smart and witty answer would have been, because there isn't a way to do nothing.  How many ways there are to arrange n is a useful way of thinking of n factorial. Useful. [math]_n\\mathrm{P}_n[/math]  happens to be  [math]n![/math] . [math]n![/math]  is not defined as  [math]_n\\mathrm{P}_n[/math].  So, lets ask again, why is [math]0![/math]  equal to [math] 1[/math] ?  It is an Assumption. It is an Assumption in the definition of factorial. [math] 1! = 1*0![/math] We assume/define [math] 0! [/math] to be [math]1[/math] . So that [math] 1! = 1  [/math]  The definition of Factorial function:    .[math]0! = 1[/math]We do not write: [math] 0! = 0*(-1)![/math] [math] (-1)![/math]  is undefined because, as seen above, it is not defined:   The reason for this assumption is simply convenience.  If  we did not assume [math]0![/math]to be [math]1[/math], kept it undefined, only defined [math]1!=1[/math], and stopped there, instead of zeroand derived other factorials from [math]1![/math],  Then, many formulae will need rework, with emphasis on special cases when [math]n=0[/math]. Example: Permutation , Combination  , Exponential function , q-analog etc. Quoting the rationale for Empty product from Wikipedia In other words, a \"product\"  with only one factor evaluates to that factor, while a \"product\"  with no factors at all evaluates to 1. Allowing a \"product\" with only one or zero factors reduces the number of cases to be considered in many mathematical formulas. Such \"products\" are natural starting points ininduction proofs, as well as in algorithms. For these reasons, the \"empty product is one convention\" is common practice in mathematics and computer programming.  Relevance of defining empty products The notion of an empty product is useful for the same reason that the number zero and the empty set are useful: while they seem to represent quite uninteresting notions, their existence allows for a much shorter mathematical presentation of many subjects. For example, the empty products 0! = 1 and x0 = 1 shorten Taylor series notation (see zero to the power of zero for a discussion whenx=0). Likewise, if M is an n \u00d7 n matrix then M0 is the n \u00d7 n identity matrix. As another example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes. However, if we do not allow products with only 0 or 1 factors, then the theorem (and its proof!) become longer.[4][5] More examples of the use of the empty product in mathematics may be found in the binomial theorem (which assumes and implies thatx0=1 for all x), Stirling number, K\u00f6nig's theorem, binomial type, binomial series, difference operator and Pochhammer symbol. Please notice the use of the word useful. It is apt.  We have assumed that which makes our mathematics easier while keeping it consistent. This is a not a practice unique to factorial function.

            "answer_text": "I think that the explanation :  there is exactly one way to do nothing is quite misleading. One can use the same argument to show [math]n \\choose k[/math] when k<0 or k>n to be 1.  0! = 1 is a definition or rather due to the axioms of Set Theory. Here is a set theoretic interpretation for 0! = 1:  [math]n \\choose k[/math] denotes the number of subsets of cardinality k of a set A, where |A| = n. By the axioms of Set theory, [math]\\phi[/math] is a subset of every set and |[math]\\phi[/math]| = 0. Let me mention this axiom specially that  [math]\\phi[/math] is unique i.e., there is only ONE empty set in the entire universe. Let's talk about [math]n \\choose 0[/math] which is the number of subsets of cardinality 0 of A. Clearly the answer is 1 (for the subset [math]\\phi[/math]). So, [math]n \\choose 0[/math] = 1. This implies [math]\\frac{n!}{(n-0)! 0!}[/math] = 1Which implies 1/0! = 1 and hence 0! = 1. I found the statement - there is exactly one way to do nothing misleading. Here is a simple reason why :Suppose I am given a task to do. By doing nothing, I postulate not doing the task assigned. Now, I can do NOTHING by doing a hell lot of other (1 or more than 1) tasks. The postulate mentioned above is introduced only to prove my point. In nature, one can NEVER do NOTHING at all. Even if I sit Idle,my body and brain are still WORKING (kind of METAPHYSICAL but Maths must agree with the laws of nature. :P). ",

            "answer_text": "Actually my answer here is to contradict it. The problem here is that, the factorial of every other positive integer is unique except 0 and 1, both having factorial equal to 1. Consider that there is a heap of infinite apples and a container with infinite slots beside it. *Also, all the apples and slots are unique*. What I have to do now is to take (n) apples form the heap and arrange it in (n) number of slots. For calculating (1!) I would take 1 apple from the heap and would keep it in one slot, since that's the only way I could have done it, (1!) is 1. For (2!), I would take 2 apples and would arrange them in 2 slots, I have 4 ways of doing it, and hence, (2!) is 4. Similarly, for (3!), I would take 3 apples and would arrange them in 3 slots, in this case, I have 6 ways of doing it, therefore, (3!) is 6. In each and every case there is a method that is followed, i.e, there is input (taking the apples), then there is processing (arranging the apples) and then comes the output (number of ways). It acts like a function. But when we calculate (0!), we are supposed to take 0 apples from the heap,i.e, perform no action, and therefore there is no input, because of this, there would be no processing and as a result no output. We are getting (1!) as 1 because we are taking an apple and placing it into the slot in 1 way. There would be no way of placing the apple if we don't take it from the heap in the first place. (0!) is not also 0 ,because, again, any numerical value as an output would indicate that some input must be there for the output to come. Hence, (0!) seems more likely to be \u201cNot Defined\u201d instead of 1. So, that's my theory, and it seems to hold good for me. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a really interesting question. Back in my 10+2, most of the introductory books said that [math]0! = 1[/math] is by convention. But this \"by convention\" never ends the curiosity of anyone. While in my grads, I decided to give another try to find the answer. And then I came across a super amazing way of proving that [math]0! = 1[/math]. Here it goes.. Before we proceed I think its good idea to define Factorial first, here is what Wikipedia says:It is a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integer less than or equal to n.[math]n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)*...3*2*1[/math] However the recursive definition of factorial is of more use in this proof.[math]n! =\\begin{cases}1 & n = 1\\\\n*(n-1)! & n \\geq 0\\end{cases}[/math] Recursive definition of Factorial leads to one interesting way of expressing factorial numbers. [math]n! = \\dfrac{(n+1)!}{(n+1)}[/math] This is valid since, as we expand [math](n+1)![/math] from recursive definition, we can cancel [math](n+1)[/math] term from both numerator and denominator to get [math]n![/math]. Or we can even calculate factorial in numerator and then evaluate the division For example,[math]5! = \\dfrac{6!}{6} = \\dfrac{720}{6}[/math] [math]4! = \\dfrac{5!}{5} = \\dfrac{120}{5}[/math] [math]3! = \\dfrac{4!}{4} = \\dfrac{24}{4}[/math] [math]2! = \\dfrac{3!}{3} = \\dfrac{6}{3}[/math] [math]1! = \\dfrac{2!}{2} = \\dfrac{2}{2}[/math] In a similar way, if we try to express [math]0![/math] we get[math]0! = \\dfrac{1!}{1} = 1[/math] And this ends our proof that [math]0!=1[/math].This proof is one of many ways, where [math]0![/math] leads to [math]1[/math]. But this one is quite explanatory in itself. There is one more interesting question I would like to share which was in my mind back in those days. WHY DO WE NEED [math]0![/math]?And the answer is computation of number of Combination.[math]{n \\choose k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}[/math] when [math]k = n[/math][math]{n \\choose n} = \\dfrac{n!}{n!*0!}[/math] This is one of many application of [math]0![/math]. But this example give a really good idea where we can make use of [math]0! = 1[/math]. HTHCheers ",

            "answer_text": "Physically if you take 2 items, like A and B, you can arrange them as AB or BA. So, there is just 2 ways or equal to 2!. But there is another way in which you can't arrange them, that might seem like another case. Of course you can either arrange them or not arrange them. If not, ok, back off dude. If then, how many ways for 2 items? 2 ways as if 2! For 3 items, it's 6 ways or 3!=3*2*1=6 ways. And a way in which you can't arrange the items. That's a case too of negation. If we talk about possibilities, here n! instead of n*(n-1)! ,, It goes to n*(n-1)! + 1(that which you can't arrange). If we put 0 in place of n, we get 0*(0\u20131)!+1 or 0 times (-1)! +1 If I omit the negative sign(just in case), then we get 0 times 1 +1 or 0+1 or 1. That's one event and the one in which we can't arrange the given items. But we don't have items as here n is 0. 0 number of items. Similarly if you take a 0 balls, you can't arrange them at all. You don't have any. But that's one event left out where you actually wont be arrange the balls, given you have them or not. If we theoretically see and assume, Let X is no of events we can arrange some items(say n=4). Thus X=4! Or 24. Let Y be the no of events in which we can't arrange the items. Thus for every value of n, Y is 1. Even for n=4(there is one way or just only a way you cant arrange the 4 items). So for n to be a positive number, the usual n! comes to play. For n=4, n! is 24. For n to be a non positive number like 0(which is not positive nor negative), the Y part comes here to play. This seems like 0! has only a single value of only Y(no X). Thus 0! = 1. (This is just my theoritial view, dont blindly believe it, work out your own view too). ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m surprised that with so many responses no one has mentioned this but I\u2019m pleased if I have something to add to the other fine answers. To understand the meaning of [math]n![/math] and ultimately of [math]0![/math] we should begin by refreshing our memory about what functions are. A function is a relationship between two sets with the special property that every element of the first set is associated with exactly one element of the second set. Example: Given two sets [math]A = \\{\u278a,\u278b,\u278c\\}[/math] and [math]B = \\{\u2665, \u25b2, \u2605\\}[/math] the set of ordered pairs [math]f = \\{(\u278a,\u2665), (\u278b,\u2605), (\u278c, \u2665)\\}[/math] is a function because every element of [math]A[/math] is being associated with exactly one element of [math]B[/math]. Notice that there was no element from [math]A[/math] associated with the [math]\u25b2[/math]element in [math]B[/math]. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. In fact, the function [math]g = \\{(\u278a,\u2665), (\u278b,\u2665), (\u278c, \u2665)\\}[/math] which associates every element in [math]A[/math] with the [math]\u2665[/math] in [math]B[/math] is a function as well. In the special case where no two different elements of [math]A[/math] are associated with the same element of [math]B[/math] and no element of [math]B[/math] gets left out, we say the function is a bijection. A bijection is a function from [math]A[/math] to [math]B[/math] with the special property that every element of [math]B[/math] is paired uniquely with an element of [math]A[/math]. (In high school math these functions are usually called a one-to-one correspondence). Example: Given two sets [math]A = \\{\u278a,\u278b,\u278c\\}[/math] and [math]B = \\{\u2665, \u25b2, \u2605\\}[/math] the set of ordered pairs [math]h = \\{(\u278a,\u25b2), (\u278b,\u2665), (\u278c, \u2605)\\}[/math] is a bijection because [math]h[/math] is a function from [math]A[/math] to [math]B[/math] in which every element in [math]B[/math] is being paired uniquely with an element from [math]A[/math]. Until now each of our examples has involved two different sets but there is no reason a function cannot associate elements from itself to elements of itself. And, indeed, a most interesting instance of this is when a function from a set to itself is bijective. Example: Let [math]A = \\{\u278a,\u278b,\u278c\\}[/math]. Then the set of ordered pairs [math]f = \\{(\u278a,\u278c), (\u278b,\u278a), (\u278c, \u278b)\\}[/math] is a bijection from [math]A[/math] to itself. The bijection in the previous example is obviously not the only possibility so it would be natural to ask, \u201chow many bijections are there from [math]A[/math] to itself?\u201d. The answer to this question is six. Here they are: [math]\\{(\u278a,\u278a), (\u278b,\u278b), (\u278c, \u278c)\\}[/math][math]\\{(\u278a,\u278a), (\u278b,\u278c), (\u278c, \u278b)\\}[/math][math]\\{(\u278a,\u278b), (\u278b,\u278a), (\u278c, \u278c)\\}[/math][math]\\{(\u278a,\u278b), (\u278b,\u278c), (\u278c, \u278a)\\}[/math][math]\\{(\u278a,\u278c), (\u278b,\u278a), (\u278c, \u278b)\\}[/math][math]\\{(\u278a,\u278c), (\u278b,\u278b), (\u278c, \u278a)\\}[/math]To see that there must be six bijections from [math]A[/math] to [math]A[/math] we can reason as follows: [math]A[/math] is a three element set so when constructing a bijective function from [math]A[/math] to itself we have [math]3[/math] possible elements with which the element [math]\u278a[/math] can be associated. Having chosen an element to associate with [math]\u278a[/math] we now have [math]2[/math] possible elements with which the element [math]\u278b[/math] can be associated. Finally, this leaves us with one remaining element with which [math]\u278c[/math] can be associated. So by the counting principle there are [math]3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1[/math] ways we can construct a bijection from [math]A[/math] to itself. You may recognize this as [math]3![/math] (read \u201c[math]3[/math] factorial\u201d) and we can conclude there are [math]3! = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6[/math] different bijective functions from a [math]3[/math] element set to itself. We have now arrived at a centrally important insight: There are [math]n![/math] bijections from a set with [math]n[/math] elements to itself.Which is to say, given a finite set with [math]n[/math] elements there are [math]n![/math] different ways to bijectively associate the elements of that set with themselves. Example: There are [math]10! = 3628800[/math] distinct bijections between a [math]10[/math] element set and itself. (Don\u2019t ask me to write them all out!) Example: There are [math]5! = 120[/math] different ways that the vertices of a pentagon can be mapped to themselves so that no two are mapped to the same vertex. Example: There are [math]2![/math] different ways to bijectively map the set [math]\\{boy, girl\\}[/math] to itself. These [math]2! = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2[/math] ways are the two sets of ordered pairs [math]\\{(boy, girl), (girl, boy)\\}[/math] and [math]\\{(boy, boy), (girl, girl)\\}[/math]. Example: There is [math]1! = 1[/math] way to map a set with one element to itself. (This does not surprise you I hope!) And now at last we are ready to address the question that inspired this answer. Namely, \u201cWhy does [math]0! = 1[/math]?\u201d To see why this must be so we can apply the central insight from earlier to the special case when [math]n = 0[/math] and obtain: There are [math]0![/math] bijections from a set with [math]0[/math] elements to itself.Now there is only one set with zero elements and that is the empty set. So the claim becomes: There are [math]0![/math] bijections from the empty set to itself.But a bijection is a function and a function is a relation which associates every element of one set to exactly one element of another. That is why we can represent bijections and other functions as sets of ordered pairs. So just how many sets of ordered pairs can be made by taking every element in the empty set and associating it with an element in the empty set? Since there are no elements to work with there is exactly one way this can be done. It is the unique function represented by the set of ordered pairs that contains no ordered pairs at all. That is to say, there is one bijection from the empty set to itself and that is the empty function. Thus, [math]3! = 6[/math] because there are six distinct sets of ordered pairs representing the six bijections from a three element set to itself. And similarly, [math]0! = 1[/math] because there is one set which contains all the ordered pairs from the set with no elements to itself. Namely, the empty set. ",

            "answer_text": "You have [math]n[/math] slices of pizza, each of a different kind. In how many different orders can you eat them (one at a time)? You can eat any of the [math]n[/math] slices first \u2014 that\u2019s [math]n[/math] ways of eating the first slice. Then you can eat any of the remaining [math]n - 1[/math] slices \u2014 that\u2019s [math]n - 1[/math] ways of eating the second slice. So, together, that\u2019s [math]n(n - 1)[/math] ways of eating the first two slices. Once you have eaten the first [math]n - 1[/math] slices, you have to eat the one remaining slice \u2014 that\u2019s one way of eating the last slice. And together, that\u2019s [math]n(n - 1) \\cdots 1 = n![/math] ways of eating the first [math]n[/math] slices. And now you have zero slices remaining. If you have [math]k[/math] ways of eating zero slices, your total number of ways of eating [math]n[/math] slices would be [math]n! \\times k[/math]. Now, if you say that there are zero ways of eating zero slices (i.e, zero ways of doing nothing), then you have to conclude that there are [math]n! \\times 0 = 0[/math] ways of eating [math]n[/math] different slices of pizza. You have effectively destroyed the [math]n![/math] ways in which you ate all those slices (why would anyone do that?!). No, [math]k[/math] must be equal to [math]1[/math], so that you get [math]n! \\times k = n![/math] (even though you may wish to increase the number of ways in which you enjoyed that pizza by declaring [math]k[/math] to be larger than [math]1[/math], we must not give in to wishful thinking). Maybe that is not very convincing. Okay, if you have [math]m[/math] different objects of one kind and [math]n[/math] different objects of another kind (say, [math]m[/math] different flavours of ice cream, and [math]n[/math] different slices of pizza), in how many ways can you arrange the [math]m[/math] objects among themselves, and the [math]n[/math] objects among themselves (eat the different slices of pizza one after another, and then eat the different ice creams one after the other)? Surely, it\u2019s [math]m! \\times n![/math]. But if you didn\u2019t have any ice cream, does it mean that you couldn\u2019t eat pizza either? Of course not, you can still eat pizza in [math]n![/math] ways. So it must be that [math]0! \\times n! = n![/math]. So [math]0! = 1[/math].  Of course, [math]0! = 1[/math] by definition. You can define it to be [math]e^\\pi[/math] if you wanted, but that would make zero sense. And then you would have to define exceptions for almost all formulas involving [math]n![/math], as other answers have shown. All I have done in this answer is argue why the present definition is the only sensible one. ",

            "answer_text": "To put a finer point on it, [math]0![/math] is the product of an empty set of numbers, and so [math]0!=1[/math] because the so-called empty product must be the multiplicative identity (i.e., \u201cone\u201d) just like an empty sum must be the additive identity (i.e., \u201czero\u201d): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_product It follows from the real numbers with multiplication being nearly a so-called group (in the sense of algebra): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(algebra) You are probably more familiar with the true group formed from the real numbers with addition. In that case, the \"empty sum\" is vacuously zero. That is, the sum of an empty list of numbers is zero. The number \"zero\" is algebraically special because it is the additive identity:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_identityThat is, the number \"zero\" is a number which can be added to any other number to result in the same number. In an algebraic group, the associated operation on the empty list is the identity. So the sum of an empty list is zero, which seems intuitive.Likewise, the number \"one\" is the multiplicative identity:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics)#Identity_elementWhen it is multiplied by any other number, the result is the same number. Consequently, for the same reason that the sum of an empty list of numbers is zero, the product of an empty list of numbers is one.Another way to see this is to consider the sum and product of a list of only one number. The sum of the list is just the number, and the product of the list is just the number. However, both addition and multiplication take two numbers as arguments. So the list always includes a hidden \u201cidentity element\u201d to make sense of a sum or product of a single number. In the sum case, the single number is added to 0 so that the sum of the list is just the single number. And so every list contains a \"virtual\" zero (for purposes of addition) even when the list is empty. Similarly, in the product case, the single number is multiplied by 1 so that the product of the list is just the single number. So every list contains a \"virtual\" one (for purposes of multiplication) even when the list is empty. What is important is that an identity element remains for each operation considered. Essentially, multiplication fills in a 1 whenever you ask for multiplication but you don't provide both arguments to multiply. ",

Hence, we have concluded that, (n-1)! = n! / n Now putting n = 1 in the above derived equation, (1 - 1)! = 1! / 1 0! = 1/1 0! = 1 There you go! Hence, zero factorial is equal to one. Hope it helps! EDIT:- A very simple approach to this question will be to find out number of ways in which we can arrange the objects. Number of ways to arrange 3 objects:- Here these 3 objects are the letters A, B and C. Now these three letters can be arranged as A B C A C B B A C B C A C A B C B A So, there are 6 ways to arrange 3 objects. Also, 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 Hence, a factorial is nothing but number of ways in which we can arrange the objects.  Similarly, number of ways in which we can arrange two objects are:- Let say two letters A and B. A B B A Hence, there are two ways to arrange two objects. Also, 2! = 2 x 1 = 2  Now, number of ways to arrange one object will obviously be 1. Because, there is only one objects, you can't swap it with another object to change the arrangement. Here we come to our question! How is 0! = 1 Now when we have zero objects, things get a little philosophical. How many ways are there to arrange zero objects? There's only one way to do it. How? Assume you have an empty space. No objects this time! How many ways are there to arrange those zero objects? Obviously, you can't swap or change anything. Hence, there's only 1 way to arrange that empty space and that is that empty space. So, the pattern still holds. Hence, 0! = 1 I have given the simplest mathematical proof earlier. This is kind of a philosophical proof. But it is right in all manners. Credit goes to :- Do watch this video. He has explained this question in a very simplistic manner.  ",

Finally the product of all those is what [math]n!/(n-k)![/math] is. Now, if we solve the problem of permuting \u2019n\u2019 things in \u2019n\u2019 different places From principle of counting, the answer comes out to be [math]n![/math] and for the above formula to become valid [math]n!/(n-n)! = n! <=> n!/0! = n![/math] making it necessary for 0! to be equal to 1. In Combinatorics, there was never a problem of choosing 0 things out of n different things(as it doesn\u2019t make any sense) but the formulation of \u201cn choose k\u201d was used in Algebra, for example in Binomial theorem.

There are: 4 ways to choose the first book and put it up.3 ways to choose the second book2 ways to choose the third book, and1 way to put the last book on the shelf.This product, 4*3*2*1 has a designation \u2014 4! In this structure, n! May be defined as the number of ways to arrange n objects in a row. So, for 0! We ask, in how many ways can you arrange 0 books on a shelf? The answer is surprisingly obvious. Just one. Don\u2019t put any books on the shelf! Now we could demonstrate this in other ways, more symbolic mathematically. But this is  Continue Reading",

            "answer_text": "You are correct that 0! = 1 for reasons that are similar to whyx^0 = 1. Both are defined that way. But there are reasons for these definitions; they are not arbitrary. You cannot reason that x^0 = 1 by thinking of the meaning of powers as \"repeated multiplications\" because you cannot multiply x zero times.  Similarly, you cannot reason out 0! just in terms of the meaning of factorial because you cannot multiply all the numbers from zero down to 1 to get 1. Mathematicians *define* x^0 = 1 in order to make the laws of exponents work even when the exponents can no longer be thought of as rep Continue Reading",

            "answer_text": "The main reason why [math]0![/math] is defined to be equal to [math]1[/math] is because the empty product is defined to be [math]1[/math]... and [math]0![/math] is precisely equal to the empty product. What I mean by an empty product is the following. Suppose I want to find the product of the [math]n[/math] terms [math]a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n[/math], i.e I want to find [math]a_1a_2\\ldots a_n[/math]. The empty product is this product when [math]n=0[/math]. Clearly the product of the first [math]k[/math] terms is the product of the [math]k^\\textrm{th}[/math] term [math]a_k[/math] and the product of the first [math](k-1)[/math] terms. Also, the product of the first one term is simply [math]a_1[/math]. But, using the definition in the first sentence of this paragraph, t Continue Reading",

            "answer_text": "The logical explanation of factorial of a number can be given as the total number of arrangements or permutations that can be done with same number of non identical objects. So if you don't have any objects at all, the number of arrangements that can be made with them is one and only one, which is arranging nothing at all. The mathematical definition of factorial of an integer is given as, n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1, where n is a non negative integer. By that definition, (n-1)! would be (n-1)! = (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1 and this can be obtained by replacing n with (n-1) in  Continue Reading",
