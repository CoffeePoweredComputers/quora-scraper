            "answer_text": "There are a couple of ways to write probabilities. Frequently it\u2019s a number ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 = can\u2019t happen and 1 = certain to occur. Using this range is convenient for calculations. You can also write probabilities as percentages. 0% = can\u2019t happen, 100% = certain to happen. These are harder to work with, but are more intuitive for most people. So a probability of 0.5 (expected to occur half of the time) is the same thing as 50% probability, as you would expect. ",

            "answer_text": "The math guys will probably say the chances are 1 or 100%.I believe that no one can see into the future, even if you are very sure that you can. You might say that an event is 99.999999999999999...However, I think that you can never say 100% that anything in the future is certain. But, for most practical reasons people do use 100%.. ",
