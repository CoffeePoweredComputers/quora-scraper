Let the number be 10 Number 10 on multiplication by 10 = 10 \u00d7 10 = 100 Number 10 is mistakenly divided by 10 instead of multiplication. On division the value will be 10 / 10 = 1 Error = 100 - 1 = 99 The value in place of 100, the error is 99, hence in percentage it will be 99% Error in result = 99 % Answer the error in result will be 99 % ",

If the initial number is x and if it gets divided by 10, instead of getting multiplied by 10, what is supposed to be 10*x becomes x/10. When x*10 becomes x/10, 100 becomes 1 ((100/(x*10))*(x/10) = 1). When 100 becomes 1, this is straightaway an error of 99%. ",
