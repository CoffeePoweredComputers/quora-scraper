The first twelve go to 996 putting the 4th term in the 2nd half of the cycle up to bat for the 1000th term. 1 1 2 3 5 8 4 3 7 1 8 9 (F1 - F12)8 8 7 6! <- (F13 - F16 and bingo) the 1000th Fib term has a cross value of 6. Does the Gigantic number matter ? OR does the core truth matter ? I\u2019ll leave it up to you. Thanks for A2A, Peace, DjL. ",
