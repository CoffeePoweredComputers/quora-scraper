            "answer_text": "First, if foci are (-8,0) and (8,0), then we know that the center is (0,0) and that the ellipse is horizontal (major axis is along the x-axis). It\u2019s equation, then will be of the form: [math]\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1[/math] and we know that [math]a^2-b^2=c^2[/math] where c=8 (distance from center to a focus). We also know that for a point on the ellipse, the distance between it and (8,0) added to the distance between it and (-8,0) is 20. One such point on the ellipse is a vertex, which lies on the x-axis and whose distance from the center is a, is (a,0). Using the distance formula [math]\\sqrt{(a-8)^2+(0\u20130)^2}+\\sqrt{(a+8)^2+(0\u20130)^2}=20[/math]. This simplifies to [math]a-8+a+8=20[/math], and so a=10. Using [math]a^2-b^2=c^2[/math], we have [math]10^2-b^2=8^2[/math], and so b=6. Thus, the equation of this ellipse is [math]\\frac{x^2}{100}+\\frac{y^2}{36}=1[/math] ",
