PROVING THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE, that \u2018a+0\u2019 is NOT equal to \u2018a\u2019 (using high school maths): Find a mistake in the following methodology (if there is one) ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| I am going to start by assuming that the statement a+0=a is false and by a series of operations, reach a contradiction that will justify this. ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| THE METHOD If a+0 = a(Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side) Multiplying both sides by a gives us (a+O)a = a^2Note: a^2 means \u2018a squared\u2019 ie a\u00d7a Subtract (a+0)^2 from both sides(a+O)a - (a+0)^2 = a^2 - (a+0)^2 Factorise both, the left hand side (LHS) and the right hand side (RHS) of the equationOn the LHS, (a+O) is a common factor in both terms. So we can write that outside the main brackets as: (a+0) (a- (a+0) ) On the RHS, is a difference of two squares. Factorising this will give: ( a+ (a+0) )( a- (a+0) ) Now the equation is as shown below(a+0)(a- (a+0))=(a+ (a+0))(a- (a+0)) Divide/cancel both, LHS and RHS of the above equation by ( a- (a+0) ) since this is common.This leaves us with: a+0 = a+ (a+0) Simplifying the RHS onlya+0 = 2a (CONTRADICTION) Therefore \u2018a+0\u2019 (LHS) is NOT equal to \u2018a\u2019 (RHS) PROVED (See if you can find a mistake in the shown proof and Comment on the above only) Serious mathematicians need not read further ======================= **************************** ADDENDUM : The following is just for EXTRA mental stimulation. Furthermore, by subtracting \u2018a\u2019 from both side, we are left with 0=a OR a=0 It is standard procedure, taught in high school maths class, to check whether you have the correct answer or not by substituting the solution found into the original equation. So let's do that with a=O The assumption made at the BEGINNING OF THE METHOD was: Let a+0= a Substituting a=O into the above equation, we get 0+0 = 0, which is correct Therefore we have made no mistakes in our method OR Have we ?

            "answer_text": "We can prove that a + 0 = a because when you add 0 to any number then we do not move left or right on the number line and stays there only this is because 0 does not have any value . 0 means that you are adding nothing . And our value remains the same. Here \u2018a\u2019 has infinite solutions. The above statement is mentioned as an axiom ( I think ) . The abovementioned statement is considered as the basic or foundational one. So it does not need proof. But still : Let a be a real number . Add 0 ( Zero not O , the alphabet. I am not lazy . I always type 0 and never O . I respect 0 . If it was not there then what would my cousin get on his tests. ) Then find out the result which is always unchanged , equal to the value of our real number. Hence , proved . If we consider it as a linear equation then I think it is the only linear equation with infinite solutions . However , we don't consider it. Sorry for my limited knowledge as I am in 10th and anything above there can be wrong just like my cousin's answer sheets. ",
