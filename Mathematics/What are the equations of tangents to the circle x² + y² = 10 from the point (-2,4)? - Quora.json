            "answer_text": "Equation of the circle is x^2+ y^2 = 10. or,(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2=(\u221a10)^2.,thus the centre of the circle is (0,0) and radius=\u221a10.units. Let the equation of the tangent which passes through (-2,4) is:- y- 4 = m.(x+2). or, y-mx -(2m+4)= 0\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(1) But , perpendicular distance from (0,0) to (1) = +/-(r). {0 - 0 -(2m+4)}/\u221a(1+m^2) = +/-\u221a(10). or, -(2m+4) =+/-\u221a{10.(1+m^2)}. , Squaring both sides. or, 4m^2+16.m +16 = 10+10.m^2. or, 6m^2-16m-6 =0. or, 3m^2 -8m -3 = 0. or, (3m+1).(m-3) =0 or, m = -1/3 , 3. , putting m= -1/3 in eqn.(1). y +1/3.x -(-2/3+4)= 0. or, 3.y + x -10 = 0. , and now putting m = 3. in eqn. (1) y - 3x -10 = 0. Thus , the equations of two tangents are 3y+x-10=0 and y-3x-10=0. Answer. ",

            "answer_text": "What are the equations of tangents to the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 10 from the point (-2,4)? Solution: There can be only one tangent at any point on the circle. The centre of the circle is O (0,0). Point A (-2,4) lies on the circumference of the circle. The equation of the line OA is (x-0)/(-2\u20130) = (y-0)/(4\u20130), or -x/2 = y/4, or 2y = -4x, or y = -2x. The tangent to the circle at A will be perpendicular to OA. So its slope will be (1/2). So the equation of the tangent: y = (1/2)x + c, or 4 = (1/2)*(-2) + c, or c = 4+1 = 5 So the equation of the tangent is y = (x/2) + 5, or 2y = x+10. Answer. ",
