            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat constitutes a \"centrist libertarian\"?\u201d The libertarian stance is and always has been centrist in the US. The term is both repetitive and redundant. For that matter it also repeats itself. The US Constitution is the great libertarian document of the US. It defines and has always defined our centrist stance. As it say in the word \u201clibertarian\u201d our center is liberty. As libertarians we are equally distant from both left and right. Now for some fun that deals with the claims of the large parties. The Democrats push farther and farther left. They claim at as they move the center moves with them. That\u2019s a demographics claim not a political stance claim. If you think they are allowed to move the central principles of the US republic just by moving left then you and I are going to disagree on virtually every political topic and as a result you won\u2019t be receptive to answers by practicing libertarians. The same applies to the Republicans and the right. Notice that Europeans tend to be well to the left of Americans even with the decades long push left by the Democrats. Your center isn\u2019t our center. Our center is the Constitution and that is the defining document of the American libertarian stance. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there is such a beast. Right-Libertarians pretty much break down into anarcho-capitalists (elimination of the state) and minarchists (the \u201cnight watchman\u201d state). They believe in capitalism and the private ownership of the means of production. Left-Libertarians are somewhat more varied, but would abolish capitalism in favor of some form of common ownership of the means of production or of everything. Unlike socialists, they do not favor a central governmental management of the economy, but instead posit cooperative arrangements. Libertarianism arose in the left. There is little difference between Right-Libertariaans and Conservatives as far as the economy goes, but many conservatives are classed as \u201csocial conservatives\u201d in that they believe the government can and should favor existing social norms even when this intrudes on personal autonomy. The term is unfortunate, because it has nothing to do with the difference between liberals and social-liberals. In America, the term seems to mean that you are a minarchist who is open to compromise. But that is hardly \u201ccentrist.\u201d ",
