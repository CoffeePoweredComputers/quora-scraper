            "answer_text": "That would mean that they had developed time travel because, in your scenario, the universe was created first, then the aliens - but the aliens are the god that created the universe. (BTW, \u201cthat first God\u201d is grammatically incorrect, it\u2019s \u201cthat first god\u201d. You don\u2019t capitalize the G in god unless it starts a sentence or you\u2019re talking about the god named God - the English name of the Christian god.) Is it possible that they went back in time to create the universe they went back in time from? Sure, but that\u2019s a paradox, and you\u2019d have to solve it first (show, logically, how something impossible can happen - going back in time and killing your father\u2019s father before your father was conceived is another one - you have no father, so you can\u2019t exist - so you can\u2019t kill anyone, so \u2026 on and on and \u2026) But there have been science fiction stories (most of them not very good) about things like that.

            "answer_text": "Yes, I believe consciousness evolves all over the universe - and its purpose is to evolve back to the one consciousness of God. So when a particular race of consciousness reaches a certain level of awareness. It knows how to tap into the multiverse (which is a dreamworld) and can pull in the dominant zeitgeist and possibly ascend to heaven - where that particular species becomes God-like. Then they go help the next species to ascend to heaven. Some don\u2019t make it and become malevolent Gods that counterbalance the benevolent Gods. Try to ruin the next species trying to make it. Here\u2019s where you can bring in Biblical or other holy books prophecies too. ",
