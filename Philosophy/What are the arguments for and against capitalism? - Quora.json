            "answer_text": "For - capitalism provides immense production & great reward for owners as well as workers. New inventions thrive with capitalism. Advances in agriculture, medicine, materials, chemistry, pharmacy, engineering, computers, energy, happen rapidly. Capitalusm provides comfort for all people. Against - capitalism, especially industrial, is volatile, unpredictable, & brutal. Corporate mergers & buyouts happen. Very good workers get squeezed out of their job. I've seen great workers laid off while average or less get retained. It happens. For me, another job was always around the corner. Capitalism creates so much work, losing a job at age 62 is not the end of my career. I am 64. Have 1 semester left for PhD. I financed my tuition at a private school. Cost me a lot of savings. But when graduated, there is no debt. Claude Abraham ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the biggies: For: Capitalism is the most effective way, by far, we\u2019ve ever discovered to improve human welfare on a global scale. Billions of people are alive, well-fed, and healthy because of products and services created by a capitalistic free market. I\u2019m not sure if this is an argument in favor of capitalism or free markets. Against: Some people make a lot of money and others are left poor. It seems immoral to have such huge disparities in wealth. Practically, huge fortunes seem to lead to outsized political influence which is also bad. I think that\u2019s what it boils down to. ",
