            "answer_text": "I learned so much reading the other answers to this question. Thank you for posing the question. My first enlightenment was earth-shattering, all encompassing, and way out of left field. I wasn\u2019t prepared. I had no experience. No background. No practice. I was naive. I wasn\u2019t even sure it was enlightenment. I just thought it was a gift, or maybe I was nuts. Either way I enjoyed it and thought it would last forever without effort. I believe it is because of this that after a year or so it slowly began to fade until I was again lost, a prisoner of my mind, for another two years until I awoke again. This time, I\u2019m more prepared. I understand it better. I know that it has to be maintained. Nourished. Deepened. Sharing my experience here and learning through others here is a big part of my practice. Those that have lived religion or meditation for a long time maybe don\u2019t need to work so hard. They already have the foundation. The tools. Not me. I\u2019m still learning them. I hope this time it\u2019s permanent, but I can\u2019t know for sure. EDIT I\u2019d like to add that I recently had an offer for non-dualistic permanent enlightenment, but turned it down. I dwelled for two days in this state, but chose to come back as I was not ready to emotionally leave my wife and children. I\u2019m hoping though practice I can keep my dualistic enlightenment. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not permanent any more than anything else is permanent. It fades over time if you don\u2019t maintain it. Maintenance is as simple as practicing whatever it was that got you there in the first place. This isn\u2019t \u201crefreshing\u201d by definition; merely continuance of the conditional causation. If it fades after this, you must then discover a new way. As a fully-accomplished Buddhist master, I can tell you from personal experience that once the enlightened viewpoint becomes habit, it\u2019s harder to shake off. And sometimes you desperately want the comfort of the illusion. But you can never un-know the illusion once you see the truth of how illusionary it is. And yet it fades, and all I have to do to allow it to fade is to stop doing whatever it is that got me there in the first place, or do it so often than I get desensitized to it. But then again, it\u2019s permanent in that everyone is already enlightened, and merely needs to overcome whatever resistance they have to seeing things from an enlightened viewpoint. Thus, being a part of human nature, it\u2019s never absent; merely resisted. So yes? No? How could I choose an answer that would satisfy all of that and more? ",
