            "answer_text": "Pretty much the reason why WE create simulations now. for funto understandso currently, we run simulations for things like structural analysis, chemistry and physics. but as with all computation, garbage in, garbage out. your simulation is only as good as the input data you put in as well as the premises established. get chemical properties wrong, get the strength of aluminum wrong, input the wrong value for gravity because you used the wrong units, the simulation suffers. but we also simulate things like the behavior of stock markets. there, the properties at play are not just attributes of inanimate objects but the nature of the human psyche. currently, our simulations abstract that kind of stuff and the simulations lack fidelity as a result. but if you could somehow simulate every single person involved in the dynamic system, then you could get a very accurate simulation. so somewhere, maybe someone is doing a history simulation. they have the big milestones but they really want to understand how history unraveled\u2026 so they go to the trouble of simulating generations of billions of people to see how it all unfolded. orrrr\u2026. someone is playing THE SIMS V.9456 ",
