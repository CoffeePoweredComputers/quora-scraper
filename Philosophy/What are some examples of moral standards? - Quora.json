            "answer_text": "The single example of the most accepted traits of (1) prescriptivity, (2) universalizability, (3) overridingness, (4) publicity, (5) practicability is the battle between Dr Fauci and Donald Trump. Most of us are able to perceive immoral acts of those with political power trying to discredit one of the most respected experts regarding his own specialty and promoting hydroxychloroquine and endangering the lives of the public. Overridingness is slightly complicated On a common interpretation of the overridingness thesis, the fact that morality favours the action of Dr Fauci does not imply that there would be anything problematic in Donald Trump promoting his own interests in securing the votes of his base. Dr Fauci is defending his position in public while not compromising with confidentiality with regard to individual patients. He could easily take the practical option of revealing confidential information of some of his patients with consent to enhance his status more, but his moral principles are such that at least to my knowledge he is not embarking on such a path. If it is still expected of me to give individual examples to cover each of these traits I will do so. A caution that we need to exercise is that moral principles do change over time. In Biblical days slavery and torture were the norm. Ancient Greeks for all there philosophical excellence would have been shocked had they been asked to give up slavery. Homosexuality was normal among Greeks, a punishable offense in Biblical times and making a return in today\u2019s world. This is because of customs and evolution. The rationality of humans who lived twenty thousand years ago in all probability was different from that of ours and this too will be different from those who will live in another ten thousand years from now. Even the stance of Kant that you should always speak the truth faces dilemma when we see a man running away and then the assailant with a gun in hand demanding from us the direction in which his intended victim ran. As a physician who looked after the acutely ill including the the elderly, those with neurodegenerative diseases the major one being Parkinson\u2019 disease, as well as terminal care, I constantly faced dilemmas of morality. Nevertheless, the mere fact that if born again I would like to do the same job all over again shows the joy of the job I did. Though I came across later in my life the traits as per Beauchamp and Childress \u2013 the authors of Principles of Biomedical Ethics \u2013 the four principles that fascinated me were 1) Do no harm that is more important than the second principle 2) Do good and 3) Justice - from those who are able to those who are in need and 4) Autonomy \u2013 the choice to do what we want as long it does not harm others. I am not a philosopher. Please feel free to tear my message to pieces with constructive criticism that will make me more mature. ",

            "answer_text": "Morality is based on love. Both in the active and passive manifestations of love. You do not mess with other people\u2019s stuff and you extend yourself for the spiritual growth of yourself or others. Not messing with other people\u2019s stuff: Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Respecting God\u2019s role as God. If you break it, fix it. If you borrow it, return it. If it is not yours, leave it alone. Extending yourself for growth: Love your neighbor. Help the less fortunate. Expand your knowledge. Be honest, true to your word, be dependable, kind, compassionate, overcome weaknesses of the flesh, exert self-discipline, seek and follow the spirit, pray, grow in humility (put God first), etc. ",
