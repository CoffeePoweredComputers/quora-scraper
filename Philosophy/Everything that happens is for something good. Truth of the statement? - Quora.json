            "answer_text": "False, but potentially useful. Suggesting that everything happens for good suggests that there's some driving force making bad things happen for a good reason. To believe that, you'd have to believe in willfull, intelligent power driving the most horrific things that have ever happened for some greater purpose. That's an idea I find very hard to defend. On the other hand, I think there's the potential to take some benefit out of almost any situation, even if that situation is terrible. Now a bad situation can be all bad, it can make people weak and bitter and cause a total loss of drive and self-esteem. However, people can take bad situations and learn and grow from them, becoming stronger, more patient and more experienced. Thus, I think that everything that happens can be made into something good, if we respond to them properly.  \"Be patient and tough. Someday this pain will be useful to you.\"                                                                                     ~Ovid ",
