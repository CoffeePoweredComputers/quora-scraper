            "answer_text": "I think Christian churches usually have clergy or someone designated as a preacher and often there\u2019s a hierarchy with Bishops, archbishops, cardinals, etc. Baha\u2019i communities have Local Spiritual Assemblies that are elected annually and National Spiritual Assemblies elected annually as well. The Universal House of Justice is also elected every five years. So there is no paid clergy as such in the Baha\u2019i Faith. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Another difference is that many churches are liturgical, that is they have rites and liturgies such as the Eucharist or Holy Communion and an Altar at the front of the church. The Priest conducts the rite before the altar. Baha\u2019is have no altars and no priests that conduct liturgical rites. We do read or recite revealed scripture from our Writings in devotional meetings and Feasts that are held every nineteen days. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Most Christians use the Gregorian calendar and hold services on Sundays and sometimes other Holy Days that are on the church calendar. Baha\u2019is use a calendar known as the \u201cBadi Calendar\u201d Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar - Wikipedia and gather at a Feast every nineteen days. Each Feast is named after an attribute of God. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Many Christian churches have a rite of confession where people ask for forgiveness of sins through a priest. While Baha\u2019is recite prayers for forgiveness or can personally pray to be forgiven we do not \u201cconfess\u201d our sins to a priest. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Many churches call for tithing or contributing a tenth of your income to the church. Baha\u2019is are encouraged to make contributions to Baha\u2019i funds. There\u2019s also what is called Huququllah which is 19 percent of profits after your expenses. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Many Christian churches have a form of the cross in their architecture and inside are oriented toward an altar; Baha\u2019i Houses of Worship have nine sides and entrances from every direction and are usually circular in their seating. The number nine is significant as it is also the Abjad numerical value of \u201cBaha\u201d. Above the auditorium in the apex of the ceiling is usually a calligraphic rendering of the Greatest Name. See: Sacred symbol placed at apex of Chile temple | Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed World News Service (BWNS) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. The main Holy Book for Christians is the Holy Bible used in public and private devotions. Many churches also invite readings from other scriptures in Inter-Faith services. Baha\u2019is recognize the Writings of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah, the Bab as authentic repositories of the Word of God and the Writings of Abdul-Baha as authoritative interpretation. Baha'i Reference Library Baha\u2019is are free to read from the Bible and the Qur\u2019an as sacred scriptures: \u201c985. During the devotional part of the Nineteen Day Feast any part of the writings of the B\u00e1b, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and the Master can be read, also from the Bible and Qur'\u00e1n, as these are all sacred scriptures. This part of the meeting need not be confined to prayers, though prayers can and should be read during it.\u201d (18 October 1948) (Compilations, The Compilation of Compilations vol. I, p. 448) ",

            "answer_text": "In christian faith what you see is what you get but in Baha'i religion things are completely different then what they outwardly stand for. Here are some points that explain what Baha'i religion is : 1) The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith exists solely to perpetuate itself, 99% of its focus and activities are toward this one goal, growth in membership. Throughout their history they have been preparing their members for the \"entry by troops\" of new converts, which has yet to materialize. They do a minimal amount of humanitarian or charity work. 2) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds use terminology in ways that was not intended. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds don't have censorship, they have \"review.\" They don't proselytize, they \"teach.\" They don't have missionaries, they have \"pioneers.\" They don't have prophets, they are called \"manifestations.\" And so forth. 3) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds have a \"lo is us\" sense of historical persecution. If you look at their history, though, most would call it just fruits. During the founding of the religion, the forebear Babi sect led a violent revolution in Iran, and some of their members later attempted to assassinate the Shah. Their leadership were exiled to the Ottoman Empire where schismatic violence within the group later led to house arrest. Of course, this is all billed as being persecuted. 4) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds lament how others view them in a conspiratorial light, when in fact, again, this is based on historical reality. In Iran the Babis had the protection of the Russian ambassador (Russia being an imperial power that had seized wide swaths of territory from Iran and at one point the Russian ambassador had to approve Iranian cabinet ministers). In the Ottoman Empire, Bah\u00e1'\u00eds conspired with the Young Turks, who deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid II in a coup. Later, they would assist the British, and their leader 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 earned knighthood, being designated KBE. With their headquarters in Haifa, Bah\u00e1'\u00eds have cooperated with the state of Israel, to the extent that some of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Center buildings are built on land expropriated from absentee Palestinian land owners. 5) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds inflate their membership numbers. Comparing census data of various nations to self-reported data confirms this. The outside data Bah\u00e1'\u00eds often cite, like from the Association of Religion Data Archives, only uses self-reported data, creating a circle. 6) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds initially hide from members some of the more unsavory realities of their religion. Men and women are equal, but women are barred from serving in the highest organ of the religion, the Universal House of Justice. The hierarchy is billed as being democratic, but only in the sense of council democracy as it still exists in Cuba where individuals elect local committees, who then elect national committees, who then elect the Universal House of Justice. There is a parallel appointed hierarchy. With no politicking or partisanship allowed, elected members in the higher ranks serve for life until they die or retire, and are subsequently replaced by nomenklatura. 7) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds hide from members some of the more unsavory realities of their history. After Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h their leader was 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and then Shoghi Effendi. By the time Shoghi Effendi died, all the living descendants of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h had been excommunicated from the religion for various offenses, including \"marrying a low born Christian girl.\" Shoghi Effendi was also designated the \"Guardian,\" by 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1. The Guardian was supposed to designate subsequent Guardians, but did not do so, although the entire Bah\u00e1'\u00ed administrative structure depended on it. 8) Ignoring failed prophecies, like `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 declaring the peace of the world to come by the year 2000. Those of us around in the 1980's and 1990's remember the crescendo, and the anticlimactic ignoring of reality and denial of the build up. 9) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds claim earlier religions are valid, but in reality they only do this in an Islamic sense (i.e., the earlier revelation was perverted over time). For example, they deny the parts of Bible written by Paul. Or when Muhammad says he is the last prophet, Bah\u00e1'\u00eds say that was true only for the Adamic Cycle, but now we are in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Cycle. Source : http://bahaitexts.blogspot.com Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith employs a great bait-and-switch technique to attract new members, akin to marketing time share realty. On the other hand, people who join the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith or remain members do so voluntarily. As such, they voluntarily belong to an organization that delineates certain stipulations for membership, including refraining from criticism of the Administrative Order's decisions. I would say this is analogous to a Catholic convert's accepting of a celibate, male-only clergy or a Muslim convert's accepting of gender-segregated worship. The analogy is severely faulty, however, since a convert to Catholicisim or Islam knows these basic facts, whereas fundamental aspects of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teachings and practice, let alone history, are outright hidden from seekers and, indeed, members.
