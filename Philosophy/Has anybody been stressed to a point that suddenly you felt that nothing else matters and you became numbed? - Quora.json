            "answer_text": "Over the course of attending college, I became convinced of the probability of nuclear annihilation. In the face of society\u2019s total collapse, everything else in my life seemed mundane; my education, career, relationships, pastimes, held no meaning as I was certain they would be lost, but I followed them blindly, knowing that having some semblance of life is important. I mourned them as such, despite still having all of those aspects present in my life. I learned to feel comfortable on my own, independent, and I took great lengths to tune my education for survival afterwards. I read about engineering, psychology, weapons usage, growing crops and raising livestock, cooking and preserving food, computers and technology, electricity, vehicles, navigation, forestry, weather, and a whole host of other topics. I posited that at least one person I know could survive as well, so I maintained a few close friendships, in the hope that once the dust settled, I wouldn\u2019t have to start over alone. The people in my life became beacons; I appreciated the good ones even more because I knew they would be gone eventually. I put no serious thought into my career, because I didn\u2019t think I could have one, so I aimed for whichever job sounded the most engaging in the meantime. I spent a lot of time doing things simply because they would be impossible after bombs started dropping; I went out with my friends, played games over the internet, went to museums and art exhibitions, traveled to other countries, visited my grandparents pet my friends\u2019 cats, loved ferociously, sang in a choir, and took every chance I had to notice nature at work. It was all a sham, going through the motions to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything before it was too late. But every day, I woke up, and still no nukes had been dropped.Every day I had one more reason to believe my life would continue to continue.Every day, I saw a little bit more good in the worldAnd eventually, I realized that maybe, just maybe, nuclear annihilation wasn\u2019t imminent. That it could be prevented. I couldn\u2019t stand the idea. I had wasted all that time preparing for something terrible that might not even happen. But in the meantime, I had gained so many useful skills for leading a happy life.And now I know that I\u2019m more than capable of spending the rest of my life happy with myself, because I\u2019ve done it before, so I can do it again, and again, and again. I\u2019m no longer certain that nuclear warfare is imminent, but never again will I settle for less than what I need, because I just never know when everything could come to a screeching halt ",

I\u2019ve experienced it several times, most recently when I attended grad school while working full time. if you're experiencing burnout, you need to care for yourself. For just a moment, pretend like you're someone else, evaluating your habits. Are you sleeping 8 hours? Are you exercising? Are you drinking too much or self medicating in some other way? You need two things: rest, and recreation. Not work-like hobbies. Recreation. Read a book. Play a sport. Go to a concert. Then set aside some time to just do nothing. Watch tv (and put the phone aside). Take a nap on a weekend. Go lay in the grass in a park. You have to practice these things to make them most effective, and it will be frustrating to try and relax, when it isn't working. Keep trying though. Try different things, and figure out what works for you in particular. ",
