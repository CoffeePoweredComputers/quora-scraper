            "answer_text": "Your question confuses me as a Mexican in Mexico but as someone who was born in Mexico and lived in the United States and has returned to Mexico I can make an interesting story about this. A story that is true nonetheless. The reason I find this questrion preposterous (no offense, you are not the only one who asks) is because it is usually the other way around. In Mexico there are no racial census and if somebody claims to be white and is not a recent immigrant others will say that he is pretending to be something he is not and will be mocked around. On the other hand, 52.8% of the Mexican-Americans identify as being white, this is ridiculous compared with Mexico, where even if no census exists, there is a belief that 2% are full European and if you add the Castizo population (75% European or more) it would be another 9% of the population or 30% at the most, yet they are not white, they are castizo, this is confusing to us. Look at these pictures and tell me the similarities you see:  Do they seem to be majority white to you? What about them?  Now, one may ask, why am I comparing Chileans with Mexican Americans? The Chilean census claim that they are 53% white, very similar to Mexican Americans and they both claim to be whiter than they look to a modern North American citizen (Including Mexico). Yes I know there are a lot of Castizos in Chile too but I am talking about 100% European ancestry. So you see, your question is the other way around and could be quite confusing to us Mexicans whom we where taught that we are all Mestizos and we all have indigenous ancestors (even if we dont, we still have them in spirit by living in their land) so when a Mexican-American comes to Mexico you can see a huge culture shock as a racist brown person talking bad about the indigenous and an offended blonde Mexican defending them with pride (50% of Mexican Americans are legal and some of those 50% are among the elites in the U.S.A.). In fact, many brown Mexicans support Donald Trump and see us Mexicans as the enemy, some of them deny they are Mexican and claim they are Hispanic American as their ancestors seceeded in Texas and they have a grudge against our \u201cImperial ambitions\u201d (we can \u201cthank\u201d Santa Anna for that). Why all this confusion, what happened here, how did it get to all this? The U.S. has some of the blame, you see, in the United States for you to be \"white\" you have to have money, talk politely and have a good and educated demeanor, if you tell an American that the Cubans and Argentines are mostly European, they are going to laugh and tell you that Che Guevara and Fidel Castro are not white. The funny thing is that Fidel Castro and Che Guevara do actually have European ancestry, but since they don't have money or good looks, they don't pass as whites now. On the other hand, if these two characters would keep their young fortunes, then the Americans would no doubt call them white.  Fidel Castro  Che Guevara There is a song called \u201cSi el Norte Fuera el Sur\u201d by Guatemalan Ricardo Arjona where he said that if Latin America was rich, Fidel Castro would be a stock broker and Che Guevara would have a Burger chain company, obviously mocking that they would not have used the people for their own selfish monetary gains and political power. This sort of confusion had happened many, many times in the history of whiteness in the United States. In the Mexican-American War, Mexico was a country in debt and bankrupt from getting into two costly wars against Spain, this made Americans see Mexicans as \"non-white\" and was a huge reason why full anexation was refuted even though Mexico had a lot of European immigration and before independence the polls said that 57% of Mexicans were peninsular or creole (European immigrants or children of immigrants). However, the official racial census of Mexican Americans has varied throughout American history. From 1850 to 1920, when Mexico had a per capita GDP similar to that of Spain, the U.S. census form did not distinguish between whites and Mexicans. In 1930, because of the Great Depression, the U.S. census form asked for \"color or race,\" and census takers were instructed to write W for white and Mex for Mexican. In 1940 and 1950, when Mexico was well again, the census reversed its decision and caused Mexicans to be reclassified as white and, therefore, the instructions were \"Report white (W) for Mexicans, unless they were definitely full Indian or other non-white races (such as black or Asian). During periods of U.S. history when racially mixed marriage was not legally recognized and when Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were uniformly assigned white status, they were legally allowed to marry what are now called non-Hispanic whites, unlike blacks and Asians. They were allowed to become U.S. citizens upon arrival; they served in all-white units during World War II; they could vote and hold elected office in places like Texas, especially San Antonio; they directed state policy and constituted the majority of New Mexico's elite since colonial times; and they attended segregated white schools in central Texas and Los Angeles. In addition, Asians were forbidden from marrying Mexican-Americans because Mexicans were legally white (China in those years was poorer than Africa and was heavily discriminated against). Confusing, isn't it? Especially when you see the New Mexico government and elite as notoriously mestizo, it's impossible to imagine how Americans considered them white. What's this all about? The answer, my friends, is that there is no such thing as race. You can tell if someone is genetically Mediterranean, Alpine, or Nordic, but that doesn't mean they are \"white.\" Races don't exist, they have nothing to do with science, even National Geographic did an article on the fallacy of race. There\u2019s No Scientific Basis for Race\u2014It's a Made-Up Label This is a map of genetic component of Europe from 100 years ago.  What makes a Spaniard the same race as a German and different from a Moroccan? The answer is that just as in the United States, in Europe, while a country develops it automatically becomes \"white\" by magic, as in the Spanish colonies of America, any mestizo who bought a title of nobility, by magic became white. Back when Russia and Ireland were poor, nobody considered them white, much less Europeans, so friends, I bet you that when North Africa and the Middle East developed, the term Europe (a 9th century Carolingian invention from a geo-cultural-political sense) is going to expand to include all Caucasians from Morroco to Iran, when the Muslims stop their fanaticism and dress up in fashionable clothes and expensive hairstyles, they will graduate as white (many in Latin America don't see much difference between an Arab and a Southern European). Similarly, now that Chile is developing, you are going to see how they will be whitened even more in the eyes of the world, just as the Mexicans were when they were just a step away from the developed world. To me, the Paraguayans look more European than the average Mexican and Chilean. Edit: This does not mean that there is no racism in Mexico but racism is a colonial invention created to justify class structures and most of our elites are not fully European, so when a Spaniard came they showed their bling-bling and said \u201cSee we have riches and power so we must rule over you\u201d. Modern Mexico suffers from classism, with some people in power doing the same but most of them are not euro looking and it pales in comparison to some Mexican-American racism however, some Mexicans in Mexico can be classist and look down towards the illegal Mexicans in the U.S. ",

            "answer_text": "Some things to point: The Mexican concept of whiteness is not the same as in the USA. Basically in Mexico, Pale Skin = White.The \u201cMexican-American issue\u201d happens not just with White Mexicans, but with all Mexicans in general (From the Middle Class and above)The main problem with Mexican-Americans (What many people think) is that in Mexico they act like \u201cWannabe Americans\u201d, and sometimes discriminate against the Mexican Locals (Which in Mexico, will cause you a lot of problems) and they want to forcefully Speak in English. In Mexico the average Mexican not speak English (And some actually speak Spanish, not a good Spanish, but still Spanish) , in a way that they claim that they are better that average Mexicans. But in the USA, they say that they are Mexicans and try to represent Mexico in the United States.Considering point 3: What many Americans dislike from Mexicans-Americans is basically similar what Mexicans dislike from Mexicans-Americans. Considering that in Mexico we tolerate English, but not in the way these people try to speak English in Mexico. Now: A particular thing that in Mexico we hate, but in America seems to happen (I had seen that personally) is that the customer make a complain for little details. Or because the service was shitty and they began to ask for reparations. In Mexico that doesn\u2019t exist. The services are usually so much better, and if you don\u2019t like something, you don\u2019t make a scene, you talk with a manager and the manager will address the issue. And in the worst of the cases, you just avoid that place in the future. You still may argue, but in a civilized way, you don\u2019t scream and make a scene. (Like an Animal, we say) Mexican-Americans may act very snobby as they have American Dollars, and they make everyone to get pissed off (All other customers, and the workers). Having manners in Mexico is actually more important that foreigners might thing: If they are not carefully with that, you might piss off many people there. Many Mexican-Americans act like if they have no manners. Being educated = Have manners. If you don\u2019t have manners there, people will consider it offensive and might try to avoid you. ",

            "answer_text": "In Mexico the concept of being white does not exist because despite of their color skin the majority of Mexicans are racially mixed, for example a person who has white skin can have an indigenous ancestor or a Mexican with brown-light skin can have a European grandfather, among other combinations. Having clarified that, Mexican-Americans are despised by original Mexicans for many reasons, I will list some of them. 1.-Mexican-Americans do not speak in proper Spanish, they are obnoxious wannabe Americans. 2.-They believe the U.S is a paradise and Mexico is hell and therefore is not good enough for them, bad news for them is that we do not need them here, they can stay forever in the U.S 3.-In Mexico we are simply Mexicans and we do not mention if our grandfather or father or great-grandfather came from Spain, Lebanon, Germany or wherever. On the other hand Mexican-Americans tend to brag about \u201chaving two passports\u201d it is annoying and we do not care about it, we are not going to respect someone just for the simple fact of holding two passports. 4.-Mexican-Americans dress and speak like if they were outside the Cowboys Stadium on a Sunday evening all the time, in Mexico we appreciate well educated and well dressed people not barbecue football clowns screaming at restaurants, hotels and airports (this goes for white Americans too). 5.-Some Mexican-Americans have brought with them the \u201ccholo\u201d subculture and everything related to it (tattoos, gangster crap, tuned cars, etc) we do not need that kind of life style here, they can go to the U.S with all of that. These are some reasons why Mexicans do not like Mexican-Americans. ",

Just add a twist of a mix of national origin. In general, most Mexicans are very welcoming to any race or national origin, they will go out of their way to make a foreigner feel welcome, a friend. Mexicans are very familiar with Mexicans-Americans, almost everybody here has a relative I'm the \u201cother side\u201d. Mexicans can get annoyed when somebody with a Hispanic name and Hispanic features doesn't speak Spanish, not a huge deal, but most Mexicans don't know the whole circumstances and history of the immigrants and her descendants in the US. Mexicans or any human will dislike people with lack of education, if they are prepotent, obstentotious, flashy, rude, yet some like Kanye West. These features come in any race, national origin, shape and color, the question is moot. ",

Great majority of people on tv are white, why? They hold the best jobs in any industry and govrenment. They own all the mines, they run the oil industry too. The peoples of mexico don't see what's going in mexico but if you are on the outside looking in you can see that the whites live well and brown people are poor. I have close relatives in mexico that are highly educated but they can't get jobs because they are dark brown. I can go on and on but yes white mexicans are very racist and they still hold a grip on the majority. ",
