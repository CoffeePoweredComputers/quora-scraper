            "answer_text": "I Don\u2019t think ill be posting this anonymously \u2026 4 years into this journey\u2026 The twist and turns and the manipulations of a young 19 year old girl ( now 25 year old woman) looking for a bit of love and hope in this world\u2026 This thread never fails to amaze me\u2026 I love seeing the \u2018contrast\u201d the mirror as we all like to call it that I now recognize as looking into distorted mirror not an actual reflection of ugly truths of those who are making it their soul mission to shut me up and shut me down. Granted when this all started out for me I had no clue what was going on but a natural curiosity to find out what this could all mean. Like the \u201cmad scientist\u201d I am. It only natural when you're on an ER room hospital bed speechless about to die and cant even speak up for yourself to might want to search for answers after. Two weeks of no sleep\u2026 Maybe more being as blacked out as I had been Being I had always been spiritually inclined before meeting this \u201ctf\u201d I did what any normal person might do if they had been in the same position. Its amazing that something that started off between two people has now involved the whole world( if not a lot of strangers) Including the most venomous snake on this planet she know who she is. 4 years to realize the spiritual and physical realm of it all. 4 years of gas-lights 4 years of taking on things that aren\u2019t mine.. 4 years of the collapse to learn that what I had been around was not love.. I love reading the contrast of heartfelt apologies compared to the mirror of some of the most ugliest things Ive ever read in my life. Its starting to make me think that demons do exist. All biblical puns intended just to be an ass\u2026 The darkness that surrounds this topic now makes me aware of that too\u2026 I never knew that I could have 3 stalkers in a year If not more.. I never knew how shady the person you thought your world was could be to you.. The innocence of just wanting to build a better life after coming from many years of abuse taken and thwarted so hard by so many people.. Its only natural for me to show you some of what You\u2019re trying to project onto me\u2026 Being that I had been a puppy noo a Dog as said by the snake and the darkly held karma man\u2026 Guess I had to start biting.. I went many years and sought my help which I\u2019m starting to realize wasn't needed on my end.. All things I had been taking on through the mirror on my end of loving those who never held an ounce of the same emotion that I had for them. They know who they are as well not to generalize. I\u2019ve gone down some dark roads and seen some ugly things because of how deep I had been loving if not just being a loving person in all of my actions even to the monster women (love a very rare thing indeed) to some very dark people.. . I just Don\u2019t think how far you some of you guys tried to open up an early path of death for me on top of the huge violation of privacy is Justified.. When for 4 years I had tried my hardest to let this go.. I know for sure a twin flame doesn't idly sit back and let this happen to you.. I know that I am not the one whos fucked in the head. I know some of you guys who boast about your High IQs aren\u2019t that smart again they know who they are. I know that some of you guys are literal cliches in the worst sense of the word\u2026 Granted as I make this public statement that If I do die from the crazy amounts of toxicity that is being thrown at me\u2026 I\u2019ve made my peace its only the 5th near death experience now.. I think its sick to try to dose someone\u2026 I think its sick how money hungry some of you were\u2026 I think some of you don\u2019t want to admit that I\u2019m right about this\u2026 I think its sick how you tried to twist my words.. I think its sick trying to get me to take on some of your \u201cillness\u2019 as said by ogre who completely stupid on any humanity\u2026 But hides in plain sight as she does boasting about being real after leeching my own humanity\u2026 ( Energy vampires are real) I\u2019m.. just trying to make up for the health that has been stolen granted, I write about it. I know a lot of people are upset about me speaking out.. self protection/ animal nature.. Its only natural for me when I\u2019m in a Bizarre situation with no true back up or protection myself.. I didn't want to write a story and make money of any of this either , this is my life you fucking monsters. Granted having a women that I met in the ninth grade and hadn't been the closest to in the first place try to control and manipulate my life so hard\u2026 She hadn't been my lover she hadn't been my anything really but couldn't handle the rejection of me waking up to the fact of what a horrible person she is every time trying to escape this woman's grasp\u2026 Any mutual person who knows us could tell you its true too.. While also being the greediest if not shadiest women before all this happening within the last 4 years\u2026 What makes me the saddest about all of this is how I had to bring out my darkest just to keep these monsters off of me that\u2019s what I regret.. Anyone truly emphasis on the word truly going through this so called journey anyone being messed with so hard I feel for you\u2026 I know for sure a twin flame doesn't and would never be a snake that much is true\u2026 They don\u2019t cheat on you\u2026 They don\u2019t Ghost you and have you begging to come see you in the hospital after getting sick\u2026 They don\u2019t abandon you. Poison you watch and let your health deteriorate\u2026 They don\u2019t show fake love to you\u2026 To the fake if not possessed with something red headed woman who is trying to stalk the shit out of me after putting as much distance from her as possible.. To the women who ruined their chances at ever having a relationship based off of love after the years of abuse given to me as a young girl and a teenager\u2026. you had your chance you chose men/ partying/ drinking/ toxicity/ greed\u2026 I feel for you though because sadly enough I understand you\u2026 They did the same thing to some of you that you and them are trying to do to me\u2026 I regret the relationships that could of been great apart of these peoples toxic Influences I've met some really sweet people apart from the modern day slave owner\u2026 The whole Jesus thing is funny Ill give some of your toxic Humor that\u2026 For the dude who does look like Jesus you know who you are lol you were pretty cool for a little while so thanks I guess.. I\u2019m starting to realize No\u2026 I know for sure like I always have narcissism is old\u2026 I grew up with personality disordered to know what it is Granted im not perfect\u2026 but Its tired who wants to live like that\u2026 I cant survive off of that\u2026 and the fact that i\u2019m speaking up they're subtly trying to kill me for it. which why I keep running away \u2026 It makes you into a greedy, if not rapey, if not stalkerly , user If not abusive person that\u2019s obvious\u2026 Love that\u2019s my god btw for all the people trying to claim I\u2019m a hyper- religious freak with psychosis related religious ideations\u2026 I\u2019m just a person who trying to learn I didn't create the concept of god just explored it and found out somethings\u2026 so theirs that\u2026 To the psychos I\u2019ll pray for you you're gonna need it. For the people you know who you are too stay safe\u2026.. All I tried to do was tap into love\u2026. So for all the people who are trying to turn this into something it isnt me into someone I\u2019m not . You already lost\u2026 trust me idc how your life turns out you lost\u2026 ",
