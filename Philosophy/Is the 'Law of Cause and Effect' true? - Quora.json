            "answer_text": "With all due respect to Brian Tracy, such an idea is utterly ridiculous outside of very general rules for engagement. Let's consider reality as three layers: 1) socio-cultural structures, 2) that which is personally controllable, 3) that which isn't personally controllable. (I'd be more pedantic, but am keeping this simple for brevity.) The structures of one's socio-cultural context include both the mores for interpersonal engagement and the physical constructs of industry. These will determine to a large extent what is possible for \"success,\" at least within that context. It's little wonder that a great many people of one culture find financial and social success when taking what they have into another culture, because staying in their original place wasn't going to result in anything personally profound. Further, systems are in place, which if not understood and capable of being manipulated, will curtail potential ideas and behavior. What is possible for someone at a high level of social power will result in destruction for someone at a lower level. There are any number of things that are personally uncontrollable, from one's biology to familial status to generational variables like poverty. Undoubtedly millions of brilliant people exist that will never see the light of day due to things outside their control.  That being said, the things that are personally controllable can shift and change depending on what choices are made.  What \"cause and effect\" means is not one cause for one effect, but the inevitability of consequence for all behavior. What those consequences are will be determined by time, location, cultural context, personal skill, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you sure that's what law of cause and effect or Karma says ? First Let me put my view on the rule of cause and effect and then we will return back to your example.It is a simple domino effect, that whatever we do shall affect us in someway now or in future somehow. Conversely whatever happens to us is the result of some action(s). Now your suspicion regarding what you heard is valid. It is not true that now if you try to build an steel empire or Microsoft or Institution like the established people now. Because what they did was relevant at there time, now you cannot hope to build an empire by starting just one powerloom factory working at some petrol pump or gas station. Success has no sure shot formula it is just the matter of shooting someone with your sniper rifle. Just Aim! Wait ! and on the right opportunity SHOOT ! ",
