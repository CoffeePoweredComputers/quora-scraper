            "answer_text": "Of course YES and the mind can be the best friend too. Thus it is all in the mind and we keep walking all around it in absence of our knowledge and so that is known as ignorance. Who is not ignorant in such situation? Difficult to find because the ignorance in people could be of different degree making a relative reference and of no use. What we can do is simply to focus on self and make an attempt to reduce ignorance as much possible. We have thus two end in front of us. More ignorant we are, our mind is making worst enemy in us. More we reduce ignorance we keep making mind our better friend. Let us go back and try to find out; Is mind ruling me or I am ruling my mind. Here you may get some clue about the difference even if vague needs to be known and amended if desire exists. We should know for improving we always have to get out of our comfort zone and thus need to identify it. Comfort zone is actually about our daily set life pattern including people we meet who are influencing out thoughts. If in the group of existing friends an outsider comes and discusses something very different that could make one enterprising but that calls for going away or ending more hours to disconnect with this group. In such instant majority simply over rules him giving many examples they have tried and failed as their justification. These people either have not experienced what they should or could be willing because they are not ready to move from their existing situation. Their risk taking appetite is not present even if their mental environment is getting stale like a part of flowing water held in a hole and is left out and gets stale and then stinks. This is one example and we can interpret this differently in many ways when we are making our mind our biggest enemy. For making mind our friend the solution is reveres and needs discipline life and hard work initially to make a habit conducive and ready to accept challenge. I am not going I details as that is not the query. ",

            "answer_text": "I thought I will begin with a lot of explanation to keep it diplomatically correct but then thought let me not complicate the things. Yes, mind is our worst enemy. This stands true in the following ways: Mind is a sharp tool which helps us to dissect things into recognisable forms so that the world and concepts become simpler and more comprehensive. But the moment we apply this to every single thing around us, we realise that some concepts doesn't have very logical explanation. This makes mind our worst enemy because it doesn't let us accept few things which do exist but might not be put into simple logical framework.Mind keeps a lot of stuff in its bank. It doesn't allow us to move forward and embrace the future often because it carries the memory of past. The moment we see something that has a past association in our mind with a painful experience, we doom ourselves into it yet again.Mind gives us endless opportunities to explore the world and empowers our rich tapestry of experiences but it also at times runs its own world within this world which keeps us away from reality for long. For instance, mind creates certain thoughts based on past experiences so effectively that we tend to believe that this is how actually things are. But it is not so. To keep the thoughts aside and to keep the conscious awareness of present alive will make us see the world in the right light.There is nothing in the mind which is of it's own. Everything is a copy of experiences we had or we read somewhere. So, mind keeps us in the circumlocution of the same things we knew and doesn't allow us easily to move forward and accept the change.Although I have quoted all the reasons for mind being the worst enemy but I also believe that the needle can be both used to prick and stitch things. The control on the thoughts our mind produces, if mastered, can be the greatest blessing too!",
