            "answer_text": "Very. Actually I think the translators ever so slightly outdid themselves, as a kind of in-joke to the French-speaking audience. I mean, it\u2019s a tad too perfect to be believable. If there was a \u201cQueen\u2019s French\u201d, that would probably be it. But there is no Queen in France anymore. Here are (my best efforts at) direct translations for some of his lines: \u201cI was hoping that you would invite me to enter in your house for the purpose of us having a discussion?\u201d (Certainly. After you.)\u201cGiven that we are on a dairy farming enterprise, I suppose there is no risk of erring [by assuming] that you [people].. got milk?\u201d\u201cI invite you to come join me at your tabe.\u201d\u201cMr LaPadite\u2026 I am in [a state of] regret to inform you that I have.. exhausted the reach of my French. To continue speaking it so little satisfactorily, would do nothing but embarrass me\u2026 Meanwhile, I do believe to know that you speak English fluidly, do you not?\u201d (Yes.)\u201cBy chance, it just so happens that.. so do I!! \u2026 Given that we are here at your place, I demand your permission to pass onto English for the rest of the conversation\u2026\u201d Accent-wise.. It\u2019s in a way flawless, but no native French speaker has that sort of intonation as far as I\u2019m aware. ",
