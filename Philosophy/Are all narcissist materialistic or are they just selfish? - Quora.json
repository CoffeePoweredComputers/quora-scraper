I don't like the people kind because I tend to get hurt by them. I do like some of the feline ones, however. I don't believe that the feline narcissists are particularly materialistic but I could be wrong because I'm no expert on feline narcissism. ",

            "answer_text": "Narcissist and sociopaths are both empty souls. What does that mean? Not having any \u201creal\u201d feelings for others only oneself, they try to fill-up with everything external. So they will try to use money, greed, envy, lust, attention, status, position, material items - cars, houses, boats, clothes, etc.. to \u201cfeel\u201d better about themselves. All of these things, of course, are short lived and then they will have to move on to the next thing. ",
