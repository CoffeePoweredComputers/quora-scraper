            "answer_text": "In very brief terms, the key idea of Kant\u2019s Ethical philosophy is called the Categorical Imperative. He carefully worked this out according to his theory of \u201cEpistemology\u201d \u2014 or \u2014 what our minds can know and what we can never know. In his view, when it comes down to living, we have nothing to go on except our own minds and logic, and our need to live in abundance at peace with other people. So, inside our minds we all encounter this logic \u2014 which is impossible to ignore and impossible to logically, namely, the Categorical Imperative. What is it? It is an \u201cimperative,\u201d which means, \u201cthis is what you have to do.\u201d It is \u201ccategorical\u201d which means, \u201cthis applies to all human beings in all situations, without exception.\u201d Kant worded it something like this: \u201cAlways behave in a way so that you can always hope that all other people would behave in this way.\u201d That\u2019s the key idea. Kant said that if people were careful, and would always refer to the Categorical Imperative before making any major decision, the whole world would be a better place to live. ",

            "answer_text": "There is one ultimate law of morality, which he calls the categorical imperative, that states that you should act in a way that the maxim that determines your action can become an universal law without contradiction. To Kant, this moral law is not simply a construct, but a conclusion on morality that every rational being can arrive at, regardless of his empirical experiences. Because of that, every rational being also has a duty to act according to the categorical imperative. An interest thing in Kant's ethics is that, from his perspective, an action can only be considered moral when it is done with the categorical imperative as its only motivation. This means that you can only act morally when you are acting with the sole purpose of fulfilling your moral duty in accordance with the imperative, without any personal interest guiding your action.
