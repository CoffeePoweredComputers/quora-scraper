            "answer_text": "It needs to be dead and very dead since it appears to almost reject any absolute truth !! It is not the favored way of many and also the past systems or influences were even better than postmodernism and yes I know that is a fact. And I will not prove it because some body possibly is younger as in a newer generation I am sorry as I do not work that way /, they need to find out themselves and if they do not it means they are not looking sincerely. We need to personally pump our brains like working at a gym like muscles .Just be truly sincere as best or better and observe things very closely/ There is a reason people knew truth being absolute were actually that. Many churches by the way are rejecting truth or absolutes also ! This will sink them down into quicksand. ",
