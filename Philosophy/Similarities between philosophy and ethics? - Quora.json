            "answer_text": "I think there are two parts to this. Firstly, as User-11844920003831285255 has pointed out, ethics is included *within* philosophy, as one of it\u2019s classical areas of concern. But secondly, when people talk about ethics *outside* philosophy, they are usually talking about applying already established (maybe tacit) ethical principles to practical situations (that\u2019s what hospital ethics boards do, for example). In philosophy, the study of ethics is more concerned with identifying those underlying ethical principles and their consequences. So if you are talking about ethics in the more everyday sense, the similarity is that both concern themselves with how people should behave, but philosophy is more concerned with general principles, (everyday) ethics is more concerned with the practical application of those principles.
