            "answer_text": "Ultimately, every human being is driven by an over-arching paradigm, which they may or may not be aware of. As young people, it is extremely likely that this will be the drive to mate, but as people grow up, it may change if mating appears impossible. As an example, if you are denied the emotional security of the first year of life due to maternal neglect, your overwhelming need for that has to be given up to allow you to survive. No infant has the emotional ability to cope with abandonment rationally, so they shut down emotions as a survival mechanism. They become a stoic as an infant because they have no power to change their situation and 16+ years to wait before society lets them break away (assuming they have money to do so). There are consequences for socialising at school as such a child is not innocent, is not very spontaneous and has many adult features like delaying gratification (since they are continually delaying their infant need for maternal security). Making friends is hard as few have the same experience. The usual outcome of this is that the child grows up seeking a new start elsewhere where the chance of experiencing what was missed might ensue. This may lead to extraordinary emotional growth or crushing blows of emotional vandals wield the knife at critical phases. If that happens, then sociopathic features may develop, simply because humans have proven they cannot be trusted. It is not inevitable: I have seen stoics as children develop as adults. But sociopathy is certainly one potential endpoint in this scenario. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are practicing real stoicism, by definition, it will not lead to sociopathy. You have to understand that the essence of stoicism is virtue. How do we define virtue? Virtue is not selfish, but rather it seeks others and it is self-sacrificing. Virtue is ultimately discipline. You do it because it's necessary and others are depending on you. You don\u2019t do it because it furthers your pleasure. That is the complete opposite of stoicism and sociopathy pretty much goes hand in hand with hedonism. Think of it this way, if your number one value in life is to feel pleasure, then everybody else is secondary. Pretty soon, you're cutting corners, harming people, short-changing them, and otherwise denying them of their due respect because you're out for number one. It doesn't take much to go from that situation to full-on sociopathy. Stoicism is the opposite. You don't focus on your pleasure but some higher value. You don't wake up at 4 AM to work out because it's pleasurable. You don't take a cold shower first thing in the morning because it feels good, but these are necessary to wake up, be fully aware and conscious. You don't take the hard path because you have nothing else better to do. If anything, stoicism leads to a much-needed form of personal minimalism. In other words, you don't focus on the extras of life that maximize your pleasure. Rather, you focus on just enough so you can understand the real meaning of living because when you want to truly live, it's not about getting something bigger, better, or more. Instead, living a life worth living is all about discovering what is enough. That is the point in your life where your possessions no longer have a hold on you. This is why minimalism is so awesome. It's a fairly recent social movement in the United States and elsewhere, and it's getting a lot of millennials and people in the Z or Zoomer generation to re-evaluate their priorities. For the longest time, we've been told that the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d is all about getting the right job, making a lot of money, buying a house by a certain age, and then retiring, and by that time we get put in a home. What if it's wrong? What if that's a myth? And now, we are at a point in history where people are downsizing their home. Many people live in tiny homes and it\u2019s not because they can't afford mansions. A lot of millennial millionaires can easily buy a McMansion, but they don't. Instead, they understand that memories and experiences are more valuable than possessions. When I read H.K. Ahmed\u2019s The Minimalist Revolution, it was as if somebody turned a switch in my mind. A lot of the things that I thought were true and worthy, completely vaporized and I realized that I don't need all that much in terms of day to day survival. And this made me feel rich for the first time in my life. Because I want to be honest with you, as a young zoomer, I'm doing quite well for myself. I have a lot of online businesses and sidelines and most of them are passive income. In fact, I am making more money than my parents were at my age and I don\u2019t have to show up to a 9:5 job to earn that money. But I was feeling empty and numb, I was caught in this trap where I thought that the more trinkets I buy, the happier I would get. Still, I was never happier, I was never fulfilled because there's always more, more, more. But when I read The Minimalist Revolution, I focused on less, less, less and I became happier. Now I can just put on a backpack, go to Spain over the weekend, or to the southern part of China and feel complete. Wealth, it turns out, is not what other people say it is and it is not what your parents made you think it is. Rather, it is something that comes from within. It\u2019s a sense of enough. Because I know so many people who slaved away, working job after job while trying to get a house and they became a slave to their possessions. After reading H.K. Ahmed\u2019s book, I made a deal with myself, I'll never be a slave to my possessions and I will never ever let the things that I own possess me. And guess what? I'm so much happier, and my relationships are so much healthier. You might want to check it out. Otherwise, it would be no surprise to discover that a lot of people become sociopathic because they are so focused on pursuing themselves and their possessions. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. Stoicism is enduring pain or hardship without displaying feelings or complaint. The very definition implies that there are feelings involved, which a sociopath or psychopath don't have. Stoicism is a very valuable trait to have for people in leadership positions. Imagine a CEO , or an army general, or leader of a country lacking stoicism. Those they lead would certainly be in a state of chaos and unsurety, unable to be confident of their leader. People in leadership positions must remain stoic, which does not mean they lack emotions; they don't show their emotions because that would not serve them well in their positions of leadership. So in my opinion, being stoic would not lead to psychopathy, but a psychopath in a position of leadership certainly would look like a neurotypical person displaying stoicism. ",

            "answer_text": "Stoicism as it is described in the works of Seneca, Epitectus or Zeno is not about substituting emotions with reason and logic. Stoicism is about a certain way of handling emotions, not about replacing them with something else. Stoicism teaches acceptance over emotions triggered by events we cannot control; it is not about suppressing these emotions. Now, having established that Stoicism is not about subsituting emotions for anything else, it becomes clear that Stoicism cannot lead to sociopathy. ",

Stoicism revolves around being ethical, which involves acting for the good of others. Thus, Stoicism cannot lead to sociopathy. Additionally, Stoicism does not substitute reason for emotions. It uses reason to prevent emotion from carrying us away. A Stoic bases their decisions on reason, but they are not devoid of emotion. ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose it could be argued that sociopathy is a form of stoicism. However, the way I understand it, the sociopath is put under unimaginable stress and, as a defense mechanism, evolves the ability to not care about the source of the stress. As this stress is oftentimes inflicted by people who ought to care about the sociopath, the sociopath learns to reject avowals of caring or love along with the pain. The chief difference I can see is that a stoic is typified by someone who takes everything, both positive and negative, with equanimity and who doesn\u2019t pursue self-gratification, while a sociopath may very well pursue self-gratification to the exclusion of all other ends. Stoicism is an attitude, whereas sociopathy is a defense. Think of a person assailed by weapons. The stoic stands there and takes the attack without showing pain. The sociopath, on the other hand, has evolved an invulnerable shield which deflects all of the weapons aimed at them. Both claim to be unharmed, however the stoic has actually taken damage, they simply choose not to admit it, while the sociopath has taken no damage. ",
