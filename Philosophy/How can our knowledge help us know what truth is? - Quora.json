            "answer_text": "Truth is a variable word. One man\u2019s truth looks like another man\u2019s lie. You need to see from different viewpoints, in different lights, look with different eyes. Statement - It is foggy outside. - Is it fog or is it smoke? Are the windows misted/dirty? Are your glasses dirty? Do you need glasses? Was it foggy but is no longer ? Statement - The bird is black. - Is it a bird or is it a kite? Is it black? A flying white bird with a bright sun behind will look black so will a landed white bird covered in oil. #Patrick McGinnes suggests in comments that real truth is objective for example: the colour blue is an objective truth and measureable, the dress is made by Yanni not Laurel. Yet even objective truths are challengeable; for example dress labels forged or changed and no one can explain colour to someone who was born with no sight; colour is subjectively perceived. The colour blue, other than from a blue light source, is reflected blue light and in reality the reflected light will vary: at night, in bright sunshine, in shade, under a different light. The dress is blue is a consensus opinion agreed if the dress is looked at in daylight; possibly challenged by those who are Tritan (blue yellow) colour blind. Few people carry tools to measure and assess, and even measuring and assessing relies on human input, action or judgement. Knowledge is knowing the act of assessing can affect objective outcomes and objective truths have constraints.What is the difference between subjective truth and objective truth? Knowledge helps us to accept there is more than one truth. Helps us to realise the different truths can change. It is hard to negotiate if a party insists on one truth only - their truth. Knowledge helps us to accept a compromise. It helps us accept a consensus. It helps us to accept good enough. With knowledge we know we cannot reach perfection. We realise values are chosen and it is by working together values become accepted. The hardest truth is we need to work from our heart and make our own judgements when necessary. We may need to challenge viewpoints or explain our own. The truth is - how we perceive affects the outcome, what we expect affects the outcome, our presence affects the outcome, what we believe affects the outcome. If we are cynical, cynicism grows. If we fear and hate, the contagion spreads and more people will hate and fear. For love and goodwill to grow we need to believe in the inherent goodwill and love of people. The belief becomes the truth. Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts (propositional knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many difference sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology. Knowledge - Wikipedia? ",

            "answer_text": "Truth is a function of how well something matches reality. Reality could be a dream, an illusion, a virtual environment, or physical - as we perceive it. Regardless of what forms the framework of reality, it is consistent and persistent. Therefore, knowledge is possible. Knowledge is a special kind of belief. It is a belief that I have consciously accepted as resembling the way things actually are AND does actually resemble the way things are at least to the extent that there is no evidence of falsehood. Knowledge does not withstand evidence of falsehood. Think of knowledge as a scaffold. The more scaffold you build, the more you have places to build more scaffold and the further you can reach. The more you know the more you can potentially put to wise use and the less likely you will put it to foolish use. Therefore, build your scaffold of knowledge to greater breadth and height. ",

            "answer_text": "Being a truth seeker is a work in process thing; one cannot affirm or say that I possess the truth once and for all. As far as using knowledge to help us attain truth or at least a as true as possibly met truth, knowledge is a useful tool that you can use in conjonction with (together with) intuition. There are ways to increase our intuition and also to increase our knowledge. The good balance of each of these can bring us closer to truth I think! One condition is required for being a good truth seeker I think: You have to be willing to spend time and willing to spend some time at searching. This process is best when you are giving a regular and steady attention on the subject of truth. One will attain to a higher degree of both knowledge and intuition guiding him or her, if one gives a constant effort in doing so. Conclusion: I dont think that knowledge alone can bring up truth; we need using both sides of our brain > rational and creative (intuition and reason). Hope I answered a bit the question; please give me you ideas on the subject too\u2026 Have a nice journey and a nice day! Roland ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing can help us fully know what truth is. For something to be unquestionably true, it would need to be true independently of our ability to perceive it. It would need to continue to be true, in other words, once we\u2019ve gone. Obviously we have no way of knowing if this is the case or not. The only truths we can know depend at least partly on us to be known. They\u2019re all subjective, therefore, and no two of them are identical. To answer your question, the most reliable truth that knowledge can help us know is that \u2018truths\u2019 should be written in the plural and not associated with the word \u2018objective\u2019. ",

Eventually a consensus is built after much scrutiny and only then do you actually have truth to the best of your ability.
