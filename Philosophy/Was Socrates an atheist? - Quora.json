            "answer_text": "Greetings and peace to you - No, Socrates was not an atheist, at least not by the time he died. While he may have believed in false gods at one time, he conceded well to the contrary before his death, professing his faith in one God. During the trial for his life (see, Plato\u2019s Apology), Socrates shared that all he knew he received from \u201cthe God\u201d and because of this he knew that he himself knew nothing. When he consulted [the] Pythia, the Oracle (at Delphi) at the time, however, she declared him the wisest man of all. He disagreed with this, though (and reluctantly as he thought it most disrespectful to do so), because he knew the Source of his wisdom (which was not himself). And so he set out to prove her wrong. Which is how he came to be on trial for his life. In seeking to find the man wiser than himself who he believed to even be among his contemporaries, he met with several peers he had thought where wiser than him. In conversing with the first of these, he learned their \u201cwisdom,\" to be lacking and so he had to acknowledge they were not wise after all. He still believed the Oracle wrong, though, and so didn't give up. Eventually, one of these men was so offended by Socrates\u2019 wisdom and acknowledgement of \u201cthe God\u201d as the Source of that wisdom\u2026 that he falsely accused Socrates of not believing in any god(s). And that's how he came to be on trial for his life and subjected to the Greek Senate's kangaroo court: one opposer twisted his (Socrates') belief in one God into a rejection of all gods, which vehemently denied, but which the Senate used to condemn him to death. I hope that helps. Peace to you! ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. Actually, he believed he had been sent by the \u201cthe God\u201d to Athens to keep the citizens' souls awake. He also believed that there was life after death. The modern feeling that he could have been an atheist comes from the fact he was a free thinker: this is probably the same reason the ancient Athenians believed he was impious. However, Socrates did not consider himself neither atheist nor impious. He simply did not believe that the tradition was untouchable nor that the Truth had been already completely revealed. So he felt free to investigate all, even religion. In this way you can fully understand his words of the trial: \u201cI do believe that there are gods and in a far higher sense than any of my accusers believe in them\u201d. I advise you to read the Apology of Socrates and the Crito. P.S.: the 5th c. BC Greeks had no word to mean \u201catheist\u201d, but the \u201ccharge of impiety\u201d (\u1f00\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 | a-s\u00e9beia) the Athenians made against Socrates corresponds quite well with a modern \u201ccharge of atheism\u201d: he was accused not to believe in any god or to believe in false gods. Socrates tried to defend himself from this charge in the Apology. You can read it yourself to judge if he was innocent or guilty. ",
