            "answer_text": "No you are being generous with the 80% figure. Most of the \u201cscience\u201d in the Koran is generalised and high level and can be interpreted in many different ways which makes the \u201cscience\u201d meaningless. For instance it\u2019s description of the earth use to be interpreted that the earth is flat when that was the common belief and now is interpreted as a sphere now that it is known the earth is a sphere. The Koran\u2019s description of a fetus forming leaves out the female egg completely rendering the fetus \u201cscience \u201c as incorrect. And it describes sperm as coming from between the back and ribs. That is where the bladder is and where urine comes from. Sperm comes from the testicles, this is also blatantly wrong. But at the time if you cut a body open you could trace the bladder to the penis, so it\u2019s an understandable mistake that it was thought sperm also came from the bladder. The description of mountains as pegs that hold the earth down firmly is wrong. Mountains are a result of tectonic movement and are caused by earth moving. Geographically mountainous regions are the most volatile not the least as the Koran describes. Also completely wrong, in fact the opposite of reality. The description of the moon and sun are more consistent with a geocentric model (where the earth is stationery) not one where the earth rotates around the sun. The sun and moon are described as having a path across the heavens but not the earth. So this is wrong also. The science in the Koran is an example of what was known by Arabs at the time, it is high level, ambiguous and has many mistakes. ",
