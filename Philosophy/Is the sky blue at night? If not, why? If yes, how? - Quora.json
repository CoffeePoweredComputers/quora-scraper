            "answer_text": "The sky is only blue because when the sunlight lenses through our atmospheric gases, the light refracts and deflects into ionized blankets of electromagnetic intensity, like how a rainbow is formed, charging the atomic molecules within your physical perspective to be iridescent. At night, there is much less light to be scattered and lensed through our atmosphere, thus allowing the atomic molecules to remain mainly transparent to your physical perspective. This is also why the morning is reddish to purplish, going to blues then oranges at midday, to blues and reds with purples at sunset. With lenses that expound on the visible light, greens can be seen nearer the center of where the Sun is located. From space I have seen images of how the sun appears white, twinkling white, not yellow or orange as we see it through our atmosphere. It's a halo rainbow that is visible from the Sun, causing the atmosphere to ionize around us by electromagnetic radiations interacting on our atmosphere. We see blue sky in day, or transparent non iridescence at night. ",

            "answer_text": "Blue sky is a phenomenon caused by the preferential scattering of blue and violet sunlight by Earth's atmosphere. Lacking an intensely bright, white source of luminance, the night sky has little light to scatter and the stars are not overpowered. However, on a night with bright moonlight, the sky does appear blue, although more subtly. This is most noticeable in long-exposure photographs. ",
