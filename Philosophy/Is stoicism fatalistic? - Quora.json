            "answer_text": "I'm pretty sure fatalism began with stoicism lol, unless I'm remembering wrong. It's definitely true that, metaphysically, the Stoics were determinists. Their ethical legacy is perhaps more important, though. They believed that we ought to worry about the things we can control, and not about the things we can't--these can't be good or bad, they simply are. By submitting to the \u201cuniversal reason,\u201d we resign ourselves to whatever fate the universe should deal us. Of course, we should still strive to live a good life and make the best decisions we can--this isn't an advocacy for a \u201chands-off\" approach to life. But at the end of the day, having already made those decisions, the Stoic would simply seek to be content with whatever happens, trusting the universe. ",
