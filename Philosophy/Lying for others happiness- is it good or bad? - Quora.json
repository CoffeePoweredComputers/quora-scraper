            "answer_text": "All a lie could do, if it could is make someone happy but only momentarily, for a short while.  When your child makes a cup cake for you and asks you to eat it up and tell how it tastes. Yes, you can go ahead and tell it was the tastiest cup cake you ever ate. (Even though you had to chew on the half baked dough, which only you know).  The child would be elated, happy, jumping into the air and plants a kiss on your cheeks with a 1000 watt glow on his face. Did this lie make the child happy ?Yes of course it did ! Did this lie make you happy ? Yes it did, seeing your child so happy is the best thing that could happen to you! This was a moment you both would cherish all your life. But here's the catch. Is it good or bad?  Good - it gave you a memory that is a treasure forever, for both of you. Bad - the child thinks, that's the best cup cake he made and might never improve upon. Not until someone comes up to point at him, that this isn't the best of the cup cakes or point the flaws in it. It breaks the child's heart that you lied. Your credibility is almost lost, depending on how often you have been doing this. The child will doubt coming to you in future for a genuine feedback. You are stealing an opportunity from the child, which they duly deserved to be aware of.  Next time the child makes the cup cakes, walk up to him and tell him that last time he made was a good cup cake the best of what he tried. However, he needs to bake it for a little longer to make it the best one. You do want the best for your child, for the ones you love.  Stealing someone of the truth that they deserve to know, does no good to that person, never in the longer run and does no good to you, since you by now should know a lie is the most powerful addiction that can ever happen to anyone. One leads to another, and it happens so soon and easy, that you lose track of which lies to confront to when time comes. Even when you want to get back to the path of truth, the courage needed is exponential once the nuclear reaction of the lies kicks in.  Hope this helps. Thank you for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "The thumb rule of life is not to speak lie for any reason whatsoever. It is because lying is a bad habit and you are likely to get addicted to lying sooner than you realize. When you lie, you develop the habit of getting temporary comfort at the cost of long term pain.  You have to understand that lying has any value only when the people believe that you are actually speaking the truth. When the people start believing that you are a liar, your lies become totally ineffective because no one believes a word of you.  There once was a shepherd boy who decided to amuse himself and started crying, \"Wolf! Wolf! The Wolf is chasing the sheep!\" The villagers came running up the hill to help the boy drive the wolf away. But when they arrived at the top of the hill, they found no wolf. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces. Later, the boy sang out again, \"Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!\" To his naughty delight, he watched the villagers run up the hill to help him drive the wolf away. Later, he saw a REAL wolf prowling about his flock. Alarmed, he leaped to his feet and sang out as loudly as he could, \"Wolf! Wolf!\" But the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again, and so they didn't come. At sunset, everyone wondered why the shepherd boy hadn't returned to the village with their sheep. They went up the hill to find the boy. They found him weeping. \"There really was a wolf here! The flock has scattered! I cried out, \"Wolf!\" Why didn't you come?\" An old man tried to comfort the boy as they walked back to the village. \"We'll help you look for the lost sheep in the morning,\" he said, putting his arm around the youth, \"Nobody believes a liar...even when he is telling the truth!\" You must therefore not speak white lies which are indefeasible and there is always a danger of losing all your credibility when your lie is exposed.  However, between \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018lie\u2019, there is a gray area, which is neither a truth nor a lie. This is the area which can be explored in the time of necessity and to keep the other person happy.  A man reached the pearly gates after his death. Saint Peter opened his books and directed him to go to hell.  \u201cBut I have never done anything wrong in my life. I followed all Commandments, performed all noble deeds and always spoke truth\u201d, the man protested. \u201cOn the contrary, you lied every single day.\u201d, said Saint Peter matter-of- factly. The man cried, \u201cThat is impossible. I never lied.\u201d \u201cWhen your wife got ready in the morning and asked you \u2018How I am looking? What did you say\u201d, said St Peter smiling. Such types of lies to make your wife happy and lead a happy married life is justifiable since it can never be proven false. When you praise your child for her ordinary performance, this is acceptable. When you excessively praise the good qualities of your friend to boost his morals, it is also acceptable. However, speaking a white lie which can\u2019t be justified may cause more damage to you and the person for whom you decided to speak the lie.  ",
