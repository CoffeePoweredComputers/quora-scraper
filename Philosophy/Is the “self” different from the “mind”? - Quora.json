            "answer_text": "Yes. I'll explain (citation at the end): That the self is more than mindWe do have some stream of consciousness. The mind is conscious, and I have a mind. Descartes pretty reasonably proved that. However, this stream of consciousness (\u201cmind\u201d) is connected to this body. This is not to say that it must be true that all streams of consciousnessess are bodily, but that, in this case, this body is attached in some way to this stream of consciousness (mind). We know this because the body is the center of consciousness for this mind, but most interestingly because this body withholds information only from that mind; only I can't see the back of my head. So, the unity of bodily experience and phenomenal experience is greater than the mind, though dependent on the mind. This unity is a \u201cpsycho-physical unity\u201d that is at least part of the self, and this unity is more than mind. 2. What is the self? The self, then is the unity of the experiences performed by the psycho-physical unity (the \u201cI\u201d). Basically, who I am is the totality of all of my experiences (and their interrelations) which is a result of being a psycho-physical unity. Essentially, the self exists in the mind but it is different because the stream of consciousness which IS the mind is (in this case) dependent on a body for the physical or bodily experience which also makes up the self. So, the self exists as phenomenon in the mind but the mental phenomena (in the mind and as an action of it) is distinct from physical phenomena (in the mind but as an action of the physical). For the full argument: Edith Stein\u2019s \u201cOn the Problem of Empathy\u201d, section on constitution of psycho-physical unity. ",

            "answer_text": "No, self is the mind the consciousness an energy regulator interacting with the brain to form the self, self is dependant on what brain areas the consciousness is focused on. I can change self from one moment to the next I am now my best/true self with left logical/positive brain areas engaged, if I shift to my right anxiety brain I lose energy efficiency/goodness instantly I am my less than best self negative/harmful thought can be generated even harmful/negative action. I use EGMi twice a day to maintain my true self if I start to slip I have quick mind hack, its a new direction for humans to choose which self we are Buddha and Jesus were true self now science is giving us the tools all can be.
