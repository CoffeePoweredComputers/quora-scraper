            "answer_text": "I was reading recently some quantum physics stuff and science is beginning to have some serious doubts about life and death. Try googling quantum soul or quantum consciousness. What is consciousness. Is consciousness produced in and by the brain \u2026. is a serious scientific question now a question that used to belong not in science but in religion and mysticism. One scenario s that your consciousness is not local but coming from somewhere else. If you look at your brain like a tv set \u2026. smash up the tv set it won\u2019t work but other sets are still picking up the signal because the signal comes from outside the tv itself. Kill you \u2026. is the signal still being broadcast but your set can no longer pick up that signal? These are now serious scientific questions. Is consciousness only found in a lump of snot and gristle encased in bone and if so why? You are just a set of atoms the same atoms the entire universe seems to be made of. So why should travelling across millions of light years of universe only discover consciousness inside this ball of snot set in bone? Which is another serious scientific question \u2026. is the moon conscious is the universe conscious? Why not? The computer I\u2019m sat at at the moment has silicon inside which stores information \u2026. pictures text even video. It\u2019s just a sliver of rock. In the right conditions then rock can remember \u2026. do the walls really have ears and even eyes? Is the world and maybe the entire universe recording everything that ever happens? Sounds crazy I know but this is serious science. The most complex and astounding thing yet discovered in the universe is the human \u2026. to be more exact the human brain/mind. The phone in your pocket has a few connections is very simple compared to a single cell let alone a human brain so what are we really capable of? Inside a single cell there is a machine with a complicated computer code that keeps the machine operating 24hrs a day nonstop in keeping recreating you every second of everyday. We call it DNA. Every cell in your body has this operating system and if you could unravel all the DNA in all your cells it would be ten billion miles long! That\u2019s insane it would encircle the solar system twice but thems the facts. It\u2019s a very complicated question and the answers cannot be simple. ",

            "answer_text": ">>>Does our consciousness continue to exist after we die, and did it exist prior to our birth?<<< The human consciousness or mind is but momentarily and individually being elicited, made up, fabricated, faked that is. Every dormancy period demonstrates this. Do you consider your mind being out for strolling while you are asleep, rhetorically asking? Our brain just functions, while it does not even know zilch about it-self, as such, on its own. Our brain can ONLY become educated, from outside that is, that it does exist, as such, it-self, on its own! A consciousness (an individual human mind) is the entirety of the individual THOUGHTS being elicited in the individual brain at an individual instant. \u26a0\ufe0f Considering that a consciousness is undetectable as such, it-self, on its own, the popular proclamation that \u201cthe consciousness causes THJOUGHTS\u201d is unsubstantiable, in other words is tantamount to pseudoscientific gibberish. The consciousness (the individual human mind) is an inside-brain-phaenomenon The consciousness is - as such, it-self, on its own - non-detectable. In other words, we cannot distinguish, whether the consciousness is the real-, the detectable brain activity - as such, it-self, on its own\u2192 \u201cconsciousness is actions\u201d an imaginary effect of the real-, detectable brain activity\u2192 \u201cconsciousness is givens\u201d \u26a0\ufe0f In any case, the consciousness does not exist - NOT as such, NOT it-self, NOT on its own. Regardless whether it is real actions or imaginary effects OF real actions, all that DOES exist and is the ACTOR if not even the GIVER, it is the brain. Which brain is merely eliciting, making up, fabricating the individual consciousness at an instant. Every child knows that the excitation of consciousness is but temporary. Any THOUGHT is just that: A tiny element of the conciousness, which element can also symbolized as Information elicited in the brain. The consciousness is nothing else than the entirety of tiny elements, in other words it is the entirety of the momentarily- and individually elicited informations. >>>Is information the foundation of reality?<<< No, it is vice-versa: Information-SOURCES (the real) are the foundation of any information (imaginary - via a perception-process). >>>What is an example of information?<<< An information is all that our brain can individually and momentarily elicit, make up, fabricate - BY-, TO-, ON- OF-, obtained/acquired FROM-, ABOUT- information-SOURCES My own, praeliminary listing of informations starts with thoughts = awarenesses = informations = properties of the (own) body: ALL sensations, emotions, problems, values (such as beauty and usefulness), ought-, should-, and must-HOODS, importance and necessity that is; meanings, intentions, purposes, desires-/ wills - and the respective counteremotions. Such as: Love and hate, appreciation and disgust, bright-NESS and dark-NESS.ALL parameters in the language of physics: MASS, distance, area, space, density, time, velocity, acceleration (gravity is an example), force, impulse, pressure, power, ENERGY, temperatureALL Constants, Axioms, fields in the language of physics. And all LAWS - of games, legislature, AND of logic, morality, physicsALL them so very well KNOWN G-Ds - such as YHWH, Jesus (THE) Christ, AllahThe individual human consciousness and its elements, the informations, they are, as such, them-selves, on their own imaginary and totally undetectable. They can only be uttered, proclaimed, manifested that is: Symbol-IZED, object-IFIED, material-IZED, determined, defined, ASSERTED that is. The imaginary realm (nature) of any information and of its entirety, the human consciousness follows LOGICALLY from the consideration, that an information is elicited, made up, fabricated INSIDE the brain: Yet, the brain will NEVER provide the information, that any information, as listed above, BE being elicited, made up, fabricated INSIDE the brain, inside it-self that is. It will rather provide the information, that the information be - ACCURATELY - located where the Information-SOURCE is physically located - outside the brain that is. In other words, the brain provides an illusion \u201cin order to make things right\u201d. In other words, I assert that the question whether the consciousness is the real-, the detectable brain activity - as such, it-self, on its own\u2192 \u201cconsciousness is actions\u201d an imaginary effect of the real-, detectable brain activity\u2192 \u201cconsciousness is givens\u201d is solved by the proclamation (assertion) \u201cit is imaginary givens\u201d In other words, consciousness is an imaginary epiphaenomenon, it does not cause anything. All that DOES cause something, it is the real actions in the brain. You can call my assertion the objectification of an inside-brain DUALISM. Please be so kind and abstain from asserting I be a Solipsist or a Constructivist: I assert that my explantions above are not that hard to be understood. Kindest regards, from GERMANY! ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness has been directly linked to only to be existent to having an active live operational brain. Wether it be human or any other animals species. Scientific research and studies have proven thus far that demonstrably without this functioning and existent brain there is no form of consciousness awareness. All living animal species thus far with a brain have it. In addition to this any animal species\u2026including humans who's brain is not existent and whos brains are not connected and operational to a degree of functioning there is no consciousness or awareness. Thus because of this required state of the physical brain needing to be present and operational to some degree.. consciousness prior to birth and after death is as far as we know impossible and not viable. As said the brain is a required mandated portion of the equation to get and measure consciousness. To make it easy for ppl to understand. In math you have a simple equation\u2026. 2+2=4. If you were to get rid of either of the equation portions of numeral 2.. (the first or the second or even both) , you can not get the answer of 4. This is how consciousness works.. Consciousness is the answer.. the brain is one part of the equation and the brain being to some degree operational is the other part.. get rid of any part you can't have consciousness. ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness or the Divine Soul is eternal. It is birthless and deathless. That\u2019s why when we die, the body is intact. There is no change. But the consciousness or the Divine Soul, it merges with the soul of the universe. Then when we are born, the consciousness comes back into us. Consciousness is one universal Divine consciousness. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t understand this. It is just like taking a balloon and filling it with air. At death, just like the air in the balloon leaves to merge with the air that is everywhere, so does our Soul. Our consciousness is like the air in the balloon. As long as it is in the balloon, it looks like we are alive. When our consciousness departs, death happens. There is no breath. But the consciousness inside the balloon, the consciousness inside the body \u2013 it merges with the consciousness that is everywhere outside. ",
