            "answer_text": "I'm going to be the asshole in this discussion- yknow, the one who walks the fence on anything. The one who's going to tell you that \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d don't have definitions and they never will. You seem to suffer, if you'd be willing to be understanding of my all-gray perspective, a \u201cmonochromatic moral\u201d like personality. Everything is black and white. There's good, there's evil, and rarely there might be a small gray spot in between. Someone who, for example, does bad things for good reasons, or good things for bad reasons. (A psychopath is a good example of what the latter looks like most of the time, contrary to beliefs of many) You wouldn't be justified to kill them regardless of your moral standing, (unless of course you joined them) because think about it- by killing those who kill, are you really any better than them at that point? You can claim all you like your \u201cjustification\u201d for doing so- to a psychopath, killing someone is just as justified to them for their own selfish reasons, just as you would justify killing them with your \u201cnoble\u201d purpose. You'd be one of those \u201cdoing bad things for good reasons\u201d people. You'd fall in with the better half of murderers, not all of which are as guiltless and sociopathic as you make them out to be. I'm not saying that what they did wasn't wrong, just that maybe your perspective is too narrow. Look at war. Are you telling me that soldiers fighting for the \u201cgood\u201d side, even the sadistic f*cks that enjoy ripping the enemy apart, are all evil? They murder people, some of which are probably more innocent than them, but they don't get the \u201cevil\u201d label just because they kill- even if, by your logic, some of them should. Theyre \u201cdoing their duty\u201d- that's their justification. Just as yours would be \u201cvigilante\u201d like. But all the same, it's your justification. Just like a sociopath might say that murdering his accomplice was \u201cjustified\u201d because \u201che got in my way\u201d. Justification is personal. Its different for every cause and consideration. For every person, for every action. So your \u201cvigilante hero\u201d approach would not fly well with everyone. Actually, it would still land you in prison, right next to the guys you were trying to kill. The law cares little for personal justification, if you kill someone, you're going to jail, at best. No cares, no empathy, and no pleas to save you. Now, I am the kind of person that has an open mind and provided you presented me with justification that fit your crime, (rape excluded) I would, were it in my power without the law, let you go. Why? Because we all don't follow the same moral values, and if your compass is crooked, so what? If you get off on murdering the innocent, of course I'm not going to let you go away free. But if, lets say, you murdered the guy who murdered your parents or something, that's different. Even if I think it's wrong, I can't very well force ya to follow my logic. You'll pay the price for your misdoings on your own. Karma is a bitch. ",

            "answer_text": "Using the term \u201cevil people\u201d is not a good way to phrase this question because it means we have to get right into a definition of \u2018evil\u2019 that goes beyond - \u201cyou\u2019ll know it when you see it\u201d. Right now, people\u2019s idea of that which is evil can cover a gauntlet of many notions and it can even encompass the concept that someone is acting under the influence of a \u2018bad god\u2019. I\u2019m going to change the question to this. Is it justified to kill people who are doing very bad things? When someone is actually doing something very bad to someone else, the purpose of government and society is to get him off the streets so that he will be stopped from doing these bad things. This function can be performed by incarceration. When you talk about intentionally killing someone, even if it is state or socially sanctioned, you put yourself into the category of murder. Vengeance, expedience, or social sanctioning is not a valid reason for murder. In a healthy society, except in times of war or a suddenly occurring great internal stress, it is not justified to kill \u201cevil people\u201d. ",

Were you inundated into a Russian brotherhood (gang)? If the answer to all of the above questions is \u2018yes\u2019, then you might be justified. *sarcasm* Now, without sarcasm\u2026who are you Green Arrow?! WTF kind of question is that? Of course not. GTFO. If you wish to combat evil, then go to school and learn the law. Apply for the police academy. This is life. Not a comic book. Society has certain regulations and restrictions on stuff like what you\u2019re thinking. The best thing you can do is become a cop. Or a lawyer, then a judge. As it stands, you\u2019re probably not qualified to judge whether someone is indeed \u2018evil\u2019 or not. By society\u2019s standards, you need to complete law school and become a judge in order to make such judgements. And even then, there is something called due process. That means you can\u2019t just see a crime being committed on the street, then deem someone evil and enact justice. ",

            "answer_text": "There was a time when I would almost clap and cheer my approval whenever the hero would prevail over the bad guys. And I would imagine myself coming to the rescue of some damsel in distress and dispatch the villain as in a martial arts movie.   I realized that there is no true justice to be found in the world. If you really want it badly enough, you\u2019ll have to do it yourself, whatever it will take. Otherwise, for most of us, we just have to leave it alone and forget about it. Else, it will cost us too much. It won\u2019t really be worth the price. So those James Bonds and vigilantes on screen were my favorite heroes.   Then sometime 1976, I came to understand how God was taking good care of everyone, even those who are murdered, tortured and raped. I came to understand that there never are any victims, just spirit students learning lessons. A whole new and different invisible Great Reality opened up to me. The Afterlife I learned was real. And no one really dies, we just transition from earth to Beyond.   As you would imagine, that changed everything for me. Even now, even though I would feel for the victim, I know that God is in control. He has His reasons for allowing bad things to happen. I would still cheer whenever the bad guy gets his due. But I also realize that God\u2019s justice is always meted out, in every case, even without my participation.  Karma is the operative law that ensures the exact and equitable dispensation of divine justice.   You can learn what I learned. You won\u2019t believe it, now, but everything I have written down are all true.   Journey to Light ",
