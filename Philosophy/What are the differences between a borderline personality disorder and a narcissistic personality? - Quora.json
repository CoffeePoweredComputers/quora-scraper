            "answer_text": "Although there can be some overlap, the two disorders are very different. One main difference that immediately comes to mind is that people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder lack the ability to truly feel empathy. People with BPD feel inherently worthless and unlovable. They tend to obsess over their flaws and faults, both real and imagined. Fear of abandonment and rejection is a driving force behind many of their maladaptive behaviors. Another difference is that people with BPD often agonize over the end of a relationship, even if they are the one ending it. People with NPD don\u2019t normally linger very long over someone leaving them, and if they are the one to end the relationship, they will immediately move on and not really give it another thought. People with BPD are frequently manipulative, but they do not gaslight others. They\u2019re usually unaware of their manipulative behavior. People with BPD do not have supply or employ the hoover technique like those with NPD often do. People with NPD also have an underlying fear that they are worthless, but are usually not consciously aware of it. They tend to view themselves as deserving of recognition for being special and superior to most people. While people with BPD often try to avoid attention being drawn to themselves (positive attention anyway) and feel uncomfortable when being praised or by flattery, people with NPD thrive on attention and flattery and seek admiration. Bonnie, with BPD, is terribly concerned that she is unloveable. She seeks attention because she fears the void where intimacy and validation from others are not present. Through her fundamental filter of perception, she cannot be without her close personal connections. Hence, she desperately fears abandonment, and many of her thoughts and reactions are fueled by that fear. Additionally, her very sense of self depends on this volatile attachment to others. Nadia, with NPD, is convinced that she is special to the point of superiority. However, this belief is built on an unstable foundation\u2014a foundation designed to distract from the underlying fear that she is actually worthless. She feels threatened by anything that compromises her self-esteem. But her efforts are dedicated to preserving the illusion of superiority rather than addressing the fears and vulnerabilities below the surface. She may seem confident and well put together, but it is because she truly believes in the exaggerated positive qualities she has ascribed herself\u2014and she feels the strong need for others to also believe in how special she is.[1] Most people with BPD know there is something wrong with them, even if it\u2019s only on a subconscious level. Although if they completely lack self awareness they will constantly be confused and baffled as to why their lives and relationships are such a mess. They often have co occurring disorders, such as major depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. They are much more likely to seek treatment and professional help than people with NPD. Other differences include: While both borderlines and narcissists can pose harm to their loved ones through potential emotional and verbal abuse, individuals with BPD are more likely to self-harm as a cry for help. On the other hand, those with NPD or narcissistic traits often harm others through methods such as gaslighting, triangulation, and sabotage as a way to bolster their grandiose image and false sense of superiority.While borderlines have an intense fear of abandonment, a hallmark of their disorder, narcissists are often the ones doing the abandoning. Borderlines may engage in chronic manipulation of their loved ones using jealousy, control or threats to avoid abandonment only to heighten the risk of being abandoned due to clingy, needy or controlling behaviors. Narcissists manipulate by devaluing and discarding their victims to humiliate and control them. This includes covertly and overtly putting their victims down, subjecting them to stonewalling, emotionally withdrawing from them and invalidating them, as well as abandoning their loved ones without giving them any sense of closure or explanation.Borderlines and narcissists share the intense experience of feeling and demonstrating an immense amount of rage. However, a borderline\u2019s rage tends to be more dissociative, stemming from what Linehan calls emotional \u201cthird degree burns\u201d that bring them into a whirlwind of emotions. Their focus gets tied to their own reactions and they are unlikely to see another person\u2019s perspective when in this state of rage or sadness. A narcissist\u2019s rage stems primarily from his or her sense of entitlement or grandiosity being challenged; any perceived slight to the narcissist\u2019s intelligence, character, status or anything else they value will be met with aggressive and contemptuous attempts to regain a sense of superiority (Goulston, 2012).Borderlines have a wider emotional range than narcissists do, though they experience a similar sense of chronic emptiness and void as narcissists. Borderlines can in fact feel intense, loving feelings for their friends, family and relationship partners; the problem is, they tend to also devalue and manipulate those loved ones due to their rapidly shifting emotions and distorted sense of identity. When they are not being their usual charming selves, narcissists tend to display flat affect, feel a sense of emotional numbness and experience perpetual boredom, which causes them to be on the lookout for new supply (people that can provide them with validation, praise and admiration). Narcissists tend to feel a watered down, emotionally shallow version of emotions, although they can \u201cperform\u201d emotions to gain attention or present an image of normalcy by imitating or mimicking the emotions of others. Their most intense emotions tend to be envy and rage.Borderlines can feel love for others but quickly revert back into hatred, fear or disgust for them \u2014 a behavior known as \u201csplitting.\u201d This can be incredibly traumatic for their loved ones, who may not understand why they are suddenly being seen in black and white (all good vs. all bad). Narcissists also engage in something similar to splitting known as idealization and devaluation, where they are prone to putting their loved ones on a pedestal, only to swiftly knock them off.While \u201csplitting\u201d can be addressed through therapy and inner work, many narcissists feel rewarded from idealizing and devaluing their victims because it feeds their need for power and control. The idealization-devaluation-discard cycle with a narcissist is often not an emotionally charged or emotionally motivated cycle as it is in splitting, but rather a more manufactured pattern that enables narcissistic abusers to move forward to other sources of narcissistic supply.It is commonly assumed that both disorders stem from trauma. However, this conclusion may be less certain for NPD as it is for BPD. Borderlines often come from traumatic childhood experiences such as neglect, sexual abuse or physical abuse; many who grow up in these invalidating family environments are diagnosed with BPD (Crowell, Beauchaine, & Linehan, 2009). There is still no clinical verdict on what causes Narcissistic Personality Disorder, though there are certainly some narcissists who can come from backgrounds of trauma.Pete Walker notes that sometimes Complex PTSD can be misdiagnosed as either NPD or BPD. There may also be another theory of origin for narcissism; a recent study confirmed that overvaluing (spoiling) children and teaching them a sense of entitlement early on can lead to the birth of narcissistic traits (Brumelman et. al, 2015). The origin of personality disorders is a complex topic and it usually involves the interaction between biological predisposition and environmental influences.[2]Footnotes[1] The Difference Between Borderline Personality and Narcissism Symptoms and Treatment[2] The Differences Between Abusers with Narcissistic Personality Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder",

            "answer_text": "They both have a lot in common actually, but the two together in a relationship spells disaster. I have seen it time and time again. A Narc and a BPD person, in an intimate relationship, have a simple argument but the level of conflict usually escalates quickly. There's much misunderstanding of one another's viewpoint, probably due to the most prominent characteristic traits the two disordered people have\u2026 One being, what a BPD person is know best for: Emotional Disregulation (drama), and the other being a Lack of Empathy (zero drama) that the Narc is observed to display. Conflict between them becomes so devastating because the Narcissist is, by definition, incapable of self-reflection and has a fragile sense of self-esteem at his/her core therefore, being slighted in an argument (Note here that the frequently used term for these individuals being slighted is also \u201cinjured\u201d) serves as a huge blow to their ego, which takes a lot of work for them to build back up after a fight. When wounded, these people become very angry (Narcissistic rage), controlling and vengeful. A BPD\u2019d individual would be emotionally devastated by the conflict too but for the reason that they believe everything is their fault and deeply fear abandonment, oftentimes to the point of pushing their partner away emotionally or subconsciously with childish behaviors. This could actually be seen as a similarity between the two, the obvious cognitive pain, from an on-lookers perspective say. Keep in mind that the Narc fears closeness because they don\u2019t want to be vulnerable (or seen for who they really are, which is pretty empty inside), whereas the Borderline craves closeness, sometimes way too much that it may seem overdramatic and smothering, to neurotypicals too not just Narcs. A BPD person yearns for a deep loving connection and will go to great lengths to achieve it and keep it (thwarting all their expectations of former bouts of over-nurturing/subsequent abandonment as expectations for the unsuspecting Narc), thereby portraying acts of desperation. Ie: The BPD will probably act out and the Narc will probably use Power & Control tactics such as discarding or cutting them off, with-holding affection, or pure devaluation in the form of verbal abuse. Looking at the similarities once more, however, both parties appear to want to be right and have somewhat perfectionist tendencies, quite maladaptive communication skills for the most part (until treated with CBT therapy or something of the like), and exidde selfish projections so others may be intimidated by them. In this aspect, when looking at the two disorders, both being said to manifest post childhood trauma, there are many cognitive distortions and unhealthy communication issues all over the place. Both have the capacity to manipulate and cause discrepancies where there really doesn\u2019t need to be any. This is not always the exact outcome of conflicts between these two personalities but in my experience it is very common.
