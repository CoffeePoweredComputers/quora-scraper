            "answer_text": "It's never as easy as flicking on a light switch. We're creatures of habit, an thus it is even said that from the time we wake in the morning, till when we sleep, almost everything we do is carried out in a routine/habitual way (when we brush our teeth, how we commute to work, what we choose to do on weekend/days off- you get the point). To make any real/lasting change we must change our habits. Staying the same is a habit, changing and trying new things is a habit, and one can develop it- that's where you start. Speaking from experience, before I made any lasting changes I had to build up to it, or rather, become a person who had the will power to make a change and the ability to maintain it. Start by changing little things, and practice sustaining the new habit. It could be as simple as adding extra veggies to your meals, waking up 15minutes earlier than usual, or taking showers instead of baths(start with things that require less will power)\u2026 point is to get into the habit of doing things differently. Soon overtime, you will notice how changing these many little things have changed you as a person. At this point, one usually has the momentum and ability to take on the desired change. And be easy on yourself, if you notice you\u2019re finding it challenging at first. The fact that your trying says alot. ",

When your reasons are strong enough you\u2019ll find a way to make it happen, else you\u2019ll find 1001 excuses not to. Often, a person will feel scared to bring about a personal change because it becomes a part of who they are. \"The worst part about anything that\u2019s self destructive is that it\u2019s so intimate. You become so close with your addictions and illnesses that leaving them behind is like killing the part of yourself that taught you how to survive.\" -Lacey L. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s something self destructive, ergo the decision to change it. You haven\u2019t mentioned what it is that you want to change, and as far as a general approach is concerned, I think Kirke has given you the best way to go about it. If you\u2019d like to discuss the specifics, don\u2019t hold back from messaging me. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "ANTHONY ROBBINS (A life coach) says that a human being only changes for 2 reasons. Pursuit of pleasure or avoidance of pain. I believe he is right. Either way, change is uncomfortable when it begins but with a true desire to change, it can be done. I had character defects and qualities in myself that I did not find admirable. I wanted to change them but, like you, did not know where to start. So I started with education and information. I looked for people, places and things that were like minded. Meetings, therapy, sponsors or good friends that had already done it and could show me how. Using a combination of education and journaling for self evaluation and recognition I learned how to identify the behaviors I wanted to change. Once I could identify them I could then trace them back to what and where they started. When I learned that I constructed the cage and why it was easy to discard them but it took practice as I learned what to do to adjust the behavior in the moment. It's not easy. It takes practice. It took a lot of practice because I had lived a whole lifetime being one way. To be another was just weird at the start. I practiced over and over until some of the new behaviors became 2nd nature. Then I changed my look. Nothing to wild but just enough for me to feel good and better and different. I hope this helps. Educate, identify, evaluate, change it with repetition and practice. ",

Then travel in the direction you want to go and enjoy yourself along the way. Act like you\u2019ve already achieved the change that you wanted to get. Obviously, you can\u2019t change your internal actuality overnight. But act the change you need, and day by day, the weight of evidence will become undeniable. Before long, the person you pretended to be becomes the person that you are. Every change is possible if you're truly earnest, committed and willing to continue. In that case what had once been a desired change will turn into an accepted reality. Thank you. Peace :) ",
