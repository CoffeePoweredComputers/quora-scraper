Now imagine yourself peeping out of that window. You see the environment is blue and you start floating. As you float out of the window, you notice that your feet seldom touched the ground. Then when you realise that and look down you see there is literally no ground beneath your feet and you are floating. It is dark outside everywhere around you. You find small rocks that shines whizzing past you. Just when you are about to dash on to a rock you escape through a meagre distance . And suddenly you realise that the temperature increases. When you turn around you find you are nearing a huge ball of fire. Before you could realise that you are nearing a very old friend of yours Mr. Sun you seep through and come out through the other side. How was The trip to the solar system . This is the power of the mind. Instant imagination is the greatest asset. And according to me the greatest power. ",
