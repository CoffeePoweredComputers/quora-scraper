            "answer_text": "SIN:  The immoral act considered to be a transgression against divine law.  \"A sin exist in the eyes of God.\"  However for one who is non religious killing it is not about divinity or the saving of your eternal soul.  \"It is about ones moral conscience.\"  To kill is wrong. Nobody has the right to take the life of another living human being. Which makes killing in self defense justifiable (kill or be killed). Justifiable is not freedom to kill at will. Soldiers are not given the freedom to kill with impunity. Their mandate is to use whatever means to protect the defenseless against those who have over come the basic human instinct to revere all human life. Killing is the final and a justifiable action used until the opposition is subdued. At such a time all killing is no longer justifiable.  ",

            "answer_text": "When I was young I happened to read a Chinese novel about \"Journey to Hell\" In Chinese  belief there are 18 layers of hell, bottommost reserved for most sinful sinners. The protagonist is a monk and he is invited to tour every layer of hell and interview the sinners to spread awareness. I am serious, it is the kind of absurdity in a plot that you wont forget. Each of the layer is actually categorization of the sins ( murder , false accusation , food wastage, lust , greed , adultery and crime) Throughout the journey , the monk protagonist see sinners that spread rumors( punished by tongue torture) , food wastage ( hunger forever) , etc  There is one layer where the protagonist asks his \"tour guide\" why that particular rooms are filled with music. Then the tour guide explains \"These rooms are for soldiers .\"  When the protagonist goes to the room,he see drunk soldiers partying with their comrades and enemies. Tour guide then says \"We acknowledged that these individuals serve their nation and that killing is inevitable.\"  Sort of saying they are the exception and this is just a station before heaven ,with free liquor.  In the place where strippers are forced to dance on these floor, it is good to be the exception.  I forgot what he said next  , but I know that once the sinners served their karma, they will then go to heaven or reborn. And I love to think good soldiers have the best stop before going to heaven. Being invited to the Satan's free flow party is the extra reward I guess.  ",

            "answer_text": "In my understanding, It depends on the soldier. Some soliders are Christians and some are atheists. The Bible tells us that there is a time for war and a time for peace, a time to kill and a time to heal. In war, no one is looked at as an individual you are either the good guy or the enemy. As a soldier in a battle you have to kill or be killed. You have an army running at you wanting to kill you. Either you kill them or they kill you. That is not a sin, \u2026 that\u2019s war. \u2026 In America, we hold our vets high. We in no way think of them as murderers. ",

            "answer_text": "It is really a mater of rersonal ethics. Let's say some attacks you in a back street to steal your money, without any other weapon than his hands. Will you strike him back to defend yourself and your money? If you do is that a sin? What he attacked a child for the same reason? Would you defend the child? Would that have been a sin? To use a weapon against poeple that use weapons against you or your colleques (or civilians) is pretty much the same. ",
