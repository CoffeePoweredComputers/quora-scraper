            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define the mind and the \u201cself\u201d. We may have two minds, an impulsive, hedonistic and perhaps childlike mind (inner child), and the grown-up within us that looks after us and pushes us through the boring bits and difficult, challenging times. If the \u201cself\u201d is our bodies, and we challenge our bodies with our ambition or need for career advancement etc, then maybe yes, our body wants to sleep, our mind tells us we have to finish this assignment. It\u2019s a personality trait as much as an imperative. ",

Usually about something that you want that is not good for you, like eat too much, drink too much, go to bed too late, procrastinate, etc. Part of you wants it and part of you knows that you better not.

            "answer_text": "The mind is the most important part of the human being. It is active from the moment your eyes open until you finally fall asleep. During this period, it keeps sending messages to you upon which, with the help of your ego, you act in a positive/negative way. In doing so, there may be several battles each day between the mind and the body. ",
