            "answer_text": "Philosophy helped me, To live a more peaceful life. Remember that, \u2018anything that will not provide us peace, is not worth pursuing after\u2019.To have bare minimum expectations needed for survival. This however does not mean that I let go of any luxury that comes my way now and then.To remain sane even when being alone. If we haven\u2019t already, we need to realize that being alone and loneliness are not really the same thing. One can be completely alone and yet not feel lonely. One can be surrounded by people all the time and yet feel lonely.To have complete freedom from any thought patterns or belief systems or ideologies, many a times. Thoughts are an extremely useful tool to solve our day to day problems, at work or home, when used judiciously. When over used or given too much importance when not really needed, it will restrict our mind and hence will never be able to give us total freedom. Thoughts are the breeding ground for anger, fear, hate, jealously, joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain (psychological), depression, anxiety, hatred, happiness, sadness etc.,To not follow any particular authority. We never need to follow anybody. Even our own self. Where there is authority, there is no freedom. Where there is no freedom, there is no peace. No one is inferior or superior to another. We are them, they are us. Self inquiry is the most potent characteristic of Human Beings. Something that is not possible in species that are before us in the evolution. (Self inquiry is different from Self Authority). This however does not mean we are adamant, or do not listen to others, seek guidance or learn from experienced people. On the contrary.To have same state of mind no matter what happens. There is no need to get too excited when something that we really want happens, or get too depressed when something that we don\u2019t like happens.To be aware of the unpleasant Human Beings we are. When doing things that are needed for survival, like competing for a job or appearing for competitive exams or saving money for one\u2019s family through various approaches or competing for any limited resources like bonus at work or when being so called smart, we need to be completely aware of the fact that we are indeed doing something that is going to possibly deprive some other Human Being of a chance to enhance his/her life. After all we are not different from them. And yet understand the harsh reality of why we still need to do what we have to do at times, with a grain of salt.To realize that the problem is never outside, but within us. The world will never change unless we ourselves change. The problem is never outside as our mind wants us to think. We are not struck in the madness of the world, we are the madness of the world.To discover that thoughts don\u2019t arise by virtue of our own thinking, but they come to us automatically. The more we observe our own thought patterns, we can see for ourselves that thoughts come to us automatically and that we have no say in it whatsoever. What is in our control though is how much we identify ourselves to our own thoughts. The more we identify, the lesser we will be at peace.",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy caused me to think about thinking. Before that, thinking was more shallow and done less consciously. Philosophy helped me question myself. Question my reasoning. Identify flaws and errors. Of course, philosophy is much more than critical reasoning. We are persons who live in a world that exceeds our ability fully understand. We are bound by time and subject to changes. We laugh. We cry. And in the deepest moments we recognize an urge to find meaning in all of this. Being a product of a society that is struggling through post-modern thinking, philosophy has been relegated to the shelf. Truth as been deemed impossible to know. Reality is now subjective and morals have become relative. I reached the point of not being able to accept that anymore. Philosophy opens up 3000 years of human genius. It gives us a means to methodically apply our ability to reason to interpret the cosmos and propel the very meaning of life itself. It provides an means of understanding and communicating truth. We\u2019ve replaced philosophy with science, a very sad exchange. In the past philosophy was consider the queen of the sciences. Without it, science lost all meaning. I believe that to be true. And, I simply refuse to believe that I am the product of random mutations and chemical reactions. Or that my life is a meaningly dream. I refuse to consign truth, goodness, virtue, and beauty to the trash heap. ",

That way of living helped me kill time (school and people were too boring), despair less of the stupidity of mankind (to make sense of apparently nonsensical things helps in overcoming them to some extent), and reach exhilarating intellectual height (there\u2019s a wonderful time when suddenly the path clears and the arduous way leads to the mountaintop, where the air is fresh and the view glorious). As for philosophy as understood as a part of the humanities, a topic to study with a body of works and history, much less, though a lot. The clearest way it has helped me is that quite suddenly, as I was reading a beloved philosopher I realized that I actually wasn\u2019t alone in this world (which is quite funny as the author was long dead). Then as for the works themselves, what I\u2019ve read and paid attention to, it would take too much space to go into the details.. it\u2019s food for thought, some kind of company, and now and then a challenge, which helps you grow, or maintain your intellectual fitness.

Yet, I act robustly and with conviction whenever there is a need to act despite my skepticism. In short, I am comfortable with uncertainty and made ambiguity my constant companion.Strong opinions but..: I hold strong opinions but they are weakly held. I have always found it necessary to validate them constantly. I believe that I should have the ability to \u201csee\u201d and \u201chear\u201d evidence that may be contrary to the opinions that I have held.Not a balanced life, but a counterbalance: I think a balanced life is a myth; a concoction. I try to live a life of counterbalance as I constantly adjust priorities to achieve what might appear as a balance. I just focus on what\u2019s most important at the moment and remain undistracted as much as possible.Circumstances is no excuse: I don\u2019t believe in circumstances and never use it to explain my failures.

For me to know and believe that tasks that I do are aligned with my purpose is IMPORTANT. Purpose is my foundation and priority decides the action. Productivity only helps me to be efficient.",

            "answer_text": "Yes. When you understand what philosophy really is it's hard to imagine being able to conduct your life intelligently and effectively without it. For instance, I spent a large part of my career as a National Visual Merchandiser at Sears Canada. One of our jobs in that department was to figure out merchandise arrangements and layouts that would sell merchandise. Just putting merch on a shelf does not work well. There has to be a reason why item A is in position A rather than B,C or D. The reasoning can be quite simple or complex but all based on common sense and on a strong understanding of how the human mind works in its ability to prioritize need. Philosphy is the ability to marry common sense with understanding and the ability to communicate it successfully to set events in motion towards a desired goal, condition or solution. Philosophy has no value if it cannot be communicated even if the communication is only to or with yourself. In fact the revelations you harvest from philosophizing generally is the difference between moving forward in life with assurance and being bogged down unable to identify a sense of self worth and purpose. It doesn\u2019t take long on quora before you start noticing these lost souls who are rudderless never having learned the mental skills derived from introspection and self analysis. In short I use philosophy to help me not only think things through but know in advance I've found my golden path. It\u2019s an amazing super power most people can develop if they bend their minds to it. It does take effort and mental time though so most people don't bother and mostly never realize that philosophy is for everyone not just the more intelligent demographic. Oddly, philosophy is one of the ways you can intentionally make yourself smarter than you were before. The more things you think through, understand and discuss with others, the more intelligent you become. How far you drive yourself determines your limits. So in a sense you can choose to be smart or not so smart. In that sense, attitude drives philosophy and both have made me. ",

            "answer_text": "The part of philosophy that had most impact in my life was epistemology. Also philosophy of science. The human mind has a lot of caveats in the way we acquire and hold on knowledge and hold on to false beliefs. Epistemology can be of great help to avoid such pitfalls and how to be more rigorous in how to learn things. Philosophy of science was useful as well in showing that, despite being an method and deliberate way to acquire knowledge (and better than believing) isn\u2019t by any means the truth and you learn the limits of science. Another good topic is logics, even more so today as everybody seems to be arguing about everything, and the absolute majority of people doesn\u2019t reason, they rationalize. So being able to check the logic of arguments and knowing about logical fallacies makes easier to navigate in this vat of bullshit that is the world\u2026 ",

The most important thing that reading philosophy has done for me is to help me grow, in my mind, the hooks onto which important information can be hung. I do not jump to conclusions. I take in the information (on a social or political conflict, for example) and I test it out. I hang it on these different hooks, which are really systematic thought processes. Philosophy trains the mind to ask many questions in an effort to find truth, and it offers an unbiased system for evaluating many of the world\u2019s intractable problems without succumbing to informal fallacies or trash talk. Not only has it expanded my mind, it goes a very long way to helping me maintain a healthy blood pressure :c) ",

One has to understand the law of impermanence of nature. After each sunny day, there has to be a dark night, after each birth there have to be certain deaths, for the full moon to come again it has to pass through no moon. In this imperfection of nature, there is perfection. So *stop taking your failures and bad part of your life soooo personally or intensely,* even God does not like to give you pain but its the cycle through which you have to pass. Prepare yourself for one more fight after each fall because even failures cannot be permanent...! Enjoy life.... *Your breath comes to go.**Your thoughts come to go.**Your words come to go.**Your actions come to go.**Your feelings come to go.**Your illnesses come to go.**Your phases come to go.**Your seasons come to go.**You have come to go.* Then why do you hold on to your guilt, anger, unforgiveness, hatred so so so tightly, when it too has come to go...Let it go ..

Imagine you apply to work in a hardware store, they will ask you why you studied philosophy when it had nothing to do with your career goals, you tell them that you did it because you are interested and passionate about it, that you love learning. That comes across well. More important than any of that is that it showed me different perspectives on things.
