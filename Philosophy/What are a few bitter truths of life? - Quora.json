Effort and reward aren't always directly linked Especially if you give up too soonA lot of people ask questions on Quora like `how can I make money online`, and that is a great exampleOnline work is the type of thing that requires loads of work to start with. When I started my Youtube Channel (Expat Strategies). I had 1\u20132 followers. It took a lot of work to get it to 1,000+ even though people weren't paying. It got easier and easier. Not fair, but rational.Likewise, my Patreon Channel (Adam Fayed is creating Videos and podcasts about financial freedom and passive income | Patreon) is new. It is hard when new, and the original subscribers get more value, as often people increase prices in time. It will get easier and easier over time. In most businesses, original customers get more value than ones who come after 5 years. Is that fair? No. But it is rational. Likewise, Buffett\u2019s original investor, the first one, got more value than anybody after him, and when I went to new hotels, I always got better rates than the ones I find now, once they are established. The market isn't supposed to be fine.Same thing with my writing. It took a while to take off but is now passive - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Steps-F. 10.
