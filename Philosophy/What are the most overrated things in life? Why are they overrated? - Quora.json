            "answer_text": "Youth When you\u2019re young, you have greater physical vitality and enthusiasm for life. You\u2019re easily amused, your hangovers are short, and your boners last for days. So far, so good. Unfortunately, you are also more foolish, selfish, unstable, egotistical-insecure (they go together!), and all around lacking in self-knowledge. Age, on the other hand, brings wisdom, inward calm, self-acceptance, humility, and compassion. Even in matters of pleasure age has an advantage. Youth rips the cap from the bottle, swills the stuff down, and ends up vomiting. Age savors every sweet drop, wise in Epicurean restraint to maximize the enjoyment of the moment. As a 40-something male I am decidedly not looking forward to my years of diminishing erectile function, hair loss, and increasing frequency of bathroom visits. But I can tell you this: the thought of going back in time, even just to age 30, is absolutely horrifying. Knowing what I know now makes the thought of re-occupying that limited, prison-like mind akin to a vision of hell. If you\u2019re young, take heart about the good things to come; if you\u2019re old, be damned grateful for the wisdom you\u2019ve earned.  Hard Work By definition, \u201chard work\u201d is any work that is done without joy or pleasure. The bizarre celebration of hard work in American culture is a moralistic piece of bullshit, frequently used to justify or otherwise explain the easiness of life for the few (those CEO\u2019s work so hard!), and to convince the plebes, who in fact work very hard, to keep doing what they do in service of the existing power structure. But there is nothing inherently dignified or even desirable about hard work. Isn\u2019t it always best to get your business done the easy way? Work energetically. Work purposefully. Above all, work playfully. But never, ever work hard if you can avoid it. Don\u2019t forget: you have just one life! Only a fool would be proud of wasting it on hard work. A psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, has written numerous books on the importance, for happiness, of working in a state of \u201cflow.\u201d Easy work, you might call it. I get it: if your car stalls, you might have to get out and push a bit. But the whole point is to get it running again. Then you just ride.  Following Your Parents\u2019 Advice As a young person you will have a natural impulse to want to please your parents and a feeling of anxiety at displeasing them. As an adult, however, and even as an adolescent, you should recognize this as the pathological state of mind that it is. Growing up involves getting over this childish view of yourself. With all the people in the world, what is the likelihood that your parents should know what is best? You must learn to treat their advice as you would anyone else\u2019s: to be judged by its own merits. What is the logic behind their views? Where is the evidence? Do any reliable authorities back their point of view? If your parents have done a good job of raising you, then they will be proud of having such an intelligent and independent child. Remember: contrary to what authoritarian parents sometimes like to say, your parents did not \u201cgive you life.\u201d The earth has given you life, just as it has given them life. You have a higher calling than obedience to your parents. Always strive to be a good child of the world, and tell your parents to respectfully fuck off if they can\u2019t see the wisdom in that.  Telling the Truth We Americans got this one from our earliest school days \u2014 that old story about George Washington and the cherry tree. \u201cI cannot tell a lie, Father!\u201d But any idiot understands that things are rarely that simple. The truth is powerful, dangerous even. Telling the truth has consequences. Does everyone deserve to know the truth? You bet they don\u2019t! That\u2019s why any truly virtuous person must know how to lie and to lie well. The crucial thing is to learn to lie with integrity \u2014 not in a shifty, self-serving way but in a way that accords with your deepest principles. One must learn to lie out of respect for others. Here we move beyond the simple moralisms of childhood. Sometimes you have to do a little bad to do a bigger good; sometimes you have to abandon the letter of the law in order to serve its spirit. And yes \u2014 sometimes you have to lie to show proper respect for the truth.  Sobriety As I see it, part of the point of living is to get high as regularly as you can. Ecstatic states, attained by whatever means, are essential to a well-lived life. Alcohol and certain drugs provide a reliable, easy, and usually safe way to do this. If you can get high in this way, safely and sustainably, then I believe you should do this as you desire. If you can\u2019t, then you should quit. But don\u2019t fool yourself: don\u2019t fetishize sobriety. Most of the time being sober isn\u2019t that great. Short of finding non-chemical ways to get high (music, meditation, and exercise all work for me), the ultimate accomplishment is not sobriety but rather learning to use intoxicants in a manner that is not harmful to yourself or anyone else. Party on!  Group Pride Here are two important facts about human nature: (1) People want to feel proud of who they are, and (2) people generally have no firm grasp on who they are (let alone what it would mean to say \u201cwho\u201d anyone is in the first place). People thus have a tendency to cling to crude, superficial aspects of their identity, such as blood, race, nation, tribe \u2014 any sort of affiliation to shore up their nebulous sense of self. This is a natural and understandable reflex of the human animal but it\u2019s not a path available to the conscious person. There is no better illustration of the silliness of this way of thinking than how every American with even a trace of Irish blood, including myself, becomes a true, crying-in-his-beer Celt every St. Patrick\u2019s day. Perhaps, as I\u2019m told, the situation is different for people who belong to certain marginalized groups, since the exclusion they have faced creates feelings of shame that need to be actively combatted. I would be the last person to discourage anyone from giving the finger to shame, but one should be mindful lest the cure sicken worse than the disease. To identify strongly with some tribe is in a way to accept the oppressor\u2019s gambit by viewing oneself in terms of the same superficial, irrelevant, and frequently falsified and gerrymandered categories that led to the oppression in the first place. Furthermore, it\u2019s not clear to me that there really is anything to be proud of. Large aggregations of human beings \u2014 races, nations, ethnic groups \u2014 are never the source of the best in human life. People, gathered en masse, suck. There are great African people and great European people, but the African and European \u201craces\u201d (whatever on earth that might mean) are certainly not great. Human excellence is always the product of rare individuals, thriving within extraordinary communities, who have risen out from the mass, often contradicting its deepest common energies. The result is something properly called human, not African, European, or what have you. Herds are for the less intelligent animals, and they frequently behave in idiotic and dangerous ways. You are better than that. Perhaps, I can admit, there will always remain some ineradicable element of tribal affiliation in our thinking about ourselves. Even so, progress is always in the direction of feeling ourselves to be children of one common life, never as members of this or that faction of the human species.  Fame/Popularity Here\u2019s the problem. When you become popular, it is never really you that becomes popular, but rather one small slice of yourself \u2014 an image, a projection, a performance of some sort. As you enjoy that popularity, finding a sense of affirmation in it, a boost of ego, you now become invested in this partial self you have successfully projected. You might even begin to identify with it. But this investment comes at the expense of your true self, since popularity, by definition, is something that excludes the totality of who you are. This is certainly a recipe for self-alienation, but it\u2019s more than that. For artists or other creative types, it can be absolutely self-stultifying. The artist now begins thinking too much in response to the audience and not sufficiently in response to his own internal resources of creative direction. He works in conversation with his critics and fans rather than in the idiom of his own unique vision. Hence, the notorious \u201csophomore slump.\u201d The best art is always a bold and uncalculating expression of one\u2019s own sovereignty. It is almost always an act of defiance. It is an assertion of the true self against the forces of conformity. If the cost of popular acceptance is personal authenticity, then one might be better off to remain obscure, unknown, and unappreciated. At least there, in that solitary place, you will have the freedom to be yourself.  Want more of this sort of thing? K.P. Gill's answer to What are 20 things that are not worth it? ",

You can be just as depressed being rich as you can being poor.Brand Name Items - The newest Iphone, the newest perfume and the newest sports car won\u2019t make your life better\u2026 especially not for the ridiculous price you pay.The News - Yes, the world is going down the drain\u2026 it does that every week, yet, for some reason, all the fear, horrible predictions and worry-some thoughts the news present rarely turn out that bad. So why stress over these things if they won\u2019t happen anyway?Big Houses - Why the hell do you need an 15-bedroom home with 6 living rooms if it\u2019s only you and your spouse? It\u2019s just more space to fill with items you don\u2019t need.Self-Improvement - No matter how much self help books or personal development articles you consume, if you do not use that information it won\u2019t do anything for you.Loot Boxes - The newest in video game gambling is taking everyone by storm. I mean, that skin for your gun may be rare, but is it really worth gambling away thousands of dollars just to get a virtual item to look different?College Degrees - If you know you need the degree to get your dream job, by all means, go for it. But otherwise you are spending over $30,000 on average just to get a piece of paper that is barely looked at\u2026 not to mention the years you spent on something you could have taught yourself in months.Motivation - Contrary to popular belief, you can actually get stuff done without being motivated to do it. Wow! I know, right?! Think about how much you could get done if you just did it and stopped relying on being motivated first? Wouldn\u2019t that be amazing?\u201cRelaxing\u201d - Yes, you do need a break every now and again. But a break doesn\u2019t mean \u201crelaxing\u201d from 15 minutes of work with a 6 hour break. If you really want to relax, turn your chair around, breathe deeply for a minute and then get back to work.New Year\u2019s Resolutions - Look, if you didn\u2019t do it last year, you won\u2019t fare much better this year. How about instead you make a resolution now for the remainder of the year? That way you will at least be able to say you tried.Celebrities - Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Lebron James, Taylor Swift, etc. What good does it do you to know what they are doing in their lives? That\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t!Others Opinions - Think about how much you remember the people you met yesterday\u2026 how about those you came across a week ago? Do you remember any of them? Guess what, those people don\u2019t remember you either, so you might as well be yourself!",
