            "answer_text": "In general, I've met a lot of average and not very intelligent asian people, but few really brilliant people. Are we talking about Asian Americans?  If yes, then chances are, these people were pushed to be driven and successful starting at a very young age.  This is likely because the parents who immigrated to America are all the high achievers who dreamed of a better future of opportunity for their kids.  They all had to work their asses off to get overseas.  Having high achievers raise kids to be high achievers starts a trend.  This developed sense of expectation leads to either high numbers (GPAs, test scores), or ambition in other forms.  This probably creates the illusion that 'asians are smarter\" but it is really a cultural difference in how we define our standards and what influenced those standards in the first place. In reality, I see them as any other people. Go to somewhere in Asia and you'll see your mix of intelligent and unintelligent people like you would anywhere else.  There are certain areas where there is a more highly concentrated population of high achieving asians, and it is possible that asians steal the spotlight because they are technically a 'minority' that competes with caucasians for jobs, status, and etc. We can go into theories of intelligence but that is another topic.  Point is, there are more hard working asian people who were influenced by others (most likely their parents), and thus they are seen as perhaps 'smarter.'  Culture really goes a long way.  For example, Koreans are really good at Starcraft because there is a culture over there revolving around it; it is a national sport.  Japanese are known for their anime/video game/tech accomplishments because there is a culture that generates a lot of passion and emphasis on those areas.    Likewise, Asian Americans who are successful overseas are where they are because they were raised on a culture revolving around hard work and success.  For the same reasons, other races are known to excel or be absorbed in other pursuits. I am kind of generalizing but so is this question. ",

(me slacker with BA). very typical in that group, which happened to be Eastern European. husband's family: great grands: literate: grands: business owners with high school and some college or night school. husband's generation: BA to PhD. happens to be Jews. my observation is that parents parent differently. some parents believe putting kids under pressure to succeed strengthens them and is the right thing to do. other cultures feel like too much pressure is a bad thing. atm, many Asian kids seem to be parented in such a way thato an outside success is very important. But it's a stereotype, and I can also think of an Asian family I know that does not pressure their kids, because they say the pressure almost killed them. who knows what is right for someone's family? you can look at statistics and see that Asian kids are doing well. but I'd like to hear some Asian voices on this. My son's used to say that \u201cB\" is a Jewish \u201cF\" (failing grade), but they said it jokingly. if they had worked hard, we didnt care about a B. Again, you cant tie success to ethnicity, because it leads to tying failure to ethnicity, and that is the road to hell. ",

Does \u201csmart\u201d mean being able to play an instrument well, paint well, play a sport well? I feel that there is some innate Asian culture at work here. The pressure to be number one. That if you are not number one, you are worthless. That education is the key to success. There is a reason why the suicide rate in Japan, Korea, and China are so high, especially the famous Japanese September 1 suicides, the sudden spike of suicide on the first day of school. Students are pressured, the ones that cannot keep up are left behind. There is no second of your day that is not studying, studying, studying. And it\u2019s not only studying. Parents pressure their children into playing instruments, sports, etc. And that sense of \u201cI am garbage if I\u2019m not number one\u201d also plays into hobbies such as gaming and other activities. So a desperation to be the best, borderline-abusive parents, and a cutthroat environment all bring Asians into success. That\u2019s my take on the topic based on research and personal experience. ",

In 1983 an American developmental psychologist Howard Gardener described 9 types of intelligence Naturalist (nature smart)Musical (sound smart)Logical-mathematical (number/reasoning smart)Existential (life smart)Interpersonal (people smart)Bodily-kinesthetic (body smart)Linguistic (word smart)Intra-personal (self smart)Spatial (picture smart)If you want to be stereotypical, Asians are bad drivers. This means they possess little to no spatial and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence at all. ",

            "answer_text": "The quoted claims contradict what we know from current, peer-reviewed psychological research in many ways. Here are two important ones: - Measured intelligence (via IQ tests, and assuming that these are valid to begin with) has increased continuously in many countries of the world over the past half century (see Flynn effect). If intelligence were determined entirely by genetics, measured intelligence should remain stable. This makes it clear that there is a significant social or environmental component to measured intelligence. - The correlation between brain size and intelligence is only .35. Brain size alone does not determine intelligence: Hunt, Earl; Carlson, Jerry (2007). \"Considerations relating to the study of group differences in intelligence\". Perspectives on Psychological Science 2 (2): 194\u2013213. It bears pointing out how difficult it is to make inferences based on ethnicity given that genetics and culture are often confounded. Moreover, diet is also intertwined with culture, and recent research has shown that the things we eat can change how our brains work. For example, eating yogurt affects your brain function (Changing gut bacteria through diet affects brain function, UCLA study shows). Given that eating yogurt can impact cognitive function, it's doubtful that something as complex as intelligence is solely determined by genetics. ",

I\u00b4ve never been to any Asian country but I do live in the city with the biggest amount of Japanese outside of Japan, S\u00e3o Paulo. We have a large chinese community here too. What I have observed is Asians are significantly less influenced by the full range of emotions white or black people are subject to. If this is good or bad, of if this is a case of repressed emotions due to cultural factors or simply genetic, it\u00b4s difficult to know. But when they are perfoming intellectual activities, it seems clear to me that emotions play a smaller role, and therefore they are better able to focus and perceive their own thinking processes, which ends up making a great difference in the long run. We must also bear in mind that although social pressure exists in every culture, in the western world (which could include Latam for this purpose) most people won\u00b4t feel rejected by their parents or have their honor damaged if they fail to join university or get a good position in a company. Asia has changed a lot but honor is still a critical thing in their culture, to the point some guys even end up seeing suicide as an option depending on the damage done to their reputation, which in turn largely dependent on their intellectual capabilities.

I haven't googled it, but including all other Asians to that figure should easily make over half the world population. With that many people it shouldn't be a surprise that many of the worlds \"smart\" people are Asian. It's simple numbers. \"Asians\" probably also have the largest share of \"non-smart\" people as well. Now if we ignore that question and you're asking about why Asian immigrants seem to be disproportionately successful, it comes down to biased immigration systems that favor lawyers, doctors, college educated etc immigrants over others. Asian immigrants tend to come from families that are disproportionately educated and successful compared to the average person in the immigrants own home country.  If the U.S. For example didn't have an immigration bias and gave equal access to all Asian immigrants regardless of education level, you'd most likely see a vastly different Asian American demographic that may not be as economically successful.

But Hong Kong does have the highest IQ on the planet, and I suppose it is more Chinese than European. Note that to recognize the inherent diversity of life is to be open to the fact that the nature of the kinds of talents found in different nations is that they are not all the same.  So in recognizing that Chinese tend to have a higher overall IQ than others means also to recognize that this is not uniform across all sub-scores: I think it is more pronounced in non-verbal than verbal intelligence.  There are many very talented Chinese lawyers in the world.  But I do not think it is a coincidence that the representation of this group in different fields is different from what would be expected based on factors beyond who their grandparents were...

The reason why Americans tend to think Asians are smarter is that the Asians who come to America tend to be among the smarter and harder working people where the come from.Another factor is that Asians are, in fact, much harder working and more self disciplined than most Americans and, thus, tend to have higher levels of achievement. As Americans equate achievement more with intelligence than hard work they come to the conclusion that Asians are more intelligent but, in reality, its because they work harder. ",

They also push us to learn. They do this by using guilt and threats of beatings (when it was still legal here then). They yell a lot too. No matter how well you did end up doing, they would ask you after getting straight As how on earth did you end up with a B+ in maths? We are not smarter. We just overcompensate and are really insecure. ",

In Chinese and English, the words for numbers 1 to 10 are unique and random and have to be learnt, but for Chinese number names from 11-19, they are based on systemic rules like \"ten-one\", \"ten-two\", \"ten-three\" etc.  In English, random names are given to \"eleven\" and \"twelve\" (tho there's some history behind it) and, for higher numbers, not all kids recognized that \"teen\" stands for \"ten\" and \"thir\" is \"three\". In even higher numbers,  \"ten\" becomes \"-ty\".  However, these studies also showed there was not a significant difference in overall learning of mathematics because it's also based on culture and context. As for how 'smart' one is, it depends on 1) what kind of smartness we are measuring eg. numbers-smart, book-smarts, street-smarts etc and 2) how accessible formal, institutional education is eg. big city, rural, immigrant, family life etc.  Im using specifically Ng and Rao's 2010 study \"Chinese number words, culture and mathematical learning\" and this article:http://m.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201312/language-measures-and-the-us-handicap-in-mat ",

You see, in East Asia, many cultures have Confucianism as part of their culture. What this means is that to Asians is that learning is one of the most important things in all of reality, and knowledge is power or will give you power, which is true. As such, Asians usually pressure their kids to do well in school to live successful lives. This academic pressure makes them give all their efforts into their School and Work, making the impression that we are smart. ",

They may do well on tests in schools, but if you talk to one on the street, you wouldn't be able to tell!  So, WHY doesn't their intelligence show if they do so well on academic tests? Some may appear shy because they may be quieter since they may not speak English very well, but if you can't tell that they are smart outside of the classroom... then they're just not smart. The answer is very clear!  If you can't PROVE that you're smart, then you're not smart!!!!!!!!!! ",

Of course there are cultural differences, but I'm guessing that the success comes from the genetic hybrid background. ",
