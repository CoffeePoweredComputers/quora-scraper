It is equally easy to come up with a list of things that are \u201cwrong\u201d only because the law prohibits them. Some things are both morally wrong and illegal. MurderArsonTheftSome things are morally wrong, but completely legal. AdulteryBeing mean to peopleLying to your parentsSome things are \u201cwrong\u201d only because they are prohibited by law.

            "answer_text": "No. Laws are put in place to maintain the current social structure. For example, in slavery there are laws governing the master and the slave. Most of those laws are bad/ immoral. Which brings us to a larger question. What is the definition of good and bad conduct or moral and immoral conduct? Here's mine: any act or inaction, in general, that maximizes the length and quality of human life is moral and act or inaction, in general, that makes human life shorter and/or less happy is immoral. You can apply this definition to your individual, family, community to come up with code of conduct that is, in general, good. ",
