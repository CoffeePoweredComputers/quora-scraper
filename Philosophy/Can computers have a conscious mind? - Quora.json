            "answer_text": "Can computers have a conscious mind? Never. Computers operating by the common binary-digital principles wouldn\u2019t ever have consciousness. There are different ways for showing this: The Chinese Room thought experiment. This experiment was conceived by John Searle in 1980. He showed in the experiment that for example, a human who utterly doesn\u2019t know the Chinese Language, can answer true and logical answers in Chinese just by using instructions of a computer program. In the same manner, a machine which looks like really understanding something by giving true answers, is merely simulating the ability to understand the questions and then answering them correctly. It can be found here: Chinese room - WikipediaThis is my own way of proving the same:The fundamental difference between the capabilities of humans and computers:Humans can form conceptual relations between 2 or more separate pieces of data. I assert that computers cannot form conceptual relations between 2 or more separate pieces of data. It can be shown in two consecutive manners. a. This is quite simple to understand. Suppose we see on a monitor the figure \u20185\u2019. A computer has manipulated certain commands and data and then delivered this figure onto the monitor. But I guess we agree that for the computer it\u2019s not really the figure 5 on the monitor. For the computer, it\u2019s just a certain array of ONs (1s) and OFFs (0s) found in its memory and which are projected onto the monitor in such a manner that it forms on it a specific shape which for the humans it means FIVE. For the computer, the shape on the monitor, is just a combination of pixels when each one of the pixels is either ON (lighting) or OFF (turned off) on the monitor at a specific location on it and nothing more. But for humans that specific shape signifies the figure FIVE as a whole concept with all its associated meanings. b. But now somebody might say that my original argument that \u201ccomputers cannot form conceptual relations between 2 or more pieces of data\u201d, is wrong. One might argue than computers use commands like IF//WHEN\u2026etc, which create relations between 2 or more pieces of data in the computers brains (CPUs). For this I would say that for computers, also commands like IF\u2026etc, are nothing more than arrays of 1s and 0s. There\u2019s not really any IF for the computers. What they have is the pre-stored pattern in their memory of the specific array of 1s and 0s, which is identical to the digital form (1s and 0s) of the compiled IF command. When these two patterns match each other, the computer delivers the data to the gate which processes the IF command digitally. It\u2019s not that the computers really grasp conceptually what the word IF means. 3. The prominent physicist Roger Penrose asserts and proves the same (that the human brain can't be a mere computational machine-like computers), in his book: Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness My own review on the book: This book is great feat of human logic. It gives in a logical analysis why the human brain can't be a mere computational machine-like computer. The author, Sir Roger Penrose, who is an acclaimed mathematical physicist, asserts on the basis of Godel's incompleteness theorems, that our brain's perception is beyond the constraints dictated by the theorems (which are true for the mathematics and the algorithms operating in computers). We wouldn't be able to grasp the mathematical concepts and to formalize new concepts if our brains and consciousness would be confined by those theorems' constraints. The author asserts that our brains operate by rules which require consideration of new Physics, particularly the Quantum Physics, in order to explain the rise of consciousness out of the brain. He gives practical examples by using AI (Artificial Intelligence) to show why brains can't be just some extended AI. Then he gives other practical examples from brain cells' basic structures to show how brains might use the mysterious principles of Quantum Physics to function and to having the abilities which surpass immensely the most advanced digital AI and that any digital AI wouldn't ever possess them in principle. The drawback of this book is that it contains extensive mathematical-philosophy discussions centered around Godel's incompleteness theorems, using many symbols in those discussions. The author himself advises most of the readers to omit such sections. But even besides it, IMO, the author's language is not always so friendly for the average reader in his explanations and conclusions about those discussions above. ",

            "answer_text": "Computers process information. Brains process meaning. Until we understand the difference, attempts to do conscious computing will be lacking. OTOH, there are current theories of mind which treat consciousness entirely as a collection of information processes. A computer programmed on the basis of these theories might convince itself and its programmer/architects that it was indeed conscious. In their frame of reference that might be true. Others could disagree. \u201cThe question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.\u201d \u2015 Edsger W.

But the reality of consciousness, as defined by the absents, of any one's ability to distinguish, any human being, and an artificial substitute, will be a reality. At that point, things get really scary. Consciousness things tent to have attitudes, they start making rules, then laws. I\u2019d say more, but the prime directive forbids it. ",
