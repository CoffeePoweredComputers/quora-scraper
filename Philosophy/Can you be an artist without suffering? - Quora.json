I will share that after the death of my spouse I was freed artistically and took great risks by displaying my artwork publicly which moved me forward in a huge way. My mom passed away just over a year ago and I did grieve and i do miss her but i am freer in some ways mostly socially to move forward. That suffering made me realize how much i have and moves me to give artistcally. i\u2019m happy to say more if you have questions ",
