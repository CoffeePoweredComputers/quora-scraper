            "answer_text": "For me you can say it was like a trip on something. But I had no drugs in my system at that time. My righteousness and knowlege lead me to enlightment. I had been experimenting with spiritual mushrooms long before this. But I have had so high dosage that the effect became permanent. So it lead me to around 1.5 year with hell. I saw alot of bad shit and I got voices to. Really bad ones. One day 1 year later I start to get demons. They haunt me all day and night for months. Until one day I have visions of wolfs. I were a wolf running around in the wood growling and howling. I woke up from this and then I see Fenrir wolf appearing fiercely. After this symbol and experience the demons got away. He scared them off me. Some time after I hit town with a friend drinking beer. On the way back home I tell him about a discovery in the cosmos which I had which made sense to the whole universe. It came out so good and beautiful that it is the best thing i've heard before and the best thing I ever said before. I had also theorised on singularity and got deep into the code and accomplished it in my mind. So I feel very good and accomplished at this moment. I go to town next day and I sit down a place with window spot so i look out. I begin to think again. Then I sense an appearence of bright light and im suddenly overwhelmed with it. Everything became light and bright I almost had trouble seeing. To then get the sensation of light inside me. I even say light plenty of times. To then have visions of my whole existence and get even with everything and I also saw the future me as successful. I sit there and feel the light for half an hour. I feel very very good now. Im the happiest man on the planet. I feel accomplished and completed now aswell. So I think this is it, pay of finally pay of. After years and years of despair I had led my righteousness into enlightment. The godly sensation lasts for a month or so. Strong to begin with and fading off slowly. But I still carry it and I consider myself a master of light now. It must be my righteousness and kindness and exeptional knowlege and wisdom that had led me to this. And alot of work and sacrifice. I feel like im blessed now as some sort of wizard. I am noble now. Guided by spirits into enlightment. Ended with a touch of godness. I don't glorify anything. It is true. I will from now on sacrifice myself for goodness. That makes me accomplished. I am a soldier of fortune now. The lightbringer. I will continue to lay my deed and justice upon this world to make it whole and counquer all evil.      ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Is spiritual enlightenment similar to psychedelic trips? - \"Vaccha, if you answer thus: 'The recluse Gotama has the threefold true knowledge,' you will be saying what has been said by me and will not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact. You will explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from your assertion.\"For in so far as I wish, I recollect my manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births,\u2026 a hundred births, \u2026 a hundred thousand births, \u2026 And in so far as I wish, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the+ human, I see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus: 'These worthy being as who are ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy being as who are well-conducted in body, speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.' And by realizing for myself with direct knowledge, I here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.From Majjhima Nikaya 71:5-10 (Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta \u2013 The Threefold True Knowledge) - -According to Theravada Buddhism, Gautama Buddha had knowledge of previous lives of other people and himself after cleaning of so-called dirt of mind (covetousness, ill will and anger, sloth and drowsiness, restlessness and anxiety, restlessness and anxiety, etc). And then he analyzed those lives and finally he got conclusion as the Four Noble Truths. -If a person can have such knowledge and get conclusion from psychedelic trips, one can said that spiritual enlightenment of Theravada Buddhism is similar to psychedelic trips. If not, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 - Reference \u2026\u2026\u2026.. Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger. Abandoning sloth and drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness and anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty........... With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion. He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind................ With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details,................ With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees \u2014 by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human \u2014 beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings \u2014 who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views \u2014 with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings \u2014 who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views \u2014 with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus \u2014 by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human \u2014 he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.............. With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'From The Fruits of the Contemplative Life ",
