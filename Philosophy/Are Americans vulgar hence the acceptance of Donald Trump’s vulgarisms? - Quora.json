            "answer_text": "No. Americans in general are ignorant and stupid as evidenced by their electing Trump to represent them. Americans are even unable to remove Trump now that he has proven himself beyond any doubt to be a moron of the highest degree Trump is different. He is also ignorant and stupid, but he is also self serving, malicious, egotistical, machiavellian, and a consistent liar. Having been given the worlds best job he repays the American people by cheating, stealing, lying, bribing, being bribed, and generally embarassing himself and the US on every international stage. Every time. Perhaps you are right and perhaps the reason the American people accept Donald\u2019s vulgarity because they are also vulgar, but I would not tarnish the American people by suggesting that there is any similarity between them and the trump. Electing Donald was really stupid but americans in general are nice people unlike Donald who will surely be remembered as the biggest mistake committed by any nation in modern times. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say everywhere in the world there are vulgar people. Trump is a populist. Therefore, he will not attract the intelligencia, the sophisticated crowds, or the professional suburban. If you go to Itali, France, Spain, or Germany, to the factories or to small rural towns, you will find as many vulgar and unsophisticated people as in the US. IN FACT, THE NEXT TIME YOU WATCH football (soccer) watch the audiences and look for sophistication. ",
