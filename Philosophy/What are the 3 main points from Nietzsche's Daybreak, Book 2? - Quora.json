            "answer_text": "When you say three main points of book II of The Dawn, it sounds that there are separate distinctions between Book I, II, III, VI, and V, which is misleading and inconsistent full stop. In The Dawn, wrote, \u201cWith this book I open my campaign against morality\u201d. and, just as in the case of the books written in his prime\u2014we cannot fail to be impressed in this work by Nietzsche\u2019s deep psychological insight, the insight that showed him to be a powerful judge of men and things unequalled in the 19th century, or perhaps, any other century. One example of this is seen in his searching analysis of the first Christian, Paul [Aphorism 68], in which the soul of this \u201cfirst Christian\u201d is ruthlessly and realistically laid bare to us. Nietzsche\u2019s summing-up of the founder of Christianity\u2014for of course, as is now generally recognized, it was Paul, and not Christ, who founded the Christian Church, and who in Nietzsche pen of of Aphorism 68, characterize as, \u201cone of the most ambitious and obtrusive of souls, of a head as superstitious as it was crafty\u201d\u2014has not yet called for those bitter attacks from theologians that might have been expected, though one reason for this apparent neglect is no doubt that the portrait is so true, and in these circumstance, silence is certainly golden on the part of the defenders of the faith, who are otherwise, as a rule, loquacious enough. No has the taunt in Aphorism 84 elicited an answer from the quarter whither it was directed; and the \u201cfree\u201d (not to say dishonest) interpretation of the Bible by Christians scholars and theologians, which is still proceeding merrily, is now being turned to Nietzsche\u2019s own writings. All these may , however, be trifling matters in comparison with the substance of The Dawn, and they may be of more interest to philologists and psychologists. It is for psychologists that this book was written; and such minds, somewhat rare in our time, may read in it with much profit. I conclude, again, from Aphorism 68, \u201cWithout this strange story (Nietzsche is referring to Paul), however, without the confusions and storms of such a head, such a soul, there would be no Christianity; we should scarcely have heard of a small Jewish sect whose master died on the cross. Of course, if this story had been understood in time; if Paul\u2019s writings had been read not ads revelations of the \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d but with an honest and free spirit of one\u2019s own, and without at the same time thinking of all our personal troubles, if they had really been read\u2014and for a millennium and a half there were no such readers\u2014then Christianity would have been done for long ago: so much do these pages of the Jewish Pascal expose the origin of Christianity, just as the pages of the French Pascal expose its destiny and that of which it will perish.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Since haven\u2019t read the book, I provide an online review of the entire volume, in the hope that you can tell what he writes in Book 2: \u201cDaybreak - Review Nietzsche attempts to re-evaluate all values for the first time. Daybreak is Nietzsche\u2019s first \u201creal\u201d book, where Nietzsche settles on a unique style of writing. He no longer writes essays, ordering his thoughts on a line, but peppers the whole book with aphorisms. It may frustrate the reader who is new to Nietzsche since he won\u2019t find any main thesis. Instead, Nietzsche puts together his ideas into a web, helping you connect more ideas together to create a range of thought with more dimensions. Yet there is a main spirit in Daybreak. Nietzsche explores human moral life in new ways; he opts out old ideas of the soul, free will, and categorical imperatives for naturalistic explanations of the body, climate, diet, and the instincts. He does not show any crude materialism, as you might think, but deals with subtle and spiritual things. The human species is dynamic, constantly changing throughout the ages, as does all nature. Nietzsche rejects the dichotomy between \u201cmatter\u201d and \u201cspirit\u201d present since at least Plato\u2019s time; instead, the \u201clower\u201d world of the body and the land creates the \u201chigher\u201d world of the mind, art, and culture. ut what is most important is this; Nietzsche wishes to open a new chapter in human history by \u201creevaluating all values\u201d as he might later put it, and he takes his first steps in Daybreak. Nietzsche is no nihilist; if anything, he is excited and hopeful. He goes on a new adventure and invites you to join him. I certainly had fun reading Daybreak, though it was a hard book to read, because I learned many new ways of looking at the world. Moral History Nietzsche spins a yarn of human history to explore how morals came about. Nietzsche is fond of writing this kind of speculative history, where he writes a fairy tale of sorts to describe some deeper process unfolding through the ages. He did in the tale of Greek Tragedy and he will do it again in the tale of Master and Slave morals. I am not fond of this kind of history, and maybe you are not either, but remember! Ancient humans told their history in myths and parables, and judging by Nietzsche\u2019s approach, we still think of our history this way, whether we like it or not. Nietzsche posits that primitive humans developed habits and customs depending on the best way to live off the land. Morals came about in this way. We may roll our eyes; such a theory is typical today, but Nietzsche takes us through a few twists and turns. There is more to this story, since morals greatly evolved alongside the humans they came from. Early humans based their morals on community and tradition - what everybody else did before them - and anyone who rejected that tradition was evil. Then, something radical happened: Socrates and Christianity. Socrates determined morals by using logic and a set of universal principles meant to improve the individual. If a custom or tradition was wrong - well, it was wrong, no matter how sacred. Early Christians jettisoned the old Roman and Jewish traditions of their ancestors. Instead, they devoted their time to saving their souls [1]. Ancient Athens condemned Socrates a corrupter of youth and the Ancient Romans saw the early Christians as evil. I find it ironic how, two thousand years later, Christians base so much of their morals on communities and traditions that have little to the with Gospel. And now they condemn rebels as evil, as they were once rebels themselves. American conservative Christians are easy to pick on; their morals come from a sense of national identity that often has a deep racial history. Using the Bible to condemn abortion or gay marriage is the afterthought. Well, what about life today? Nietzsche takes several issues with modern morals. In general, he seems to regard them as stale and causing a malaise in the mind of Europe\u2019s people. Yes, you can easily point to how Nietzsche blames Christianity for giving us a \u201cbad conscience\u201d, which he does. But he describes how great Christians developed more subtle and profound morals. For example, the French thinkers of the Enlightenment refined their character, thought, and manners to create a sublime culture [2]. Spirit From Matter [SPIRIT CANNOT COME FROM MATTER!] Sigmund Freud was famous for describing how human thoughts and actions, even our loftiest aspects, come from a dark subconscious world of primitive passions. He was not the first. Nietzsche did it before Freud and Schopenhauer did it before Nietzsche. The word (or leitmotif) Nietzsche uses throughout the book is arriere pensee, or hidden thoughts. Even beyond our instincts, our volition determines what we think and see, and just as important, what we do not think and see [3]. We do not really know what we want. His most striking writings concern kindness, self sacrifice, and human rights. At first, great nobles feigned kindness and honesty as a tactic; it gave them more safety and increased their power by gaining allies. Yet over time, hypocrisy slowly transformed into genuine kindness [4]. On the other end, a disciple who eagerly immolates and sacrifices himself for his god is far from humble. He gains a euphoric feeling of power and becomes exalted by being associated with his god [5]. The ideas of duty and rights we revere today were created when people of greater power and rank formed a relationship with people of lesser power [6]. Nietzsche diagnoses the illness of the soul much like a doctor diagnoses an illness of the body. He examines a person to find cancerous thoughts and emotions lurking beneath the reasoned arguments, and beyond that, Nietzsche traces the cancer\u2019s origin in the body and environment. And much like a doctor, Nietzsche advises small steady doses for even the worst of illnesses; a change in diet, habit, and exercise [7]. If we have illnesses, and most of us do, fear not. Nietzsche rejects the belief in a soul, and with it the belief that people are \u201ccomplete and perfect facts\u201d, that we have one essential thing that defines us and that we can never change. Instead, Nietzsche describes our minds like gardens, full of different kinds of growing plants. We have some control as gardeners, and we are even responsible in cultivating our feelings and impulses. And we must change, as a snake sheds its skin. If we do not grow and learn new things, if we do not change our minds, we cease to have minds [8]. In general, we have some grasp of our different powers: our talents, our skills, our knowledge, our health, and so on. But we do not know our full capabilities. Our environment is so important, Nietzsche says, because it can conceal, weaken, or develop out powers. Nietzsche urges us to study our environment very carefully, which includes everything I mentioned above from circumstances to the land to diet, so we can cultivate our powers to reach the greatest possible heights [9]. What is Feminine Nietzsche has relations with women and the female gender role that are - complicated. The stereotypical Nietzsche fan is quick to shun women and all that is feminine, but Nietzsche thinks differently. As early humans became more \u201cfeminine\u201d, such as becoming more beautiful, frail, timid, sensitive, and discerning, they also became more intelligent and civilized [10]. I find Nietzsche very striking at this point because he subverts assumptions we hold to this day. Even now, we see building civilization as something \u201cmasculine\u201d, a task accomplished by Mr. Fix-It and Bob the Builder. We imagine the beginning of civilization as a big manly thing, where a king whips slaves into building a monument. Even liberal minded people, who do not like to put men above women, assume men rule over culture and women rule over nature. But Nietzsche paints a different and more arresting picture. And Nietzsche even questions gender itself in the first page, describing it as transient as morals. I paraphrase; when we gave a sex to all things, we thought not we were playing but believed we gained a profound insight. Only later did we admit, just a bit, that we made a huge error. We gave a moral character to everything in the world in the same way. One day, declaring something good or evil will be as relevant as describing the sun as male or female [11]. Our Limits Late in Daybreak, Nietzsche arrives at the end of the world. He reaches the limits of human intellect and even of truth itself. These ideas are difficult for us to hear, since our advancing science and technology tends to make us optimists. Indeed, we assume no knowledge is beyond us. Sooner or later, if only we try hard enough, our leading physicists will discover the Theory of Everything and we will find a way to travel faster than light. But our limits to knowledge are deeper than whether we can make spaceships. Humankind has a limit. Language itself is a problem. It helps us create all sorts of new ideas, yes, but words box our thoughts into the discreet concepts. Our thinking only goes as far as our language lets us. And when we do discover something, when we wish to expand our language, we have to deal with all the old state concepts our language has, concepts that prevent us from thinking in new ways [12]. What is logic but a word game? Is truth itself just a word? As much as we think we like science, we have a problematic relation to it, and it has a lot to do with old habits in how we think of ourselves. Long ago, we assumed ourselves to be the highest creature on earth; nature\u2019s final goal was to create us. We assumed nature existed to serve us and all the knowledge we could find would only benefit us. To this day, we seek answers with science to solve our many problems from global warming to why we feel depressed. But science does not care about how we feel or what we feel entitled to, and people resent science for that fact. Many people who claim to love science treat it lightly and would hate science if it ever saw through them [13]. Knowledge can also be dangerous and harmful to us. Learning something new is not always a good thing, as Oedipus shows us. Nietzsche expresses this idea most clearly in his famous Don Juan aphorism. What is our destiny, a people who put the pursuit of knowledge above everything else? We will seek all knowledge, no matter how trifling, until we become so bored we seek knowledge that will hurt us. We will yearn for \u201chell\u201d, a final terrible answer, but we will not find it, and will forever be frustrated [14]. How can we overcome our morals and limits in knowledge? Nietzsche has a couple of ideas, but we need to take small doses to get such a radical change in values. The change may be so slow we may not even realize it when we get there. There is no fast and easy way; \u201cgreat revolutions\u201d are a farce caused by malicious and impatient political invalids [15]. Let us slowly supplant moral feelings and judgments, Nietzsche says. Let us follow the duties imposed by reason, and re-establish the laws of life. Maybe we can borrow the foundation stones for new ideals yet to be born. Let us then rule ourselves as if lords of an estate, our small experimental state [16]. Nietzsche ends Daybreak with his most uplifting prose. As birds fly to the horizon, we may fly as far as we possibly can to realize our potential, but even the greatest of us will find a perch. Our greatest ancestors did the same. Yet new birds will fly farther, far above our heads and our failures. Where are we all flying? We do not know [17]. Work cited: 1. Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm.

FROM WIKIPEDIA: The Dawn of Day or Dawn or Daybreak (German: Morgenr\u00f6te \u2013 Gedanken \u00fcber die moralischen Vorurteile; historical orthography: Morgenr\u00f6the \u2013 Gedanken \u00fcber die moralischen Vorurtheile; English: The Dawn of Day/ Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality) is an 1881 book by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The Nietzsche scholar Keith Ansell-Pearson writes that Dawn is the least studied of all of Nietzsche's works. Themes Nietzsche de-emphasizes the role of hedonism as a motivator and accentuates the role of a \"feeling of power.\" His relativism, both moral and cultural, and his critique of Christianity also reaches greater maturity. In Daybreak Nietzsche devoted a lengthy passage to his criticism of Christian biblical exegesis, including its arbitrary interpretation of objects and images in the Old Testament as prefigurements of Christ's crucifixion. The polemical, antagonistic and informal style of this aphoristic book\u2014when compared to Nietzsche's later treatments of morality\u2014seems most of all to invite a particular experience. In this text Nietzsche was either not effective at, or not concerned with, persuading his readers to accept any specific point of view. Yet the discerning reader can note here the prefigurations of many of the ideas more fully developed in his later books. For example, the materialism espoused in this book might seem reducible to a naive scientific objectivism which reduces all phenomena to their natural, mechanical causes. Yet that is very straightforwardly not Nietzsche's strongest perspective, perhaps traditionally most well-expressed in The Gay Science.\u201d The Dawn of Day - Wikipedia ",
