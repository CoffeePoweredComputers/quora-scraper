            "answer_text": "One doesn\u2019t really have that much to do with the other. If competence bred confidence, competent people would never feel insecure. But read a few interviews about whoever you think is confident and you will very quickly realize that they too are insecure from time to time. Does confidence breed competence then? Well sort of, but perhaps not in the way that most people think. A lack of confidence is the result of too much thinking. It\u2019s about focusing on ourselves rather than the task at hand. This is why so many people mix up experience with confidence, because in the beginning of doing something, we have a ton of thinking about it. Am I doing this right? What if I fail? What am I missing? How can I get better? What if I get hurt or disappointed? Instead of naturally and instinctively immersing ourselves with what we are doing (which is the most effective way to learn), we are up in our heads trying to think our way through something that isn\u2019t intellectual in nature. As a result, we second guess ourselves more, we are stiff instead of relaxed and loose, and ultimately we learn more slowly, because we are resisting what is happening the entire time. As we get more experience, our worries, fears and excess thoughts tend to way, and what they reveal is a spacious peace that blurs the boundary between the doer and the doing. This peaceful, spacious feeling is what most people equate with confidence. This space opens up when we stop overthinking and over-trying. Said another way, when we stop resisting and worrying about the outcome and just get on with it. Perhaps you think this means experience is a prerequisite to confidence. That, in my experience, is not the case. Experience does not need to precede confidence. Confidence isn\u2019t something that is created or acquired, but rather something that is uncovered. Confidence is our default state. It\u2019s underneath all our excess thinking, analyzing, strategizing and worrying. It\u2019s always there, we just have the ability to cover it up with our thinking. The more you can relax into what you are doing regardless of what is going on in your head, the quicker you will rediscover that spacious feeling (confidence) and the more effectively you will learn. How do you relax? Stop worrying about how you feel. Stop trying to figure out how it\u2019s all going to play out. All of life is a game. Just play. ",

Think of sporting endeavors that are potentially dangerous like NASCAR racing or skydiving. # 3 people hold themselves back and don\u2019t contribute as much as they could. # 4 people have positive impacts. Remember also that confidence is a state. Some people set rules for themselves like, I have to do so many times before I can feel confident rather than being able to access the state (resource ability) beforehand. If you are already confident you are likely to be more effective. ",
