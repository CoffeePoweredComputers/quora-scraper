            "answer_text": "\"Hell\" is a western concept, and the Eastern equivalents don't translate as easily as a dictionary might imply. And Eastern thought rarely lets you give yes-or-no answers to any question. Western \"hell\" is eternal. You never escape from it, until the end of the world (if then). Buddha could not have been in that kind of Hell.  The Buddhist Naraka is sometimes translated as \"Hell\", but in one crucial dimension it's closer to Purgatory (a concept that doesn't really exist in non-Catholic denominations of Christianity). It's really a state below that of animals, plants, and ghosts (disembodied spirits). Its similarity to Hell is the rather graphic descriptions of torment given in some texts, which will be quite familiar.   Note the \"eye for an eye\" nature of the pairings, very Dante-esque. Did Guatama Siddhartha ever go there? I know of no story which says he did (disclaimer: my familiarity with the Sutras is in passing, not comprehensive, so take that with a grain of salt), but it could be justified either way. He's said to have lived many eons, to fulfill his karma, and it seems very reasonable that at least some of them would have been spent in every state. It's known that he spent time as an animal, and I see no reason why he wouldn't have been lower. After all, he needed to experience everything to obtain enlightenment.  He did, however, also suffer in life (according to some stories), so it's possible that some torments had eluded him. Further, there are stories which strongly suggest that Buddha was never completely human, or never merely human. But as the Dalai Lama said, \"Siddhartha's previous lives, many aeons. Sometimes as a human being, sometimes as an animal, but then gradually, using his practice, becoming more higher and higher, deeper, deeper.\" Personally, I'd say \"yes\" is the more likely answer. The Buddha is enlightened, not pristine. If he had been he'd have been enlightened in a previous life, rather than waiting for his incarnation as Guatama Siddhartha. ",
