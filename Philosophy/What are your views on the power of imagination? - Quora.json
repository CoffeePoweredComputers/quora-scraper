            "answer_text": "The purported \u201cpower of bland imagination\u201d is only a piece of wishful thinking. You can\u2019t push your imagination ahead without attending to its causality. \u201cImagination\u201d has five factors. \u201cIntuition\u201d and \u201cvolume of knowledge\u201d are the apparent ones. The other three, the latent and remoter ones, are \u201csolidarity of emotions\u201d, \u201csolidarity of knowledge\u201d and \u201cthe dream\u201d. \u201cIntuition\u201d is the faculty of visualization, i.e. the faculty of looking forward. However, it needs to be \u201cpowered\u201d, \u201cdirected\u201d and \u201cauthenticated\u201d. The power comes from consistency of existing cumulative emotions which has been referred to above as solidarity of emotions. The cumulative emotions are collectively known as the subconscious. So, solidarity of emotion could be also described as subconscious solidarity or subconscious stability. This empowers intuition. What directs (gives the right direction to) intuition is a special spiritual proclivity called \u201cdreaming spirituality\u201d or simply, \u201cdream\u201d. This is a psycho-intellectual proclivity that is begotten of visualization and acknowledgement of the \u201cuniversal twin goals\u201d. These are the mutually-corroborative two universal goals, the first one being \u201cphysical evolution\u201d/ \u201cmacro-evolution\u201d and the second one, \u201csubjective happiness\u201d/ evolutionary happiness. Intuition finds its right direction under the inspirational traction of the dreaming spirituality. The dream also consolidates the individual emotions and the subconscious as a whole. Knowledge is derived from perceptional memories coming from direct perceptions such as geographical and social interactions or indirect perceptions such as studies, cultural wisdom etc. \u201cSelf-confidence\u201d and \u201cveracity\u201d gives it solidarity. Dream plays the great role of invigorating the neural activities by instilling confidence into the perceptions on one hand and of invigorating the intellectual process by instilling epistemic veracity into the intellectual products viz. ideas and inferences. \u201cPerceptional self-confidence\u201d and \u201cepistemic veracity\u201d bring about the \u201cepistemic solidarity\u201d which has been taken as one of the factors. Imagination becomes maximal in volume and optimal in quality when these five factors are taken care of. ",
