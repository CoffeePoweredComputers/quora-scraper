            "answer_text": "are we a simulation? nope, i dont think reality can be simulated at all. its a backward thinking. we invented simulation and then apply this concept to us. imo, reality creates rather than simulates. the quantum world is not a simple binary of \u201cto be or not to be\u201d. i guess this is where you get the idea of virtual simulation. that a quantum particle , as it pops in and out of existance from the vacuum must be oscillating as a binary system of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s. but this isnt case. it\u2019s more like the oscillation is from ( + ) and ( - ). and +1 -1 = 0. so as far as the energy of the system is concern, they all add up to zero, this is due to conservation of energy. contrary to popular beilef that everything is made up of energy, this isnt exactly true because energy is not a thing. its just the ability to do work. a measure of motion. it doesnt do antything, it is the doing. an equilibrium cannot do anything, but if you split it say into two parts, a positvie pressure and a negative presure, they will both do work . one can push and the other can suck . but if you put them back again together, they will just cancel out and have a net zero energy again. another thing,, a quantum of particle can also be very dense. and can decay or split into two but less dense particles. this is how particles multiply. 1 = 1 x 1. its like the division of cells, a neutron decays into a proton and electron. in reverse two particles can also fuse into one. bec and bh are examples of convergence to unity. so why is the world built in these principles? i dont know. perhaps its the only principle would works to give rise to self organising structures, geometry and mathemtics. harmonic resonances, chaos giving rise to order. . unity and multiplicity. all rolll into one. its kinda cool.:) tnx james for the request.
