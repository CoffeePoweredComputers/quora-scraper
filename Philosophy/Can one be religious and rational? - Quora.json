I know many, many atheist people who are stupid, and by stupid I don't just mean they don't now much about the world, science, society and politics, I mean stupid as in no street smarts. I will go tell them to get me detergent from the supermarket, they'll bring me fucking dish washing soap. Know one know's someone true's intellectual and moral superior. its all about perception. As Del Da Funky Homosapien says in the popular song Clint Eastwood:  Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eyeYou perceive with your mind So to an atheist, a religious person will always be irrational, just as to a mouse a cat is ferocious monster. But in the common perspective, a religious person can definitely be rational on things like politics, economics, and culture, but religion, of course someone has to disagree. One religious person I look up to who seemed rational is Gregor Mendel, he was a devout Catholic but discovered the study of Genetics, another religious rational person is the famous poet Rabindranath Tagore, who believed simply in a singular deity but still was fascinated by science and the fundamental aspects of the universe and even had a conversation with the famous Albert Einstein:  And there are many other religious thinkers who respected scientific logic and never persecuted those who didn't believe in what they think. Rather they infused their life philosophy with scientists and prove evidence for God or some other entity through a common process rather than preaching shit about demons inside people and claiming to \"save them\" through reading scriptures which never enough evidence.  Tagore here rejected polytheistic and idol worshiping, but had faith there was a God out there somewhere, but to go further with it, he discussed such philosophical matters with brilliant minds like Einstein before jumping into conclusions, and that is what I think is a fine example of religious thinking and rational thinking working together.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Consider the descriptions for each of the major philosophers listed at Rationalism, all of whom were religious. The modern opposition between religion and \"being rational\" is an oversimplified social conflict arising from the conservative backlash of Protestantism, as it has developed, mostly in the United States, after beliefs about Biblical accounts being literally and historically true began to be controverted by discoveries made in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries as fields of the natural and other sciences--paleontology, geology, biology--that painted a very different picture about things about the world and the planet that had been long assumed to be true based on the Bible. That backlash grew out of Sola scriptura, a doctrine common to all Protestant denominations that scripture is one of the only requirements for a Christian to merit salvation, i.e. all you need do is read the Bible.  Historically, this likely arose as a move to reject all the \"expanded universe\" canonical writings made by the Catholic clergy in order to remove justification for their positions of clerical and divine authority.  The masses shouldn't be excluded for not paying enough gold to priests, who were all corrupt at the time anyway. Effectively, this seems to have resulted in later Protestants commonly reasoning that, if it's not in the Bible, and it says something contradicting the Bible, the Bible is right and screw that other crap. Yet, the silliness of such reasoning seems to have been lost on those literalist Protestants, especially if you:  look at that the dates when those rationalist Christian thinkers lived, consider how many of them continued to be both religious while rejecting literal interpretation of the Bible to the exclusion of anything else,and consider that all of them long pre-dated the birth of these Science vs. the Bible conflicts.Your perception that atheists would think that way is incorrect, and if your atheist friends do think that way, they have likely fallen under the whole \"Science (Rationality) is always opposed to Religion, and vice versa\" false conflict and are likewise incorrect. \"Rationalism\" really just refers in philosophy to the concept that knowledge can be acquired by using reason (and generally or only using reason).  Most of these religious (and very Christian, even Protestant) rationalists lived during the periods of the Renaissance and Enlightenment.  They argued and believed that reason was a gift given by God to all men, that it was intended to be used for such purpose, and that it was rather nonsensical that God would thus reserve divinity in defiance of human reason, effectively hiding it behind a shroud of mysticism.  Even from an atheist standpoint, if God actually exists, it wouldn't make sense that God would grant humans the faculty of reason if you are simultaneously supposed to distrust it so regularly or even at all. Reasoning by rationalist Christian thinkers in argument for religion and the existence of the Christian god generally proceeded by beginning with concepts that were ideally perfect, like mathematics, and using mathematical deduction and induction to do things like prove the existence of God must be also be true, i.e. because proofs in math are also true.  Even as far back as the time of the Catholic philosopher, St. Thomas Aquinas, who I believe is sufficiently \"rational\" in his reasoning and argumentation, you see rationalist reasoning making cases for the Christian god being the perfectly benevolent and omniscient|omnipotent being he is depicted as today. In case you're wondering why an atheist wouldn't buy such reasoning, that's a much longer group of different arguments, most of which probably occur to atheists at different times. Firstly, any conclusions arrived at purely via reason must always rely on axioms, that is base assumptions one must accept as true (perhaps as self-evidently true).  What this means is you aren't actually producing new knowledge, you're starting with things you already know, perhaps because they are obvious, and using correct and consistent reasoning to arrive at a necessary implication of those things you started with, a conclusion that may not in fact have been obvious at all.  Mathematical proofs and theorems are of this sort.  So rationalism serves to root out confusion in ones thinking. The other implication of this is that two people can both use logically correct reasoning to arrive at contradictory conclusions if they each begin with different assumptions.  As you can imagine, we see this a lot between atheists and theists.  You even see this between different theists.  This is probably about as desirable an outcome as one could hope to have between an atheist and a theist bent on discussing such matters: to be able to find each other's reasoning consistent and not-self-contradictory! Secondly, as other respondents have stated, rationalism alone is only a useful tool for \"gaining\" knowledge in certain subjects, such as mathematics.  Beyond a certain point, correct reasoning isn't capable of leading you to acquire new knowledge.  For that, you need observation.  More specifically, you need the ability to compare new observations against past observations.  You need the ability to make them repeatedly and independently of other observers.  This is Empiricism. This allows one to account for the possibility of false or erroneous testimony.  Even like in the Bible, false testimony can be a sticky problem.  By contrast, the Bible and much of Christianity relies fundamentally on testimony as the basic assumption by which one gains knowledge (you see remnants of this all over the linguistic \"archaeological\" record of Christianity's history--consider how often the words \"testify!\" and \"testimonial\" are used--consider that both books of the Bible are referred to as \"testaments\"--someone somewhere who is expected to be trustworthy has attested that such and such a thing they witnessed was true), and hence the severity of its prohibition against false testimony. Now, to be clear, it's philosophically okay to make an epistemological assumption that testimony is a perfectly acceptable basis by which one attains knowledge that something is true.  It is the case that false testimony is the enemy of ascertaining truth and knowledge.  Just be aware that any sensible critic of yours would immediately raise the objection of how patently unreliable testimony itself is, even in our modern age given the incentives and lack of consequences or enforcement against falsification of evidence or accounts, to say nothing of questionably \"historical\" events claimed to have occurred thousands of years ago by parties with stakes in the outcome. Going back, atheists are often so particularly fond of science because the scientific method systematically relies on both rationalism and empiricism in order to attain knowledge about the world everyone is forced to share.  The conclusions produced by it, while not being all-encompassing, lead to incrementally greater knowledge than previously had, about the physical world and universe we inhabit and all experience, and to the best of our collective ability, at least insofar as is logistically practical to do so, and at least insofar as when scientific method is practiced correctly. Scientific knowledge is a \"belief\" in the technical sense of the word as used in philosophy, but it's not a (just a) \"belief\" in the colloquial sense.  Science is about reality.  Scientists, religious or non-religious, don't \"believe\" something just because they choose to.  Scientists believe something because they should be unable to conclude otherwise after falsifying other explanations and validating against errors in data of observations, and following experiments that anyone should be capable of repeating given the same equipment and physical scenarios and following the same instructions in earnest. But yes, rationalism, by itself, isn't intrinsically opposed to religion.  In fact, much Christian doctrine has evolved to establish baseline axioms by which one can completely conclude all of Christianity's claims.  The other key epistemological axiom in Christian doctrine is that knowledge can be also be attained by revelation, i.e. that God, or any supernatural being (one that communicates from beyond any natural means of detection or interaction, outside the universe, for instance), speaks directly to a person, who is a believer.  An example of revelation would be God talking only to the Pope and his immediate subordinates in Catholicism.  Or God, or Jesus, speaking directly to Protestant worshipers.  Or Allah speaking directly to Muhammad.  Or Cthulhu speaking directly to his cultists.  Or the Flying Spaghetti Monster speaking directly to that 14-year old. Obviously, revelation carries its own host of problems, namely how in the hell one distinguishes a true prophet or revelation from just any other crackpot hearing voices in their head and making wild claims.  (I believe this is addressed in some fashion in the Bible and Qur'an, but I suspect no atheist who's considered the argument finds it at all sufficient.)  Of course, I suppose that's what the value of true testimony is for. ",

Humans can try, but we are all emotional creatures that view the world from our subjective eyes and brain and has probably been raised with a bias.Some are better at tryringto be rational and objective....some are worse. I haven't seen much that indicates that religious people are better or worse at trying to be rational, compared to their non religious peers. But the the word here is 'their peers'.The ability to try hard to be rational, has much more to do with culture and education, than with religion. Among my peers a quarter is religious, a quarter is atheists and the rest don't care enough to choose a standpoint. Their abilitty to rationalise is the same. It works sometimes, but as we are human it dosen't work always. The ability for people who haven't been raised in a culture that favours being rational, or haven't had training in trying to think rational, it is a whole other matter.I don't know many of that kind of people, but I'd assume that those who are most rational are those that can set aside a written rule of any religion and do what is best in the situation.But that might not make them unreligious, they are just not being regid but trying to reason their way through life.

            "answer_text": "I'm going to curry the anger of those who embrace the Rodney King school of philosophy, the \"Can't we all just get along?\" crowd, and say \"No, not on the topic of religion.\" I'm going to say that not because I don't want to get along. I do. And those who really believe Rodney King articulated the key to world peace are certainly free to apply their own philosophy and \"...just get along\" by agreeing with me. Here's Why I Call Theists Irrational Regarding Religion There are some very intelligent, well educated theists in this world. They may be rational about just about everything they do and reject nearly all extraordinary claims made without any verifiable supporting evidence. But the claim most theists do accept about the existence of a supernatural, omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent creator god or gods; coupled with the notion that this being cares about humans and routinely intervenes in cause and effect; and that this being has a very exacting list of things we must always do and others we must never do lest we be at risk of eternal torture instead of eternal pleasure -- that is about as extraordinary a claim as it's possible to make -- and they accept it without any falsifiable evidence that any of it is true. To make matters worse, if this god is truly a loving god, and god's list of thou-shalt-nots is so vital, why wouldn't an omnipotent, omniscient deity make absolutely certain that every human being knew god's nature and will? But we find people believing wildly different things about god/s depending on the vagaries of the birth lottery, not rational thought in most cases. Here's a video that sums up the irrationality of it.  Clearly if there is a god, almost every human being is wrong about which of man's thousands of claimed deities is actually the One. At best, only a tiny handful of all the humans who have lived since humanity evolved have lucked out and worshiped the right god/s, and it gets even worse when worshipers of any one of the thousands of deities man has proposed can't agree on what their deity actually wants of them. To claim that all this is the plan of a supernatural, omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent creator god or gods is exceedingly irrational when that claim has no falsifiable proof to back it up. ",

As a preliminary point, just to be thorough about it, a homicide detective can be entirely rational in his approach and yet identify Polanski as the perpetrator when in fact Harper did the deed. The point, of course, is that rationality does not rule out error. To answer this first question, then, yes, in principle a person can take the rational approach, get caught up in error, and remain religious. But that is far more likely if he (let\u2019s say) is ignorant and hence proceeds from false premises, or bad at logic and hence draws invalid inferences (\u201cThe flowers are so pretty, so God must exist!\u201d). But perhaps you have the following in mind: Can a person pursue the rational approach to the end and yet remain religious? It depends on what you mean by \u201cto the end,\u201d and on the religion in question. If you mean to the point at which the truth of the matter is firmly established, then of course he can pursue the rational approach to the end and yet remain religious only if his religion is true\u2014that is, only if the core tenets represent the truth. But this means the objective truth, for there is no other variety. If such-and-such is not true objectively then it does not represent reality, and if it does not represent reality, then it is not true at all. Note that if he resorts to faith in the religious sense (\u201cI\u2019m going to forget all the controversy and just believe it!\u201d) then he has abandoned the rational approach, which violates the conditions. To resort to faith is not to pursue the rational approach. On the contrary, it is to refuse to pursue it. In my opinion, in the final analysis, a religion that essentially posits the supernatural (\u201cA supreme supernatural being created the natural physical world,\u201d for example) simply fails to make a jot of sense. It is just a load of gibberish. But if that is so, then the rational approach eventually washes up at that conclusion, in which case it is necessary to abandon the religion, or else rationality. In the end, however, I think that the question you have in mind is best put in terms of society as opposed to the individual, as follows, for example: In the long run, across many generations into the future, will rationality leave room for religion? I do not think so. Religion has been on the way out for centuries, and it will continue on its way out, barring a global catastrophe that leaves the few miserable survivors desperate and in need of reassurance. That is because it does not represent reality, but merely virtual reality, or in other words, imagination. ",

They simply don't apply rationality to their beliefs. No wonder, if they did consequently, they would very likely have to turn atheist. Noone is purely rational or purely religious. Atheists can be pretty gullible, too, and have irrational beliefs apart from gods. We all change from rational to irrational and back all the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. Many believers are completely rational . . . except for the irrational things they believe. Tops on the list of irrational things to believe in are impossible things. If you really believe in resurrection after 3 days of death, you're being irrational. If you really believe in virgin conception, you're being irrational. If you really believe in curing blindness by divine will, you're being irrational. If you believe in Biblical creation, you're being irrational. Next on the list of irrational things to believe in are things without objective reason (evidence, proof, or anything else factual) for belief. This includes unicorns, leprechauns, martians, Santa Claus, and (you knew it was coming) God. This doesn't mean that these things can't exist, it just means you have no objective reason to suppose (much less, believe) they do in the first place. Next on the list of irrational things to believe are fallacies. If you think morality is a dispensation from God or that believers are more moral than disbelievers, you're being irrational. If you believe that the Old Testament God represents the epitome of morality, you're being irrational. If you believe you're going to heaven, you're being irrational. If you believe God answers your prayers, you're being irrational. So yeah, believers, like non-believers, are often rational . . . except when they're not. ",

A rational person supports a position by explaining how through a chain of logical steps he can deduce that position from one or more premises. However, a rational argument does not necessarily result in a true position. If the premise of the chain of logic is false, then the resulting position will also be false.  Many church intellectuals have been exceptionally good at devising rational argument. Where I disagree, it is normally with their premises, not their rational arguments. ",

Now, mind you, I'm an atheist, but that doesn't mean I don't respect good intellect even though well-thought-out conclusions may differ from mine. True intelligence allows for disagreement, conceives of alternate possibilities to those it embraces. So very much has been written about every nuance of Christianity (for instance, but by far, not the only example) and somehow, much of this learned wellspring is completely unnoticed by modern theorist. Every point, made by bible thumper or atheist, or fence sitter, has been eloquently pondered and discussed. Not just in affirmation, but it genuine discussion as to the workings of the world. We may disagree, more and more of us, now in the current day, but none of that belittles the serious and cogent thoughts of many, some arguably smarter than ourselves. To be clear, I am not abdicating... I do not believe they were right; but I believe their judgments are well worth pondering as we all, in our ways, examine the reason and import of our existences.

            "answer_text": "No, you can\u2019t. This is because being human is to be irrational about at least some things and at least occationally. We are evolutionary wired to see intentions and faces in nature and to have taboos and beliefs. Being a little less rational than it is possible to be might correlate with being superstitious, spiritual or even religious. But as we all know, correlations often describe differences which only show with large data and the effect sizes can be surprisingly low. The rationality of theists and sceptics have been studied. Both groups have individuals high on rationality scale and individuals low as well. There is no guarantee that a certain philosophical view will make a person be totally rational. For example time pressure may make a person not exercise their skill of inhibiting naturally occuring irrational thoughts.[1] In my opinion, there is a certain type of religious or metaphysical thinking style which is connected with being overly rational and using deduction with constructing belief systems. For example, if you have a personal experience which does not have a natural explanation, you may deduce that there is a higher probability for supernatural things. There are also people who are rational and do not fall for any scams, frauds or smoke (which is certainly irrational behavior) but who are open to thoughts about religious ideas and choose to believe in God as a way of reducing anxiety or to belong to a group. Is it rational? I think it is, in a way. I know many theists who are really irrational and incoherent in their thinking and they are often people with lower education and no interest in critical thinking. But irrationality is found in other groups as well and we are all less than perfect. Footnotes[1] Redirect Notice",

The religious people and the so called rationalists, both may have rational and instinctual aspects. All kinds of human beings may think automatically (without much deliberation) and socially (follow their peers). Moreover, People think with the help of mental models of reality. Some of these mental models need not be grounded in actual reality. However for those who hold these mental models, there is a logical consistency and some empirical validity. Let me take a crude example. Many believe that the God would become kinder to those who worship Him a lot. There is logic and some empirical evidence here. There are powerful people in the world who become kinder to those who worship them. God is powerful, so He should be like these people. They may note that some who worship God a lot are `happier\u2019. They may neglect counter evidence or information and that is also common among human beings. Another reason for the religious belief is the increasing vulnerability of people. This vulnerability is different from poverty. People who are in poor perennially need not be that vulnerable. When they get out of poverty due to economic growth, vulnerability may increase. Then people may take several strategies to minimize this vulnerability. Following religious rituals could be part of these efforts. ",

That said any belief, even irrational, is better than none, and so gods were useful explanations. Complex religious belief systems ten acted as proto rational belief systems and trained people in all sorts of skills including literacy which were te preserve of the clerics. Best wishes :) ",

I'm sure that most of the non-narcissistic rational thinkers would do the same. As Margaret Weiss said here is the proof that Being Religious and Being Rational is not mutually exclusive. To answer your question, it all depends upon how religious one is. I'm religious, but i'm rational enough to take the good parts (like karma) and leave behind the attached strings. When i'm about to do something really bad, my religious senses stop me (even if it is rational) but when i'm about to do something good, my rational senses make me do it even if there is some collateral to the religion.

Without telos you can't have true rational deliberation or intentionality, rather than random deciding on actions. Second, our most famous scientists have been Christian or deists.  Calling them irrational is highly questionable.  They knew the scientific method. Third, the limits of science in terms of finding God are significant.  Science isn't the only knowledge method in town.  And to assume it is is to roll back the clock on survival, education,  and progress.  That would be the height of irrationality. Here are other rational arguments:  Why I am a ChristianNathan Ketsdever's answer to Besides faith, what reasons do you have for believing or not believing in a higher power?",
