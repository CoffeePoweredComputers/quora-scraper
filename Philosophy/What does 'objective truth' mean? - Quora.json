            "answer_text": "Nothing can be true except objectively. Anything else is either an opinion, a perception, a preference, a philosophy, a value, a guess, a hope, a belief, an error, a delusion, or a lie. All of these are subjective. One big problem with philosophical questions is that they produce philosophical answers\u2014which seemingly never seek the simple and practical answer that resolves the issue, but rather to identify and examine what kind of philosophers are involved in the discussion, and/or what kinds of philosophies are being used, and/or what kinds of philosophical errors are being made. Of course, this is starting out as one of those answers. But I'll get to the practical answer in a moment. First, how do you make an answer practical rather than scholarly-but-useless? Answer: By being specific. That is, instead of just speaking in terms of logical forms and logical models using such nondescript inputs such as anything, something, \u201ca thing,\u201d or \u201cno thing,\u201d use specific examples in our forms and models. This forces us to see whether our claims are valid. It also helps us, in this case, to realize what kinds of \u201cthings\u201d we are dealing with\u2014which cuts to the heart of the issue. This enables us to see whether our claims are valid. It also helps us, in this case, to realize the kinds of \u201cthings\u201d we\u2019re dealing with that can be true\u2014which cuts to the heart of the issue. You see, the only things that can be true (or false) are various kinds of predicative statements\u2014assertions about some aspects of reality. These can be called propositions, claims, confessions, accusations, assumptions, avowals, declarations, deductions, and so on. My point is, these all consist entirely of words, but are not just words that name things\u2014or nouns. Rather, they involve a subject and a verb. Too often on Quora people attribute truth or falsity to a single noun that, by itself, does not make a predicative statement. Or, they ask whether a noun is \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d For example, at any given moment, there is a debate ongoing on somewhere on Quora over whether \u201cevolution\u201d is true. Or \u201creligion.\u201d Or a specific religion (usually, \u201cChristianity\u201d). Or some other ism. But none of these can be \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d Each of these terms merely identifies a discipline, a broad theory, or a rationale or method that contains multiple claims and assumptions\u2014each of which may (and probably should) be evaluated for truthfulness separately. So, making statements such as \u201cEvolution is a fact\u201d (which I\u2019ve seen too many times) is utter nonsense. Or, \u201cReligion is false [or even true].\u201d Again, nonsense. Now, the statements themselves are assertions and are therefore either true or false. (Okay, if you say, \u201cEvolution happens,\u201d now you have a predicative statement\u2014one that is either true or false.) And the truthfulness or falsity of each statement is objective. (The two above are both false.) All we need to do to know that things true are objectively true, and that things false are objectively false, is to specify several statements about reality we know to be either true or false. Then, each ask ourselves: How do I know this is true? or How do I know this is false? I submit you can only know objectively\u2014or you don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m sure my just saying that doesn\u2019t prove and will not convince anyone. But you may be able to convince yourself if you do the exercise. This assumes you know something\u2014at least one thing in this world\u2014to be true or false. If you\u2019re one of those who insists nothing can be known with certainty, then you consent that you don\u2019t know anything and are thus unqualified\u2014either way\u2014to decide. Now, I intend (in the comments) to come up with my own list of things some of us know to be true. Also, I\u2019ll see if I can come up with some we know to be false. For contrast, I\u2019ll also come up with some things that are opinions, perceptions, lies, and such, to show how some are necessarily subjective\u2014as well as how even these, though subjective, exist (or occur) objectively. As a disclaimer, I don\u2019t claim this will \u201cprove\u201d anything to anyone. That\u2019s not my purpose here, because I hold that proving is each person\u2019s private responsibility. _||_ock ",

            "answer_text": "A: Welcome to Philosophy: the only field that doesn\u2019t require you to assume an interpretive answer to this question. Rather, it requires you to think \u2014 logically, on one view \u2014 about the implications of all the possible answers. As such, since you\u2019ve asked a philosophical question, I\u2019ll give a philosophical answer: It\u2019s pretty complicated.  Well, we could answer with \u201cno, no thing can be objectively true;\u201d but, in doing so, we\u2019ve identified a thing that is objectively true: the fact that no thing is. We could, contrarily, answer with \u201cyes, some thing can be objectively true;\u201d but, then we\u2019d have to devise and justify a methodology to prove that some things can be objectively true. Epistemological nihilists are those who outright deny the possibility of knowledge; i.e., they would go with the former answer. To argue for their position, they might say, \u201cokay, fine, I concede: \u201csome thing can be objectively true;\u201d but, there\u2019s only one thing that is so: the fact that \u201cno thing can be objectively true.\u201d But, they\u2019d still have to prove that there is no other thing that can be objectively true. But, mind you, they really ought to do this by the same standards by which they \u2018proved\u2019 that that one thing is true \u2014 not just by simply restating that (supposed) \u2018fact.\u2019 That is no easy task. But, neither is the modus operandi of the Epistemological Realist. This position disagrees and claims that \u201cknowledge is possible:\u201d i.e., they take the latter answer. Epistemological Realists must, therefore, \u2018prove\u2019 the objective truth of some set of things for their answer to be \u2018objectively\u2019 justifiable. However, in troth, neither interlocutor seems to have much of a case either way \u2014 well, if they\u2019re being honest with themselves. I mean, neither (seems to) have a \u2018definite\u2019 methodology nor a \u2018definite\u2019 fact from which to start. ",
