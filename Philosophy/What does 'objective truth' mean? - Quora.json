            "answer_text": "Nothing can be true except objectively. Anything else is either an opinion, a perception, a preference, a philosophy, a value, a guess, a hope, a belief, an error, a delusion, or a lie. All of these are subjective. One big problem with philosophical questions is that they produce philosophical answers\u2014which seemingly never seek the simple and practical answer that resolves the issue, but rather to identify and examine what kind of philosophers are involved in the discussion, and/or what kinds of philosophies are being used, and/or what kinds of philosophical errors are being made. Of course, this is starting out as one of those answers. But I'll get to the practical answer in a moment. First, how do you make an answer practical rather than scholarly-but-useless? Answer: By being specific. That is, instead of just speaking in terms of logical forms and logical models using such nondescript inputs such as anything, something, \u201ca thing,\u201d or \u201cno thing,\u201d use specific examples in our forms and models. This forces us to see whether our claims are valid. It also helps us, in this case, to realize what kinds of \u201cthings\u201d we are dealing with\u2014which cuts to the heart of the issue. This enables us to see whether our claims are valid. It also helps us, in this case, to realize the kinds of \u201cthings\u201d we\u2019re dealing with that can be true\u2014which cuts to the heart of the issue. You see, the only things that can be true (or false) are various kinds of predicative statements\u2014assertions about some aspects of reality. These can be called propositions, claims, confessions, accusations, assumptions, avowals, declarations, deductions, and so on. My point is, these all consist entirely of words, but are not just words that name things\u2014or nouns. Rather, they involve a subject and a verb. Too often on Quora people attribute truth or falsity to a single noun that, by itself, does not make a predicative statement. Or, they ask whether a noun is \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d For example, at any given moment, there is a debate ongoing on somewhere on Quora over whether \u201cevolution\u201d is true. Or \u201creligion.\u201d Or a specific religion (usually, \u201cChristianity\u201d). Or some other ism. But none of these can be \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d Each of these terms merely identifies a discipline, a broad theory, or a rationale or method that contains multiple claims and assumptions\u2014each of which may (and probably should) be evaluated for truthfulness separately. So, making statements such as \u201cEvolution is a fact\u201d (which I\u2019ve seen too many times) is utter nonsense. Or, \u201cReligion is false [or even true].\u201d Again, nonsense. Now, the statements themselves are assertions and are therefore either true or false. (Okay, if you say, \u201cEvolution happens,\u201d now you have a predicative statement\u2014one that is either true or false.) And the truthfulness or falsity of each statement is objective. (The two above are both false.) All we need to do to know that things true are objectively true, and that things false are objectively false, is to specify several statements about reality we know to be either true or false. Then, each ask ourselves: How do I know this is true? or How do I know this is false? I submit you can only know objectively\u2014or you don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m sure my just saying that doesn\u2019t prove and will not convince anyone. But you may be able to convince yourself if you do the exercise. This assumes you know something\u2014at least one thing in this world\u2014to be true or false. If you\u2019re one of those who insists nothing can be known with certainty, then you consent that you don\u2019t know anything and are thus unqualified\u2014either way\u2014to decide. Now, I intend (in the comments) to come up with my own list of things some of us know to be true. Also, I\u2019ll see if I can come up with some we know to be false. For contrast, I\u2019ll also come up with some things that are opinions, perceptions, lies, and such, to show how some are necessarily subjective\u2014as well as how even these, though subjective, exist (or occur) objectively. As a disclaimer, I don\u2019t claim this will \u201cprove\u201d anything to anyone. That\u2019s not my purpose here, because I hold that proving is each person\u2019s private responsibility. _||_ock ",

            "answer_text": "A: Welcome to Philosophy: the only field that doesn\u2019t require you to assume an interpretive answer to this question. Rather, it requires you to think \u2014 logically, on one view \u2014 about the implications of all the possible answers. As such, since you\u2019ve asked a philosophical question, I\u2019ll give a philosophical answer: It\u2019s pretty complicated.  Well, we could answer with \u201cno, no thing can be objectively true;\u201d but, in doing so, we\u2019ve identified a thing that is objectively true: the fact that no thing is. We could, contrarily, answer with \u201cyes, some thing can be objectively true;\u201d but, then we\u2019d have to devise and justify a methodology to prove that some things can be objectively true. Epistemological nihilists are those who outright deny the possibility of knowledge; i.e., they would go with the former answer. To argue for their position, they might say, \u201cokay, fine, I concede: \u201csome thing can be objectively true;\u201d but, there\u2019s only one thing that is so: the fact that \u201cno thing can be objectively true.\u201d But, they\u2019d still have to prove that there is no other thing that can be objectively true. But, mind you, they really ought to do this by the same standards by which they \u2018proved\u2019 that that one thing is true \u2014 not just by simply restating that (supposed) \u2018fact.\u2019 That is no easy task. But, neither is the modus operandi of the Epistemological Realist. This position disagrees and claims that \u201cknowledge is possible:\u201d i.e., they take the latter answer. Epistemological Realists must, therefore, \u2018prove\u2019 the objective truth of some set of things for their answer to be \u2018objectively\u2019 justifiable. However, in troth, neither interlocutor seems to have much of a case either way \u2014 well, if they\u2019re being honest with themselves. I mean, neither (seems to) have a \u2018definite\u2019 methodology nor a \u2018definite\u2019 fact from which to start. ",

            "answer_text": "No. That\u2019s why we make a distinction between objective and subjective. Once you accept that the external world existed before you, will exist after you, and exists in its own right, independent of your short existence and limited consciousness, that is when you can make the distinction between objective and subjective, and can then become incrementally more objective from your permanently subjective internal state. Yes, you can never be totally objective, due to being a subjective being, yet you can become more objective by using more objective methods. No reason to quit if you can\u2019t have it all. Can anything be objectively true? Everything that is actually so, is objectively and truly so. The only things that are not so are constructs in/from the subjective mind, aka imagination. If something is so then you are not imagining it. If you imagine something, that does not make it so. There are a situational exceptions, that you can imagine something and it can later turn out to be so, either because you had no knowledge that it already existed when you imagined it, or when you take action to make something that you imagined so by physically making it happen. I would suggest not being fooled into thinking there is no real difference between subjective and objective by the exceptions. Subjective - The internal view of the world.Objective - All that does exist in the world. Objective is also used to describe methods for the subjective being to become more objective, or change their subjective view to align more closely with the real world. So when we call a person objective we are describing someone with a low imaginary world view and a higher alignment with what is actually so. The word objective being used both ways can lead to some confusion on this topic. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. That\u2019s the big problem of science. No, no thing can be objectively true. A good example of the reasoning for this are Descartes Meditationes. In this he argues (as if he had seen The Matrix) that everything could just be a dream, or a setup of a mischievous god. Only one thing he can be sure about: Cogito, ergo sum. (Back then, the stance of everything else being the matrix and thus untrue was called Solipsism) I would translate Cogito, ergo sum not literally as \u201ci think, therefore i am\u201d but rather as \u201ci experience, therefore i am\u201d or \u201ci am conscious, therefore i am\u201d. You have to see that Descartes divided the world into the res cogitans and the res extensa. So the extended world, the bodily world, and the thinking world, the world in which the thinking takes place. This world is our consciousness (actually the outside world takes place there too, somehow, but let\u2019s not get too crazy). So what Descartes actually says is: the only thing you can be sure of is that you are conscious, that you are alive, that you are. Else there wouldn\u2019t be anyone asking this question. Everything else is uncertain. This reality is uncertain. Every sentence trying to describe it is only an assumption. Someone once said: The map is not the territory. And it will never be. How would a sentence be equivalent to what it describes? Many philosophers have boggled their minds with this question and haven\u2019t found an objective answer. Maybe that\u2019s reason enough to trust it. Although also this sentence is only an assumption. Nothing is sure, not even the uncertainty. If you stop striving for certainty, you may live happier. On the other hand, objectively true sentences can be formed from a basis of other sentences. This is logic. It is what mathematics are build of. Use some axioms, prove what follows from them. So you can build maps that are self-consistent. The funny thing is that reality is very well describable using the method of logic. That\u2019s what makes me wonder the most about this reality. Why does science work so well, even though it\u2019s plan is never achievable? It\u2019s crazy! ",

Now we are realizing that things that we once thought were absolute truths are really forms of evidence that have an infinite number of variables attached to them that we can't possibly factor in because of the limitless qualities. Therefore we are stuck with incomplete concepts that we can still use as valuable guidelines, but not as the perfect absolutes we once thought they were. A great example is health. We all know that diet and exercise correlate with good health, but the specific behaviors are going to be different for everyone. Each of us can experiment on what works best for us based on the guidelines, but we will never know exactly what's best for us, and we will have to continually approximate and make adjustments based on the feedback our individual bodies give us. Relationships are another example where these same formulas apply. ",

However, the deceptive point about objectivity is our missing out of the fact that an object is only partially perceivable. The other associated deceptive point about it is our unreasonable demand for complete perception of an object and our being fanatic against accepting a course of perception if less than complete. When you are looking at a sandbank, you are certainly seeing sand, although you are not yet aware of the number of sands you are looking on. Does it mean that you don\u2019t know the sandbank, just because you don\u2019t know the number of sands it is made up of? Does it mean that the sandbank isn\u2019t objectively true, because of the aforesaid shortfall in knowing? Does a candle\u2019s glow is to be reckoned by the darkness that borders it? ",

The most objective true statement that one can make is: \u201cAll concepts and perceptions are subjective\u201d and even that is only subjectively true. The only objective truths consist of tautological truths i.e., things which are true in that they are defined as such. This includes math, logic, and other rules based systems. Even these systems are subjective to the perceiver and are not necessarily universally true as they depend on the beliefs of each perceiver. Perception is REALITY. The only means to be truly objective is on a meta level so that our subjectivity itself can be objectified viewed from outside of physical and mental reality.

Is this not a glaring double standard? Why would one claim to be so smart and yet allow himself to remain inconsistent, with an air of being an expert in epistemology? One thing we do know is that it is personally \"convenient\" and at times politically and economically expedient to remain an agnostic. This is the real intellectual, you know! It is popular in many circles today to be ridiculously \"open-minded\" in that some are so open-minded that their brains have fallen out and their thinking process is flawed. Such is the case when one foolishly argues he can know, but you can't know. But, John 17:17 and John 8:32. Thanks for allowing me to throw in my two cents.  ",
