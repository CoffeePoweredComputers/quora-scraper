            "answer_text": "A fish moving with the current can\u2019t measure the river. So, neither the fish of the Greek river nor the fish of the Indian river would have an idea about their respective Rivers of philosophy. The West thinks that its \u201cimposing physical posture\u201d is the defining legacy of its gnostic past that began with the advent of Greece. On the other hand, the East (India) thinks that its \u201ccirculatory introspection\u201d is the defining legacy of its gnostic past that began with the advent of Jambudvipa. These are the two fishes floating away in two great rivers, thinking that they know their habitats. An unmanned survey ship with no specific bias could do the job of finding out the relative sizes and depths of these two rivers, provided it had the requisite gadgets. To cut the story short, let\u2019s be practical. Pick up Bharatamuni\u2019s \u201cNatryashastra\u201d, the encyclopedic treatise on dramaturgy and histrionics. This is one of Ancient India\u2019s hundreds of such treatise of such acuity and acumen. It is quite doubtful if Greek standard of intellectual analysis and creation is as high. Because it was getting admixed with ostentatious rhetoric and sophistry right from the beginning. India lost track of own intellect due to its failure to mine the relatively small requisite quantity of \u201ctin\u201d that was necessary to turn its huge heaps of \u201ccopper\u201d into bronze through \u201calloying\u201d. Copper is here the metaphor for \u201chigh-quality general philosophy\u201d when tin is that for \u201cgender ecstasy and inspiration\u201d. Somewhere due to a transient inattention, a fatal fault crept into the Indian socio-cultural ambience initiating a retardation caused by \u201cagencies of trans-intellectual kind\u201d. The reason was obviously the false notion of and obsession about \u201csuperiority of pure knowledge\u201d over \u201cpractical knowledge\u201d, when the later should have been the priority. As a consequence, India began to miss \u201choney-sweet experiences\u201d and \u201cperennial inspiration\u201d for forwardly momentum. On the Greek side, this omission didn\u2019t occur and \u201cgender power\u201d was fully exploited to drag their chariot of civilization uphill and forward through thick and thin. The \u201cintellectual wagon\u201d would be the natural tow of the chariot, anyway. Thus, on the Greek/ Western side, the shortfall on the intellectual aspect was made good by the \u201csocial pragmatism and proactiveness\u201d. Woman freedom, sexual freedom, positive pornography etc came on the side of the \u201ctrans-intellectual agencies\u201d of the Western Civilization. On the Greek/ West side, unaware of the concealed identities of the agencies of civilization, \u201cscientific attitude\u201d has been pulled out at random to serve to represent the agencies of civilization. It may not be the truth. India was relatively more scientific long ago, but it lost at the \u201cgender crossroads\u201d. The West is winning for reasons other than \u201cscientific attitude\u201d which isn\u2019t any longer in possession of them at this moment, anyway. The very \u201cfirst principle of science\u201d that calls for and empowers \u201cuniversal/ ingenious/ cross-faculty thinkers\u201d to become the source of the \u201cguiding hypothesis\u201d and to become the master of the organization of contextual employed specialists/ professional who would be carrying out the corroborative experimentation has been abandoned by the West long ago. This also has pushed mankind and globe to the brink of catastrophes and apocalypses as the cumulative civilization has become uncontrollable under the avaricious influence of the non-science. So, if you are listening, you can visualize very well that India has entered a period of endless hibernation to escape the cold of an unending winter which has been invited by its \u201cgender stupidity\u201d. India doesn\u2019t now need to be more \u201cintelligent\u201d. It needs to be \u201cgender-wise\u201d. Fast revival would be around the corner thereafter. Coming back to your query, well, most portions of your long query needs to be retold to bring back consistency. ",

            "answer_text": "Evolution took a different path in India. Greece didn't evolve in it's own way . Christianity took Greek and Europe centuries before. Greeks had measured Circumference of Earth and had lot of scientific knowledge and philosophical knowledge,but monotheistic strict Christianity killed everything. Later Protestantism made some progress and French revolution happened in France. Later scientific revolution took place. This was the milestone of success for Europeans. But in India all philosophies were termed as mythology by Western-Indologists . China and India deserve lot more attention and recognition . We had come up lot of mathematical formulas which Europeans found centuries later. ",
