            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you mean by \u201cpersonal domain of truth\u201d. I guess you mean the domain where the truth are inherently personal. That is the subjective innate knowledge which comprises your consciousness, mainly in the \u201cform\u201d of qualia, that is subjective percepts. The usual examples are feeling pain, felling pleasure, feeling being convinced by an argument, remembering personal memories (the smile of your friends, \u2026), and usually our subjective (true or false) memories, your dreams, etc. None are truly communicable. If a kid complains about a toothache or an headache , his mother might have some difficulties to evaluate if that is real, or if he is playing a comedy to avoid going at school (like he did before, say). Consciousness can be characterised by what is true, immediately (first-person) knowable, non prouvable/rationally justifiable, nor even definable without invoking a notion of truth/reality, yet indubitable by each entity concerned. But we have empathy, and we easily attribute consciousness to those who are enough similar to ourselves. All the content of consciousness you can be conscious of belongs to that personal domain of truth, as such, even if some of those refers to some outer reality and are wrong. If someone believes (sincerely albeit erroneously) that the Moon is made of cheese, the experience of that belief is true, and belongs to his/her personal domain of truth, despite being wrong (assuming the moon is not made of cheese!). We cannot be wrong on such truth. If the little kids did not have the toothache, he knows that perfectly well. His/her mother can\u2019t be sure, but the kid, and \u201cGod\u201d, knows the truth, in this case. ",
