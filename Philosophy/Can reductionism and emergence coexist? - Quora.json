            "answer_text": "I once wrote a thesis on this. It\u2019s a large subject, and you\u2019ll only enjoy it if your kink is analysing apparently similar, but actually very different definitions of vague concepts, written by a whole set of influential people in different fields, whose only unifying quality is that they are not good at writing definitions. And if that is your kink, then Chapter 1 of this will be porn for you.  On the off-chance that you just want to skip that and address the question instead\u2026 I believe the upshot is that there is a useful, strong notion of emergence that is consistent with a useful, strong notion of reductionism. And not only are they consistent with one another, but both notions appear to hold in the world we live in. A useful, strong notion of reductionism is that everything supervenes on the microphysical.*A useful, strong notion of emergence is that there are fundamental** laws of physics that are not microphysical.Again, there\u2019s a lot of logic-chopping to properly understand those two. So let\u2019s skip it, and go straight to an example.  Phase transitions. Second order ones to be precise. Let\u2019s take a sample of water and adjust its temperature and pressure to being it near its triple point. We will find that some of the water\u2019s physical quantities start to behave exponentially. i.e., as we \"tune\" the system closer and closer to its critical point by changing some parameter xx these quantities change in a manner proportional to ekixekix where kiki is a constant called a \"critical exponent\". There are four of these constants. Now the strange thing is that when you do the same thing for a bunch of other systems that are ostensibly nothing to do with one another: a ferromagnetic transition through the Curie temperature, a diffusing system about to undergo full percolation, a virus propagating through a human population \u2014 you get the same critical exponents. That is, they all behave in a similar exponential manner, and the same four constants fall out of the experiments across all these different systems. This behaviour was entirely independent of the microphysics. It did not matter what kind of atoms were in these substances, or what microphysical laws they obeyed (all that matters is the dimensionality of the substance and whether the interactions are short or long-range). In 1982 Kenneth Wilson put forward a theory of this behaviour (winning himself a Nobel in the process). He was able to show how each of these disparate systems became self-similar at different scales close to their critical points, and so a new symmetry (the renormalisation group symmetry) began to dominate their dynamics, rather than any dynamics of the particles that they are made up of. This explained why the same behaviour could be observed in water, in magnets, in percolating liquids, and in viruses propagating through a population as they all approached their critical point.  Critical behaviour is an example of what some condensed matter physicists call a law within a \u201cprotectorate\u201d. That is, some behaviour that is utterly isolated from the microphysical by the collective dynamics of the substance. The claim, which I believe can be filled out in detail, is that the laws holding in these \u201cprotectorates\u201d and described by theories such as Wilson\u2019s, deserve the label \u201cfundamental\u201d as much as do any laws of the microphysical; in particular, they are not in any way derived, or dependent on them. And yet they are fully consistent with reductionism, which holds throughout all this discussion.***  * \u201cSupervenes\u201d has a technical meaning, but in this context means that there can be no difference to any system without a difference at the microphysical level (including in the laws of dynamics). And here \u201cmicrophysical\u201d means the properties and objects treated by a theory that is uncontroversially microphysical: the Standard model will do for our purposes. ** \u201cFundamental\u201d is a tricky one to define. So, the challenge is turned around: give reasonable criteria for \u201cfundamental\u201d that are not question-begging (e.g., belongs to a microphysical theory) that applies to one but not the other \u2014 I don\u2019t think you can. *** There\u2019s a plot twist. It turned out that Wilson\u2019s application of renormalisation to condensed matter physics led to a re-evaluation of the appearance of renormalisation in the quantum field theories of the Standard Model \u2014 and all of a sudden they looked a lot less \u201cfundamental\u201d than they did before. See here for a discussion. ",

            "answer_text": "Reductionism holds that phenomena can be explained by the properties of constituent parts. Emergence asserts that certain phenomena result from the relationships between constituent parts and/or the relationship of phenomena or a system of phenomena to the environment or to other systems. Life is a prime example of an emergent system. You can reduce a flower to all of its constituent parts of atoms and molecules, but nowhere in the properties of those parts will you find a \u201cflower\u201d \u2014 unless you look at DNA, but even then the constituent parts of DNA, once broken apart, do not contain a \u201cflower.\u201d Crystals are sometimes called emergent. For example, where in water\u2019s constituents do we find the ever-changing patterns of snowflakes? I would argue though that at least the general template for snowflakes (six radia) stem directly from the properties and shape of water molecules, and that would be a reductionist analysis. Then we have the idea of the sentient isomorphic algorithms (ISOs) from the movie Tron. Those entities just \u2026 emerged. While reductionism and emergence can be contrasted, I tend to see them as being at opposite ends of a scale. At one end, the reasoning is that the whole can be explained totally by the parts. At the other end, the whole cannot be explained by parts at all. There can be many shades between the two extremes \u2014 the snowflake is an example: each unique shape is emergent, but the general pattern is determined by reduction. So I would say yes, they can and do coexist, and both can even yield insights to the same specific phenomena. Conflict would arise mainly where someone would be determined to hold rigidly to an absolutist view of one or the other, and that could lead to conflict, and that conflict could be resolved through flexible thinking. (Also note: reductionism is often contrasted with holism. And in philosophy, there are two branches that seek to counter reductionism. One is dualism \u2014 some things, like say a soul or a mind, simply exist in some separate way. The other is dialectical emergence, which is what the above question probes.) ",
