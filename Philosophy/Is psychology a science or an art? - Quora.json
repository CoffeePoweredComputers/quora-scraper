            "answer_text": "I have given a lot of thought to this. Let me start with a fact. This is about humans and there are so many variables. We are getting handles on stuff but some groups are trying to deconstruct us into particles thinking reductionism will reveal the secret to thought. The science label is so intriguing and sets up a lure that is hard to resist: Objectivity and reducing cognition into synaptic conditions. I've actually read a line that said if a therapist talks about therapy being an Art, you need to get another therapist. This is someone who doesn't seem to know enough about science, psychology, or Art.  Science, in the biological sense is replicable. But it does not give intent nor reason. In the discipline of psychology, it tends to explore the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. It tries to reduce thought down to chemical process and objectify everything believing it can be measured rationally. Biologically we need our equipment to be functioning well to be able to think and feel straight but it does not tell us who we are. Taking drugs to relax and stabilize you will not repair nor heal seeing the love of your life being blown away right in front of you. Psychology Studies the mind and behaviour. It tries to understand the how and why of people thinking and them choosing to do certain things, certain ways. Different aspects of psychology do different jobs. A practitioner is certainly not the guy researching probes buried in the brains of rats. The clinician branch tends to use talk processes to change a persons mind. Thats why the degree is a bachelor or master of ARTS, or a doctorate of PHILOSOPHY. Beliefs of the individual are like differing religions. You don't change that by being rational. Biologically, all the differing religious minds look about the same.  Art is sometimes only thought of as the fine arts and as a medium for self-expression and interpretation; Pictures, music, poetry and the like. They relate to art as a thing, an object to be evaluated and judged. It is much harder to get a handle on the process it produces in a person. The nuances in a piece of music or subtleties in a smile. Concrete thinkers don't get it at all. Nor do they tend to understand the science in art either. It follows certain structures whether the mathematics of the golden triangle, the sequencing of notes for a song or the rhythm of haiku. There are replicable patters of which the artist follows and then deviates creating a dynamic which impacts on the experiencer.  Aesthetics is a subtler process known in philosophy and are about creativity, interpretation and sentiment. It deals with the creation and appreciation of art, sometimes known as taste. They are individualized judgments with emotional values.  Psychologists know the patients perception, personality, cognition, interest, emotion, intelligence, motivation, brain functioning, behavior, and resources both internally and externally determine if they will be able to change. The individuals history, psychological resilience, family support, and other factors all can mean the person with a similar looking brain chemistry and MRI will make wildly differing choices. Couple that to the therapist personality, the set and setting, the therapist choice of techniques, the skill of execution all become factors. It is not a mechanical process. I've been doing this for forty years and seen thousands of patients now. All the techniques have to be tweaked to each person. What they get out of it and how they can utilize it is individualistic. We aren't changing out carburetors here. So the real answer is: Both.  The science sees the patterns, underlying mechanisms, the typical setups and the tattletale behaviors which plague the patient, as well as identifying the causes. That then helps the therapist, select the tool. The artistry of the therapist is to be able to wield that tool, past the patients defenses, and have them be helped, in spite of their resistance both consciously and unconsciously. That's the art.

            "answer_text": "Either, depending on the context. Practicing clinical psychologists or psychotherapists are practicing a professional art, in the sense that their training and experience allows them to get inside people's heads and lead them in the desired emotional direction. But studies show that in the long term, most of the benefit from talk therapy comes from just talking to someone who is willing to listen attentively. There is negligible scientific evidence that any particular method/school of talk therapy is more effective than any other. Theories of psychology have no scientific basis from a therapeutic standpoint because the only evidence of their effectiveness is the anecdotal and subjective impressions of the therapist. And that is strongly mislead by a combination of confirmation bias and the fact that most patients naturally get better on their own with no intervention.  Psychological studies that seek to uncover knowledge of how the mind works, however, are science. Unfortunately it's often bad science. Psychology researchers tend to be the absolute worst at picking sample sizes large enough for statistical relevancy. There is a bit of math required to identify the sample size for a particular study and for some reason researchers rarely use it.  On top of that, most psych research volunteers are college students. That seriously (cripplingly) biases the results of even the best-designed studies in favor of studying young, reasonably intelligent, reasonably affluent, white Americans. There is very, very little psychological data available for impoverished people or developing nations.  Combine the two effects and you get a plethora of idiotic studies for the scientifically-illiterate news media to latch onto. My favorites are the headlines that say things like \"Wealth Makes You An Asshole\" or \"Lefties Love Fat Chicks\" based on survey results from 8 white males.  ",
