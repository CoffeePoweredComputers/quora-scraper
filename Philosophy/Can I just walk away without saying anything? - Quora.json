If that\u2019s a case with you then: Try to make the other person understand of your views and be firm and practical while explaining the things. Don\u2019t just run away from things. Be a Bravo :) If someone has done that to you: Try thinking, may be if they would have said you the reason to leave you, you might have got hurt worse. Thinking this, may be they don\u2019t want to worsen things and lack the patience to deal with the situation, they might have left. Just because you are good to one, you can\u2019t expect the other to be the same. It\u2019s as insane as that just because you don\u2019t eat Lion, you expect it not to eat you up.  It hurts initially, but don\u2019t give your Brain the power to control you for the things that others have done to you! Be smart of not wasting your time for something that someone has done to you. As our ultimate goal should be to live at peace happily :) Cheers! ",
