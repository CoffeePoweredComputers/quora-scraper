            "answer_text": "YES because being what is decided by society to be GOOD OR BAD may not even affect these people at all. RELIGIONS DECIDE WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD and this is a hugely variable scale from region to region, era to era, generation to generation. There was a time when people were KILLED FOR HOMOSEXUALITY and it was branded as DEVIL WORK. Society joined into the fray. SOCIETY ALWAYS DOES. We are all conditioned. > There was also a time when BEING ABLE TO READ WAS REGARDED AS EVIL unless you were a high ranking scholar or some form of clergy. IN THE DARK AGES IF YOU COULD READ YOU WERE BRANDED AS EVIL. So define evil? The dictionary simply defines it as DESTRUCTIVE/destruction so tearing down/demolishing building is LITERALLY EVIL. So right there we do not even understand the actual word. But then getting back to the religious side: MORALITY IS VIRTUALLY ALWAYS THE DETERMINING FACTOR AS TO WHETHER A PERSON IS EITHER GOOD OR EVIL AND THIS IS ALWAYS DECIDED BY RELIGIOUS ORDERS WHO MAY BE STARKLY GUILTY OF THE THINGS THEY JUDGE THE MASSES FOR THEMSELVES. EXAMPLE: rampant homosexuality exists within the priesthood and guru ships of ALL MAJOR RELIGIONS although each will tell you that YOU WILL BE CONDEMNED TO SOME BAD PLACE IN THE AFTERLIFE FOR THIS YOURSELF. HAVING A FREE MIND is almost always considered evil OR standing against some actual wrong. MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS CONSIDERED EVIL BY LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE BOTH WHITE AND BLACK IN HIS TIME. BEING A VOICE AGAINST SOME WRONG THING ALMOST ALWAYS GETS A PERSON BRANDED AS EVIL. So the basis of BEING EVIL is so undefined and so un grounded that CERTAINLY THIS HAS NO AFFECT ON WHETHER A PERSON CAN BASICALLY LIVE WITH THEMSELVES I am more than certain Dr King was more than comfortable with his EVIL STAND against segregation. God bless him. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people are saying yes, but I don't think they fully understand the question. If you are evil, than that means you intentionally do morally wrong things, at least, that's how I see it. If this is what you \"want\" than it can make you happy. But \"want\" is in a matter of perspective. Nobody, unless they have a mental illness, wants to be evil. Even if you ask someone who claims they are evil why they did things, they will most likely try to reason and back themselves up with moral correctness. In most cases, people have merely convinced themselves they want immorality. But \"deep down\" that isn't what their mind/heart needs to feel satisfied, so they will come off as angry at the world or a generally negative person.  Now, if immorality isn't what they really need to be happy, then by getting it (and thus being evil) they are not becoming truly happy, no matter what they convince themselves of. Thus, they are not really happy.  So most people who are \"evil\" are not really evil, and go about acting like it only finding a false happiness.  Your answer is mostly no. ",

            "answer_text": "In nearly every story that I have seen, evil people are usually maniacally laughing or being very smug and arrogant with how well their masterplan is being carried out (before ultimately being stopped by the hero, hobbit, normal person). It looks like they are really happy at being evil! Happiness, after all, is a state of mind. In real life though, how evil people react depends very much on who they seek recognition from. If they have close peers who themselves support and encourage the evil behavior, then of course, it becomes a positive (evil) feedback loop for them, causing them to be happy. But if they are lonesome, their point of feedback would be society itself, which would look  at them in disdain, and this provides a negative feedback loop for them, causing them to be unhappy. For example, If you read some of the personal thoughts of serial killers, they talk about how they feel like they are being controlled by the devil, etc. But as always, this isn't a hard and fast rule about all evil guys.

They will never feel they have enough, so there will always be a feeling of anxiety, needing the next 'fix' of whatever their evil demands. There is no feeling of reaching a final goal, so there is no moment when they can, at last, rest and find peace. Actually, now that I think about it, it seems to me a truly evil person creates his own, inescapable Hell, from which he can never be free. ",

There is a subtle difference between pleasure and happiness. A tickle can give pleasure, but it's not happiness. Heck, a massage session, a spa treatment, binge drinking or any other hedonistic activity can only give momentary pleasure not lasting happiness. Even a fantastic victory achieved by wrong means can be tumultuous for a person. Lance Armstrong's, a cancer survivor and seven times winner of Tour-de-France, confession gives you an idea about the torn person he'd become because of the means he had adopted. And that happens to any person with a mind-body-soul conflict. ",
