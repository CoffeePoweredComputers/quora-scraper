            "answer_text": "There is nothing spiritual or faith based. I am not attached, to know, at start little bit faith required to, just like a science student. Hence upnishads call it as Shraddha. Here Shraddha means nothing but concentration. Concentration of mind. Because dilluded mind can not realise the absolute truth. Here it is not a blind faith like religions belief and faith. hence if someone told, \u201c I believe that\u201d, before sri Ramakrishna paramahansa, he used to call, Khot time\u201d, means bogus or fake. if it\u2019s not attached, it should be visible to me. Once seen, really \u201cI am not attached, I am the independent, I am not the creator of anything, I am not had any karma, or not having any karma, I am the self, this creation is simply hanged to me, I am the self or Atman, I am not even point of geometry, triangles or vaginas not belonged to me, body not belongs to me, I never born, there was, there is, there will be no death for me\u201d, now every thing you transcended and you became it.
