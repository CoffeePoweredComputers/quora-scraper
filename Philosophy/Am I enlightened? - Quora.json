            "answer_text": "Yes. You\u2019re enlightened. This is the correct answer. Seven billion people growl to disagree. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m enlightened \u2014 makes me angry.\u201d\u201cMe? Enlightened? I\u2019m working off bad karma from thousands of lifetimes.\u201d\u201cNope. Not me. I don\u2019t witness my dreams. My waking mind is a hot mess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything spiritual or religious. Enlightenment isn\u2019t real.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a PhD in psychology. Get out of here with that silly religious stuff.\u201d\u201cI love God and pray daily, but I\u2019m a sinner and far from being a saint.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve done bad things. No way am I salvageable. I don\u2019t deserve enlightenment.\u201d Etc.So what gives? How can a guru say, \u201ceveryone\u2019s enlightened\u201d and keep a straight face? Answer: A guru sees God at play when you project identity. The actor, Boris Karloff, pretended to be Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s monster. Back stage, everyone knew him to be a gentleman to great degree.Not a single sin of the monster was the karma of Boris.Same deal for you. You can realize that you\u2019re an actor. You can realize that your role is not you.You can realize that God wrote the script. So see how easy it is to stop being a mistaken identity? You don\u2019t have to adjust the script. The play continues.You don\u2019t have to make the monster become moral.You don\u2019t have to understand the monster.You don\u2019t have to get the monster to start meditating. You don\u2019t have to have a relationship with The Playwright. Instead:\u2014 take a break.\u2014 go backstage.\u2014 remove your wig. How? Closing the eyes is all the \u201cmethod acting\u201d you need. When we close the eyes, we\u2019re immediately backstage. We now see:\u2014 There\u2019s a mental play being performed. The mind is theatrical. \u2014 Thoughts and emotions are strutting and fretting their hour. \u2014 One attends no matter if it\u2019s a comedy or tragedy. If we practice meditation, we are gradually freed. Once freed of thinking one is one\u2019s role, the whole theater is realized.Once the theater is seen, outside the theater can be explored. Outside the mind is pure God.God swaddles creation like a newborn infant.In every manner, we are escorted by silence, God\u2019s Being. Any closing of the eyes brings God\u2019s Being to the fore.Silence is suddenly huge. Expansive beyond one\u2019s skull. As we practice being silent we begin to be silence, God\u2019s Being.Silence gradually becomes enlivened to an all time reality. After that, God\u2019s being is your elixir.After that, God\u2019s writing your lines.After that, God\u2019s speaking your words. After that, God\u2019s two hands are heard clapping. ",

This is a very good experience. We have two types of Samadhi: Sampragyata Samadhi or Savikalpa Samadhi: In this type of Samadhi you will know that the Meditator,Meditation and whom to meditate are not absorbed but the consciousness becomes calm or silent and that consciousness stand in Brahman is Sampragyata Samadhi.This state is like a dawn of the day which mean sunlight exhibited without appearance of Sun.In this state the eternal happiness is experienced but not at the appearance of the Atman.In this state, Self-realization is not attained. The state of mind is like a cat on the wall which mean it endeavors to get absorbed in to Samadhi.In this Samadhi, Mind attains the state of consciousness but self-realization is not attained.Seeker in this state should practice a lot to get the state of Enlightenment.Asampragyata Samadhi or NirvikalpaSamadhi or Enlightenment: This is the state of man becoming God.In this state man as Brahman exists, No Meditation, Meditator or meditation on whom does not exist.This Samadhi is like a Sun Rise which mean lustre accompanied by Sun appearance.In this Samadhi eternal happiness is accompanied by enlightenment.Sunlight and Sun cannot get isolated like wise the eternal happiness and enlightenment cannot get isolated in this state.Every human being is enjoying eternal happiness in his daily life but due to inexperience of the Samadhi he is unable to identify it. For example. when we perform a deed with concentration or listening to a music, or when we are with a peace of mind. when we see few astonishing movements we experience this state.The above cannot be comprehended unless we experience the state of samadhi.When we listen to music, our eyes get closed efoortlessly, our mind becoms conscious of listening music, we experience a state of happiness. This is \u201cShabdanu viddhi Samadhi\u201d.When we watch a person performing cultural dance, we forget every thing and watch it. This is \u201cDrushyanu Viddhi Samadhi\u201d.",

            "answer_text": "Of course, not. In my understand, there will be no doubt or confusion after achieving even the stage of stream-winner, (Sot\u0101panna in Pali and Srot\u0101panna in Sanskrit), which is the very first step or the very first achievement in the journey of Enlightenment. Now, you are asking whether you are enlightened or not.  Don't believe what I said. You can question, challenges, test and understand by following steps what Buddha has outlined. There are people who does not take the achievement of stream-winner because they want to achieve the full Buddhahood so that they can also liberate others. I will discuss about different kinds of liberators later. Achieving the first stage: Stream-winner Once you achieve even the first stage, i.e., Stream-winner or stream-enterer, you have already cuts off the first three of ten fetters[1], which catch us into the circle of life and death. These three fetters are (1) belief in a self, i.e., believing that we have an eternal soul; (2) doubt or uncertainty, especially about the Dharma or teachings, i.e., about the laws of nature and life taught or shared by Buddha, which includes the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. What does a Stream-winner mean?Once we achieve that stream-winner stage, we will be liberated, i.e., escaping from the circles of life and death, within next seven lives. We will never be again in the low four plains of existence[2]. According to Buddhism, Stream-enterer attains an intuitive grasp of dharma (right view) and has complete confidence in the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha). He or she has \"opened the eye of the Dharma\", because he or she has realized that whatever arises will cease (impermanence). Their conviction in the true dharma would be unshakable. Most importantly, stream-enterers never commit the five precepts[3], which is the very basic in Buddhist practices.  Four stages of attainment In the journey of enlightenment there are four stages we have to achieve; first, Stream-enterer (we have already discussed about it); second, Once-returner; third, Non-returner; and, fourth, Arahant.  According to Buddhism, everyone who truly achieves that kind of stage keep their achievements in secret. I will talk about it more later. I will also give full references for what I have said. I now have to work on, finish and submit a report to my school today or not later than tomorrow. Please help me: how can I stay away from Quora just for a couple of days until I finish all my assignments? I think it is also a kind of attachment that Buddha wants us to release ourselves from it. Footnotes [1] Ten \"fetters of becoming\"(1) belief in a self (2) doubt or uncertainty, especially about the Dhamma or teachings(3) attachment to rites and rituals (4) sensual desire (5) ill will (6) lust for material existence, lust for material rebirth(7) lust for immaterial existence, lust for rebirth in a formless realm(8) conceit (9) restlessness(10) ignorance [2] There are in total 31 planes of existence, according to Buddhism. [3] Five Precepts of Buddhism(1) Not killing, that includes killing all kinds of living beings(2) not taking what is not given, i.e., stealing(3) not conducting or having sexual misconduct, like adultery and having sex out of marriage, rape, etc(4) not giving false speech, i.e., lying, or telling of lies, or false statements, or untruthfulness(5) not taking fermented drink that causes heedlessness, i.e., not drinking alcohol or alcoholic drink, not taking drug ",

            "answer_text": "It might be a state you enter that is out of the ordinary, not like your usual experience. Those states, if they come and go, can\u2019t be enlightenment. Enlightenment can\u2019t be a product of causes, can\u2019t come and go. It is supremely ordinary in a way :). \u201cIt is incorrect to think that Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is the natural result of the extinction of craving. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the result of anything. If it would be a result, then it would be an effect produced by a cause. It would be sa\u1e43khata \u2018produced\u2019 and \u2018conditioned\u2019. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is neither cause nor effect. It is beyond cause and effect. Truth is not a result nor an effect. It is not produced like a mystic, spiritual, mental state, such as dhy\u0101na or sam\u0101dhi. TRUTH IS. NIRV\u0100\u1e46A IS. The only thing you can do is to see it, to realize it. There is a path leading to the realization of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. But Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the result of this path You may get to the mountain along a path, but the mountain is not the result, not an effect of the path. You may see a light, but the light not the result of your eyesight.\u201d The Third Noble Truth - Walpola Rahula: What the Buddha Taught But sometimes these states do carry something of the message or blessings of enlightenment. Other times they are just distractions. Either way, where it can go wrong is if you start to try to find ways to reproduce it. Once it becomes a state you try to reproduce, it becomes an effect you are trying to cause. It becomes like a child hitting their head against a wall to try to se stars. Once that happens, then you can spiral into hitting your head harder and harder until you see really bright stars - that\u2019s doing nobody any good. Even if it is genuinely carrying something of the message of non self or enlightenment or whatever it is. Generally the best thing to do when you get unusual experiences that seem in some way \u201cspiritual\u201d is to just recognize them as experiences. Okay today I stubbed my toe. And yesterday I got this unusual state of mind I\u2019ve never encountered before. Just accept them both as states that arise, and then pass away. A good teacher would help you there, how to deal with it. There may be a message sometimes of some sort. If so, well it will come back in its own time. A good teacher may help you in other ways at this point. But it\u2019s not easy to do much yourself, because as soon as you feel you can achieve something using this experience, that becomes a spiritual accomplishment, or something you create and possess, which for a Buddhist anyway - that\u2019s leading you away from the path. A teacher helps by being someone else who is not you who can lead you in a fresh direction, but it\u2019s very hard to do that at that point by yourself. Basically you need a sense of humour. Okay I\u2019m bound to get funny states from time to time. And sometimes I\u2019m bound to start treating them and myself as special because of those states. This happens to everyone at some point if they do any work with their mind including meditation or just deep contemplation. Can happen sometimes from listening to music, or art, or just looking at a flower. Indeed in some traditions they say these sorts of experiences are happening all the time, but we just don\u2019t notice it or immediately forget them. There\u2019s nothing special about any of it. Nor is there anything special about enlightenment. In some traditions again the ay they put this is that the number of Buddhas way outnumbers ordinary beings. Nearly everyone is enlightened already and we are the few dumb ones left who have somehow not managed to \u201cget it\u201d after countless trillions of lifetimes. That thought can help one to not treat such experiences as special, and to maybe be open to the path and to finding a direction. While if you treat them as special you\u2019ll maybe never get any closer. It can become a very big impediment indeed for those who fixate too much on it. My teacher once told us that the sickness of clinging to illusory ideas of self is difficult to deal with - but the sickness of clinging to illusory realizations of non self is extremely hard to deal with - because you have turned the medicine that could cure you into a sickneses itself. So, it just needs a light touch. Which is where a teacher can really help, that\u2019s one of the main roles of a teacher I think. I don\u2019t mean a guru though that is also the main role of a guru too if I understand it right (I don\u2019t have a guru) - but just a teacher who is not yourself. can help a lot. Without a teacher, just a sense of humour and a light touch will help a lot. If you haven\u2019t read Walpola Rahula\u2019s little book \u201cWhat the Buddha taught\u201d you may find it helps a lot to be a bit more grounded about such things.

            "answer_text": "When I was 2 as a wedding gift my mom was given a Family Bible I looked at daily and as child I had visions that I thought were just re occurring dreams that would developed with more detail. Stars that circled in an 8 which I was told it is commonly used as the infinity sign. As I got older I focused in more at the stars themselves and I saw that it was men flying naked and shaped like my ken doll. I describe the winged men and I learned what I saw are Angels. What I did not like was the premonitions of danger so accurate I got scared and prayed to God to take it away I didn't want to to know if it was going to be bad. I Love God and Jesus so much after learning about them from a Christian family. What religion it was I don't know. Anyway it was the love this family had within their home won me over. As it was complete opposite of the daily abuses I received. Going to Sunday school and Awanas Church on Thursdays wasn't enough God and Jesus in my life. I LOVE the LOVE both have for mankind that by 9yrs of age I organized and taught a bible class on my own to my school mates on Tuesdays after class. At 11 my baptism was chosen by family tradition of Catholic. At 12 I confronted the church about the Idols everywhere inside even offered to remove the statues and crosses. The Priest ripped the Bible out of my hands where I had it open at Exodus the 10 commandments showing him exactly where I read it. He abruptly and aggressively shouted stop reading the Bible. If I had any questions ask him. I was traumatized God is my whole world. My escape from what I saw wrong at home. As a beaten child I was docile and I did what I was told and I stopped reading it that day forward. And began praying and talking to God daily since 5 and I haven't stopped since. I talked to God about everything on my mind all the time because before he yelled at me I wanted to be a nun because I didnt want to have to go through a middle man to talk eith God and boys become priests and girls are nuns. I then said the very best thing next is be a teacher. I will travel the world teaching English as a second language in under developed counties so all people would have the rite to make their own decisions in life and not be stuck at home because they can't read signs. Anyway long story short that didn't happen I moved out of the English speaking city into the rural French speaking country side. At I7 I met a Jehovah Witness and immediately confronted \u201cbrain washing\u201d And after reading JEHOVAH in bold print at Palms 83:18 in our families Catholic Bible. I was shocked. There God's personal name is as plain as day. For the first time I was encouraged and praised for reading the Holy Scriptures (Bible). I set out to prove them wrong or false as I was very knowledgeable about God. I studied the 5 World Religions in High School and by comparing the Holy Books 90% on earth are false. Since the past 7\u201310 yrs of documented spiritual visions gradually increasing prompted research the past couple years. Combined with previous study +20 yrs continually developing a personal relationship now +35. I feel that I can say with confidence we are friends after reading Allah's inspired thoughts. Explained what I have seen in my vision. More over Creation to Salvation is explained by 3 Holy Books past present and future the content proves God is real. Only higher perspective God's Wisdom could provide His own evidence not that He needs it and before even asked He provides it to. ",

            "answer_text": "Asking the question is answering it. I once had an experience that made a huge impact on me, over a decade ago. I thought I got 'there'. I didn't question the experience and at first also not the meaning. After a couple of days stress set in. How does one get stress from something good, awesome? First of all, very soon a background realisation hit: it cannot last. It was never in front, only in the background. Next was that it was impossible to talk about with people. I could explain parts of the experience yet it felt too 'alien' to fully talk. I could not get it verified and would often receive blank stares when talking a little. Years later a second experience. This one was quite different. With the first experience it took me a long time to figure out what happened. This one was directly linked to meditation and right afterwards I knew what happened and its implications. The question of 'realisation/enlightenment' was not a question anymore. Self and non-self, no more doubts what this means. Also within seconds after standing up the realisation: 'this cannot last'. Since the mind was quiet at that moment it was like being struck by lightning: where did that come from?This bit kept me wondering for months because the experience was such that I know the resulting peace is always present. It has to be. A quick recall will drop the mind into the peaceful state in a split second. One day while sitting in meditation the mind began to stir and the source of the earlier wondering became apparent. I've encountered many different states of mind in meditation and would have never expected this one.  Why am I telling this?There are many experiences and you can assign different meanings to them. After the first experience I had a similar mindset as you and it took me over a decade to get past it. Only afterwards I was able to pick up the vigorous training leading to the second experience. I could have gotten stuck on the peace of that state easily. The best advice I can give you is the same as Armin's: seek a teacher.I didn't have good guidance after my first experience and it plunged me into several depressions after a couple of years. I've met my 'teacher' in a way I would have never expected and only after meeting my teacher I was able to get a grip on myself and start moving into the right direction. And it hurt a lot, even though I already knew things were 'not real' so to speak. You need to understand that in the background some things are at play of which I can give only very limited guidance in a medium as the internet. Only when staying close to someone these traits become clear. The internet is not the right place to go into this, it's easy to make mistakes due to the delayed communication which lacks any form of personal interaction.Really, seek a teacher.  Oh, by the way. If things are only sounds, not-self and have no real meaning: Take a large hammer. Put your thumb on the table. Pick hammer with other hand. Lift hammer and with full force bring it down on your thumb. There is no truth behind the experience, so why don't you do it? ",

            "answer_text": "Added: Maybe just like the state you describe is beyond words, so you do not need to give it a name too. Just accept it as something that is.But, when you feel somewhat insecure about your experience, follow the advice of the other answers, to get in contact with an experienced teacher. That will make you feel secure and you will be able to progress in a practical way. Buddhist meditation does indeed seem to be a bit similar to your experience. Or maybe the Platonic idea of people living in a cave and taking the shadows on the wall for the real world, may apply. I learned meditation in a group called Ananda Marga (Meditation, Yoga and Social Service in Ananda Marga Centers Worldwide). Ther are many different paths though and you may want to find one that resonates best with you.  ...The difference between Nirvikalpa Sama\u0301dhi and Savikalpa Sama\u0301dhi is that during Nivikalpa Sama\u0301dhi (total suspension of the mind, or trance of Complete Absorption) the unit mind merges in the Supreme Purus\u0301a, and that is why, in that condition, Bhoga (pleasure and pain), Bhogya (that which is to be undergone or perceived) and Bhokta\u0301 (the perceiver), or Jin\u032da\u0301na (Knowledge), Jineya (Knowable) and Jin\u032da\u0301tabha\u0301va (Knowership) do not exist. There remains only an unexpressed Bliss-Entity, whose perceiver remains self-lost in ecstasy, completely oblivious of what he or she will get. Such a condition of the unit entities does not last long either. The Mutative Principle of Prakrti will bring them back to their unit-hood or microcosmic state in order to undergo and serve the unserved Sam\u0301ska\u0301ras. Thus returning to their individuality they feel as though some inexhaustible spring of ecstatic exhilaration of some unknown region is inundating their mind, their soul, their entire entity. \u2013 Abha\u0301vottara\u0301nandapratyaya\u0301lambaniivrttirtasy aprama\u0301n\u0301am.\u2013A\u0301nanda Su\u0301tram After that sense of void when the tide of happiness floods the mind, then one can understand that, that so-called state of want or void was nothing but Nirvikalpa Sama\u0301dhi (The void, because, in the absence of the mind there was no matter or object). The question of breach of, or return from Savikalpa or Nirvikalpa does not arise in the case of one who has no remnant of Sam\u0301ska\u0301ra to serve. Such a lasting Savikalpa is called Mukti or liberation and such a lasting Nirvikalpa is called Moks\u0301a or final beatitude \u2013 salvation. You must have thoroughly understood these two through Ananda Marga way of Sa\u0301dhana\u0301... Also see the comment to the comment below. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cEnlightened\u201d is a loaded word these days. So let\u2019s define terms. In truth, it\u2019s best to think of the path to enlightenment (or self-realization or self-actualization) as a scale. Picture a ruler. Now imagine one end doesn\u2019t end. Instead, it extends to infinity in that direction. Now picture the other end extending to infinity too. That\u2019s the path to enlightenment. We\u2019re all on it because we\u2019re all divine beings. We\u2019re just in different places on it. Also, since there is no \u201cend,\u201d there is no moment when we can say \u201cI am enlightened\u201d really. If we commit to the path we\u2019ll move up the scale and become more enlightened. Our experience of ourselves and our lives will change then too. Maybe we\u2019ll add some amazing power or ability we didn\u2019t have before. Surely then we are more enlightened than we were and than most people. So, congratulations\u2026You are enlightened! And you have wonderful opportunities to continue your journey ahead of you! (As do I!) B. ",

When the Buddha attained enlightenment he knew exactly what he had done, but initially doubted he could communicate it to others because it was beyond the understanding of the unenlightened.The simplest way to check for enlightenment is to see if you ever experience negative mental states. If you do, you're definitely not enlightened (although if you don't, that doesn't prove you are enlightened).However, what you describe does sound like a very advanced spiritual state - insight. Possibly stream entry. Insight is when a practitioner gains some understanding of the nature of reality (as in truly seeing the nature of things rather than just knowing theoretically about emptiness etc). Stream entry is when someone has had enough insight that there is no chance of them falling away from the path, and enlightenment is inevitable. However, even a stream entrant can experience negative mental states until they gain full enlightenment.You've clearly had a major breakthrough - keep doing whatever you are doing! ",

Dukkha is discontentment and suffering. Has dissatisfaction and discontentment with life, the world, etc. ceased? Has suffering like fear, guilt, boredom, etc. ceased? Time will reveal this answer too, because enlightenment does not come and go. If suddenly there is belief in a \u201cme\u201d again\u2026and so suffering, attachment, etc. - then it was a passing glimpse or spiritual experience. If this happens, what is still missing is understanding. For enlightenment is dispelling ignorance (via understanding) and no longer being fooled by the illusion\u2026if the illusion still causes confusion in future, it has not yet been seen through because understanding is still lacking.

            "answer_text": "I think you have entered the path, the first of many steps to enlightenment, and that you should find a teacher, or two or three, and give it time. I personally would avoid much Buddhist approach for reasons of form over substance, obsessions with dogmatic acceptance using a foreign vocabulary, where many of its adherents spend the bulk of their time telling each other that they are wrong, unless you are Indian or Chinese, in which case this would be fine. If, however, you grew up Western, there are far better teachers that will make sense to you and not send you into needless circles for a decade. It sounds like you already started with ACIM, if so, take one year off and do the lessons again. Read Joseph Campbell, Regina Dawn Akers, Byron Katie, Adyashanti, Francis Bennett, as a starting point. There are at least another 100 that these might point you toward, if you are interested, or any of these may have the depth or approach that you want to continue. Another year of contemplative meditation and you will reach an awareness that they are all saying the same thing with different words, then you are truly ready to live it, for Enlightenment, or Awakening as I prefer to call it, is not something intellectual, as knowledge of what is True cannot be taught nor does it have value in its own right, it is merely what we call it when a person is living in the world but not of the world, seeing past the appearances of separation, someone who has discovered who they truly are, and hardly makes decisions with any involvement of their, now greatly diminished, egoic self. This person will demonstrate an acceptance of all, little attachment to the material, automatic trust, forgiveness, joy, patience, generosity, defenselessness, honesty, tolerance, faithfulness, openmindedness, and unconditional love of others.  Good luck in your next steps. Blessings! ",

I\u2019ve met a lady who is one of those and been told about others. Have you avoided killing even bugs all your life? This was the case with Gloria Ambrosia an Italian American women who was found sitting in full lotus posture as a very little girl by her non-Buddhist parents. She even as a young child never killed a bug having the natural keeping of the moral precepts of a Stream-enterer. I would seek out an advanced teacher of Theravada Buddhist insight mindfulness meditation vipassana. Gloria Ambrosia does teachings at the IMS Buddhist retreat center in Barre Massachusetts and is associated with the Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery in California. You could try to contact her through them.  In Buddhist insight meditation one sees the impermanence and no-Self nature of the observing consciousness as well as the object. The higher consciousness of concentration meditation is a temporary liberation only Nirvana gained through insight mindfulness vipassana meditation is a permanent liberation. Gloria is giving a vipassana meditation retreat at the Albuquerque Vipassana Sangha (Albuquerque, New Mexico) on  October 19 - November 4. If you can get off work I would encourage you to go to her retreat if there still is an opening. ",

It's a powerful experience that can resonate in us even weeks after.  Attainment of each Path is usually thought to occur in single steps, although there's no rule for this and more than one step could be achieved at one time. Attainment is usually possible through high levels of concentration, but this also need not happen only to meditators.  Samadhi has been known to occur spontaneously (see Zen and the Sudden Schools).  Samadhi has its own symptoms of deep ease and, most importantly, it facilitates clear comprehension. Fortunate indeed if you attained the Supramundane and not merely Samadhi (which can also resonate its peace and clarity for a long time).  If the Supramundane was reached you will know once your new reorientation with reality settles.  That takes time.  The shock of attainment can be a very confusing time, but once the concentration does wane, and it will, you will be able to recognize better how far you traveled through the arising of surviving fetters.

You don\u2019t seem crazy, if that is what you want to know, other than that, just relax. And when I say this, I also mean that accept the curiosity that you have as well. Just observe it.
