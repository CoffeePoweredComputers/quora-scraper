            "answer_text": "If humans survive, it is inevitable that Western and Eastern philosophy will transform into a unified philosophical experience, and through the transformation individuals will come to better understand the value of and connection of the Western and Eastern views to one another. I agree with some of the prior answers that Western philosophy emphasizes logic and reason as the path to understanding truth, and generally considers the individual to be irrelevant to his or her use of logic and reason in the search for truth. In other words, a Western philosopher (or scientist or mathematician) believes he need not understand himself or herself in the least to move toward truth in philosophy (science or math). Even Morality is compartmentalized, considered solely through the lens of logic and reason, as if morality itself is an intellectual puzzle to be worked out. The closest Western philosophy has come to morality is when the philosopher has abandoned the formal approach and allowed his mind to wander into the forests of intuition rather than sticking to the well paved paths of logic and reason. The fly in the ointment of Western philosophy is creativity. If the purpose of all philosophy is to discover truth, then what is the role of creativity in the process of expanding truth and where does creativity come from. Creativity is not logical yet it is nearly always through creativity that the largerst leaps in understanding come. From the outside, it seems to happen mysteriously. It has, in the case of Einstein, arisen from the lonely space of a mundane patent office, and in the case of Ramanujan, from the dusty streets of a small Indian village. However, while Einstein and Ramanujan made enormous creative leaps in understanding in physics and mathematics, and both were touted as creative geniuses, there are literally millions of people with higher I.Q. scores that have not contributed anything to the expansion of truth. Nonetheless, we still call someone with a high I.Q. score a genius. Why? Because we have no understanding of creativity and that ignorance is frightening to those who cling to and tout logic and reason as a way of expanding truth. When Ramanujan came out of obscurity, his formulae were largely without logical mathematical proofs and he was not particularly interested in providing them; those formulae nonetheless contained truth, but from where did it come, if not through logic? Western minds are happy when genius alights to move understanding forward, but creativity is viewed as a kind of magical quality, as if the creative individual has been sprinkled with fairy dust allowing them to suddenly see previously hidden paths toward truth. Eastern Philosophy takes a different view though ironically, the westernized views of Eastern philosophy tend to obscure it. Instead of beginning with logic, Eastern Philosophy begins with understanding oneself, understanding every aspect of one\u2019s own personal suffering. In other words, unlike Western philosophy, the individual cannot be divorced from his or her thinking; he or she is an integral part of it and must be understood prior to logic, reason, and their kissing cousin rhetoric, running amok. The Eastern approach places primacy on oneself, the individual who is thinking, observing, interpreting his or her environment. In many ways, this is far more scientific and reasonable than Western science and philosophy. While science emphasizes the rigid control of experimental conditions to insure the result can be tied to the factors contained within the experiement itself, there is no effort to account for the variables arising from the individual scientist who is creating, observing, and interpreting the experiment. However, an interesting thing happens in the process of understanding oneself that is often reflected in Eastern philosophy with its focus on understanding oneself first. As one begins to understand oneself, particularly as one begins to understand his or her own suffering, including its origins and the factors that perpetuate it, that understanding leads naturally to changes in one\u2019s life and mind, not changes that are forced onto oneself out of a resolution of conflict but changes that simply arise as the impediments in life are happily dropped from an understanding of their true nature. As these changes arise, creativity begins to alight more and more rapidly and soon, creativity itself no longer appears mysterious or magical. Logic and reason, however, do not become irrelevant; they merely take their proper place in the scheme of expanding truth. The problem with Eastern philosophy is nearly the mirror image to Western philosophy. Floods of creativity can create flights of fancy, where the human mind has difficulty continuing to distinguish between what is genuine creativity and what is merely overconfident, consciously inspired self-aggrandizement, riding the white water of past creative waves. Logic and reason are the touchstones that assist in keeping the creative mind grounded in reality and prevent conscious flights of fancy that are less about creativity than one\u2019s conscious ego suddenly inflated with success, adulation, and pointless fame, that comes when one exhibits creativity others have not experienced. So the expansion of truth within any individual requires both the creativity that arises from the approach of Eastern philosophy and its emphasis on understanding oneself, as well as logic and reason that is overemphasized in Western philosophy, where creativity is viewed as nebulous. The more one focuses solely on logic and reason, the less creativity one is likely to experience, but the more one focuses solely on creativity, the more prone one is to becoming a crazy man or woman preaching to everyone from a street corner near the beach claiming he or she knows god and the end is coming. The elements of Eastern and Western philosophy are actually complementary when one understands the purpose of each in the process of moving toward truth. ",

            "answer_text": "They must! The best I can do is to copy & paste the following, which is self-explanatory (I strongly recommend Philip Renard): Introduction: Non-Dualism, Eastern Enlightenment in the World of Western Enlightenment - Stillness Speaks What we need right now is that non-dual Understanding is getting integrated in our modern western context \u2013 which by now has become a global context. It means integration of two completely different interpretations of the term \u2018enlightenment\u2019. The western interpretation, which has its origin in the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment and its emphasis on reason and mental understanding, is at odds with the eastern one, which is based on an Understanding that precedes the mental one. Such integration is entirely new. Two completely different world views are colliding with one another. Of course such a thing is not accomplished overnight. So, the invitation is to let exactly this happen. To the eastern ways of liberation the most important discrimination possible is the one between the already mentioned two levels of reality: between the level of the timeless, difference-less, always-present Reality, and the level of manifestation, which continuously is changing, with birth, growth, decline and death. The order in which both levels are mentioned here is not arbitrary. Although of course terms like \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 level are not true ultimately, one can still say that it is essential for the realisation of one\u2019s true nature to first dedicate oneself totally to what is true always, to what is \u2018always already the case\u2019: that which is called \u2018first level\u2019 here. The fact is that if you continue to focus your attention on the particulars of the person simultaneously, this will form an obstacle to the view of your true nature that is always present. Hence one can say: make the recognition of your true nature the all-important in your life, the main point. From this recognition you can see that the first level encompasses the second one. The first level is always present within the second one, and this is not the case the other way around. ",
