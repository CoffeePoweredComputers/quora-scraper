            "answer_text": "Descartes is first and foremost an epistemologist. Instead of starting from a set of axioms, and from those attempting to derive models to explain natural or supernatural phenomena, he starts with incrontrovertible knowledge, knowledge which cannot be denied or disputed. He realizes that everything can be doubted. The entire world might be an elaborate illusion created by a malevolent demon. The approach of doubting first is called methodological skepticism and owes its origins, to a large degree, to Descartes. It's an approach still used in much of the sciences. In his first meditation, he considers his own existence. He realizes that he can think to himself and question his own existence. But if he thinks, \"I do not exist\", then who is it who is thinking that? If it is not him, he is not thinking it. But if it is him, then surely he has demonstrated to himself that he exists. Thought, he concludes, logically implicates one's own existence. I think, therefore I am. This becomes Descartes' first principle. A common misinterpretation interprets Descartes' logical implication with causation. He is not saying that thought is the cause of his existence. In fact, in the first meditation, he hasn't yet established causation. The connection is a logical implication meaning that it cannot be true that I think and false that I do not exist. One thing which is interesting about Descartes' first principle is that its justification is entirely subjective. One problem Descartes' had was establishing the existence of other minds. Since our thoughts are entirely private to us, she thinks therefore she is might be trivially true if she doesn't in fact think. So while the implication might be valid, it might also be unsound since we cannot establish the truth of the antecedent. In the subjective case, I think is immediately demonstrated to oneself as soon as one has thought it. This led to the problem in Western Philosophy whereby methodological skepticism starting with private subjective knowledge doesn't provide you knowledge anything external to thought. The various responses to this problem divided Western Philosophy, and there is still no overwhelming consensus on the proper response. Well, that's not entirely true. The closest thing we have to consensus is that we ought to relax epistemological certainty. Nothing we know about the world external to thought can be incontrovertible. That's only a half answer though. It doesn't tell us anything about what we should relax and how. The answers to those questions have further subdivided Western Philosophers who do not take the Idealist response. ",
