            "answer_text": "Implementing AGI may have nothing to do with consciousness. We may discover more about it on the way but IBM's Watson is already generally intelligent with a knack of finding answers on the web. Imagine Watson with a body. It could find howto YouTube videos and perform them. This is a popular engineering problem everyone is working on. There is an important distinction to be made between the soul and merely being aware. A security camera with motion sensors is very much aware, and has an awake state, may make decisions based on it's perceived circumstances, and most certainly is able to communicate with you in case of emergency. This may not be enough to convince you there is a soul somewhere in there, but the slippery slope is established: How much more must it do to be convincing? At what point does it become practical to assume it has one? It may be as simple as having it simulate a sneeze once in a while to have children believe it is alive.  (fig.1. Put Watson in a Muppet) Look at it this way. A doll is a fake person. But after a certain point, it becomes close enough to something that allows us to perceive it as a person. For all practical purposes, consciousness is exactly the same. A sufficient architect will be able to build fake consciousness, and parents would buy it for their children to play with, so to speak. It will be harder to fool an adult, let alone an expert, but at some point we are at least able to play along, as opposed to see nothing going for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes.  (but..)We need some definitions. Intelligence, using my understanding, is an ability to solve problems. Simple problems, like 2+2 = ? , right through to complex problems ... like designing a space shuttle.  Awareness is the ability to respond to the environment appropriately. To do this requires senses, the computational power to interpret those senses and goals. This leads to the unique property of aware agents; the ability to do actions which lead to sensible outcomes which further those goals. In animals, many creatures are aware, but respond to events using hard-wired responses. Consciousness, using my understanding, is awareness on steroids. Simple awareness is enhanced by the ability to build rich and complex world models. It can create and manipulate arbitrary abstractions which in turn means behaviour can be fluid and hyper responsive.  Is it possible to have intelligence without awareness? Yes. Clearly.  Dumb computer programs can solve interesting problems.  They can even beat grandmasters at chess and yet are unaware of threats to their very existence. Mindless evolution has not built a space shuttle, but it has built swans and hummingbirds - which have even more working parts. (And seem a little more robust) (I'd argue that all natural forms have an \"intelligent designer\". But that designer's intelligence was a brute-force stochastic search of the genetic space.) Can we have human level intelligence without consciousness? When we talk about human-level intelligence. It's not clear what that really means. We certainly could envisage a super smart program attached to more computational horsepower than a hundred brains, that could out-perform grand-masters at chess,  design pharma-molecules, solve equations and design exquisite orbital mechanics and all the time not having any representation of its self, its existence or have any agenda. But... If such a machine was unable to answer the question \"who are you?\", I doubt if many people would consider it a \"human level intelligence\". I think the answer is yes, but the notion of an entity with these intellectual resources, but neutered by being stripped of any awareness would be regarded as in-human. ",
