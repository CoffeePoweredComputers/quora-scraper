            "answer_text": "If you want any knowledge, firstly you should have a bona fide guru, in ramayan also when shri ram killed bali, bali had question many thing like he was very intelligent but what bali says was not correct, sri ram said to him that, you are talking in the way that you seems to be very intelligent, but it is not like that so because the knowledge you have is self learned and it have many mistakes, and you have not acquired this knowledge by any bona fide guru, so thats why your knowledge is not perfect. So it is very important to have a bona fide guru, because if without guru also if you acquire any knowledge by your self, then it will not be helpful and will be not benifit to you. Even ram who is god has a guru in ramayan, actually god dosen\u2019t want guru but as god was doing ramayan leela, god was showing that how should a man should be in his own life. And you can find a bonafide guru at any iskcon temple. So i recommend you to go to any iskcon temple. Hare Krishna \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f ",
