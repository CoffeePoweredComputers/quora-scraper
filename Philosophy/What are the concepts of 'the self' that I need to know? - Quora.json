            "answer_text": "First and foremost is the concept of self as a biological organism in a physical world. This is the self as understood by everybody. Secondly is the concept of self as the \u201cagent of action\u201d, or as something that somehow intervenes in a non-random way in the behaviour of the biological organism in a such a way as to be a causal agent independent of prior physical causes. This is the metaphysical entity that is at root of our conviction that we have \u201cfree will\u201d (in the libertarian sense). It is a fiction. Thirdly is the concept of the self as mind (or as an instantiation of conscious experience). This is the self that Descartes rightly declared indubitable. Finally is the concept of the self as the \u201csubject of consciousness\u201d, or as something that somehow \u201cexperiences\u201d the contents of mind. This is another fiction. Now note that the first concept of self is part of the constituents of the third concept of self. This makes the third concept foundational, the proper starting point, but we are (in our default state of ignorance) inclined to overlook this and consider the first concept to be the starting point. This, alongside the metaphysical conviction that the physical world is, at its fundamental level, devoid of consciousness, makes it difficult to account for the existence of consciousness. This in turn leads some thinkers to consider consciousness either an illusion (eliminative materialism, denying the indubitable) or to consider it a product of evolution (strong emergentism, not unlike claiming that at some point in our evolution \u201cmagic happened\u201d). And all because\u2026 we harbour this metaphysical conviction that the starting point is this stuff we call \u2018matter\u2019, stuff that is intrinsically devoid of consciousness. We need to re-examine this conviction if we are to find out way past what Chalmers calls the Hard Problem of Consciousness. Galen Strawson does precisely this in his paper Realistic monism: why physicalism entails panpsychism + Appendix 2006. ",
