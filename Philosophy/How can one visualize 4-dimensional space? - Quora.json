            "answer_text": "Best thing to do, to build up a good intuitive sense for this, is to first analyze what happens when we go from 0 to 1 dimension (point to line), from 1 dimension to 2 (line to square), and from 2 to 3 dimensions (square to cube). Since we already have good intuition for these transitions, we can dissect what happens during these transitions, regarding boundaries, number of faces, volume, and extrapolate from there, towards the fourth dimension. (Credits to John D. Norton, Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Pittsburgh: Four dimensions) We can drag a point along to form a 1 dimensional line;  Its volume is length L, it has 2 faces, which are formed by 2 points.   Now lets drag the line to form a 2 dimensional square;   Its volume is area L2, it has 4 faces, which are formed by 4 lines. Now lets drag the square to form a 3 dimensional cube;   But we can also take 2 of its faces, and connect the corners (marked red);  Its volume is L3, it has 6 faces, which are formed by 6 squares. Now lets drag the cube to form a 4 dimensional tesseract;   But we can also take 2 of its faces, and connect the corners (marked red);    Its volume is L4, it has 8 faces, which are formed by 8 cubes. Now this is hard, so try to find the 8 squares in this one, first;  The small, black inner one, and the large, black outer one are very clear. But there are also 6 oddly shaped cubes (frustum shaped);  They're only shaped this way, because we can't draw 4 dimensional tesseracts on a 2 dimensional surface, only a 2 dimensional impression of their 3 dimensional 'shadow'. For those who read Flatland: imagine how a Flatlander would normally draw an impression of a 2 dimensional square on a 1 dimensional surface, by using highlights and shadings on a line, but now are suddenly presented with a semi-transparant 2 dimensional shadow of a semi-transparant (glass) cube, inside their world;  ...that looks different every time we reposition the cube. Square faces of the cube are sometimes not squares at all, but parallelograms (we can even make the shadow of the cube look like a perfect regular square): how would a flatlander draw this 2 dimensional shadow of a cube on its 1 dimensional surface?. But these 8 cubes we found, are faces or boundaries of the tesseract, and you can slowly flow through all events inside it, by passing from the outer cube to the inner, or left cube to right cube, back to forth, or up to down cube, much in the same way as you can move squares in all six directions through a cube, and pass all events inside the cube in any one of those swipes.  When moving squares through cubes like in the image above, you see the four lines perimeter of the moving square pass through four of the cube's outer squares. These moving squares can pass through all point-like events inside the cube: every square in its path is a fresh new one, that can contain its own set of data, but also crosses the data of the other squares moving through the other directions. When moving cubes through tesseracts, you'd see the six squares surface area of the moving cube pass through six of the tesseracts outer cubes. These moving cubes can pass through all point-like events inside the tesseract: every cube is a fresh new one, that can contain its own set of data, but crosses the data of the other cubes moving through the other directions. Try to envision this passing of cubes through the tesseract in all 8 directions. Start with the easiest one: the outer to inner one, and envision the midway position: all 6 frustum shaped cubes have squares 'cut' halfway in them, which form the surface of the midway cube;  Now morph this midway position in the way shown in the following video, and rationalize what this midway position must look like, when moving through the other 6 directions of the tesseract. How would you move across  the other directions of the tesseract?  The midway position should look exactly like a tesseract cut right in half: the outer and the inner cube both have a square in them, and also 4 frustum shaped cubes have a square in them. Those six squares form a perfect cube in the 4th dimension, that has the same volume as the inner, the outer, and all the other cubes. Understand how the following (hard to recognize) cube is the midway position between moving from the bottom cube to the upper, or backwards;  Now try to envision cutting our four dimensional spacetime, which contains causal world-lines of particles that form static four dimensional objects of our familiar 3D objects in motion;  ...and find how this can have eight 3 dimensional cubes at its ends, of which 2 are made of pure space (simply two 3D space snapshots in time: first and last), and how the others are mixed with time (2 space, 1 time);  Two space axes and one time axis would show the 'stacked time-line' of what passes through a fixed square in our space, which results in a single, unmoving 3D shaped object. The right cube in a tesseract shows the stacked time-line of a right square, and the left cube in a tesseract shows the stacked time-line of a left square. All in-between cubes show all time-stacked in-between squares. Normally in science, world-lines (or, in this case, world-volumes) are shown as if the moving objects limited their movements in only these two registered spatial dimensions, so they never 'step out' of the time registered square: world-lines are never shown broken, because the particle left the registered square (or line). Now, all this is not completely useless brain torturing. Understand that when objects move in respect to you, they always have part of its length of motion hidden in the time dimension (but never further than the space-time angle of light speed), which causes the famous length contraction, although its effect only gets noteworthy at relativistic speeds.  But what you might consider 100% pure time, is in a very real sense actually part of the moving object's space, and vice versa. So time actually has very space-like qualities to it from a physics viewpoint.  Probably an intentional simplification, but Dr. Greene's explanation that time dilation causes the relativity of simultaneity is not correct, since it's the time differences across length of motion that causes this. A phenomenon not mentioned at all in the (pop-sci) video. The movie Flatland is also much fun;  ",

            "answer_text": "Here's an easy way to visualise a four dimensional universe. [Note: time is not a dimension. You can't measure time in inches or metres. This is about four spatial or linear dimensions.] First, imagine a two dimensional, flat world inhabited by two dimensional people. They understand straight lines, circles and plane geometry. Now put some of them on a sphere, draw a circle around the north pole and get them to place a strip of sellotape* (* Other brands of adhesive tape are available) around the outside of the circle, flat on the surface of the sphere. Then they place another strip of tape outside that one. Knowing the width of the tape they are able to calculate quite accurately how much more tape will be needed for the second strip. They continue to lay larger and larger circles of tape. After a while they notice that they need progressively less tape than their calculations predict, so they figure that (flat) space must be curved in some unimaginable way, and then something extraordinary happens. When they get to the equator, they lay a ruler against the edge of the tape and discover that the edge of their circle is dead straight, while their mathematicians had assumed that only a circle of infinite size could have a straight edge. At this point everything north of them is tape but everything to the south is still empty space. Baffled, they continue to lay tape, only to discover not only that each strip now requires less tape than the previous one as they approach the south pole, but also that the edge of their circle is now concave! Eventually they reach the south pole and find themselves, not outside a growing disc of tape but inside a shrinking disc of empty space. At this point they probably stop for a cup of tea, while they think about it. Now let's add a dimension. Imagine you are living in a universe with four linear dimensions and you decide to cover your planet a mile deep in concrete, then another mile, and so on... a thousand miles, a million miles and keep going. If the universe is four dimensional then you might notice, after a while, that you don't need quite as much concrete as you expected for each additional layer. The surface of your sphere becomes less and less curved with each layer until the point when you realise that it is completely flat -- a circumstance you would not have expected unless the sphere were of infinite size. Everything under your feet is now concrete and everything overhead is empty space. The next layer is ever so slightly concave and, from there on, each layer that you pour actually require less concrete than the previous one until you find yourself in the middle of a shrinking sphere of empty space, surrounded by concrete. You'll probably need a cup of tea at this point while you consider how an unbounded volume of space can have a measurable volume that is exactly equal to two times infinity (if infinity is defined as the volume of a sphere with a flat surface) and how the entire extent of the universe can be measurable, yet nothing exists beyond it, because the outside is actually inside it. You have now visualised a four dimensional sphere. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was dumb enough to ask this question of my advisor, and mind you, it was decades ago, he gave a long, soul-searching look, and gave me the best answer I ever heard. \u201cNothing is simpler, Ekke,\u201d he said, \u201cthan visualizing a 4-dimentional space. Just visualize an n-dimensional space, and then let n=4.\u201d Thankfully, I was also smart enough to understand what he meant by the answer. You do not. I had a great advisor. You develop intuition about high-dimensional spaces, but it has nothing in common with visualizing them. We are only humans, and having evolved in a 3D space, have a very limited capacity of visualizing higher dimensions. Some visual models may be helpful, some misleading, most of them part of both, and using the right one, which does not mislead you in your particular pursuit, is a matter of mathematical experience. Accepting your limitations is the first step in the direction of maybe not overcoming them, but rather finding a better way around. Ants have a three-dimensional sense of \u201csmell\u201d, and we humans do not. Can I truly imagine that? Am I misleading myself when I do? The most important question you must ask yourself when you are trying to imagine unimaginable: Am I fitting it in a convenient box, leaving the most important traits outside? Instead, you just develop mathematical tools to think about higher dimensional spaces. 4 dimensions are interesting. You can think, for example, of symmetries of that space. There are 6 Platonic solids in 4D, one more that in our 3D, and there are whopping 7 possible rotations; one of them, called a compound rotation, is not like the others (called basic, as if they really were!). It is just a fortunate coincidence that in 3D we have 3 translations and 3 rotations, so we can think of the rotations about x, y and z axes; in n dimensions, there are (obviously) n translations, but n(n\u22121)/2 of only basic and the whopping, fast growing number of 2n\u22121\u22121 basic and compound rotations together. Can I visualize these complex rotations? No way! Or, maybe yes, I can, but in a special sense. We have developed mathematical tools, such as Clifford algebras, to study these rotation groups. They are important in physics, as many theories operate in 4D (Einsten\u2019s General Relativity is but one example). And of course we are thinking not only in symbols alone when doing math. Sometimes it makes sense to project a higher dimensional space to the familiar 3D or 2D. But first you must be sure you are not leaving out important things when doing this simplifying projection. To conclude, my main point is that your question is dangerously general. There is not one \u201cbest\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d way to think of higher-dimensional spaces. if you find that one of the answers here \u201cworked\u201d for you, lit up that \u201caha!\u201d light in you mind, then you might just got an illusion of understanding. Do not get me wrong; thinking them through is a great thing, but just do not fall into the trap of thinking that any one is a full and final answer to your question, boom, matter closed. Always be afraid of fooling yourself. When I graduated, I foolishly thought I understand a lot. It took me 20 more years to understand how deep is the abyss of the things I do not really understand. And that\u2019s the greatest and the most inspiring thing, intellectually, of my life. ",

            "answer_text": "Most if not all answers assume you take three dimensions and then try to add one, either spatial (positive metric) or timelike (negative metric). Let me try another approach, somewhat in line with the one whose professor asked him to visualise n dimesnions and then let n=4. Let us merge two 2D spaces into one 4D space: You can visualise three dimensions, right? Well, someome said we can only visualise two dimensions, so let\u2019s say you have two dimensions. I, on the other hand, can clearly visualise two dimensions where I am (let\u2019s use our desk surfaces). Now, assuming that our realities do not interact(and since I haven\u2019t seen any sign of your desk around here, that seems a good assumption), then they can be considered linearly independent, and voil\u00e0, four dimensions! You pick a point on your desk and I pick a point on my desk, and we have choosen a point in four dimensional space. It is as simple as that, really! You are not satisfied with visualising a point in 4D space, but want an object? Ok, there is no single object spanning all four dimensions of our desks, since that would mean we both saw it. But let us each make an identical copy of an object - we both draw a square on a piece of paper and place it on our desks. Now, *define* those drawings to be the same object. You move it around in your space(i.e. on your desk) and I move it in my space, on my desk at the same time. Notice how me moving the projection of the object on my desk does not have any effect on the projection of the object on your desk. The object moves in four dimensions. Ok, there is nothing saying that the object should look the same from the two specific viewpoints we have chosen, so you draw an arbitrary figure and I also draw an arbitrary figure. Now consider those two drawings to be the same object. We have created an arbitrary four-dimensional object! The weakness in this visualisation is essentially the same as claiming that a plan drawing and a facade makes a complete representation of a house. (Except that with a house drawing, one dimension is common between the two projections and that is not the case when using projections on two linearly independent sets of two dimensions.) Thus, for a complete representation of a solid object, you would need a second two-dimensional cross section for every point in the first two-dimensions, in much the same way that you need slices of a house along a set of lines in the plan to get a complete understanding of internal heights and walls. Of course, should we want to rotate our object around an axis that is not perpendicular to both desks \u2026 well, that is a bit tricky so I\u2019ll leave that as an excercise for the interested reader. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "I'm loving the other answers. I think the technical side is very necessary, but I hope maybe the following will help to imagine what it would be like to experience 4-D space. If there were a fourth dimension it would be like we are living on one level of a skyscraper, and completely unaware of the other levels. So let's say we are living on Level 1. Everything around you, the air you breathe, the food you eat, what you can see, what you can touch, the earth, the sea, the sun, the moon, the stars are all on Level 1. Now imagine that you find some kind of portal (an \"elevator\" if you will), you press a button, and all the atoms and particles in your body are shifted an inch \"up\" to Level 2. You would be in exactly the same geographical location, but because you have changed levels you can't see or touch anything on Level 1, and nothing on Level 1 can see you or is affected by you.  So you move around and explore Level 2 a bit. Maybe Level 2 is a completely different world, maybe it's inky blackness, who knows? You walk/float/swim a certain distance, and then suddenly the effects of the portal wear off and you snap \"down\" into Level 1. You're back! If you stayed near to where the portal was, you won't have gone far. But if you wandered off, let's just hope you happen to find yourself in the middle of an empty space because you could just as easily find your arm is now part of a wall. Whatever you do, don't climb a hill in Level 2, because if it's not there in Level 1, guess what! Now, what would it be like to be a four dimensional being? Well, your body could well have length, width, and height like a human being, but you would also have \"height\" in terms of \"levels\". So if you were 5 feet 11 inches \"tall\" in the fourth dimension, this would mean your body is present in 71 of our \"levels\" at the same time. Presumably you would have four dimensional eyes, and these eyes would be able to see through the various \"levels\". You might peer \"down\" and see a human on his Level 1 find the portal to Level 2, float around a bit, and pop back \"down\" again. This would be like watching a Flatlander (or let's say a checker piece) somehow hoist himself up off his world and fall back again. Let's say you want to help the humans. \"Hello, I'm a four dimensional being, but you can call me Fourd if you like. Let me show you my world.\" So you take a string of four-dimensional beads, and drop them \"down\" through Level 1. What would the humans see?  As the bead on the end of the string passed \"down\" through Level 1, they would see a sphere suddenly appear in front of their eyes. Although to you, Fourd, the carvings on the beads are unchanging, the humans see an undulating pattern as the bead passes \"down\" through their \"level\". Then comes the end of the first bead, and the string connecting it to the second bead. The humans see the sphere contract into a little ball of a different colour, with a different undulating pattern. Now the second bead. The humans see the ball again transform and grow into a sphere, just like last time, with the same undulating pattern. Unfortunately the humans still have trouble visualising the whole object, because they cannot see \"up\" or \"down\" through the fourth dimension like Fourd can. All they see is the part of the string of beads that is passing through their \"level\" at any one time... (If anyone finds any holes in this conceptualisation I'll be grateful.) ",

            "answer_text": "The concept of hyperspace is Amazing! Even \"supernatural\" phenomenon could possibly be explained with Higher Dimensional physics. For example, GOD, if he would ever exist, would do so in the 4rth Dimension. Even \"Ghosts\", if real, would have the ability to walk through walls just because they would have access to a higher dimension. We humans live in the third dimension. However, there is a way to visualize objects in 4D. CROSS-SECTIONS As 3-Dimensional beings, we cannot visualize 4-Dimensional space, let alone an object/a being that is present in it, at least, not directly. We can, however, see their cross-sections.Let's start from the ground up. A 2 dimensional object passing through a linear world.Consider a 2 Dimensional object, say a circle, that is going to pass through a linear space. As it passes through this space, it will appearas a point that gradually increase in length, then decrease and finally vanish.  \u200b[The dark red lines are the intersection of the circle as it passes through the 1 Dimensional space, which is shown in bright red.] Moving on...A 3 Dimensional object passes through a 2 Dimensional space.  \u200b Consider a Pyramid that would pass through a plane. As it passes through, what is seen on the plane is a small point that gradually grows into a square that increases in size. If there are beings on this 2D world, they would witness this.   \u200b A 4 Dimensional object passes through a 3 Dimensional space.So, when a four dimensional object passes through our world, we would witness a 3 Dimensional object that changes size.  \u200b What we are seeing is just the cross-section  of the 4 dimensional object. It could be a blob, or anything that constantly  changes size. How do 4D objects look like anyway? We haven't seen a 4D object yet. There are only assumptions. To give a small example, let's look at the case of a tesseract, a hypercube.  \u200b Wrapping a line around 4 points gives us a square [1D -> 2D]. A square pattern (cross) when folded in space, gives a cube [2D -> 3D]. Similarly, across formed by cubes when folded, gives us a 4D object called a Tesseract, or a hypercube. The exact formation is complex. You can read more about this here : Tesseract.  Although it is hard for us to comprehend higher dimensions, we cannot drop the possibility of Hyperspace.

            "answer_text": "There are already some very nice answers to this question. However, here are a couple elements I would like to add that haven\u2019t been stated very clearly in my opinion, which helps me quite a bit in visualizing higher dimensions in a cartoonish way. First, if we see a cube like this below and rotate it so we are looking face on, the square of the back face is drawn smaller for clarity because it is implicitly further away. It is this shift in perspective that is often overlooked when explaining visualizations of higher dimensions. If we were to walk into the face-on view, we know, like in a video game, we would walk along that corridor to the other side of the cube. If we looked back, we would see the corridor from which we came. The second issue here is the confusion associated with treating each face and vertex equally. For example, the corridor would look much more corridor-like if we put a door on each end, hung paintings on the side, put a carpet on the floor, and hung a lamp from the ceiling. This really emphasizes we are moving into a new space with a distinct path and endpoint.   The classic tesseract, represented as a cube within a cube (shown from wikipedia), is very similar in that the inside cube is drawn smaller because it is implicitly further away moving into another spatial dimension independent of the usual x-y-z. Walking into a 4th direction would qualitatively look no different to us than walking in three dimensions. It is just another direction. If you imagine the inside cube as being a distant room, it would appear smaller standing with the outside cube. Moving into that 4th spatial dimension, you could walk down that corridor to the distant room. However, once you arrived at the inner room it would just be another room; indeed, it could be the same size, or even much larger than the room you were originally in, depending on how the perspective was drawn! Like with the ordinary cube above, visualization of the motion can be cluttered by monitoring every face and vertex as if they were exactly the same. If you look directly down one face of the tesseract into this 4th direction, it would look very much like the corridor of the cube viewed face-on above. Put a couple doors on each end, a carpet, a lamp, and some paintings and it would look exactly corridor-like, but you are just walking into a different spatial dimension. In addition, if we started with six observers in our original room, all looking directly into each face of the tesseract into that 4th spatial dimension, all of them would also see a distant room. Each could travel directly toward it and meet us inside as if the motion were ordinary.  For example, if you had a closed 2x2 meter cube with a door on one side, you could open it and walk down a long corridor (that would not appear particularly unusual, just another 3D experience) to a 20x20 meter room! If the 2x2 cube was open from all sides, people sitting around the 2x2 cube could watch someone walk into the cube along this 4th spatial dimension toward the inner room; the person walking would appear to get smaller and smaller to everyone standing around the 2x2 cube. The walker gets smaller from perspective as it moves further away. Robert A. Heinlein uses this idea to describe the powers of the protagonist to make objects in 3D get progressively smaller than disappear. Without wanting to sound too frivolous, this is also exactly the principle behind how a tardis from Dr. Who is bigger on the inside than the out. When you enter the door of the tardis, you walk along a 4th spatial dimension to a distant location, which happens to be a larger 3D space than the outside. This gives the illusion of a big 3D space being inside a smaller 3D space. Here it is, explained by the Doctor himself, emphasizing the perspective approach to visualizing a 4th spatial dimension I described above.  ",

            "answer_text": "Time is not real, but changes are real. Time is not 4th dimension at all. Time as 4th dimension in theory of relativity is actually 4th dimension of space (distance) in disguise. Think of space-time diagram. Units on time axis is \u2018ct\u2019 which is measure of distance, not time. Nothing is moving at speed \u2018c\u2019. Only light is mov9ing at a speed \u2018c\u2019. Speed of the Earth is 30 km/s and of the Sun is 230 km/s. We mostly use earthly time i.e. second, minute, hour, day, year. This is the only time that is known to man kind. This time is set by the Earth and the Sun only. This time is not speeding up or slowing down. It passes at its won rate - one earth second is equal to 30 km. We can say that speed of time we use is 30 km/s. Speed of light is 300,000 km/s - second here is earth second. There are 9 billion oscillations of a cesium atom in one earth second. We do not use time based on speed of light or based on oscillations of a cesium atom. Time is not real, but changes are real. To know time, we compare one change with another change. Our earthly time is based on changes occurring around us i.e. sunrise, sunset, changing seasons. These changes are due to rotation of the Earth on its orbital path around the Sun and also on its won axis. This time is not relative. This time does not dilate. This time does not stop at speed of light either. But measuring devices of time are affected by force of gravity, by force of acceleration or by any other force. This is why clocks in space read dilated time. That is why we adjust that dilated time to earthly time in GPS system. An observer also measure dilated time due to speed of light which is not instantaneous. Observers are part of the group of measuring devices. Earthly time does not dilate at all and it is not relative. It does not speed up. It is set only by the Earth and the Sun. Change or time is very unique on specific object. In fact, there are as many times or changes as there are objects in the universe. We do not use other times as they are not practical. ",

            "answer_text": "The 4th Dimension is enigmatic. (I\u2019m no science expert but I will try my best to share what knowledge I have about this topic.) So, now it\u2019s \u201cQuestioning the fabric of reality\u201d time. Starting with the basics, imagine being a perfect dot (a 0th Dimension entity) in a 1-D Space. You have no width, only a certain length in forward or backward direction. You can only move in a narrow line of zero width, the X-axis. What you see in front of you is another dot followed by another then another till infinity. Think about being in an infinite tunnel. Now to that dimension, add the Y-axis. You can now not only move in unidirectional straight lines but move so in any direction in your plane or move in a curve or zigzag or go haywire as you wish. That is what we call a 2nd Dimension or Flatland. Imagine that dimension, filled with a population of 2D people called Flatlanders. I don\u2019t think that I have to explain 3rd Dimension to you as well but in short: add Z-axis to the plane so the movement is possible in heights as well. Understanding the perspective of a Flatlander :- Take a piece of paper and draw a figure on it. Now, imagine if you were a flatlander living in the plane of the paper, how will you comprehend the object. All you may see are lines but if you try to feel the object you will that it is smooth in all directions(a circle) or it has edges(a polygon) or weird curves(whatever you call that).  Question: How can these flatlanders comprehend our 3rd Dimension? Answer: Cross- sections. Things are going to get tricky from here. Imagine a 3D object passing through a 2D plane. Flatlanders can\u2019t see the object as a whole due to restricted vision but can comprehend it by the its variation through time. So, where were we? Yes, an object, say a sphere, passes through Flatland. As soon as it touches the plane, a tiny dot, the base of the sphere is seen or rather comprehended by the flatlanders. As time passes and the sphere crosses Flatland, the dot seen by the flatlanders gradually grow to a circle of increasing radius. The radius increases until it reaches the centre of circle and then the circle decreases in radius returning to a dot(top of sphere) and then vanishes. Now again imagine yourself as the smartest guy on Flatland. You see this phenomenon, join the dots and circles and are finally able to comprehend the object as a whole. Maybe these pictures can help :    Thus, by using these slices they can form their own mental composition of the projections they see.   A 3rd dimension being to them is like :  Now coming to the real question: How to visualize 4D? Things are going to get tricky from here( Part -2 , Level : Mind F**ked) The process is same. Imagine the earth with its XYZ axis as a flat 3rd dimensional plane (Yippee Ki-Yay flat earth society) and imagine a 4th dimensional sphere called a hypersphere passing through this plane with each circle on our place equivalent to a 3d sphere. If we analyse these components of this hypersphere, we can visualize it the same way the flatlanders visualized us.    Thus by joining all the spheres and all other wierd shapes formed, we \u201cmay\u201d visualize how a hyperspace object may look like. Fun fact : A Tesseract is a 4th dimensional entity. Keep this in mind that this explanation is just a way to explain the concept and in no way represents the real deal. If we keep on adding further dimensions to it, it gets way beyond human comprehension. We get every possible concept of logical and physical laws. We get the concept of existence itself. The real question is not why anything exists, but if anything does not exist.  EDIT : Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM \u2014HESOYAM ",

            "answer_text": "We are already seeing the 4th dimension 'in one degree'. [Note: the real 4th dimension is the 4th dimension in four degrees]. Any form of manifestation in time is seeing the 4th dimension. Not all 4-d objects are hyper-cubes, which sort of goes without saying. The typical 4th dimensional thing is simply 'highly manifest'. Manifestation (e.g. manifestation in time) is what measures the 4th dimension. If you can see people moving like snakes with trails of their bodies behind them, that is seeing the 4th dimension. This effect is typically called Motion Blur: Motion blur [Wikipedia] This may be possible by exaggerating one's memories onto the refractive lens of one's eyes. Motion blur is also analogous to the many arms of Vishnu: Vishvarupa [Wikipedia], a significant contribution to universal theology. Certain drug experiences have a similar effect, although I don't recommend them. Sometimes drug experiences are psychic only at the cost of actual mental function. This is something you may find interesting: one time someone commented, saying 'Why do his arms look long and blurry?' I think he was commenting on how I had increased the manifestation of my body, making the 'time-snake' more manifest than usual. Call it the 'art of not dying' if you like. If you focus on more than one moment in time simultaneously, then you have a chance of increasing your physical or spiritual manifestation, and thus, becoming more like a time snake. Sometimes it feels dirty though, because there's two parts of your body. Arguably that means more sweat, and more stink. Otherwise, the side-effects might be better memory and better brain function. And a lot of the functions might take place between the third and fourth dimension for most people. ",

            "answer_text": "I've written this in an article form\u2014  Our world is three-dimensional one. But what is it like to be in a dimension beyond it? What is it like? I'd like to answer some of these questions here. Let's get started ! ! ! As we know our world is a three-dimensional one. But one may even think about a dimension higher than ours. Well to some it doesn't exist. We can't exactly make a four-dimensional thing but we can project a hypothetical 4 d object on a 2 d object. First of all, for this we'll have to understand 0,1, 2 and 3 dimensions. Consider a point, it is of no, or 0 dimensions but extend the point sideways and you'll have a line or one dimensional object. If you further extend the line, we get a two-dimensional object that is a square. If we further extend a square upwards, we get a three-dimensional cube. So to get a four-dimensional cube, we just have to extend the cube outwards and we'll have a peculiar shape commonly known as a tesseract. A four dimensional cube is also called a tesseract.  \u200b Although the dimensions also change with the size of an object. But by ignoring that point, movements and shapes in the 4th and beyond dimensions also exist. But this doesn't just end here. With every change in dimension, the rotation also changes. For example, let's take a point. A point can't undergo any rotations but if you take it to a higher dimension, you'll find that you can rotate it. But the rotation is limited. You'll just find a piece of line rotating on a two-dimensional surface and a two-dimensional object rotating. It'll be just the same but the object will be bound by 4 line segments. But if you're rotating a three-dimensional cube, the rotation is just as normal as rotating cubes. However, in the 4th dimension, the rotation changes in two axis and we get a peculiar rotation called the double rotation. Your can watch a rotating tesseract on youtube by searching 'Rotating tesseract'. Thank you all !! https://www.oyewiki.com/education/exploring-the-4th-dimension-3-2-2018 ",

            "answer_text": "I have two methods. The first is to close my eyes and analyze what I am seeing behind my eyelids. If I hold my hand out in front of my face but keep my eyes closed, I realize that what I am visualizing is in a space altogether different from the space where my hand is located. I imagine that that is the fourth dimension. This is mostly effective in convincing myself that there can be more than three dimensions, not necessarily in visualizing what the 4th dimension looks like. The second method is to ponder a description of what three dimensions would look like in a two dimensional world. You can find a great description here:  http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/polytope/ And by the way, I am of the opinion that we should change our terminology.   Knowing that particles exist which have no mass, indicates that existence itself, or location, or point is the first dimension.  This is what is often called the Origin.The second dimension is that which has the ability to be measured: a line.  It must contain at least two distinct points, thus length, Origin (say, zero), and distance from Origin.The third requires at least three points that cannot be connected by a straight line, or two intersecting lines to create a plane. (x,y) on a co-ordinate plane, but x and y being relative to zero, or the Origin.the fourth, two intersecting planes.etc.Post script:  I have fun with this whenever I think of the supernatural. Think of the way ghosts are depicted in films.  Could it be that the fourth dimension is where we go when we die? ",

            "answer_text": "Start with visualizing 4-dimensional objects, which is easier than assumed. Consider the following\u2026 The most simple 1D structure is the line, and it is defined by two distant points. The most simple 2D structure is the equilateral triangle, defined by three equidistant points on a plane. Not only are they separated by equal distances, but by 60 degrees. The most simple 3D structure is the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron is a three-sided pyramid, defined by four equidistant points. Its sides and base are equilateral triangles. From this pattern, we can deduce that the most simple 4D structure must be defined by 5 equidistant points. But where to place the fifth point isn't obvious, because all possible directions have been exhausted, making the visualization of the 4th dimension a big challenge. Where do you go after the 2nd orthorotation while keeping all the rules? It turns out that the most simple structure of 4D space is two tetrahedrons occupying the same volume. However, when a 4D tetrahedron is projected into 3D space, it becomes a hexahedron, made up of two tetrahedrons joined at the base, and congruent, and pointing in opposite directions. The top tetrahedron represents a real object in 3D space, and the bottom tetrahedron represents a phase of that object in the past or future. This is an alternative to illustrating the 4th dimension using an animated tesseract which involves cubes occupying the same volume and transitioning from the potential to the real. Now it becomes more obvious why time is called the 4th dimension. Produced using SpeechToText PRO. ",

Consider, if a three dimensional person (with height or z direction movement) enters into the room, if the room is closed, as the 3D person, he has the ability to move in z-direction. So, he moves in z-direction without opening 2D wall or line, he can enter into it. By seeing 3D person inside his closed room, the 2D person asks, \u201chow you entered inside my room when it is closed?\u201d The 3D person replied, \u201cI\u2019m 3D person, I have one more dimension called height, so moving in the 3rd dimension, I\u2019m able to enter your room without opening it!\u201d But 2D person get confused after listening this, as he was not able to feel or imagine the same.

            "answer_text": "We first have to clarify what we mean by the 4th dimension. You could mean Einstein's 4th-dimensional space-time continuum. We can imagine that just fine -- at least the non-revelistic parts -- because, well, we live in it. The other idea is the mathematical 4th-dimensional space, in which case time becomes the 5th dimension. I will address the latter, because I deem the former to be trivial. Imagine, if you will, how your visual system works for 3D. You have 2 3D eyes with 2D retinas, and a brain to reconstruct the 3D from them. Now, do the obvious transformation. You have 2 4D eyes with 3D retinas with a brain to reconstruct the 4D scene. Note that your brain can still remain 3D. It just needs to be wired to these 4D retinas, so the optical nerves will be a bit thicker, etc., but those are \"unimportant\" details. Think of how your brain would reconstruct that scene. Try to \"see\" through those 4D eyes yourself. You have to think very carefully about this, but if you try it enough, you should be able to get a glimpse of what 4d vision would be like. That is, if your brain does not explode first. Doing this led me immediately to the insight that -- ignoring the impossible physics for a moment -- flipping your 3D body into the 4th dimension would lead to non-containment of your organs. They would -- along with your blood and all -- just slip out and drift everywhere. The poor Flatlanders would have the same problem.  I answered this back in December 2014, almost 6 years ago. Long time(!). Back in the 80s, I was keenly interested in visualizing 4 dimensions, and I actually wrote some software to help me with doing that. And the software was actually based on this book:  It gave you a thorough treatment in how to handle the 4th dimensions, based on creating objects with vertices and edges. It steps you from doing this in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions, and then progressed to the 4th dimension. And so, I wrote a program to allow you to do the same \u2014 to input those edges and vertices manually, whereby it would render the object for you and allowed you to rotate it in 4D. It was only wire frame, and ran on DOS, but I had some inclinations on doing something with rendering polygons instead, color-coded so you could follow the transformations better. With today\u2019s graphics capabilities, I could do much more. Maybe I will at some point. It was this effort that gave me the insights you read above. ",

            "answer_text": "So after watching the movie and reading the book \u201cFlatland\u201d, each several times, and watching a few videos about the development of a video game in which your character travels through 4-dimensional space, I feel like there's a way to imagine it, albeit somewhat abstract. In Flatland, the main character, a 2-D pentagon (I'm pretty certain he's a pentagon) observes a sphere passing through his 2-dimensional world at one point. The way he observes it, in a 2-D world, is a line growing in size (the sphere enters) then shrinking in size (the sphere leaves). Basically, it's as though (if you consider the event relative to our character's point of view) another 2-D plain was passing through. Bring this to a 3-D plain, and we can imagine a 4-dimensional being entering our 3-D plain in much the same way, only this time, we observe it as a 3-D being entering (through a 2-dimensional area) our plain, then exiting (through another 2-dimensional area). Basically, you would see a constantly changing 2-dimensional image (because our vision is a 2-dimensional projection of our 3-D world) of the 3-dimensional slice of the 4-dimensional being. If you were this being, and you were walking, you would be walking through 3-D plains. Every step you take puts you in a different 3-D plain. Just like 2-D plains are infinitely stacked in order to create a 3-D plain, 3-D plains are infinitely stacked up in order to create a 4-dimensional plain. In the 3-D plain, you pass through an infinite number of 2-D plains. The next logical step therefore is: in a 4-D plain, you pass through an infinite number of 3-D plains! Get it? Got it? Good. ",

            "answer_text": "No one visualizes Four-Dimensions! Never has it happened that any physicist has seen the view from four dimensions. Mathematically, any number of dimensions are possible to include in a mathematical problem. The problem faced is that a dimension must always be independent of any other dimension. This amounts to recognizing that all drawn dimensions must have angles between themselves and any of the other dimensions, of 90 degrees. This can be written mathematically because mathematicians do not need to restrict their research to the real Universe. Now for physicists, anymore than three dimensions to visualize is impossible. There is; however a solution. The solution to having to accommodate more than three 90 degree angles is to introduce a theory where one declares 90 degrees to exist in each and every angle, but, calculates as if 90 degrees is variant, similarly to applying the Lorentz transforms to angles. This amounts to taking the two contradictory views of Relativity Theory. Relativity Theory says that when such contradictions involving dimension occurs. the official explanation is that the angles remain at 90 degrees as measured, while simultaneously adopting a model where there are not really any 90 degrees in each angle. This is not sleight of hand; however, it is sleight of logic. ",

            "answer_text": "Without the Motion, you can not visualize\u2026 The first 3 spatial dimension is to define a stationary object.The fourth dimension is to define a stationary object in the Universe. (Due to the continuity of the Expansion)The Fifth dimension is to define a moving object in the Universe. All of them are macro cosmos definitions of dimensions as coordinates. While you are describing the size of an object, you use the size (size, length, width) in the macro scale. Since expansion of the Universe is uniform for all objects at all points, you can not visualize this as easily. Yes there are some mathematical definitions for dimensions as you see in the other answers. According to this all dimensions should be orthogonal to each other. But actually \u201cbeing orthogonal\u201d is an assumption arising from the state of the first three spatial dimensions.Because of that when we try to visualize 4 and above dimensions, we can not draw a comprehensible visual. Because I think, we determine the concept of dimension superficially. At first, all thing are made of the Energy. The Energy is composed from energy packages called as quanta. The Quantum is plural term of it.We should determine the concept of the dimension in the perspective of quanta without conflicting with macro definitions. If a quanta is non vibrating, it has zero dimension. (As point)  If a quanta is vibrating in a direction, it has 1 (spatial) dimension. (as a line)  If a quanta is vibrating in 2 direction as orthogonal, it has 2 (spatial) dimension. (As photon)  If a quanta is vibrating in 3 direction as orthogonal, it has 3 (spatial) dimension. (As mass)  If we look at the common feature of all, \"the dimension\" is the vibration field for a quanta. It is necessary to continue the concept of dimension in the perspective of vibration. By summing these fields which are on the same direction, we can obtain any measurement as dimension at macro universe.  _ _ _ _ _ If you turn 3d orthogonal vibrations into 2d you will get a plane and the angle between spatial dimension will be 120 degrees. Only with this condition, these three can be intersected with a new one as orthogonal. In my opinion, when the all energy were still in the 2d form as fields at the beginning, by the effect of the Time, they turned into 3 form.     (This means also the Time ensures continuity of 3 dimensions. Without the Time, all matter with mass will turn back its 2d form as energy fields.) When The Time is defined as a vibration field for the quanta in the perspective of the dimension concept, The Time is not sourced from the matter quanta. (However, the first three spatial dimension was sourced from the quanta of matter.) Because the Time is sourced from the expansion of the Universe. At first, which kind of a medium can expand? (I think the Universe as a medium at here because of included energy density). If the medium has a more pressure than outside, the medium expands.Another explanation is the fluctuated medium can expand in a stagnant medium. I think, the Space is always full with quantum as like a sea with water molecules. Before the Big Bang, all these quanta was stagnant with non vibration. Because of that, we determine them as in singularity. After an impact in this texture in a point, the symmetry between them was broken. The effect of impact has spread out as a wave. As the wave of this effect have dissipate, the scanned area by it also has fluctuated. Also, due to energy density differences between wave in and out, a echo wave released back into this area with same period. (1 period in a Planck Length as wavelength and a Plank Time in frequency)  These waves are the source of the Time. These waves are different from what we know at a few points.Firstly, there are convex slopes as they spread from outside to inside. So as you progress, the power they transfer increases. In addition, they are more like gravitational waves than electromagnetic waves. Their frequency is also the highest vibration in the Universe. So their speed is C.We determine the reference Time frame, according to the wave order which is passing our point at the Now. The closing waves are waves of the Future and the waves had passed the now, are the wave of the Past.A few of them as all defines any Duration.  These waves are transferred by the quantum, whether vibrate or non vibrate. But in the medium with vibrating quantum, they are effected a little bit. (We define this case as the Time dilation) Because the Time waves are scanning all three spatial dimensions at the same time as equally. And forcing them to keep their positions as open constantly. This is a vibration movement for the quanta. It is unidirectional, regular, continuous and discrete. It also prevents the Spatial Dimensions from being curled up and closing.  I think, this is a visualizing tool for the fourth dimension.  You can imagine that all universe while expanding also scanned at every expansion stage by echo waves (time) of it.  (Illustration for while the Universe is expanding, the echo waves released into it ) Note: In order to see if this perspective would work, I dealt with various issues under the same perspective. I produced answers.I add the links some of these answers to the comments section below. ",

            "answer_text": "All of us are familiar with three dimensions \u2013 length, width and depth. So though, on the face of it, it seems to be very unlikely that there could at all be any four dimensional or 5 dimensional objects but, the fact is, it is not so. Just think of the moon taking rounds of the earth. When we look at it from the ground level, it appears to be travelling around the earth along a two dimensional path only because, while standing on the ground, we can\u2019t see neither the earth revolving around its axis at a speed of about 15\u00b0 per hour minute nor travelling around the Sun at an average speed of 29.291 km per second as shown below - not even the moon revolving around the earth though the moon is also revolving at such speeds along with the earth in the space.  But supposing you moved out into space to a point from where you could have seen not only the moon revolving around the earth but even the earth revolving around its axis as well as travelling around the Sun you would find that in about four days the moon has travelled along a spiral path, which is 3 dimensional, as shown below.  So you find that what appeared to be a 2 dimensional object from the ground level has turned out to a 3 dimensional object. Obviously if a 2 dimensional object could turn out into a 3 dimensional object a 3 dimensional object should turn out into a 4 dimensional object. Though we may only imagine how the 4 dimensional and the 5 dimensional objects should look like but we have to believe that the same way as a 2 dimensional object could have looked like a 3 dimensional object, if you moved out to a point in the outer space from where you could see even the Sun up-heaving above and down-heaving below the galactic plane and the Sun travelling around the centre of the black hole of our galaxy as shown below, even the 3 dimensional spiral path would turn into a 4 dimensional object and what could have appeared as a 4 dimensional object would turn out into a 5 dimensional object, isn\u2019t?  Though I agree, we may not be able to see the moon from that far away through our eyes without a telescope but we can\u2019t say that it is not possible to even conceive existence of 4 dimensional and 5 dimensional objects. It is up to you to decide whether the 4th and the 5th dimensions are curled-up spatial dimensions as assumed in the string theory or not. According to me time is not a dimension. It is only one of the coordinates that tells when a point may have had the coordinates (x, y, z) or (r, h, \u0398) or (r, \u0398, \u03a6) or the other spatial dimensions. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my answer, pasted in from my book \u201cFields of Color\u201d, which explains Quantum Field Theory to a lay audience: SPACE-TIME ISN\u2019T 4-DIMENSIONAL The most challenging and non-intuitive of all the concepts in the general theory of relativity is the idea that time is part of space\u2026 Our brains can take us only so far because it is so nearly impossible to envision a dimension comprising three parts space to one part time, all interwoven like the threads in a plaid fabric. \u2013 B. Bryson (B2003, p. 125-126) Of course space-time is four-dimensional in the trivial sense that it takes four numbers to specify when and where an event takes place, but that doesn\u2019t mean that space and time are equivalent. In QFT, as in Einstein\u2019s theory, space and time play separate roles in accord with our natural perceptions. The idea that space-time must be viewed as a four-dimensional entity was introduced by the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski. In a speech at Cologne in 1908, he expressed this view with great eloquence: Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality\u2026 It is only in four dimensions that the relations here taken under consideration reveal their inner being in full simplicity, and that on a three-dimensional space forced upon us a priori they cast only a very complicated projection. \u2014 H. Minkowski (E1923, p. 75, 90) Einstein, however, did not subscribe to that view; he called it \u201csu\u00adperfluous erudition\u201d. When adapting Minowski\u2019s mathematical formalism to describe the gravitational field, Einstein had to add the \u201cimaginary\u201d number i to the time term. This makes the equations more compact and easier to work with, but Einstein was careful to distinguish the formal aspect of the notation from reality (emphases added): The discovery of Minkowski\u2026 was of importance for the formal develop\u00adment of the theory of relativity\u2026 The four-dimensional space-time con\u00adtinuum of the theory of relativity, in its most essential formal properties, shows a pronounced relationship to the three-dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical space\u2026 Under these conditions, the natural laws\u2026 assume mathematical forms in which the time coordinate plays exactly the same role as the three space coordinates. \u2014 A. Einstein (E1961, p. 63) Einstein is saying that the four-dimensional notation is useful for physi\u00adcists; it is a convenient way of handling the mathematical relationship between space evolution and time evolution that is required by special relativity. One might almost say that physicists couldn't live without it. Nevertheless, space and time are different, and I say shame on those who try to foist and force the four-dimensional concept onto the public as essential to the understanding of relativity theory.

            "answer_text": "Hi!! Amigo\u2026 When I first got to know that there is a word 4th dimension, the only question I thought was how is it possible. This troubled me for few months and I forgot about it later. Suddenly a few days ago, ideas and ways to imagine the 4th dimension struck my brain. See the thing is, what we the inhabitants of 3D world know as 2D is exactly what 3D is to the 4D world. Take it simple, when we draw a 2D plane, there are two line perpendicular to each other. When it is 3D, 3 lines are perpendicular to each other. Then there might be a possibility of 4 mutually perpendicular lines!! The coordinates of the point will be (a,b,c,d) just that simple. One more thing, when we try to forcefully immerse a 3D sphere in 2D space, it shows a small circle then a little bigger, biggest at a point (diameter) and then decreasing again. Similar is for a 4D sphere in 3D world. A small sphere, little bigger, biggest, then decreases and finally disappears. Just think if you are playing a super Mario game, if the player turns by 90\u00b0, the image of Mario somewhat mixes and it seems that it has turned, but for the screen it has just mixed. Although we know that it has practically moved through a 3D space and then it seems it has turned. You can draw a 4D cube in your copy. First try to draw two squares and as you join the corresponding vertices, you get a 3D cube. Do the same for two 3D cubes. You get a 4D tesseract. Complicate the thoughts by simple logic. Hope it helps. Plz upvote. Thank you!!  This is how it will look.. ",

            "answer_text": "The Space in which we are currently living is 4-dimensional space. This sounds strange if you haven\u2019t studied theory of relativity. According to the theory of relativity, space and time are not two separate things but these are mixed together like fibers in a cloth and always exists together. Time is the 4th dimension which is used to describe the position o a particle. Everything you see in this universe occupies some space and also affected by the flow of time. Lets say for the instance, a tree, it occupies some space and also grows larger, becomes old and finally dies as the time flows and this concept applies everywhere. 3D is only the measure of a particle\u2019s shape, size and volume but 4D not only tells about the shape, size and volume of a particle but also tells its position in space. For example if a car is moving from one place to another then it is moving in 4D because the time co-ordinate for the car is also changing which means that at time T=0sec the car was at point A but at time T=10sec it has reached point B i.e, its position is changed with time.

            "answer_text": "Hmm. That pesky fourth dimension happens to be at right angles to all three of the other visual ones. Kind of hard to visualize, right? We need a starting point (in as many senses of the word you like). I used to use the analogy of 2d-seen-from-3d; Rudy Rucker's book on the subject was a huge help.  Also, if you take a line (two points of  any real distance apart) and have a point off that line in 2-space the  same distance from either point, you have created an equilateral  triangle (of course). Take a point and move it up in 3-space from the  three points, and you have a tetrahedron. Take the next point and have  it somehow similarly equidistant from _all_ _four_ _previous_ _points_, and, presto, there is a 4d object (pentatope), created by moving that fifth point in your elusive fourth spatial dimension.  From then on, the next step I would recommend would be exploring a solid  representation of the aforementioned pentatope. The most familiar representation will have a point nested in the center of a tetrahedron, connected to the four outer points by equidistant lines. These lines will be shorter than the lines which connect the points of the actual tetrahedron, because after all, the point you can feel inside isn't actually off in some fourth spatial dimension; it is considered to be a type of 'shadow' in 3d of the 'actual' fifth tip, or 'vertex' of the 4d pentatope/object. The entire object is, in fact, a 3d shadow of a 4d object. Another excellent starting point is to think of where the past went, or where the future is coming from. While some may protest the use of time as a sort of stand-in for a spatial dimension (a la Minkowski), others may suggest that the two are functionally equivalent. After all, a frozen scene corresponding to a a point in time, say, for instance, exactly 24h ago still 'exists' somewhere; something had to exist to create the 'now' you are at this point in time aware of. Even if you remain stationary in your current frame of reference, you can be thought of to be moving forward some-'where'. It can be no less frustrating than using analogies or mathematical abstractions to be stuck with time as a degree of freedom when all that one really wants is that elusive, tantalizing fourth degree of space firmly in their mind's eye. However, for the strict purpose of getting started, the use of touch and 3d sculptures of simple 4d polytopes, as well as imagining the line connecting past and future 3d scenes is probably the best way to visualize with our 3-d brains.  (PS Keep in mind that we can visualize precisely and only in what we are actually using. Therefore, not only do our internal 'points', 'lines', and 'polygons' have some kind of 3d quality to them, even a frozen scene in 3d space can be thought of as being as 'thick' as the time taken to draw the scene with light. Time is a component in our current understanding of reality whether we like/understand it or not.) ",

So combining the mental representation of time and space is a problem physicists have been struggling with ever since the special theory of relativity.  The only way I know to imagine 4-dimensional spacetime is to reduce it 2 dimensions(that can be plotted in an X-Y graph): one of space and one of time. Now, any object's speed through this spacetime is constant: if you increase your motion through space, you decrease your motion through time (and vice versa). This does actually happen, which leads to the interesting phenomenon of relative time dilation. ",

            "answer_text": "The notion of the fourth dimension was introduced in the 19th century by Charles Howard Hinton. He invented the so-called \u201ctesseract\u201d to illustrate his idea. Early in the 20th century, the notion of the fourth dimension was embraced by art critics to explain Cubism, and by theoretical physicists trying to explain Einstein\u2019s theory of space-time. The fourth dimension became virtually synonymous with space-time but it is a mathematical view, divorced from common human perception of space and time. For one, it fails to clearly define the notion of space. Space means different things to astronauts, theretical physicists and architect. The Chinese long ago synthesized space and time aesthetically. The unity of space-time is at the heart of the classic Chinese painting, a scroll that takes the viewer through a landscape like a movie. The Chinese explained the notion of space-time is this way: \u201cWhat comprises the four points of the compass together with what is above and below: this is called Yu (space). What comprises past, present and future: this is called Zhou (time).\u201d This image illustrates the Chinese view of space and time:  This type of projection is known as an axonometric projection, the Chinese version of linear perspective. When Charles Howard Hinton made his initial illustration of the fourth dimension for his book on his notion of the fourth dimension, he also used an axonometric projection. See here: Views of the Tesseract Hinton explained that gaining an intuitive perception of \u201chigher space\u201d required that we rid ourselves of the ideas of right and left, up and down, that inheres in our position as observers in a three-dimensional world.

            "answer_text": "imagine how a person (you) living on a peice of paper (2D) would see something that happened above the paper (3D). So you are moving around in your paper world, and you see some two dimensional shape. then some 3 dimensional being picks up the shape off the 2d paper and moves it to the left and sets it down. You would see the shape disappear and reappear a little bit to the left. Amazing! Ok now lets take 3D to 4D. You are a person living in a 3D cube. You can see the current positioning and state of everything in 3D at the current time. Now a 4D being alters the environment. This could be moving an object in some foreign dimension so that it reappears somewhere else like in the first example. Or it could be as familiar as time altering the flowers appearance (wilting). The flower's position is not changing. Its not moving up, left, or sideways. Yet we can see it changes which is proof that the dimension exists (you can see it change over the dimension of time). The reason people often equate time with being the 4th dimension is that it is one example of a 4th dimension. But the 4th dimension can be positional just like the first 3 are. We just don't observe the kinds of changes that a 4th dimension change brings. Even when we watch a flower wilt we aren't observing it getting older, we are merely seeing the affects of the change.

It's something nobody on Earth can yet come close to understanding beyond mere theoretic conjecture. ",

            "answer_text": "I had three of my own theories to get to know about 4 dimensional space. But at the last stage of each theory, you would have to visualise on your own. First one,I this theory i used the fact, that as 1 dimensional space is embedded in 2 dimensional space and 2 dimensional space bieng embedded in 3 dimensional space. Similarly the 3 dimensional space will be embedded in 4 dimensional space, and so on till the end of dimensions! (i told you that you have to think on your own.) 2. Second one, Thisis quite easy to understand but the toughest to Imagine. Generally till three dimensions we get all the 3 axis perpendicular to each other. So to find the fourth dimensions, it would be easier to find 4 perpendicular lines meeting at a common point. (Understood!!! Now imagine.) 3. Third one, It is quite simple and based on Geometry, now consider the following :(take out a graph paper if you can, to help you) In 1 dimension : point (1) is 1 unit from origin. In 2 dimension : point (1,1) is \u221a(12+12) that is equal to \u221a2. In 3 dimension : point(1,1,1) is \u221a(12+12+12) that is equal to \u221a3. So in 4 dimension : point (1,1,1,1) is \u221a12+12+12+12) that is equal to \u221a4 ,which is equal to -2 and 2. Now imagine the type of graph paper you would use to get it. These are some of my own theories about 4th dimension. A secreti want to share is that i imagined all the images but when i would lookat them, they feel me so awkward that my mind corrects them back again in 3D. That's the reason why i am unable to post any photo or video related to it. Thanks for reading it. ",

Actually we can't perceive the 4th dimension literally.People often try to explain it with projection method for example if you have a cube, light, wall then keep the cube in light and see the shadow on wall, the shadow will be of 2 dimensions, square if aligned well. Similarly we may think our universe (that we observe 3d) is nothing but projection of 4d space as you said hypercube can have 3d projection which is likely to be cube in well aligned position.Now according to general relativity (not string theory), the fourth dimension is assumed to be time! We perceive Only one way journey through this dimension, it's ever running in one direction as entropy.On the other hand string theory says there are 10+1 dimensions but we can't see all of them because they are too small to be observed (you can watch Brian Greene's explanation on higher dimensions at YouTube).

            "answer_text": "What you need to think, is that pictures and maps hang on the wall, are views of 3d from 2d. The room itself is a 4d picture of 3d. If it is a map, things don\u2019t fall. So you can draw plans of cities and so forth by imagining things floating around the room. The second thing to consider, is that some things are described according to the equations like h=0, (ground), and h=0, r=10 (fence), while other things are described by their dimension, eg a line or a point. In 3d, you have everything as three signs, eg =,=,+ (meaning two divisions and one internal dimension). When you make it four-dimensional, you have four dimensions, eg =,=,?,+. Whether you put an = or a + depends on whether it\u2019s a division (= signs) or a union (+). A line in the sand is a division. Specifically gravity divides space into height and surface, and the line divides surface into safe and unsafe. So it\u2019s actually two = signs. It becomes ==++ in 4d, a 2-d space. You can compare lines and 2d spaces against this meaning on your 3d room-as-plan. A knife cuts. Specifically, a solid is cut (=), by the sweep or time-motion (=) of the blade, so it too is two equal signs. Your bus-route is on the other hand, a line connecting source to destination, ie it\u2019s a union or \u2018+\u2019. This means that the 4d bus follows a linear track too! When you come to look at city blocks, these are divided from each other by roads. But roads are things that go from place to place, and that a road is ==+, gives in 4d ===+. Since only two equal signs divide the surface, roads no longer divide, and you can walk around without thinking of blocks. ",

M\u00f6bius strip and Klein bottle animations can help too.  But consider this: humans can't really even perceive three spatial dimensions very well.

            "answer_text": "Most of the answers here deal with the difficulty of envisioning four spacial dimensions (and many do that well). However, I suspect that the question is prompted by the assertion that time is a fourth dimension. To envision this you don\u2019t need any mathematics. At any given moment of time, you can say how far the earth is from the sun, the moon from the earth, or a plane from an airport, or a pen from your hand, but those measurements are only valid for that moment of time. The measurements evolve over time, so to say where something is relative to you (for example) we need to say how far it is in front (or behind) of you, to the left of you (or the right of you), and above you (or below you), and we need to say when that was true. So time is the fourth measurement we need in order to say when the other 3 measurements were valid. That does not tell you how time is used in physics. That is more complicated and I won\u2019t try to answer that here. But I will echo others who have said that measurements of time are not like measurements of distance. You can\u2019t go back and measure time again: it is a bit like measurements of distance made of distant stars, you can\u2019t go back and measure where they were last year. And time has different properties from space. You can rotate an object in space, so length becomes breadth (say) or length becomes height. You can\u2019t rotate an object in space/time so that length becomes duration. A length in space/time is either space-like or time-like or exactly midway between (null), and no amount of rotation or change of speed will alter that. ",

Time plays a key role as a dimension in mathematical formulations of physical laws and theories such as general relativity and string theory.  A viewer from the fourth dimension would see both our insides and our outsides simultaneously. Higher-dimensional viewing allows all sides of an object to be seen simultaneously. Being in 4-D space has some rather strange properties. To imagine what some of these might be like, let's again use a lower-dimensional analogy. Let's say that a square in 2-D space has both a defined front and a defined back. If we were in the plane with the square, we would not be able to see its back if we were looking at its front.

The object which has only length and no breadth or height is said to be of one dimension or 1D. For example, a straight line. Now, we draw a square on the sheet of paper. We need its length and breadth to describe it. But still, it has no height or thickness. We see a cube or say a box in simple terms. It has length, breadth and height. So the line is 2D and the box is 3D. What do you think of a point? It has neither length nor breadth or height. Yes, it is dimensionless or 0D. So, we conclude that there are four types of dimensions viz. 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D. Have you ever wondered about 4th dimension? It is believed that Einstein could see things in 4 dimensions. But I clearly say that Einstein did not have any special organ which enabled him. But, about 4D I too agree that it is possible. I have framed two theories which are strong enough to prove it. Firstly, yet simple; A square, 2d figure composed of four 1D figure called line. Now, draw a cube on the paper. We can perceive it as 3-dimensional, and made from six 2-dimensional figure called square. Similarly, if we look at 3D object we are actually perceiving it\u2019s 4-dimension figure. Secondly, a square is composed of four lines, a cube is composed of six squares. So, a 4D object can also be called as square of cube, must be composed of cubes that can be unfolded into say ten similar cubes. Such 4D is structure is also named as \u2018tesseract'(Yes, the one movie Avengers).  Now, I hope these proofs are strong enough to prove something exist in 4th dimension and if this theory is extended then we can make upto n dimensions ",

            "answer_text": "The fourth dimension is generally understood to be time. Einstein has taught us that time is related to a distortion of space. He calls it \u201cspacetime.\u201d Space is curved. Velocity distorts it and distorts what we think of as time. It may be that whatever dimension you exist in and can move around freely in, you would experience the next higher dimension as time. I once visited a print graphics facility that had a room that was about 15\u2032 high x 10\u2032 high x 60\u2032 long. This was quite some time ago and digital photography was not a thing. At one end of this room was a very large camera hanging in the center of the 15\u2032 x 10\u2032 space. This camera appeared reminiscent of those old cameras from the 1800\u2019s that a photographer would stand behind with a black drape over his head to keep light from exposing the film through crevices on the back side. Only this camera was huge and probably custom made. The photographic plates on the back of it were probably 2 foot square. There were tracks on the ceiling running the length of the room and there was a screen hanging from the tracks. When I peeked in, the screen was about 40\u2032 from the camera and advancing slowly toward it. I thought, whatever is on that screen is only two dimensional but it is clearly experiencing the third dimension as it moves along the rails. It only experiences the third dimension one \u201cmoment\u201d at a time though. Similarly, when the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie came out, there is a scene where the supervillains are imprisoned on a two dimensional rectangular plane that tumbles through space. They have become two dimensional beings, only experiencing the third dimension incrementally, like we experience time. Maybe if we lived in the 4th dimension instead of the third, what we currently call \u201cthe past\u201d or \u201cthe future\u201d would simply be a different physical location. Analogies are rarely perfect and since I haven\u2019t seen this one from another source, it\u2019s probably very imperfect or all together wrong. Let me know. ",

            "answer_text": "One method I've come up with to visualize spaces of more than three dimensions is as combinations of spaces that are easily visualized.For example, one could think of a 4-dimensional space as being a line (a 1-dimensional space) of which each point corresponds to its own 3-dimensional space; a typical 4-dimensional figure would be one which existed as 3-dimensional cross sections through an indefinite number of 'adjacent' spaces, similarly to how a typical 3-dimensional figure exists as 2-dimensional cross sections existing on an indefinite number of 'adjacent' planes (bear in mind that, while this method of thinking of a line of spaces is enough to include and comprehend all of the points in a 4-dimensional space, it does not include ALL of the possible 3-dimensional spaces in that space, similarly to how the indefinite number of 'lined-up' planes that can be used to visualize a 3-D space don't represent all of the possible planes in that space). One can also visualize even higher dimensions using very similar methods, for example a 5-dimensional space as a plane in which each point represents its own 3-D space, a 6-dimensional space as a 3-D space in which each point represents its own 3-D space, and so on.

If your grasp is clear, you should understand why you can't knot or braid curves in 4D, but you can do so with a surface and a curve. You should be able to visualize an entire duocylinder in its native 4D environment, and understand how objects can rotate in two perpendicular planes without distorting. The reason why 4D has the most regular polytopes (analogues of platonic solids) of any dimension is child's play to you. Seriously. Humans suck at understanding geometry and topology even in 3D space, that's why wooden puzzles exist, and adults get flummoxed by them. If you understand 4d space, you are in the remarkable position to prove or disprove the smooth poincare conjecture with just a leap of intuition. The math can come later. Do exotic spheres exist in 4D? How many? ",

            "answer_text": "How can I learn to think in 4 dimensions? I'm not sure I understand the question but here goes: I think, therefore, I am. You can think because you are conscious. According to the 'Davies Hypothesis' you have consciousness when your brain uses the three aspects (dimensions) of time, 'real' time, (present), which relates to the senses and understanding our environment and circumstances, 'unreal' time (past) which establishes knowledge & supports memory and 'imaginary' time (future) which allows us to anticipate the future, plan and contemplate the abstract. The latter aspect also drives dreams. Imagine that you are walking in the savannah and you spot a lion using the 'real' time component of the brain. 'Unreal' time (memory) tells you that a lion is dangerous. 'Real' time, (ie interpreting the senses), tells you that the lion is close or far off; is hunting or not; playing with her cubs etc. 'Imaginary' time formulates a plan of action; flee: get in your car: climb a tree (Not if your 'unreal' time component of the brain recognises an image of a leopard) etc. All this happens, more or less, at the same time giving very, very fast response times. You can gather from this that you are already thinking in three dimensions but what of the fourth. I fear that this is impossible in our universe as this extra dimension belongs to that absolute nothingness that I term the 'Pleroma'. If you could think in this dimension, I believe you would know the future. ",

Some people, I include myself here, are equally capable of thinking in imagery, tactile, and analytical processes.  Just lucky. I very much liked your method in explaining dimensional visualization and I think it may be helpful to many in gaining an understanding of not merely what dimensions are and how to visualize them, but in how the mind works to solve seemingly impossible problems.  Thank you, Alon. ",

And I am a mathematician so please save the usual arguments. it is easy to prove that no fourth dimension is possible and in fact any 10th grade geometry student can do it. Four dimensions requires four mutual perpendicular axes. Any two of the axes define a plane. The other two axes have to be perpendicular to this plane. Thus they are parallel to one another. But all the axes must be mutually perpendicular. Axes can\u2019t be both parallel and perpendicular. We are talking about Euclidean space here so bye-bye fourth dimension. ",

It is like this,as both dimensions-fourth & third-i.e.time & space are perceived in different form.Space perception is associated with forms of physical energy wherese time perception is associated with forms of psychic energy like motion/movements/thinking etc. Things with very slow changes like stone burried deep down in the globe earth can't show any time dimension and things like thoughts can't show any space dimension i.e can't show any physical form as it has motion. To visulize motion/movements/changes you need to still it and it means motion has converted into non-motion i.e.time has converted into space. If you extend space i.e.if you put space into motion,it is converted into time. thanks Q guru ",

Viewing 3D of space, and navigating though time, is effectively navigating a 4d space, even if you are ultimately looking at a projection onto a 2d screen or eyepiece.  Another example is to look at twins fighting with ultrasound. This image lets you see inside the 3d bodies and they move in time, which takes up the fourth dimension.  The best way to grasp higher dimensions is to understand lower ones. In \u201cThe Planiverse\u201d book by A. K. Dedwney, a 2D universe with 2D creatures is described. For them, time is the third dimension, and it is easy to imagine a 3d solid as a space-time continuum. After you have understood this, it is easier to take on the notion of 4D as the space that is orthogonal, or at ninety degrees, to the entire 3D space, even if you cannot visualize the data without projection or dimensional reduction to 2d for the eyes.

Is it space and time, or just an extra spatial dimension to the 3-D we can measure. If it includes time, then our consciousness IS the best way to visualize 4-D space-time. If, however, it is an additional dimension, I would say that is more in line with what is actually going on in reality. Multiple conscious beings are experiencing a shared consciousness aka shared reality, versus personal reality, aka self or ego. This allows for shared local measurements. But distant measurements would be delayed due to value of c in a constant medium. But we should allow for are those unknown delays to be redefined as echoes of larger or smaller domains of a possible hyperbolic space. ",

In the cards above, you can imagine that each progressive card going upwards the circles describe a cone.

Square) is taken out by us and left in our world. He is astonished to see things changing their size and shape. The shape or size he see is basically depending on the distance between him and the body. He cannot see 3d things and thus gets a 2d image of what he sees. Thus when he would see a 3d person's face, he would see a point ( tip of nose ) change into circle and oval and so on when he comes near or go gar from our face. The same thing might happen when we are left into a 4-d world. Our brain is evolved or created so as to decode 3d things and not anything from further dimensions.

We are learning and must be able to remember what we learn. It\u2019s similar to taking pictures in our daily lives. But there is no time as Einstein would have us believe. It seems he made it up to cover his inability to figure out the physical reasons causing relativity., and there are physical reasons. In short there is no real fourth dimension.
