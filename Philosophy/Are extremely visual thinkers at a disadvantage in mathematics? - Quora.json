            "answer_text": "There are some very visual fields in mathematics, for example geometry and trigonometry. Some abstract problems can be turned into visual problems with enough practice. For example, combinatorics is often about the positioning of objects or people. Therefore, it depends on what branch of mathematics you refer to. You mention statistics, some forms of statistics are very combinatoric in nature. My major has lots of statistics so I can verify that personally. The basic distributions are much easier to understand if you think about them visually. When first learned them, I thought it was just memorizing a bunch of formulas. Once I learned to think about them visually, the binomial, geometric, negative binomial, and hypergeometric distributions became SO MUCH easier to deal with. The way I visualize binomial is having x successes and n-x failures. You can picture successes and failures in your head however you want. I will use X for successes and O for failures. If n is 6 for example, you could have this: 1 success: just picture the arrangements where you would have 1 X with 5 Os It could be XOOOOO it could be OXOOOO it could be OOXOOO etc\u2026 THAT is what (nx)(nx) refers to. You rearranging the items as many ways as possible. Then the pxpx represents the probability of having that many Xs. The (1\u2212p)n\u2212x(1\u2212p)n\u2212x represents that all the rest are the complement. The way I visualize geometric is by having 1 success at the very end, and the rest are failures. If x is 6 for example, you could have this: OOOOOX If x is 4, you would have this OOOX The success is always at the end. That success is at probability p, all the rest is at probability 1-p. The way I visualize negative binomial is to realize the very last one HAS to be X. Then the other ones could be rearranged. So when you look at the probability that the 2nd success happens on the 6th attempt, you already know there are 6 terms, and the last term is success. Therefore you could have any of these: XOOOOX OXOOOX OOXOOX etc\u2026 The way I visualize hypergeometric is more complicated: Both the successes and failures could be rearranged. Therefore, you need to multiply the number of arrangements of successes (out of all the successes in the population) by the number of arrangements of failures (out of all the failures in the population). Then, to make it a probability you have to divide by the number of arrangements possible when it doesn\u2019t matter if you are dealing with successes or failures. Since the geometric and exponential distributions are memoryless, sometimes conditional distributions can be simplified visually as well. The uniform distribution is possibly the most visual of all, it is just rectangles. Also, thinking about the normal distribution visually helps out a lot as well due to it\u2019s symmetry. As far as pure math, I don\u2019t have as much experience with that. ",

            "answer_text": "NO NOT AT ALL!! Thanks for A2A :) I am a visual learner as well! It doesn\u2019t matter if you are visual learner or Auditory learner. Especially, in math you can visualize everything. You didn\u2019t specify any topic in your question that is hard for you to visualize, so I will tell you about some important ones. Geometry:- In geometry, you mainly learn about properties of shapes, are, perimeter, proportions etc. You can make 3D models of buildings like World trade center or Burj Khalifa, Petronas tower etc, and try to make them proportional to the actual building. You make also make a model of leaf (hard one) and analyze that. You can make models of some monuments as well. You can design your own building maybe? You can find the area or volume of your model and then maybe use proportions, to find the area of actual building! There are lot of 3D modeling softwares out there which you can use. Algebra:- GRAPHS! In algebra you can have a lot of fun! You can go to websites like Desmos | Beautiful, Free Math where you can model many things like a cup of coffee cooling down. You can also make your favorite cartoon character\u2019s face. Like for making a round shape, use an equation of circle. For Square use peicewise functions etc. You can also make patterns using desmos. Like this one:-  There are so many cool things you can do on Desmos that will need you to apply your math skills. You can even watch you tube videos about modelling a character using functions. Here\u2019s another example of creating patterns using desmos, which demonstrates the double slit experiment:-  You can see on the left hand side there has been many functions written and have certain domain and range. You can do the same thing on Desmos. Again, you didn\u2019t specify me what exact topic you want to visualize so I just gave you some range of Examples that I use and generally all students use. Hope this helps! P.S if you have any more questions, ask me in the comments section ",

            "answer_text": "No. Every mathematician perceives math in his/her way. Jacob Barnett is a kid who is a math \u201cgenius\u201d, and he is a visual thinker. Terry Tao is known to being one of the best mathematician alive, and he confessed that he does not really get Topology, but he translates it into Geometry (No, they are not the same thing). So you can find a way to translate the equations (or whatever) into visual ideas. Besides, there are so many math topics that are visual, so you can try to find a way to translate the abstract ones into visual and structured ones. ",

            "answer_text": "I think anything with geometry can be very visual, and visual thinkers can be at an advantage. However, I think that although subjects like abstract algebra and number theory can be visualized, they are more like learning a language: there is a set of symbols and notation that really have to be learned and manipulated in the way one learns (e.g.) French. This can always be translated into imagery, but it is hard\u2026 Also, at the higher levels, subjects like geometry involve a lot of terminology and notation as well, so if you can\u2019t learn that very well, you are at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, maybe some of the best mathematicians are highly creative, and what is like learning linguistics to me, is just \u2018mental imagery\u2019 to them\u2026 ",

In such cases, visual thinking might be a boon. For instance, while jumping into 3D geometry from plane geometry, visual thinkers will no doubt learn faster and much better than others. A visual thinker with adequate practice must be able to succeed in Mathematics. ",
