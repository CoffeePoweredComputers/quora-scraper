            "answer_text": "In my mind it is essential that you know what you want out of high school. Then you can make the most of the opportunity that you have in front of you. Most students drift, they allow peer pressure to push them this way and that, and tbey end up wishing they had worked harder and got more out of school. I taught adult are entry classes. Young adults, - and some not so young, who take the opportunity to return to school. They now know what they want out of school and work to get it. Don't let time drift by so you too wish you had worked harder and not wasted valuable time. ",
