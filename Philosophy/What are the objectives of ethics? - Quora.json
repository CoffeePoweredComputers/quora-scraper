            "answer_text": "The most pervasive, but simple, answer to that question: what are the objectives of ethics, can be summarized this way: How does a thinking person ever arrive at an \u201cought\u201d statement and justify it? Yes, it\u2019s really that simple \u2014 and that difficult. Consider this conversation: MOE: This is an easy question. You ought not to commit murder or rob people. JOE: But why, Moe, why? MOE: Well for one thing, God tells us we ought not to do those things. JOE: But does God disapprove of certain actions because they really are wrong, or are they wrong because God disapproves. In the former case, God is simply rubber stamping what is self-evidently unethical; in the latter case, God\u2019s will is arbitrary. In either case, you haven\u2019t gotten any closer to really answering the question. MOE: Ok, Joe, so try this. We don\u2019t need God if we use evolution in the way that Richard Dawkins does. He says that genes try to spread themselves, by promoting behavior that leads to the survival of beings with the same genes\u2026 i.e. humans. JOE: So, you\u2019re assuming that survival of our genes is somehow morally superior to not surviving? MOE: I guess so, yes. JOE: But Moe, that\u2019s an erroneous assumption. Survival is not automatically a moral good. The Buddhists believe that Nirvana is better than being reborn\u2026 so the Buddhists take the position that survival is NOT a good thing; it is not a moral imperative, and there is no \u201cought\u201d we must follow. And I can punch lots of holes in the idea that survival is always a moral good. Is it good for Hitler to have survived to adulthood? Is it good for Great White Sharks to survive? What about cockroaches? So, just because social conventions might lead to human survival, you are no step closer to producing an \u201cought.\u201d Maybe, from the standpoint of other species, it would be better if humans did not survive. I\u2019d just like you to try to prove otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "First we must ask, What should ethics achieve? If ethics are to promote our life in society, then the specific objectives should be commensurate. Our life, as human, is fundamentally different from other animal life. We may develop concepts, based on precepts, based on sensation. Other animals are limited to the perceptual, or sensation. We refer to our unique nature as \u201csentient\u201d or intelligent. But unlike animals, we have to choose to be human, to use our conceptualization. We may act on a perceptual level partly, to be more like an instinctual lower animal, or not. That is our constant choice, second by second. The more we think, the more we actualize our humanity and our uniquely effective means of survival. The less we do so, the less our chance of survival. Therefore, our code of ethics must coincide with our humanity if we are to optimize our life, physically and mentally. Codes do that in varying degrees. Some do the opposite, are inhumane. Societies employing these inhumane codes exist to the extent that they are NOT practiced fully, but hypocritically. For a consistent ethical code based on reason, logic, rights, see \u201cThe Virtue of Selfishness\u201d by Ayn Rand. For the opposite, see any religious or superstitious code. ",
