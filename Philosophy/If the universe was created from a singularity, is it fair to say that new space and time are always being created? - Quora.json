            "answer_text": "Absolutely. At the \u201cPlanck time\u201d instant of the Big Bang explosion, Space began expanding outward. Time also was created at the same time the \u201cnew\u201d Space was created. The so-called \u201cDark Energy\u201d is responsible fore expanding \u201cSpace\u201d of the Universe. It is my hypothesis that \u201cDark Energy\u201d was/is the result of the Big Bang explosion, by creating two three-dimensional pressure waves that \u201cstretched\u201d and expanded Space. Time is the human measurement of the expansion. It continues as a part of Space, and therefore we have Space/Time. But Time is NOT a dimension, it is a measurement.  Times travels along all three dimensions, as Space expands, the measurement of time ticks away. As long as there is Space, time will exist. However, by my hypothesis, Space will eventually slow down. Mainly because the expansion of the Universe \u201crequires\u201d work energy to be expended to continually \u201cstretch\u201d Space by \u201cDark Energy.\u201d Since this \u201cDark Energy\u201d does have a finite amount of energy to expend, this energy will continue to be consumed doing the work of expansion until the \u201cDark Energy\u201d will finally be used up. Just saying\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s fair to say that although I would not say space and time are always being created as space and time are metrics that measure real things (distances, rates of actions) but themselves are words that refer to the mathematical measuring tools that makes them metrics; they are not substances or forces themselves. And, here is what I think it might look like, the geometry of this continuous action:  ",

            "answer_text": "Cosmologists don\u2019t believe that there was a singularity in the beginning, just a very dense, hot state. Laws of physics tend to not work when taken to an extreme. Rolling back the expansion to a singularity is on such extreme, which is one reason they don\u2019t believe in it. Another reason is that eternal inflation is a favored model (google it), where our Big Bang is a bubble in an eternally inflating greater context. ",
