            "answer_text": "Briefly put\u2026 Aristotle (ca. 350 BC) excelled in at least sixteen fields, who wrote several academic textbooks which were authoritative for over a thousand years. These include: Natural Sciences: Physics, Astronomy, Geology, Botany, Biology, Anatomy, Zoology and Psychology.Humanities: Logic, Metaphysics, Ethics, Politics, Rhetoric, Poetry, Drama and Art Criticism.Epicurus (ca. 300 BC) excelled in Ethics, but all that remains of his writings are three lengthy letters to his friends. Epicurus wrote that all we can know comes from our five senses; that Pleasure defines the Good; that we live only once; and that death is just nothingness.In the past 2,300 years of the study of Ethics, scholars tend to dwell on Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics more than the writings of Epicurus.
