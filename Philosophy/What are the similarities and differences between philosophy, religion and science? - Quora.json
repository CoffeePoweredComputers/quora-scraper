            "answer_text": "Religion: Acceptance of ideas is based on tradition, superstition, or personal interpretation. The acceptance is without evidence and is either absent logic or logic is treated only superficially. Consensus is isolated without a control group. Challenge is almost nonexistent even when ideas are clearly wrong. Vested interest in ideas is usually at a national or organizational level but can be international or localized. Annual support in the US is $800 billion. Philosophy: Acceptance of ideas is based on tradition or personal interpretation. The acceptance is without evidence, but is logically consistent. Consensus is mostly isolated but can include a small control group. Challenge is rare. Vested interest usually does not extend beyond a department level for universities but can be much broader in conjunction with religion, motivation, or self-help. Annual support in the US is $15 billion (mostly for self-help). Science: Acceptance of ideas is somewhat based on tradition but can include personal interpretation for new ideas. All ideas must be supported by evidence and be logically consistent. Consensus is pervasive but can be isolated in highly specialized areas. There is usually a control group but this is not always possible. Challenge tends to be inversely proportionate to the age and commonality of an idea. For example, ideas that have been around for centuries and examined by many people tend to have all the problems worked out and won\u2019t have grounds for challenge. Conversely, newer, more specialized ideas will tend to have more challenges. Even so, older ideas do get updated when there is sufficient evidence. Annual support in the US is $170 billion (mostly for basic research). When people try to defend religion they will usually appeal to philosophy. They rarely appeal to science, but when they do, it usually involves flagrant misrepresentation or cherry picking. When people try to defend philosophy they usually appeal to science, however, this normally involves intuitive arguments. When people try to defend a scientific position they usually appeal to evidence. Speculative science can involve intuitive arguments but these seldom prove correct over time. ",

            "answer_text": "The universe presents itself in three experiencible dimensions: matter, mind, and spirit or energy, consciousness, and purpose. Each domain gives rise to specific areas of learning associated with them. Awareness of the phenomenon of the material Cosmos of energy coupled with the desire to understand the meaning and explain this phenomenon gives rise to science, awareness of the spiritual Cosmos of values coupled with the desire to know, experience, and integrate them into our lives gives birth to religion and spirituality, and philosophy is born out of the awareness of the facts of science and the values of religion and the urge to \u2018make sense of\u2019, to co-ordinate, or unify these diverse dimensions. Philosophy becomes, therefore, the arbiter between the two - ceaselessly endeavouring to align the facts of time (as understood by the scientist) with the ideals of eternity (as understood by the religionist). Science focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on the \u2018inanimate\u2019 aspects of existence - the non-volitional, and utterly passive realities of so-called \u2018dead matter\u2019. Religion is primarily concerned with the domains of the \u2018animate\u2019 - the volitional, reactive, proactive living beings. Philosophy is concerned with the development of a system that intelligently integrates these. Science is concerned with the quest for the Grand Unifying Theory - the theory that can explain all material phenomenon. Religion is concerned with the the Great Brotherhood - the familial association of all living beings, mortal and divine, the Children of God. Science is interested in releasing the hidden power of matter. Religion is interested in releasing the hidden potential of each individual and the collective potential of the great cosmic Brotherhood - the great brotherhood of the children of God. Philosophy explores how we can align the power insights of science with the wisdom appreciation of religion and most effectively realise our potential. It becomes, then, inevitable that ethics are a primary area of interest for philosophers. The reality is, though, that these areas of interest overlap - especially as science peers deeper and deeper into matter and biological systems. Science is essentially blind to truth, beauty, and goodness, blind to love, duty, honour, and nobility. Such things are \u2018matters of the heart\u2019. Almost everyone will concede that to live in ignorance of such things is hardly to live at all. Nietzche once said: he that has a WHY can bear with almost any HOW - meaning that so long as life has a purpose you can endure almost anything. Religion offers us the supreme WHY: \u201cLOVE\u201d, love of one's self, fellows, family, country, God: it offers us the great ideal of personal attainment - to be perfect even as the Paradise Father is perfect. Science teaches us about the Cosmos and how all energy is related. Religion teaches us about the Creator and how all living beings are related. Philosophy looks at the hows of science and the whys of religion and helps us construct a way from what is to what ought to be. The key tools of science are reason and imagination, of religion faith and imagination, but philosophy must make effective use of all three - imagination, reason, and faith. There's a lot more one could say on these subjects and even this statement is only a rough draft but it's a reasonable primer. ",
