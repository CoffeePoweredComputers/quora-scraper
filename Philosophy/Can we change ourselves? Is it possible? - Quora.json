But firstly we need to consider some points like for whom we are going to change or what would be the result of changing yourself\u2026the most important thing is that the person for whom you wanna bring a change,will he accept you after that or why does he want to change you\u2026remember, if you change yourself, don't do it maximum otherwise you will lose your real identity for what you were known.. Change is good but excessive will destroy you ",

You can't change because you are afraid of failure and think that change is scary but don't let that stop you because what you think are trully not worse then the situation on. So embrace the change and let go of that fear that have been stopping you from changing. Remember only you can change yourself. ",
