            "answer_text": "That depends a great deal on your moral code and to a certain degree what you really want for them. I have found that lying to make people happy might make them happy for the moment, but when they discover it is a lie, not only are they not happy about whatever you lied about, but now they are also unhappy because they know you lie to them and cannot be trusted. Notwithstanding, whatever you lied to them about, they may have made decisions with long-term effects that they aren know unhappy about because they were bad decisions. But, if I don\u2019t like you, I may lie to you to make you happy because I know it will make you more miserable in the long run. Or if my ethic/moral system is based totally on what benefits me, then such lying would not be wrong. One might argue though that to lie to make someone happy may serve a greater purpose, like making someone happy so they will stop bullying or harassing or stalking someone. Like, saying you keep unnecessarily detailed records of customers that will make your auditor happy so he only visits once a year instead of quarterly. In this sense, \u201cappeasement\u201d might be a better word than lying, even if you are lying to appease. But, one must always consider if the truth wouldn\u2019t make them happier, especially in the long run. ",

            "answer_text": "I think not. My personal preference is for radical honesty. Really. I know lots of people think they want that, but they don\u2019t. I actually do. I don\u2019t like even white lies. Of course there is a place for them. If someone is really excited about their new haircut they just love, what good will come of telling them you think they look like a bad 80s clown? None. That would be cruel. So keep your mouth shut. But in most cases when we tell ourselves we\u2019re lying to be kind that is the biggest lie of all. We lie out of fear. I used to love shopping with my (now ex) husband, because he was honest and direct with his opinions about things I tried on. He knew my insecurities about my body, and what I liked about it, and he\u2019s give specific feedback related to that, like \u201cThat looks great. It shows off your flat stomach and makes your waist look tiny.\u201d Or \u201cUh, no. It\u2019s too tight in the boobs and too loose everywhere else, so it makes you look straight up and down.\u201d You have to consider consequences before speaking. Too much honesty can be cruel. But a lie is always harmful. So you have to balance these harms in each situation and decide what to do. I will say that the benefits you receive from always speaking the truth are so amazing. Try it! ",
