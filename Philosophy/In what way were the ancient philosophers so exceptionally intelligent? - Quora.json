            "answer_text": "Interpreting deeply, the Presocratics contributed at least the following important ideas based on existing records: \u201cThe place of contemplation is where the mind directs its aim\u201d \u2014-creative extrapolation / interpretation of Thales, possible origin of structured thinking. \u201cSome will say the world comes from what is not, but this is unreasonable\u201d \u2014-creative extrapolation / interpretation of Thales, possible origin or reasoning. \u201cThe immortal is made up of\u2026 that which shall remain eternal.\u201d \u2014-creative extrapolation / interpretation of Anaximander, possible proof that infinity was invented with his concept of Apeiron, and otherwise we would think about something completely different, like the circumferences or rounded relations of things. \u201cWhat is definite takes the form of air.\u201d \u2014-creative extrapolation / interpretation of Anaximenes, possible origin of definiteness. \u201cThe principle of air is the principle of all things, and being that principle, it cannot very well resist itself.\u201d \u2014-creative extrapolation / interpretation of Anaximenes, possible origin of coherency and also the principle of non-contradiction. \u201cSomething of the thought remains in a form.\u201d \u2014-creative extrapolation / interpretation of Pythagoras, possible origin of Plato\u2019s Forms and the direct association of concept and object. \u201cAnalysis is the beginning.\u201d \u2014-I attribute this to Heraclitus, but if it is his, it may be the only reason that non-mathematical reasoning is usually done a-posteriori, and not through some other inventive method based on the future, the present, or some other principle not related to time. Assuming I have insight into what they actually thought, this at least proves that they were highly original thinkers (\u2018smart\u2019).

            "answer_text": "They were part of an oral tradition so that they were trained in Mathematics, Rhetoric and The Art of Memory. Once people learned the technology of reading, writing and finally, printing books their memories became a lot worse. Up until the 20th century almost all philosophers were trained in The Liberal Arts which contains seven different types of mathematics. When the mass media, records, movies, radio and television, appeared on the scene our memories got even worse. Then, with the advent of the microcomputer, they got even worse. To top that off, when the world wide web and the internet took off, it got worse. Finally the cellular phone has probably done our memory in entirely. ",
