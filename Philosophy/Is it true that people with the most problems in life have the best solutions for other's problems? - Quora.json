            "answer_text": "True and false. Sharing my experience, I encountered many problems during the renovation process of my dream home. For instance: LeaksInstead of just accepting the current circumstance, I went on to study the process and spent time understanding these matters better. Hence, when my friends are doing renovation, I advise them to: In a hot country with unpredictable rain falls, please ensure that the contractor uses a special coat of sealant before applying the the final coat of paint. Take this seriously as any contractor would use a white color based painting which they will tell you that such a base paint is sufficient. It isn\u2019t. Without the proper sealant, the concrete will crack eventually. The sealant act as the last line of defense. Secondly, please put zinc/ metal sheet capping at all the edges of the exposed concrete supporting the roof, as cracks from such areas are common and can cause severe leak.There are many others, but what I am illustrating is that listening to someone who went through the headache, and has learned from it is helpful. But it is limited to technical matters. On another hand, some problems are subjective in nature. For instance, if someone ask me if it is better to marry young or marry later, I would tell them that nobody has the answer to that, even if that particular person has experienced the problems of either being married young or at a later stage of their life. This is because it relates to matters of the heart - not something that can be quantified. ",
