This kind of progress, with more agreement (not \u201cproof\u201d) when our hypotheses are found valid by more investigators, allows us to refine our concepts of reality and enjoy more credence as we learn; there is NOTHING beyond the senses, for even our own thoughts must be apprehended as if sensed internally. Cogito ergo sum; I think, therefore I exist. From Brittanica (snippet) Cogito, ergo sum, (Latin: \u201cI think, therefore I am) dictum coined by the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes in his Discourse on Method (1637) as a first step in demonstrating the attainability of certain knowledge. It is the only statement to survive the test of his methodic doubt. The statement is indubitable, as Descartes argued in the second of his six Meditations on First Philosophy (1641), because even if an all-powerful demon were to try to deceive him into thinking that he exists when he does not, he would have to exist in order for the demon to deceive him.

            "answer_text": "No, that conclusion is solipsism and it\u2019s the opposite of what realism suggests. The premise, which I agree with, is the realist position that our perception is not the fundamental existence but serves to inform of us of an external reality. The implication is that our perception is imperfect and that there are aspects of reality that can not be perceived. We can\u2019t prove something isn\u2019t there only because we can\u2019t detect it. ",
