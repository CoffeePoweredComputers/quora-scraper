            "answer_text": "So, there are a couple of possible answers to this, and they're all more or less context-specific.(I'm going to try to explain this in simple terms: be aware, almost every term I that I use the \"common usage\" meaning of, probably has a jargon-based specific definition (being, essence, category) that will differ depending on the field you are talking ontology with. So... if you read this, understand that in philosophy, computer science, A.I., network design, etc... many of the terms I am using to communicate will mean different things to specialists, and they may not know that you aren't speaking to them in their jargon language. Its hard- be prepared to struggle with the language a bit. ) Originally, Ontology was mostly a philosophical term. It was considered the first philosophy of metaphysics, and was specifically concerned with the definition of what did and did not constitute a \"being\", and what things did and did not belong to the category of \"being\", and why. Then it further went into different essential(basic) categories of the kinds of beings there were... what properties belonged to those beings... and then various discussions about how you organized and talked about those different kinds of beings in a larger scheme.So in basic form, Ontology was the study that dealt with \"reality\"... what did exist, what didn't exist, what it meant to exist, and the different levels on which things existed (for instance, the issue of Unicorns... we all know what they are, we can draw them, but they don't \"exist\" the way a horse does... that is a real basic discussion of ontology.) Later, when people began to identify concepts as a type of \"thing\"... and discussing whether concepts existed or not, abstracts became a tricky thing for ontology to deal with. There are lots and lots of philosophical and theological debates about those kinds of things. You can ask me about them specifically if you want, and I can try and explain. More recently, and due in no small part to the contentious inclusion of abstractions and concepts into the larger discussion of ontology, people who had deal with the creation of categories and classes of specific types of abstract beings became interested in ontology. Here I'm talking about people creating object-oriented computer schemas, librarians trying to create abstract indexing systems for media storage, and of course... artificial intelligence researchers and designers... who had to \"build\" ontologies for the A.I. to  organize the world's data, and their own environment designs into. So... all that said... ontology is more or less the study of what does and doesn't exist, how to class those things, and what attributes are strictly necessary for Thing A to be considered a member of Category B.  See how that sits with you. If you're looking for something else, pipe up, and I can try and clarify. ",

            "answer_text": "tl;dr: Ontology is the study of how you put things into categories, including figuring out just what it means to be \"the same thing\" as it undergoes changes.  It also refers to crafting hierarchies of categories so that things can be organized and efficiently accessed. The original idea dates back to Greek Philosophy: it's the study of what there is in the world (from the Greek ontos, \"to be\").  It tries to pin down just how an object exists in relation to other objects and classes or categories of objects:  How does it persist over time (i.e. are you the same person you were yesterday?)What categories does it fit into?What features of it help you sort it into categories?  Which ones can change?These questions are tangled up in other areas of Metaphysics, like Epistemology (\"how do we know anything at all?\") and Semantics (\"how do we convey meaning\"). It wasn't all quite so metaphysical.  Putting things into categories is doing ontology.  Distinctions like animal/mineral/vegetable, Linnaean taxonomy, the periodic table of the elements, etc. are part of ontologies.  Philosophers of ontology get all meta to that, and try to figure out just how \"real\" those categories are and try to provide general criteria for making them rigorous. There has been, for a decade or so, a fancy for using the name \"ontology\" to apply to any system of classification.  We have a Quora Topic Ontology of answers, which sounds all metaphysical until you realize that it's precisely the same thing as the Dewey decimal system or the orignal Yahoo! home page: http://web.archive.org/web/19961017235908/http://www2.yahoo.com/ In particular, the term has been co-opted by the Semantic Web project, conceived by Tim Berners-Lee as the successor to the World Wide Web.  Conveniently, it's not semantic, and it's got practically nothing to do with the World Wide Web.   But it does have a taxonomy, with the intention of sharing taxonomies for easy information interchange.  In that it's not really all that much different from UML (Unified Modeling Language), which can also be said to be an ontology language. ",
