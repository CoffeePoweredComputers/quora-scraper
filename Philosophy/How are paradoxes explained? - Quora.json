            "answer_text": "Paradox in logic refers to valid propositions which cannot be given a truth value of either True or False. The most famous one is the Liar paradox, \u201ceverything i say is a lie.\u201d This proves that the Law of Excluded middle is not a valid law of logic. This proves that there is at least a third truth value of neither-true-nor-false. Paradoxes cannot be explained. Nor can they be explained away. Many logicians have jumped thru all kinds of hoops to try and explain them away, but it is not possible to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "A logical self-contradiction requires the axioms to be changed (or a new one added). A paradox is not as serious as that. A paradox is only an apparent self-contradiction, arrived at by taking a logical or mathematical step that is not explicitly allowed by the axioms. A paradox is explained by finding the mistake. ",
