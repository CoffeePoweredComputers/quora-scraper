            "answer_text": "Q. What are the characteristics of political ideologies? (1) Firstly, what\u2019s political ideology? (1a) Political philosophy offers a colorful menu of many diverse political ideas. These ideas are typically centered on other key ideas and values. Examples: Liberty / freedom and democracyEstablished traditions and valuesJustice and equalityPersonal development to realize personal aspirationsSocietal well-beingRespect for the environment.These basic ideas and values may conflict with one another. Freedom for one citizen may be injustice to another. Your freedom to party into the wee hours keeps your neighbor awake.Absolute equality may stifle personal development (Moral hazard).So, political ideologies need to choose one of the key ideas or values as foundational, and will, if necessary, compromise on the others. For example, if you choose freedom as foundational, you may need to allow inequalities in society if everyone is free to work to improve their situation. Some folks will do much better than others. And you\u2019ll want to limit what a government can do to curtail your freedom, even if it\u2019s done in the name of justice and equality.On the other hand, if equality is foundational, people\u2019s personal freedoms and ambitions may need to be restricted if they go against the needs of society at large.(1b) A political ideology is a working set of ideas, values and arguments that hang together to give a coherent overall view of what society should be like. This makes it easy for the lay-citizen, the voter, to assess and choose. (2) In the 20th century, there was a wide range of political ideologies: Socialism (focus on justice and equality)Communism (common ownership of the means of production, absence of social classes, money, State); More: Sam Qwato's answer to What exactly is Karl Marx's philosophy?Conservatism (traditions and values); More: Sam Qwato's answer to What does conservatism stand for?Liberalism (Liberty, individualism, personal development)Nationalism (focus on preserving the nation's culture)Fascism (primacy of the state in all considerations); More: Sam Qwato's answer to What is fascism?Anarchism (voluntary self-governed societies, stateless)EnvironmentalismList of political ideologies(3) What inspires political ideology? Politics deals with the deepest instincts and impulses of human nature. The inspiration wellsprings are primarily centered on the circumstances of individuals in societies, and in human living experience. (4) Here\u2019re five animations of inspirational forces. (4a) Ideals Para (1a) above lists the key ideas and values that are the firing ideals of many political philosophies, and in turn, political ideologies. The durability and utility of traditions and values inspired Conservatism.The ideals of justice and equality inspired Socialism.The ideal of high order individualism inspired Libertarianism.(4b) Context Karl Marx (1818\u20131883), whose \u201cCapital: Critique of Political Economy\u201d (Das Kapital) was published in 1867, lived in the era when the Industrial Revolution (1760\u20131840) was at full tilt. Marx observed the ugliest excesses of Capitalism. The callous exploitation of labor. Child labour. The numbing alienation of shop floor automatons. This, not inspired, but moved him to charge his political economy body of ideas, that was to fire up the planet to high tumult later, in behemoths Russia, China. (4c) Personal Experience Ayn Rand was born to a Russian-Jewish family. Dad was a successful businessman. She was 12 during the 1917 Russian Revolution. The rule under Lenin disrupted the serene life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father\u2019s business was confiscated, the family displaced. They fled to Crimea. While in high school, she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue. At 16, Rand and her family faced desperate conditions, on occasion, starving.  After the Revolution, universities were opened to women. Rand enrolled, only to be purged from the university shortly before graduating, because of her Bourgeoisie roots. In 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit her US relatives. She stayed on to become a movie screenwriter. The stuff of movies! And indeed movies were made\u2026 This torrid experience moved Rand to develop Objectivism. Its central tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness,that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception,that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic,that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest),that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism.Rand is a controversial figure in the highfalutin philosophy sanctum. She is mostly ignored by academia establishment. But, Rand is the darling, the icon, the archetype of Libertarianism, out in the right field. Strident liberty, defiant soaring individualism, thriving in breakneck viral capitalism, as epitomized in her movies: The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged.  Rand\u2019s works resonate with young people. Rites of passage reading. Why is that? Rand shoves in your face, seemingly simple, stark, unambiguous, black and white answers to life\u2019s complexities. This glare of clarity, slick grace of simplicity, appeals to the angsty instincts of young people. To validate Rand, and yourself, read Rand in your 20\u2019s, and again in your 40\u2019s. The difference if any, is your journey made good.  (4d) Circumstances and Political Motivations WW1 ended in 1918. Italy was in a state of severe social and political unrest. It was forced to concede territory to then-Yugoslavia. It was reeling from the heavy losses of war. Unemployment was escalating as the economy shrank. Mainstream politicians appeared unable to provide answers. Both left and right-wing groups were growing in popularity among the struggling peasants and workers. The right-wing National Fascist Party, under Mussolini, and the philosophical guidance of Giovanni Gentile, used nationalist rhetoric to win popular support. They advocated a radical new form of social organization based around the fascist state.  Gentile rejected the idea of individualism. He reckoned that the answer to both the people\u2019s need for purpose, and the state\u2019s vitality and cohesiveness lay in Collectivism. He describes the state concept as an attitude toward life in which individuals and generations are bound together by a higher law and will of the nation. It opposed the doctrines of political and economic Liberalism, which in his era, proved itself unable to maintain political stability. The key features of Fascism, simply\u2026 The law and the will of the nation take precedence over individual will.All human and spiritual values lie within the State.All individual action serves to preserve and expand the state.The concept of state is all-embracing. Above: Mussolini  Above: Giovanni Gentile Here, we\u2019ve a philosopher, and politician partner-in-crime, inspired by, and responding to, difficult circumstances, opportunistically. Fascism subsequently had massive impact on Hitler\u2019s Germany,Franco\u2019s Spain up to 1975,Salazar\u2019s Portugal up to 1974.(4e) Tumultuous Events Edmund Burke was horrified by the upheavals of the French Revolution. The blood. The gore. It upended his universe. It, not inspired, but moved him to develop Conservatism ideas, in his \u201cReflections on the Revolution in France\u201d. Conservatism promotes retaining traditional social institutions in the context of culture and civilization. It emphasizes stability and continuity, favoring incremental changes over time. You can see where all these insights came from. Today, we have Conservative parties in many countries, notably the UK Tory, US Republican Party. ",

            "answer_text": "The tendency to harden into increasingly more rigid doctrines until they become unresponsive to the needs of the people or the conditions on the ground. Then preserving the doctrine instead of governing becomes a goal into itself. Like magic or religion, nothing can be admitted to be the fault of the doctrine & then the purges begin. First leaders are branded heretics for not being doctrinaire enough, then followers insufficiently \u201cpure.\u201d Eventually the absurdity & brutality of the doctrine causes it to collapse & and an old doctrine is resuscitated to begin the cycle again.
