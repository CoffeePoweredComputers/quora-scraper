            "answer_text": "Yes, indeed, I am estranged from my entire family, the family that I was born into. The short answer is because they were physically and emotionally hurting my children. It\u2019s because I\u2019m the family scapegoat and when my children came onto the scene they simply provided my family with another means to attack me. Families are dysfunctional in so many different ways. Tolstoy said it best: \u201cHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\u201d It\u2019s hard to break off from one\u2019s family. Especially when they have tragic histories and you feel compassion for them. In my case, my parents survived some of the worst of WWII. I.e., They survived physically but not emotionally. They weren\u2019t able to give me what I needed. They weren\u2019t able to protect me from the harm that resulted from their lack of participation in my life. They concocted stories about me that weren\u2019t true and alienated me from other family members and so on. Because of their history they presented me as just one more problem to deal with. They received a lot of support. I received further rejection and consequent harm. I ran away as a teenager and put myself through university. I discovered self help books. In later years I could afford and sought out psychological feedback and professional insight. Over the decades I attempted to establish a relationship with one or more family members. Nothing ever worked. In fact, I opened the door to further abuse. My husband couldn\u2019t understand why I even attempted a relationship with people that would treat me in the manner that they did. Despite the fact that I\u2019m speaking about parents, siblings, cousins, etc. I had enough insight to finally break contact when my children were placed in jeopardy. The only good thing about this saga is that I can truly look at myself in the mirror and know that I really did do the best that I knew how to do. I don\u2019t have any regrets, just sadness. ",

            "answer_text": "I cut contact entirely with a family member. He\u2019d never been a great guy. Selfish, rude, a user. He had angry outbursts. He was controlling. Unreliable. Ungrateful. A chronic liar. A substance abuser. Still, on good days, he could charm the birds out of the trees, and he\u2019d had a challenging childhood. The final straw was when I found out how he was treating his disabled wife and young adult children, and even grandchildren (he\u2019s never met his own beautiful grandkids). It\u2019s a long story, but it was horrendous. Beyond crazy cruelty and abuse, neglect etc. The more I found out, the more appalled I was and I just decided I wanted nothing to do with him any more. I just couldn\u2019t condone the dreadful behaviour. My husband was in full support. By the way, I\u2019m still in contact with his wife and kids. ",
