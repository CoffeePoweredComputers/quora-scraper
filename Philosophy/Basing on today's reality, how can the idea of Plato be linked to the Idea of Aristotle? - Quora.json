            "answer_text": "Both Plato and Aristotle recognized that when we understand what something is, the thing remains out side of us but in some way also enters our mind. Plato thought there were forms of things known that actually existed and that entered our minds so we could know. Aristotle said that what is in our mind is an understanding of the thing seen that our mind puts together from our sense experience of something. ",
