            "answer_text": "Excellent question. One that plagues contemplatives from all traditions. In fact, outside the pages of Alan Watts and similar popularizers, in the world of real people waking to chant the threefold vows and sit zazen, quietism is among the most feared of mistakes. Or as one of my teachers put it, the delusion that \u201ceverything is one giant glob of oatmeal.\u201d That\u2019s the trap of non-dualism. And yet, the sutras tell us: \u2026 form is no other than emptiness, emptiness no other than form; form is exactly emptiness, emptiness exactly form; And then yet again, another worthy in that lineage,Yamada Roshi, rather famously said: \u201cThe purpose of Zen is the perfection of character.\u201d Perhaps the improvement is not of your self, but is simply \u2026 improvement. That\u2019s one way to consider it. That\u2019s very true, but this goes deeper. Because - where even does the notion of improvement appear if all is non-dual, not-two? What gives? If things are non-dual, then why do anything? The solution is what gives Zen its \u201cbite,\u201d its reason to be. The useful response I can give you is this - yes, good question! Keep asking it! Never, ever stop. Dig into it with all you have. What may come of that process, your sincere devotion to realization of non-dual AND improvement - that is the rub! Or the Zen, if you like. Here is a famous koan that applies to your question: MUMONKAN CASE 16. UN-MON'S SEVEN-FOLD ROBE Un-mon said, \"The world is vast and wide; why do you put on your seven-piece robe at the sound of the bell?\" Mumon's Comment: When one meditates and studies Zen, one extinguishes the attachment to sound and color. Even though some have attained enlightenment by hearing a sound, or an awakening by seeing a color, these are ordinary matters. Those who intend to master Zen freely master sounds or colors, see clearly the nature of things and every activity of mind. Even though this is so, now tell me: Does the sound come to the ear, or does the ear go to the sound? But when both sound and silence are forgotten, what would you call this state? If you listen with your ear, it is hard to hear truly, but if you listen with your eye, then you begin to hear properly. Mumon\u2019s Verse: If you are awakened, all things are one and the same, If you are not awakened, all things are varied and distinguished. If you are not awakened, all things are one and the same, If you are awakened, all things are varied and distinguished. That seven piece robe is a complicated affair, worn for ceremonial purposes. That\u2019s a lot of effort to make just \u2018cause some dude rang the temple bell. Why do you do it? Or perhaps better, for what do you do it? And don\u2019t worry about the bell and robe. Un-mon could just as well have asked \u201cThe phone is ringing; why do you answer it?\u201d Exactly. Why? In sum: \u201c\u2026 form is no other than emptiness, emptiness no other than form; form is exactly emptiness, emptiness exactly form;\u201d AND \u201cThe purpose of Zen is the perfection of character.\u201d Yes. Indeedy. ",

            "answer_text": "You can work on \u201cyour shortcomings\u201d by not thinking of them as \u201cyour shortcomings\u201d. Thoughts happen, actions happen, and they affect what happens next. All of that has nothing to do with your \u201cself\u201d that can be improved. E.g. there was no understanding of math, and now there is. There were episodes of heavy drinking, but not anymore. New things happening, new experiences emerging. If anything, your \u201cself\u201d is the awareness of the experiences, a capacity to know, and that capacity has never changed a bit. What you know to be happening has changed a lot, but not the ability to know whatever it is there to know. Using the words of the Sixth Patriarch of Zen, the mirror always reflects experiences perfectly - how can it be improved? The idea of \u201cimprovement\u201d is just one of the countless ghostly reflections seen in it. ",
