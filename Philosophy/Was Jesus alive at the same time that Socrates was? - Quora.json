Addendum I'm sorry I did not read the question carefully. I thought it said \u201cWas Jesus alive like Socrates was alive?\u201d The answer to THIS QUESTION. Is no, missed by 400 years. Socrates died 399 BCE. Jesus was born in 6 BCE or 6 CE depending on whether you believe Matthew or Luke. He died on the cross sometime around 28\u201330 CE. Then he rose from the dead, but not in a mortal body. That's another discussion. ",

            "answer_text": "I really like Ian Sawyer\u2019s answer for this question: \u201cSocrates was born in either 469 or 470 BCE and died in 399 BCE, whereas the biblical Jesus is supposed to have been born around 4 or 5 BCE and died somewhere around 30 CE.\u201d I would only extend it with a question: How do you define being alive? Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the son of the Almighty God who lives forever. So from this point of view he was alive and he is still alive, just not in a human form, he is in the Heaven. If we only see being alive as being alive in a \u201cnormal\u201d human body he \u201cwas only alive\u201d from his birth until the crucifixion. After the resurrection he had a special form, which is a different story. ",
