            "answer_text": "The philosophy of a religion is just what the religion teaches. In practical terms. In the case of an ethnoreligion, it would be the cultural values of that ethnoreligious group. So Judaism has a very legalistic philosophy, because that\u2019s how that group sees the world. In the case of an evangelical religion, it\u2019s the philosophy espoused by the religion\u2019s founder. So Christianity has a very merciful philosophy, turn the other cheek, judge not lest you be judged, gold rule, etc\u2026 In many ways your question is backwards. It\u2019s not that the philosophy has a purpose to the religion. It\u2019s that the religion has a purpose to the philosophy. The religion is a vehicle for the philosophy of the group/ founder, the means by which the philosophy is enforced.  Turn the other cheek.  Don\u2019t fall into extremes. ",
