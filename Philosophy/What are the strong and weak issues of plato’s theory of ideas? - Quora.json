            "answer_text": "Surely the strongest and lasting importance of Plato's theory of ideas is that all knowledge and understanding requires universals. The weakest aspect is really the result of people trying to create models for how that works. Plato was quite clear that universal's cannot be understood as concrete particulars. And in the \u201cParmenides\" Plato is his own best critic in the sense that he shows the weakness, indeed, the misleadingness of any attempted model of how that works out, that is, the nature of the relation of universals to particulars. It may be fairly said that Aristotle is kind of a Johnny-come-lately when it comes to the 3rd man argument. It is stated clearly by Plato himself in the \u201cParmenides\u201d and Plato is completely transparent about the fact that he is unable to resolve that issue. I tend to think that it has not been understood well enough the extent to which Plato would be completely on board with one of what I think is the main results of Wittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy, his Investigations. Namely, to beware of false models. ",

            "answer_text": "First, Plato\u2019s Theory of Ideas is not a subject at all. I mean that it is not a compact mental material to be presented on an intellectual platter. Plato himself refrained from making it the direct theme of any of the twenty-five or more dialogues which he wrote. Instead, the ideas appear in the context of conversation, incidentally, and in scattered places. The point is, the Ideas are not a theory. Socrates calls his bringing in of the Ideas a \u201csupposing\u201d (Phaedo 100 b); the Greek word for a supposition is a hypothesis. A hypothesis is, literally, an underpinning, a prop. It comes to him and he comes on it at every departure and at every turning. It is a condition he acknowledges so that he can carry on as he must; it is not a conclusion presented for verification but a beginning which then becomes as well the end of inquiry. It is at first the condition that gives him heart for a search by making it possible for him to launch a question that has in it an arrow making for an answer. One might say that it allows him to turn the unknown into a suspect to be interrogated. Thereafter, however, the Idea-hypotheses\u2014for the hypothesis is not the proposition that there are Ideas, but each Idea is itself a hypothesis\u2014are to be used as stepping stones to their own conversion into something not merely supposed but truly beheld, \u201cseen.\u201d Such suppositions are surely not fruitfully accosted by formal hammer-and-tongs argument, though they are, of course, amenable to careful and critical inspection. I keep calling these Socratic suppositions Ideas. The word idea is a transcription of a term Socrates himself uses, idea. Nonetheless it is an infelicitous term. For, ask yourselves what we usually mean by an idea, for instance when we say: \u201cThat\u2019s her idea of a good lecture.\u201d Clearly we mean an opinion, or a mental image, or a concept, something \u201cin our minds,\u201d often in opposition to \u201cthe real thing.\u201d This modern notion of an idea, the result of an earth-shaking intellectual upset, is that of a mental representation, something before or in the organ of ideas, the mind. The use of the term would cast my exposition into a false, albeit familiar, frame, and I would only make things worse were I to insist that Socrates\u2019 Ideas are \u201creal,\u201d and worse yet, \u201creally exist.\u201d Socrates\u2019 own chief word is eidos. Like the word idea it is built on the simple past stem of the word to see, which signifies the act of seeing once done and completed. Scholars have collected the many meanings of eidos which flow continuously from the broadly ordinary to the narrowly technical: shape, figure, face, form, characteristic, quality, class, kind. But, of course, when we dwell on the multiplicity of Greek usages, we are standing the matter on its head, for they are all revealing differentiations from the dead-center of meaning. Eidos means sight, aspect, looks, in that eerily active sense in which a thing that has looks or is a sight presents itself to our sight and our looking. \u201cLooks,\u201d then, and not idea or form, is the most faithful rendering of eidos. But it sounds too curious, and so I shall tonight speak simply of eidos. The plural is eide. Eidos, then, is the word Socrates chooses for his hypothesis. For that choice he might, for this once, be called a \u201cGreek thinker,\u201d since he cherishes and yet overturns the wisdom of his language which associates seeing and knowing: \u201cI know\u201d in Greek is built on the stem of \u201cI saw.\u201d Eidos is a choice full of witty depth, for Socrates\u2019 eidos is invisible, and that is surely the first of all those notorious Socratic paradoxes.
