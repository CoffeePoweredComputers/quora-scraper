            "answer_text": "The difference between Society and Nature is that Nature is greater than Society and it precedes Society in the sense that Nature is pristine, whereas Society is a Human Construction i.e. Society belongs to Nature, but Nature does not belong to Society in that a Society cannot exist without Nature, but Nature can exist without Society (Far in the uninhabited jungle, for example). Nature and Society are Teleologically related. Society is the Social Construction of a collection of Homo Sapiens living or existing in close proximity, so that a particular physical territory might accommodate various different Societies, Groups or Collections of Humans. The term Society has also been lent to Groups of other Sentient Beings such as Primates, but less so to the Lesser Developed Species such as dogs, lions or cats or insects, such as ants \u2014 where the term Colony seems more apt. In certain parts of the world there is an existence of a biosphere supporting Life other than Homo Sapiens and we do not expect to find a Society there. Primates exist in the jungle and their Groups have often been referred to as Societies of Apes or Monkeys but that is strictly not a true Society per se, because it is less highly developed or differentiated in comparison to that of Homo Sapiens or Man and for that reason it is more apt perhaps to describe such Primate gatherings as Troops or Groups. Human Society is a highly differentiated collection of Individuals coexisting usually in peace and co-operation by following an evolved body of fixed rules, as even found to exist among Primitive Man i.e. Natural Equitable Rules of Living. Nature per se is Primary and Pristine and Existence is based on the \u201cSurvival of the Fittest\u201d and (Darwinian) Natural Selection and Adaptation, where the Law is based on \u201cTooth and Claw\u201d superiority (Lex Talionis). In contradistinction, Living in a Society is a more sophisticated existence governed by consensual Social Conventions, Rules and Law. All Societies are part of Nature but not all Nature is Society \u2014 Nature is the greater. ",

            "answer_text": "IMO, it is really not any different than if you were in the wild with a group of your species of animals. There are behaviors the individual newborn has to learn. But remember, nature is a mix of being forced (even killed) to achieve conformity and also the need to be totally independent. So maybe best is to be trained to conform during the training period (like in school) and then at \u201cgraduation\u201d, to choose to be a teacher in the conforming training school or to be released from school and be totally independent. In the wild there are many examples of and names given to \u201csocieties/tribes\u201d: Apes: a shrewdness Badgers: a cete Bats: a colony or a camp Bears: a sloth or a sleuth Bees: a swarm Buffalo: a gang or obstinacy Camels: a caravan Cats: a clowder or a glaring, Kittens: a litter or a kindle, Wild cats: a destruction Cobras: a quiver Crocodiles: a bask Crows: a murder Dogs: a pack, Puppies: a litter Donkeys: a drove Eagles: a convocation Elephants: a parade Elk: a gang or a herd Falcons: a cast Ferrets: a business Fish: a school Flamingos: a stand Fox: a charm Frogs: an army Geese: a gaggle Giraffes: a tower Gorillas: a band Hippopotami: a bloat Hyenas: a cackle Jaguars: a shadow Jellyfish: a smack Kangaroos: a troop or a mob Lemurs: a conspiracy Leopards: a leap Lions: a pride Moles: a labor Monkeys: a barrel or a troop Mules: a pack Otters: a family Oxen: a team or a yoke Owls: a parliament Parrots: a pandemonium Pigs: a drift or drove (younger pigs) or a sounder or a team (older pigs) Porcupines: a prickle Rabbits: a herd Rats: a colony Ravens: an unkindness Rhinoceroses: a crash Shark: a shiver Skunk: a stench Snakes: a nest Squirrels: a dray or a scurry Stingrays: a fever Swans: a bevy or a game (if in flight: a wedge) Tigers: an ambush or a streak Toads: a knot Turkeys: a gang or a rafter Turtles: a bale or a nest Weasels: a colony, a gang or a pack Whales: a pod, a school, or a gam Wolves: a pack Zebras: a zeal ",
