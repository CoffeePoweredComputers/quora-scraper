            "answer_text": "Existential statements is an statement which is true for at least one situation or values. The best and subtle way to prove an existential statement is to prove the statement by contradiction method ,just find the values or situation at which this statement contradicts your statement ,when you find that values or situation it implies that it is true for all the other values. That is the way by which you can easily prove an existential statement. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no existential statement - there are only existential moments that are beyond the duration of time, cause and effect - beyond space and time. Existential moments are those, which exist in the here and now, as it is, the way it is without the mind evaluating or analysing what it perceives. Like you are watching the beauty of a sunset sitting on a beach in awe without being affected by either the space or that time spent in admiring its beauty. ",
