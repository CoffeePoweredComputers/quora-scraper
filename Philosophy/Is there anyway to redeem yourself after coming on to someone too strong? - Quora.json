            "answer_text": "Question answered: Is there anyway to redeem yourself after coming on to someone too strong?  I always look at someone\u2019s intentions rather than reacting impulsively and negatively. If someone comes on too strong with me, I try to understand the reasons why. If they were over-eager to get to know me, or if they tried too hard to impress me, I\u2019d act like a decent human being and cut them some slack. You can never know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s life - not to mention in their heart. Instead of instantly rejecting them and hurting their feelings, and rather than acting like a heartless jerk, I would dial back the intensity of the interaction and respond politely, but positively. That would spare the other person some deeply hurtful feelings and also prevent them from feeling that they\u2019ve been heartlessly rejected. ",

In my humble experience you can do two, mutually exclusive things: You can immediately look for an opportunity to spend time IN THE SAME GROUP SHE IS IN, but don\u2019t SAY a word to her and finish the night by just saying,\u201chi nice to see you again.\u201d If you say ANYTHING one-on-one to her she\u2019s liable to tell you to f-off and never talk to her again. Play it V E R Y cool! All you can do from the end of this evening is hope and wait. DO NOT call or msg her in ANY WAY!You can try to impress her FROM AFAR! She has been creeped out. It takes a long time (if ever) to wash the creep off)!",
