            "answer_text": "Can we really be whatever we want? Can someone become the next President of the United States of America if she/he was born outside the USA? No. So, it\u2019s a lie, isn\u2019t it? If someone has bad eyesight (or has other disability), can she/ he become a pilot of a fighter plane or be sent into space as a NASA astronaut? No. Again, a lie. If someone will grow to 6,7 feet tall, 250 pounds, can she/ he become a pro jockey? As much as she/ he wishes this to happen, it\u2019s not going to happen. Again, a lie. And yet, we often hear how much it meant for famous people that their father or mother (or both) told them that she/ he could be whatever she/ he wanted to be. I think it\u2019s always better to encourage people, than to put them down and tell them that they don\u2019t have what it takes (I mean, what value is there in putting other people down anyway?), but we need to understand that this message is about something else. The message behind the statement You can be whatever you want to be in life is: Listen only to yourself. Don\u2019t let other people discourage you. Don\u2019t let other people tell you what you can and what you can\u2019t do. Don\u2019t let other people dictate you what you should do in life. Fight for your dreams. Don\u2019t let other people take your dreams away from you. That\u2019s the real message behind the statement You can be whatever you want in life. No, we can\u2019t realistically hope that we will be able to be anything we want. Some things are and forever will remain unattainable for us. Most things, we are as soon as we start. We want to be writers, we start writing. Because that\u2019s what writers do - they write. We want to be painters, we start painting. Because that\u2019s what painters do - they paint. We want to be singers, we start singing. Because that\u2019s what singers do - they sing. But if you want to become a pro soccer player staring at the age of 40, then you\u2019re being delusional. Immediately you will be a soccer player (you play soccer), but you will never be a pro soccer player so you can forget about making millions playing for Real Madrid for example. - Part of it appeared in my post Lukasz Laniecki's post in Rethinking parenting ",

It\u2019s because its THE PLANET, and the HUMAN RACE, and you are a powerful, and valuable speck like the rest of us\u2026 Those who have altered the course of evolution, did not do so on their own\u2026and they were to some degree in the right place at the right time to be noticed along side the change\u2026 Tell kids to aspire to makes the world a little better for those who they can reach\u2026not leap around them so they can make all the difference in the world\u2026 Think big and start by helping a little, and you\u2019ll do more than most even bother to settle for.
