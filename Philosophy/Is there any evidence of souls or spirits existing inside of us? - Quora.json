            "answer_text": "Yes, but indirect. No one has come up with technology to see or detect souls or any direct evidence of such. The words soul and spirit are often misinterpreted. None of my answers are based on any Biblical scriptures, or any religion, for that matter. Religions are not based on scientific proof. They are based on opinions, hearsay, and faith. Have you ever heard of Dr. Ian Stevenson? He has over 2600 meticulously documented evidence of reincarnation with little children who remember past lives. His evidence is the closest I have seen to scientific proof. It borders of very strong anecdotal evidence and scientific proof. There is no doubt, in my mind, that reincarnation is real. There are three ways to remember past lives. Spontaneous past life memories. This is where one just remembers events in past lives. This usually occurs in very young children and disappears around the age of eight.Dreams. Reoccurring dreams of past life events.Past life hypnotic regressionsThere are also NDE\u2019s (Near Death Experiences), but that isn\u2019t really reincarnation.Give me an explanation of how the memories of someone who has died end up in some other person some 30, 50, even hundreds of years later, and all very accurate. I approach it with logical thinking. Logic tells me, these memories are preserved after a person dies. These memories don\u2019t dissipate. I believe these memories are in the form of energy. This energy is really intelligent light energy that has its own consciousness and self awareness, and it retains its knowledge, memories, and experiences. I call this \u201cbody\u201d of energy, the soul, and its consciousness, the spirit. This energy is not alive, as in biological organism, but it is immortal from its point of creation on forward. Its normal form is a point of light, and it resides in what we call the afterlife. The soul uses physical hosts (such as humans) for learning. A soul will meld with a human fetus and remain with it for the duration of that human life. it will learn things that it can\u2019t possibly learn in the afterlife. But the end result gives the soul strength, knowledge, and wisdom, which raises its spiritual energy. The soul will incarnate over, and over, and over, again, constantly learning lessons along the way. Once this energy is at a certain level, the soul won\u2019t get any more benefits from incarnations, and will remain in the afterlife. This is why I answer, indirect evidence. I am just presenting ideas and concepts here. I am not saying my ideas and concepts are absolutely true. I am just trying to explain the observations in ways that other people can understand. ",

            "answer_text": "At first, I want be sure you are aware, that any Bible is an interpretation of the basic Scriptures. I want to clarify this, because both the concepts of \"soul\" and \"spirit\", is an approximate translation of the original words, which has been interpreted according to the content of the Christian faith. Fact is, science has never been able to detect neither a soul nor a spirit, in otther way than in a trasferred meaning: A) - The concept \"soul\" is translated and interpreted from, the Hebrew (transliterated) word \"nephesh\" which just means \"life\". B) - The concept \"soul\" is translated and interpreted from, the Greek (transliterated) word \"psuch\u00e9\" which just means \"breath\u201d! C) - The concept \"spirit\" is translated and interpreted from, the Hebrew (transliterated) word \"ruach\" which just means \"breath\" (vind). D) - The concept \"spirit\" is translated and interpreted from, the Greek (transliterated) word \"pheuma\" which originally means \"to blow \u2013 to breath\u201d (wind)! ",
