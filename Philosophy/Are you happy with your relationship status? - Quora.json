I used to give more than my 100% and the guy was not even interested in talking to me ,well yeah that shit hurts but you have to accept the reality now he calls me and texts me all the time but until and unless i move on from him am not gonna reply to again fall for this toxic person.. and coming back to the question , yes i am happy because i am at peace with myself , i sometimes feel like what if he's got changed or something like that but on the other hand i know how many chances I've given to this relationship so i feel really good because I have tried everything and even it still didn't work out , it's none of my fault\u2764\ufe0f ",

We do have a lot of fights but most of the time laugh at how stupid the fights are later. We love to cook together, we travel, she laughs at my jokes even when she doesn\u2019t find them funny, she listens to my endless boring observations of people, religion, motivation,etc. I have always hated big crowds, parties. She is the opposite, to show her that I wanted to enjoy stuff that she enjoyed too - with her - I had 6 B52 shots and sang on a karoke night in front of 30 people. I sang Tina Turner - I will survive. I think that is the day she is realized I was the most weirdest person she ever met. And we got along just fine :) We have complimented each other and have tweaked so many things in the last 10 years. You have to be open to change and criticism, amazing things can happen if you are.

SINGLE. And content. Cheers :) ",

            "answer_text": "In relationship satisfaction is inversely proportional to conditions. Love blossoms with commonality and wither with differences. Within a short time, only limited qualities of a person is visible. As life progresses, it unfolds repulsive qualities. People want to deal with successes and strengths and not failures and weaknesses. Everyone expects perfect man/women but they themselves are fallible. Our perspective changes with expectations. Relationship survives on accepting people as they are and not how you want them to be. Periodic sacrifice is the only solution for satisfied long lasting eternal relationship. I am not in a relationship because my girl did not accept my proposal but if she would have then this would have been my approach. ",
