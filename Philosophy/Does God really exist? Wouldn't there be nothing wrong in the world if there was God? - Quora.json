            "answer_text": "The existence of God is one of the most profound philosophical inquiries and has been since the beginning of man. The question has been studied by some of the greatest thinkers and philosophers throughout history and no answer goes without debate. As time has gone by, ideas and beliefs about God have played a major part in human life. They've provided answers to unalterable questions, and given man a way of life as well as a reason to live. Yet even with the idea of God, there's such an influential part of human life, can we be sure that God does exist? The main reason people tend to lose faith in God is because the concept of God seems to be incompatible with the existence of evil. We understand God to be a perfect being an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving creator of the heavens and the earth, with the existence of such a being how can any type of evil possibly exist. So is the problem of evil, the reason to dismiss the concept of God or even the existence of God? Major philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God: The ontological argument attempts to prove the existence of God through logic, but is logic enough to prove God\u2019s existence? Followed by the teleological argument otherwise known as the design argument. This theory states that the intricacy and complexity of our world and universe could not have come about by chance, it was in fact designed. If the world in the universe was designed, it needs a designer and this designer is God. So, we question: can our intricate planet have come about without a design? Finally, we have the cosmological argument, the idea that cause and effect is proof of the existence of God. He holds that everything that exists needs a cause for its existence and because the universe exists, it also needs a cause and this cause is God. So we question: Is it in fact possible for the universe to exist without actually having a cause? ^^This is how philosophers tried to understand the concept of God. However, I personally believe that \u201cGod\u201d cannot be understood by the rational human mind, but through faith. That it\u2019s \u201csomething\u201d you choose to follow or believe blindly without any proof of its existence (keep in mind that I\u2019m not referring to God as a person or a thing, when using the pronoun \u201cit\u201d). For instance, when you (a believer or a non-believer) are in times of trouble, you look up and seek for help unconsciously and at that moment arises a faith, that someone in some shape or form is watching you. So, how can this be explained? In like manner, people have EXPERIENCED unexplainable events in their lives, which they believe are God\u2019s doing. Nevertheless, this is a question that no one knows the answer to!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. God does really exist. If there was no God, there would be no creation, and with no creation, there would be no life. Even if you applied the scientific theory \u201cthe Big Bang Theory\u201d, there would still have to be the ultimate being that created the \u201cprimeval\u201d atom, which you don\u2019t need to know about. What you do need to know is that there is a God, and he loves each and every one of us for who we are. Your second question sparks my interest though. In the beginning in Genesis 1, there was the garden of Eden, and the garden of Eden was the perfection of life. It was basically heaven on earth. The reason God took that away was because Adam and Eve sinned against him. He then was forced to kick them out of the garden and put Angels with fire swords to guard the entrance. From then on there was pain in childbirth, the shame of nakedness, the knowing of right and wrong, and much more. God didn\u2019t intend for us to be kicked out, but he knew Adam and Eve\u2019s sin would force him to banish them. So, to this day we live in a broken world, where people know what is the difference between right and wrong and choose to do the wrongs. That is what I like to call a fallen world. The fallen world we live it would be hectic if God wasn\u2019t here to help us through it and guide us to a purpose as Christians to spread the Gospel. God chooses us to work in him and strive to complete his goal to finish what he started: The gospel. You might ask, then why doesn\u2019t God just end this and make everybody go to heaven? It doesn\u2019t work like that. God cannot make you go to heaven. If he did that he would be destroying his just character. He doesn\u2019t want to make us all robots and make us all believe either, so he would rather people like us help him and spread the word to as many people as possible and for them to come to heaven at their own free will. So, on earth, God cannot make all the wrongs just disappear. He is a just God, and will not do that. That is about as far as our human comprehension of God and heaven can really go. Beyond that, we must seek after God, and maybe ask him in heaven someday. GODSPEED through your journey with Christ, B. Johnson ",

            "answer_text": "Does God really exist? Wouldn't there be nothing wrong in the world if there was God? We assume that life on earth is the main life and blame God for not making it easier for us; that is a wrong assumption. We are in a temporary primary stage like the children who were asked to learn reading and writing but those kids struggle to understand the rocket science. In our temporary stage, we have been asked to obey God and to do good deeds to help others, but we are debating what we cannot comprehend like \u2018who is God\u2019, soul, or \u2018what is afterlife\u2019. We are here for testing; test environment necessitates struggle between desires and obedience, between good and evil. Testing missions are not supposed to be fair, easy, or comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. The wealthy father has the right to test his sons before distributing the wealth The wise father disciplines his children and prepares them for a better life The obedient son who takes care of others should be rewarded better than the disobedient son who persecutes others. Psalm 66:10 teaches \u2018For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us as silver is refined\u2019 Proverbs 17:3 teaches \u2018The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, but God tests the hearts\u2019 Isaiah 48:10 teaches \u2018I have refined you, but not as silver is refined. Rather, I have refined you in the furnace of suffering\u2019 Job 23:10 teaches \u2018when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold\u2019 Qur\u2019an verse 47:31 clarifies that we are here for testing And We will surely test you until We make evident those who strive among you [for the cause of God] and the patient, and We will test your affairs Verse 29:2-3 confirms that we are here for testing Do the people think that they will be left to say, \"We believe\" and they will not be tried? But We have certainly tried those before them, and God will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars. Similar teachings are found in 67:2, 18:7, 2:155 and 76:2 Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives; we cannot have inner peace without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day... for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-our-purpose-of-existence-in-this-world/answer/Sabri-Shahin We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed The student is not supposed to rejoice and enjoy himself during the exam hours Students should not wonder about the intention of the teacher; they are supposed to focus on what the teacher asked them to do If God wants to set up the testing environment to test people, then we are not supposed to advise God on how to set up the terms and conditions of the testing. The students are not supposed to advise the teacher on how to prepare the exams. God has created us, and he knows how to test us. The testing questions and answers are not supposed to be disclosed before the exam; testing environment necessitates some doubts and enables different choices and different decisions. The test does not depend on the level of education, a child may say \u2018I do not see the plane any more, it is going far away, it is still there but my sight does not reach it; God must be there but my sight does not reach him\u2019, but a scientist might conclude that, \u2018I do not see God, then there is no God\u2019. The test does not depend on the level of religion education, maybe someone who never heard of the religion teachings could pass the test based on the natural original gifts of conscience and reason \u2018What I do not want done to myself, I will not do to others. We may find some scholars who know the religion teachings but they accept to persecute and torture others, those are the bad trees which the prophets have warned us of them and of their bad fruits. The wise teacher sets different evaluation criteria for different grades; the students in the first grade are not evaluated as the students in the advanced degrees. We expect that the fair and wise God would evaluate people according to what they have been provided. The person who never heard of Prophets would have an easier test based on the gift of intelligence and conscience; he might get rewards for his good works and he might not be punished if not wicked. God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God does not predetermine bad plans for good people. God does not predetermine good plans for disobedient people. We see many people born poor but have succeeded in life We see many people born rich but failed in life God has empowered us to do and get whatever we want. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. For those who have doubts, they can ask God. All prophets have urged us to ask God and taught that God would answer us. Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us.

            "answer_text": "When there is an election there are various parties vying for votes, the reason why is that humanity is composed of individuals, with different views and beliefs. In a Utopia everyone would act and think exactly the same, a Utopia would need humans to be animals and think identically in a collective manner, in Communism individuals are exterminated, so theoretically, only the robots are left. In the distant past our societies myth goes, we were given freewill by Lucifer, to decide what is good and what is evil. Our individuality is one of the many important differences humans have from animals. There are the Kingdoms of Nature and each of these exhibits a vast gulf a chasm, that must be crossed before reaching the next Kingdom. So it is not that one God exists but many as a Hierarchy of Gods each in their own higher Kingdom lives. Take the plant from the Plant Kingdom, it has zero knowledge of or understanding of human activities and cannot possibly at its stage of evolution. Now Mary and Joseph had a baby Jesus and were informed of this by two Beings who were two Kingdoms higher than humanity. So these Beings were in the same position as a human looking upon the plant world, which is two Kingdoms lower than a human. So a human, even of the high status of a Mary or a Joseph has no understanding of these Archangels as they were then called. Now a Being who looks at a human as at the evolutionary level of a plant would have to be called a God and were in times before Christianity. However, the Beings above these \u201cArchangels\u201d are just as incomprehensible to them as the Archangels are to humans. So the story goes that the \u201cEarth\u201d appeared before the Sun - so there was no 24 hour day - and humanity appeared at that time in a mineral stage of creation [creation is just a more accurate and complex word for the materialistic evolution]. The next evolutionary period was the introduction of the Sun, which went through its normal vast period of development with the Earth within it. Humanity rose to the next Kingdom of Nature the Plant through the activity of a group of Beings in the Hierarchy, different from the first group which had given humans a material body. Later in an other vast period the Moon separated from the Earth and humanity arose through time to become the humans we see today. This story is incredibly more complex than this, which needs a library to explain. Myths are very useful because they can illustrate or give complex or simple ideas in very few words. So on the Last Days of Creation an unbelievably long time from today, the Earth and humanity will reach perfection - will become Gods. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a good story which will help you to understand the existence of God. Once a man went to a barber to get a haircut. While he was having his hair cut, the barber said, \u201cThere is no God\u201d. The man asked him the reason. The barber replied, \u201cIf God was present, there would not be hunger and poverty every where.\u201d The man kept quiet and after the haircut went out of the barber's shop. On the street, he saw a bunch of hippies who were very dirty and there hair were in a mess. He instantly returned to the barber's shop and exclaimed, \u201cThere is no barber in this street\". The barber was amazed at his words and said, \u201cHow can you say that when you have just had a haircut by me?\u201d The man replied, \u201cIf a barber existed, the hippies would have their hair cut and neatly trimmed.\u201d The barber quickly retorted, \u201cThe barber exists, it is just that they do not come to him.\u201d So the answer is simple. God exists. People who are poor are either in this state because of their sins, either because God wants to test them. People who turn to Him for guidance can easily know that God exists, watches our every move, and rewards us with a lot of things. Thankyou.

First, define \u201cwrong.\u201d What is the definition of wrong? Bypassing that, an all-loving God will give His intelligent creation the choice to do good or do evil. There is no way around that. If God made everyone love Him, that would not be love because love does not force people to love. If one loves God, that person does what God says or at least tries. If one doesn\u2019t love God, that person doesn\u2019t do what God says and does whatever that person wants. So there is a choice. Doing what God wants is good while not doing what God wants is evil or sin. The ones who don\u2019t love God gravitate towards evil deeds. Now, this evil or not doing what God wants can be the aforementioned what\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d in the world you asked about earlier however, that depends on the definition of what you meant by \u201cwrong\u201d in the beginning.

No one knows. But, do we get to know good things if we know more about god? Definitely. Question 2 Now let\u2019s assume there is god. You\u2019re saying that if god existed, he would not let anything bad happen in the world. But that\u2019s not how it works, right? A circus lion will not survive much when left in the jungle much. Similarly, we have to deal with our own problems. No problems, no success. One can counter this statement as - If god existed, why would there be problems in anyone\u2019s life? Would not he take care of everything? In that case, I think you have the answer to your first question. Thank you. ",

In fact, he visited us in the flesh in the form of Jesus Christ who secured our eternal salvation. This world is a flawed place in which evil rules. God gives us the unconditional gift of eternity in Heaven with him, if we choose to receive Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior in accordance with The Gospels. There is a God, and there is much wrong with our world and that is intentional and it serves a purpose. I highly encourage you to read The New Testament. Begin with the Gospel of John. then go back and read the Gospels beginning with Matthew. Christ be with you! ",

Then he put Adam to sleep and took a rib out of Adam and God created Eve. And the world will still trouble free trouble did not come into the world until there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon which is Lucifer and his angels and Lucifer and his bunch lost the war and were kicked out of Heaven, they settle around planet earth. That\u2019s when the trouble started but God created man with the power to choose. And a person chooses not to follow God that is their choice but like any decision we make in our lives there are consequences to be had. The reason why things went along so good in the beginning was because Adam had no choice there was only God but when Satan presented his version of what God was all about Eve decided to eat the fruit off the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and she gave the fruit to her husband and he did eat. Adam knew it was wrong but he did it because he loves his wife he chose his wife over God and that\u2019s why we are in the condition we are in today. ",

It amazes me how people can see all the cruelty and evil that human beings do to each other, and then say that all this evil makes them doubt the existence of God \u2026 but it doesn\u2019t make them doubt for a moment the essential goodness of humanity. There is evil in the world because God gives people free will. Sure, God could have created a race of mindless robots who would always do exactly what he wanted. But he didn\u2019t want to create robots, he wanted to create people with freedom and autonomy. The price of that is that some of them will rebel against him. God accepted that price. ",
