            "answer_text": "I like Nagarajan's response, but I\u2019m going to assume a more mundane approach. I attended recently the conference that Bessel van der Kolk organizes every year. This year they offered several lectures on Self. I was really eager to hear the latest on the discoveries on self since it\u2019s becoming obvious that trauma shatters the sense of self, and therefore, it\u2019s essential to understand how to repair it. To my surprise, instead of talking about perception, they talked about \u201csenses.\u201d That\u2019s why I jumped into responding to your question. The most interesting take from the conference is that using the \u201cinternal\u201d senses can help us feeling ourselves, connecting with a sense of us, on how we work, and how we exist. Those senses are mainly proprioception (perception or awareness of the position and movement of the body), and interception (helps understand and feel what's going on inside your body). Proprioception refers to information coming to the brain about the position and movement of the body and is essential for coordinated movement. Proprioception includes the sense of position and movement of our limbs, the senses of muscle force and effort, and the sense of balance. In addition to knowing where our limbs are in space, at least two other sensations contribute to our physical self-awareness: a sense of force and a sense of effort or heaviness. Conscious proprioceptive awareness of reflex postural preparedness may give rise to pleasant experiences of stability, readiness, and self-efficacy, or unpleasant feelings of lack of confidence and anxiety. There are a number of serious, debilitating conditions associated with disturbances to the body image. These include eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa; conditions in which the patient denies that a part of their body actually belongs to them; and out-of-body experiences, where the patient believes that their body is no longer under their own control. Indeed, our very sense of self is believed to be generated in association with the central processing of proprioceptive information (Gandevia et al, 2016). Interoception is a sense that provides information about the internal condition of our body\u2014how our body is feeling on the inside. At the most basic level, interoception allows us to answer the question, \u201chow do I feel?\u201d at any given moment which prompts us to take action based on the body signals we notice. Interoception allows us to experience many body sensations such as a growling stomach, dry mouth, tense muscles, or racing heart. Awareness of these body sensations enables us to experience essential emotions such as hunger, fullness, thirst, pain, body temperature, need for the bathroom, sexual arousal, relaxation, anxiety, sadness, frustration, and safety (Mahler, 2017). Interoception encompasses the brain's process of integrating signals relayed from the body into specific subregions\u2014like the brainstem, thalamus, insula, somatosensory, and anterior cingulate cortex \u2014allowing for a nuanced representation of the physiological state of the body. This is important for maintaining homeostatic conditions in the body and, potentially, aiding in self-awareness. Interoception has been proposed as key to resilience as the accurate processing of internal bodily states promotes a quick restoration of homeostatic balance (Hasse et al, 2016), and as an aid in developing a stronger sense of self. The increased awareness of this sense has to do with \u201cbiofeedback\u201d where the ability of a person to gain control over autonomic functions is a method of treatment for varying conditions, especially trauma. Since interoception was considered important, now definitions include widens the concept to encompass \u201cthe skin and all that is underneath the skin\u201d and the perception and function of bodily activity to more fully understand psychosomatic processes.\u201c The physiological status of all tissues in the body and its mapping onto the brain provides an individual with subjective feeling states which are critical for human emotion and self-awareness. Emotions are actually perceived by this sense. Attention to interoceptive and proprioceptive experience may be more effective in handling stress and emotional dysregulation than attention to ideas and thoughts alone, because bodily experience allows more direct access to stages of response \u2014like reflexive noticing and orienting to the stimulus, preparation, and execution of response. In this case, noticing our internal state helps using better defenses than the ones that get triggered automatically if we don\u2019t notice; they also serve the function of connecting our frontal lobes with more sensory information, giving us more control over emotional responses; and lastly, they give us a better sense of who we are, helping to develop a better perception of how our reactions are connected to our body functions. Stephen Porges has added up another sense he calls Neuroception. Neuroception is the capacity to distinguish whether situations or people are safe, dangerous, or life-threatening. It explains why a baby coos at a caregiver but cries at a stranger, or why a toddler enjoys a parent\u2019s embrace but views a hug from a stranger an assault. Porges states that faulty neuroception might lie at the root of several psychiatric disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression, and Reactive Attachment Disorder, and that it\u2019s essential in the studies of trauma. All these senses provide useful information about or emotional state, and therefore it\u2019s used in the somatic modalities that are trauma-informed like Somatic Experiencing, or EMDR. To answer your question, YES, we can sense ourselves by using our internal senses, and not only the external ones. As we sense our bodies and our physiological changes, we can perceive the state of our Self. ",

This LIGHT is very intimate and just like the eye can see everything else but it can never see itself, this LIGHT has no way of knowing itself but all that IT can say is \u201cI perceive this cosmos and therefore I AM!\u201d.

Anything transcendental is invisible by the five senses. That includes the Self. The dogmatic Empiricist will conclude on that basis that the Self doesn\u2019t exist, because it cannot be placed under a microscope to examine its visible properties. Yet, as Rene Descartes showed (1650), the Self is the most undeniable fact of our existence. Even though the Self is invisible to the five senses \u2014 many other Realities are also invisible to the five senses. ",
