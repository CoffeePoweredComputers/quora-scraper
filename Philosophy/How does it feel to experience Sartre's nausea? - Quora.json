            "answer_text": "I think i would describe it as a sort of existential crisis. At least i think that is what Sartre was going for. Either feeling that everything and everyone is meaningless, or that everything that held value is somehow not worthy anymore and that you\u2019re sick of it. One may need to take a break at this point, try and be free of thinking at all, go visit a good calm peaceful place, possibly where one spent their childhood since it tends to reinvigorate the soul. Some scholars tend to say this is the point of enlightenment, or religious closeness, maybe your soul is trying to get away from everything in the search of something Higher (getting closer to God, truly understanding Him). Sartre\u2019s nausea in my opinion can really either make or break a person, depending on how they choose to go further with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026it kind of makes you\u2026kinda nauseated. Well named. The experience is the like the bottom drops out and all certainty and firm ground disappears. The lesson to learn is in the story about the falling people. You get used to that slightly queasy feeling of uncertainty\u2026then you pop into a new space. The existential dilemma and crisis is an access, a door. Jung spoke of the abyss. Stare into it, but be careful because if you stare too long it tends to stare back. Good luch. ",

Louis Ferdinand Celine was the greatest writer in the world during the last century.

He sold them a painting fulling thinking they were recognizing his genius, but later he learned that they had it repainted to match their furniture! It was all decoration to them and he became an ornament ! Please describe this phenomena more precisely for me: Nausea: Analysis I\u2019m thinking of Socrates famous saying: \u201cI\u2019m wise because I know nothing.\u201d Ok then, why are you telling me things? Why have you written it down? I\u2019m thinking it is a variant of : \u201cAd nauseam is a Latin term for argument or other discussion that has continued to the point of nausea. For example, \"this has been discussed ad nauseam\" indicates that the topic has been discussed extensively and those involved have grown sick of it.\u201d So i shall create a term: Ad Nausia: The empty feeling you get trying to be a perfectionist or master artist in a world of mediocrity and shalowness.

You might have folded your things neatly into a pile, or you might have lost them as you tumble down. It doesn't actually matter very much. The upshot of it is that you no longer trust your personal viewpoint. You don't know what you are going to do next. ",
