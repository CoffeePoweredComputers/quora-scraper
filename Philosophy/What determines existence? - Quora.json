In its own right!An imaginary inside-brain-effectindividually and momentarily elicited, made up, fabricated, fakedby, to, on, of, from, aboutSome-Thing, a real cause in- and outside the brain via a perceiving-processThe existence (aequivalent to thought, truth, property, usefulness, opinion) is, as detailed in my first sentence above, always a thought - a No-Thing about Some-thing. Here comes the thing: All them people who are taking existence as such, it-self\u2026 for real, they might assert \u201cyou just contradicted yourself, bzc you and I are thinking about existence RIGHT NOW\u201d. This assertion is the key at the understanding of the imaginary nature of existence as asserted above: You are NOT thinking about existence NOT as such, NOT it-self, NOT on its own, NOT in its own rightAll that you are actually thinking about, it is Some-Thing which can act or is acting and \u201cproviding its existence\u201d. For an example the visible (readible) utteration, prolamation, definition = DETERMINATION = object-ization OF existence!Sure is, if you are inable or just unwilling, to akknowledge the categorical distinction between the real SOME-thing and the imaginary existence OF the real Some-Thing, then my response is obviously not for you, sorry! \u2192 tldr: short response: \u201cSome-Thing, the senses and The brain and eventually, the organs of exertion (mouth talking or hand writing) ",

            "answer_text": "What is meant by \u2018existence\u2019? Certainly \u2018Consciousness\u2019 is. No theory or belief is required to attest this fact. As for everything else\u2026 it is plain that all \u2018objects\u2019 appear in Consciousness as an instantaneous collection of sensations (colours, feelings, odours, flavours and sounds) that appear as \u2018my body\u2019 and \u2018my feelings\u2019 and \u2018my thoughts\u2019 and \u2018my surroundings\u2019 (including specific \u2018things and events\u2019), as specific ideas are associated with each part of the sensory pattern as it arises. The patterns themselves have no \u2018parts\u2019. It is idea alone that makes the distinctions between \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019. Consciousness is Sensing-sensations and Knowing-ideas and the Power to manifest sensations into patterns that accord with the ideas, to create the appearance of an \u2018external world\u2019\u2026 as in a dream. These are all meaningless words. Any attempt to define them is to miss the \u2018pointing\u2019. Yet, to recognise their import is not difficult. Simply become \u2018aware of awareness\u2019. Notice this Seeing and Hearing and Feeling and Smelling and Tasting and Knowing\u2026 This is it :) If there is doubt the apparent world is an illusion\u2026 check it out. Notice that \u2018things\u2019 thought of as having a fixed size, position and shape constantly appear to change in every respect. One thing known to be larger than another at times appears to be smaller than it. Lines that are known to be parallel appear to converge. This can only \u2018be\u2019 if the appearance is an illusion, and not the \u2018thing itself\u2019. In fact all things \u2018exist\u2019 in reality only as ideas. Every idea takes its meaning from all other ideas. No idea can ever change, for if it did, it would be a different idea and not the idea it is. No idea can \u2018exist\u2019 apart from it being Known. Knowing all ideas as One, ever unchanged is called Omniscience. How could Consciousness be \u2018All-Knowing\u2019 and not know it? Notice that there is no awareness of any idea\u2026 until it is imaged by sensations. So the word \u2018elephant\u2019 suddenly appears. Instantly, the meaning is known. Notice however, that until the word appeared there was no awareness of knowing or not knowing the idea represented by the word. Only as an idea is represented by some sensory symbol is there any awareness of knowing it. This could be the image of the beast itself, the the sound of it trumpeting, etc. It could be a \u2018subtle image\u2019 that represents a \u2018thought\u2019 or \u2018imagined creature\u2019. But without any image at all, how could there be \u2018awareness\u2019? The sensory symbols representing any apparent object are not the idea that is immediately associated with them. Which is to say, the images are not the cause of the idea. It is the idea that gives the images their meaning. This is evidenced when the word \u2018elephant\u2019 is read from the perspective of a non-English speaker; the word in that case appears as meaningless\u2026 because no idea is associated with it. So it may be said that Consciousness exists\u2026 ever unchanged. Though \u2018what\u2019 it is, or \u2018how\u2019 it came to be remains an eternal mystery. Don\u2019t believe it\u2026 all \u2018belief\u2019 is based on \u2018ideas\u2019\u2026 and this reality is not a \u2018concept\u2019. Try to fathom its depths\u2026 impossible :) ",
