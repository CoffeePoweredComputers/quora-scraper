The idea, about where we are in \u201cthe chain\u201d is irrelevant because there is no chain. The entire idea is baseless and nothing more than a digitalcentristic fantasy on one hand and a philosophical snow job on the part of Nick Bostrom, on the other. When closely analyzed, it is classic philosophical bollocks. No one, and I repeat, NO ONE has been able to counter the arguments in my paper and they all must be countered in order for simulation theory to have any real legitimacy, because I covered all of the arguments posited in its favor and the evidence presented that supposedly supports it. Simulated reality theory is done like a dog\u2019s dinner. Ask any Aussie what that means\u2026 ",
