            "answer_text": "Thank you for the ask to answer, Pranjal Shukla. Yes, totally. Earlier token of love meant a chocolate, a rose, or something like. The value was not prioritized, but the emotion behind that gift. Nowadays, I see people spending more time deciding what to gift their loved one than actually spending time with them. Why? Because that gift will supposedly impress their girlfriend/boyfriend or their love. Moreover, I see several girls around me boasting about what their significant other gifted them on a specific day. Is this love at all? So, does love mean expensive gifts? Or has the token of love lost its essence? Neither. Love has become materialistic nowadays. The value of gifts are prioritized over the feelings behind them. Girls look for rich boyfriends to provide them with luxuries, guys consider gifting expensive gifts as a way of impressing them, and it does! Well, there are exceptions always. I know couples giving handmade gifts, letters, other such things which express love and not the monetary value of a gift. PS. Girls telling their boyfriends about the branded clothes they wear and the expensive perfumes they use haven\u2019t even heard of Gucci till date, I bet. No offense meant. Good day. ",

Talking about today\u2019s scenario\u2026\u2026 it has become a game for teenagers I guess\u2026\u2026 they have very less maturity towards this sensitive topic ending up screwing lives. While I have seen many people who are still waiting for the same person after one year of break up. These are the people who truly know the meaning of love. So love isnt materialistic nowadays\u2026\u2026.. it all depends how mature you are to handle the situations, who survives conquers love while others end up badly . ",
