            "answer_text": "Good luck with that project, and let us know how it goes! You can certainly be very talented in many areas, but perfection is both impossible and very subjective. What does it mean to be perfect at art, or at computers? There\u2019s no such thing. You can\u2019t know everything about any one subject let alone about all of them, and the more you study anything the more you come to appreciate the literally infinite depth of absolutely everything. People spend their careers narrowly focused on one subject, and become highly skilled, but never perfect, even at that one thing. The greatest scientists and artists and athletes never say they\u2019ve achieved perfection. And yet you want to be perfect at everything? Sorry, but it\u2019s impossible and absurdly arrogant, really. There\u2019s a saying, \u201cperfect is the enemy of good enough\u201d. What you need to do is work hard, apply yourself, and improve; that\u2019s all you can do, and it\u2019s good enough. Forget about perfection; it\u2019s just not helpful. Work toward concrete improvements, build skills. If you\u2019re going to attain something like perfection in anything, regular practice is the way, so just do that. But to even figure out what perfection might be, in order to attain it, you need perfect judgment. I mean, you want to be perfect at playing guitar, so who\u2019s better, Jerry Garcia or Jimi Hendrix? Which one was more perfect? You\u2019ll need perfect discrimination to evaluate all writers, musicians, thinkers, and artists, just in order to know how to become perfect yourself. And of course you\u2019ll need to study widely. So go for that first. Seek wisdom, and experience, and test yourself, learn your strengths and weaknesses. Be honest, and when you find you\u2019re far from perfect, accept that as the normal human condition, and look for specific ways you can improve. Letting go of perfectionism is one way you might consider. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, that is a hard question, but if you really want to be perfect i can give some advice. Here are some tips. Try not to give upIf you want to be perfect try not to give up, belive me i know because it happend to me. So if you have a homework to do or a job that you need to do until next day, try to set up a plan what will you do and when will you do something. 2. Create a plan You know when you get a homework and you don't want to do it because you are lazy or because you have some more important things to do, well do NOT do that. You don't want to do homework that you got in 3 days to do in 1 day because you said \u201cI will do it tomorrow\u201d, well that happend to me too, but now i have a plan of my whole day and i don't have to worry. If you want to know how to make a plan i will write it now. So, this is how to make a plan: 1. Take a paper A4. 2. You need a pencil or whatever you want. And now the procedure: If you want to make a plan you need to write all the things on the paper, then you can make tables or whatever you want, so it's on you. When you are done with that you will write like Mon, Tue etc. When you are done with that you can add time on the side so you know when to do that. When you are done you can use markers or pencils in color and mark what is most important and what is not. Oh, yes you need a time when to do that, well here are some tricks of mine. If you have to brush you teeth that try to think how much time will you spend on it, or if you have to study set time how many hours will you study AND set the alarm and keep the phone away from you because it will distract you. 3. Perfect body Well well well, how to get a perfect body. If you want to look like a Victoria secret models, i don't know what they eat or how rhey train so you should go on some other page, but if you want to look sexy and feel confident and feel good about yourself and be happy, then i just know what to do.

If you want to lose some weight try some EXERCISE, it wocom. happend itself. So here are some exercises for it: planksquadswalking on stairs up and downdonkeychild poseAnd if you want to stretch yourself i would reccommend yoga, it burns calories and you can be flexible.4. Clothes Well, clothes was never my stronger side, but if you want look good i would reccommend fashion magazines, because i have no idea about fashion but i can say that i like to wear hoodie and tight jeans or you can wear something else. But what i want to say is if you wear tight up than wear loose down and if you wear loose up than wear tight up so you don't look like billie eilish, no offense, or you don't want to look tight like Sandy in Grease, but if you have a figure than wear what ever you want.
