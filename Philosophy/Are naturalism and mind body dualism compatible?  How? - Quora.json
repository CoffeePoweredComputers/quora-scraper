            "answer_text": "Very many people would say \"no\", but I'd have to disagree. Firstly, we are all dualists at some level. Everyone has feelings, and the experience of feelings (in the sense of emotion and \"qualia\") are very different to our experience of naturalistic models of the physical universe. Neither is feeling love or hate very similar to experiencing a chair.  We all differentiate between the physical and the mental constantly. So that's a kind of dualism, whether we admit it or not. Secondly, I'd argue that whatever a full explanation of the universe might look like, it's going to be a naturalistic explanation or else it's not really going to be an explanation. Sometimes we find things that can't exactly be explained, or at least not in simple deterministic terms, but that doesn't put them in the realm of superstition.  We cannot prove, for instance, that arithmetic is consistent. We can't give a rigorous explanation of how arithmetic works. You can try, but you won't succeed. You might start by saying that the natural numbers all have a unique successor, but then how do you know they don't go round in a circle? How do you know there aren't two separate strands of natural numbers? So you reach for another axiom, but then you find there are other unresolved problems. G\u00f6del proved that no matter how you try to patch the gaps, you can never derive even all of arithmetic from a fixed set of axioms, never mind mathematics or physics. Our minds struggle with the idea that time might have had a beginning. If it didn't have a beginning, does it go infinitely far back? How can we make sense of that? Can there really have been an infinite amount of time before the present moment? But if not, how can time have started? Or how about the random outcomes of quantum experiments? Can they really be truly random? Can it really be true that two identical photons can make different \"decisions\" about whether to go through a polariser or not? But it seems that if the outcomes of quantum experiments are not random, we'd have to know the state of the entire universe to predict them, which is clearly never going to be possible. There are lots of things that we can't understand in the simple way that we'd like to understand them, but this doesn't mean we have to consider them to be metaphysical, in the sense of falling in the province of superstition. So yes, dualism and naturalism are compatible; so are idealism and dualism. Physicalism, when held to be the only reasonable explanation for anything, is a faith-based ideology. If we're to be scientific about it, we should say that we'll adopt whatever explanation best fits the data. If there are things that we can't explain using current techniques, even in principle, that doesn't put those things in the realm of superstition. It puts them in the realm of \"further research\".

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can be a naturalistic dualist. And while the term \"naturalist\" in this context is quite a new one, we can even see examples of philosophers and scientists in history who both happily loved their science, but also endorsed a kind of dualism. But if you're a naturalistic dualist today, I would argue that you're either a pretty piss poor naturalistic philosopher or a very committed dualist. The two are compatible, but in a great deal of tension. Why? Well...   First things first, we should be clear with our terms.  Dualism is an ontological claim - that there are two kinds of thing or substance - mental stuff and physical stuff. Our minds are made of the mental stuff, and our bodies, and the universe around us is made of physical stuff. Different dualists will have different accounts of what this stuff is. Naturalism as it is used in philosophy is often bandied around as meaning anything from \"science is kinda cool\" to \"science first, philosophy second\".  And it has uncountably many varieties. Two standard ways we can understand the term are: (1) Methodological Naturalism At its base, philosophy should respect the output of the sciences. If our best science says x then the truth of x should be respected.  This is a wishy washy way of putting it, but it is meant to be broad. At the one end of the spectrum, this means that many philosophical questions are simply reduced to scientific ones.  The philosopher ought to, wherever possible, work alongside the science to collect empirical evidence and theorise. Differences between the philosopher and the scientist are somewhat superficial.  The weaker naturalist sees the two disciplines as having a significant degree of overlap, but doesn't necessarily supplant the work of the philosopher with the empirical study of the sciences. This kind of naturalist will respect the results of science - only offering revisions if there is very good reason to do so.  So, for example, philosophers of physics will sometimes discuss problems with the concept of identity, and draw upon the theories of physics to draw bounds around their hypotheses. If their account conflicts with that of physics, out the window the theory will go. This is an example of a very weak kind of naturalism. (2) Ontological Naturalism This one harks back to Quine. What science says exists is what exists. A strong ontic-naturalist might add in an \"and only\" to read: \"our best science tells us all and only what exists\".  For example: Physics talks about electrons, and Physics is a pretty damn good science, so we should believe that electrons exist. No science talks about, relies on, or in any way depends on a deity, so deities do not exist. Physics refers to numbers, sets, fields, etc. and as such we should believe that they exist. All of this is controversial, but is just meant to clarify what an ontic-naturalist might be saying when they claim that science tells us what exists.  Okay, so can you be a committed naturalist and still buy into dualism?  If you're an ontic naturalist with an \"all and only\" thesis, then you look like you're out of luck. You might be able to say the following: Psychologists refer to mental states (beliefs, pains, desires) and as such these mental states exist.That's the start of an ontic naturalistic argument for the existence of mental states. But not of mind. You would have to also show that these mental states are made of mental substances, and not reducible. Moreover, both you and the methodological naturalist will then be faced with problems from elsewhere in science. The physicist will ask: Where does the energy come from that allows the mind to influence the brain and thus guide our behaviours? You've said the mind is non-physical. So it cannot be a transfer of energy. Sounds suspiciously like energy-creation...The neuroscientist will say: If the mind is non-physical, how can I learn so much about it from studying the brain alone? I have yet to see any non-causal processes occurring in the brain. You're overstepping my ontology.And the psychologist will say: Wait, you're saying WHAT? That because I'm referring to mental states I believe in a mental substance? Hell no! I like being able to ask my buddy the neuroscientist for evidence to support my hypotheses. But if we're being pedantic - which we are, as we're doing philosophy after all (home of pedants the world over) - there is no strict inconsistency between the two views. Science is an ever learning, ever changing enterprise, so it is possible that one day it will shift so as to become in favour of, or at least neutral towards, non-physical substances. And if we look back just over a century, you'd find a surprising number of dualistic neuroscientists. Still, it's a bit of a long shot, though. Don't hold your breath. And I guess for completeness sake, since we're talking isms, if you fancy defining \"naturalism\" as \"I kinda like science, but I'm happy to say 'screw it' when an ontological view takes my fancy\", you could also be both. But that's icky. ",

            "answer_text": "The term \"naturalism\" isn't a clearly defined term, but a historical artifact. What you are probably interested in is what we today call physicalism, which states that everything is made up of the same basic parts (e.g. subatomic particles) and that events are in principle entirely describable by a complete axiomatic set of laws, whatever those may turn out to be. Whether we have found the most elementary particles or complete set of laws remains in question, but that question is separate from the commitment to physicalism. The answer to your question are [physicalism] and mind-body dualism compatible is NO. Mind-body dualism is the thesis that the mind is not identical to and does not supervene on the brain. In other words, the mind has mental processes and states (e.g. beliefs) that occur independently of brain processes and states; also, that mental processes or states can change without any corresponding change in the brain.  The reason why mind-body dualism is inconsistent with physicalism is primarily due to the tenet that everything is made up of the same basic parts, while the mind is not (made up of neurons, for example); secondarily, that mental events are not describable (predictable or explainable) in terms of the laws.
