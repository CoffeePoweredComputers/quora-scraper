            "answer_text": "I believe the answer is going to be based on the biases of the person hearing what Donald Trump says. Another factor would be, are you listening to what Trump says, or what a third party is telling you Trump said. There again, that individual will be interpreting what Trump said, then you are interpreting the interpretations of a third party about what Trump said. The most recent example would be Trump\u2019s comments on Kim Jong Un. People are confused about his reference to having to give Kim Jong Un credit for what he accomplished. People (especially those who have a biased disposition against Trump) will interpret this as an endorsement of Kim Jong Un\u2019s policies. However, since Trump did not condone the policy factor, the people who would claim that Trump is not rational are the individuals not being rational. The conflict of Trump referring to Kim Jong Un as a \u201cmaniac\u201d and interpretation of Trump\u2019s comments as an endorsement of Kim Jong Un\u2019s, make this conclusion irrational. If you hear what Trump said, from the perspective of a case study, it presents a different message. Despite Kim Jong Un being a \u201cmaniac\u201d, the fact that he has been able to maintain an iron fist of control, over generals who have more experience (compared to Kim Jong Un\u2019s youth [age]), that Kim Jong Un should not be taken lightly (i.e. \u201cJV\u201d). And a discussion might be advantageous. If you are referring to Trumps use of rhetoric (what ever happened to dialectic?) by labeling people of being \u201clittle\u201d, \u201closer\u201d, \u201cliar\u201d, \u201ccheater\u201d, it is a practice that has been in use for the last 20+ years (actually longer). You are just not used to hearing it from the RNC side, so it is perceived as atypical, instead of an established norm which most people have either accepted as reality or are inattentive to. For years, the DNC has been using this form of rhetoric by labeling the opposition as \u201cracist\u201d, \u201csexist\u201d, \u201chomphobic\u201d (Saul Alinsky strategy). The accusations are based, solely, off of conjecture or extrapolation. Can anyone prove that Bush, McCain or Romney are actually any one of those labels, without a shadow of a doubt, beyond inference? So the question of being rational falls on the people who have an issue with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, but are oblivious to the DNC rhetoric. (personally, I think that liar, little, loser and cheater are less inflammatory and slanderous than being labeled a bigot as racist, sexist, homophobic and xenophobic [latest addition]). If you want to get into the birther issue, Cruz\u2019s eligibility \u2026 Trump being rational would be harder to defend. If you want to know my personal opinion. Trump is just as human (both rational and irrational) as the rest of us \u2026 [the day I am perfect, I will expect others to be perfect - don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for that day]. ",

            "answer_text": "Donald Trump is more rational than some people and less rational than others. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines rational as \u201chaving the ability to reason or think about things clearly\u201d. Given this definition, it is irrational to seriously ask \u201cIs Donald Trump rational?\u201dMr. Trump can be called irritating, rude, condescending or any number of other things. However, he is definitely rational. He has built a large business empire, convinced millions of rational American citizens that he should be the next President, outfoxed a large number of professional politicians in order to gain the Republican Party nomination, and put together a political campaign that could very well make him the next US President. You may not agree with his positions on the issues or maybe you're just incensed at the way he speaks or you just don't like his hair. However, he IS rational. ",
