            "answer_text": "Both terms are misleading. Here in the U.S. left-leaning Republicans tend to use the term moderate and right-leaning Democrats tend to use the term centrist. However, moderate Republicans disappeared with the advent of President Reagan, whereas centrist Democrats have monopolized the Democratic Party since the Clinton regime. This means both parties have shifted so far to the right that the entire political configuration has changed radically during the last 40 years. Nevertheless, many centrist Democrats like to consider themselves progressives, another word that seems to have lost its meaning. T.V. pundit, Rachael Maddow, for example, likes to call herself a progressive, using it synonymously with liberal, but her promotion of a neocon foreign policy and corporate spin on issues such as TPP can readily put her to the right of Trump. Her definition of progressive seems to be liberal on social issues and perhaps the environment, where it\u2019s easy to be considered to the left of Trump. Indeed, the terms left and right have been conflated so much by the current media that they no longer reflect the typical connotation of 50 years ago when left was defined by labor issues and right was the status quo. The self-styled libertarians even have their own left/right scale. Nevertheless, using the original left/right scale the electorate have definitely shifted to the starboard side of the this ship of state. There may be a center from stem to stern but with everyone congregating on the right it looks like this boat is about to capsize! ",

            "answer_text": "There is indeed, though many in America are confused by the terms because they\u2019re not properly explained by the few politicians who use them. Since I have answered this question many times I keep it very brief these days. A Centrist has data, no ideology whatsoever. They act on research and studies which prove that one policy is more required or more effective than another. Personal feelings have no baring on their policy positions. Moderates are apologists and pacifists. They have no discernible goals of their own and therefore spend their time complaining about how fiercely other people fight for their own agendas. Beware of Republican and Democrat party members claiming to be Centrists. In the US they do not understand the term and tend to use it instead to suggest that they are in the middle of the political isle and therefore above all the conflict. Centrists are not anywhere on the isle. On some issues they appear right wing and in others they appear left wing. This is because both the left and the right are correct about different things and Centrists use what is proven to be correct. If a politician claims to be a Centrist but wont defend their policy positions with credible data, then they\u2019re lying about being a Centrist. ",
