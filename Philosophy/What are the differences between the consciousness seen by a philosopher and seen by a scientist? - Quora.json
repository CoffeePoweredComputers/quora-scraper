            "answer_text": "There are two ways of approaching consciousness, as rational as the other. The first is called epistemic by philosophers: \u2018what is experienced\u2019, the subjectivity of the mind, the phenomena experienced by consciousness as a subject. The second is ontological: \u2018what constitutes\u2019, the objectivity of the real, the material, the subject to represent for the mind. By the epistemic approach, consciousness is a space. Fusion of a multitude of experienced phenomena. Bizarre contradiction of the uniqueness covering a polymorphism. By the ontological approach, consciousness is a structure. Material structure at first sight (brain, neurons), structure of information by looking at the matter a little closer: the substance disappears and remains identifiable only... the structure, that is to say a scale of information. By bringing together our two approaches, consciousness is a structured space. The great diversity of its arrangements is that of individual consciousnesses. However, the nature of diversity is seen differently: epistemically it is a diversity of phenomena, ontologically a diversity of patterns of excitations. Can we assimilate them? The reductionists do it without flinching. But that's not what we experience. An emotion is not the same phenomenon as a mathematical abstraction, or a color. How excitations conveyed by identical neural supports can become different phenomena? Ontologically, the information is of the same nature. It's a neural coding. But by being conscious we are the result of coding. The result says: the phenomena are of different nature. Dead end. This is the problem of explaining a flavor of information that is not described by it. 'Qualia' of the philosophers, pure experience. What can such a notion be based on when the reality of the scientist is fully described by information? This is the real gap between philosophy and science about consciousness. How to link phenomenon and information without going through the rude shortcut of assimilation? The terrible problem of consciousness goes further. It is not without reason that the reductionists try to ignore it. Assimilation and correlation are bridges hurled hastily throughout the organization of reality, from quantum excitations to neurals. If we reject the reduction of the phenomenon to the information that represents it, no more phenomenon of reality can be explained by structuralism alone, including in the organization of matter. Why do we go from one phenomenon to another when the nature of the information (series of numbers) does not change? The scientific building is compartmentalized between its disciplines. Its hegemony is no longer tenable. By the simple fact that we are thus experiencing consciousness, a first experience, the 'hard problem' becomes that of the nature of the whole of reality. Why is it not just a nursery of quantum excitations devoid of any consciousness? Conclusion: the explanation of consciousness lies in the explanation of the nature of reality and vice versa. The theory of the one and the other can not be reduced neither to the neurosciences, nor to the fundamental physics. ",

            "answer_text": "Scientists are somewhat like philosophers, though with a well defined way to study a phenomenon technically. While philosophers rely on logic and assumption, scientists think in an algorithmic way in terms of computational theories and advanced mathematical concepts. Consciousness can be described as various self-referential activities occurring in the background to enhance one\u2019s sense of existence through the self. It seems humans have so far surpassed the capabilities of most other animals that our consciousness lies on a different realm altogether, given what we are able to realize. Essentially, consciousness or any brain process is built up from emergent phenomenon in how neural pathways react to stimuli, based on how the most basic building blocks evolved. Philosophers may connect it with an everlasting soul, while scientists are less likely to. ",
