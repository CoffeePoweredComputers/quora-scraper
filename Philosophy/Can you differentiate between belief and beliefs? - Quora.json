            "answer_text": "Believe is an emotional and moral values judgement based on personalised experience and perception in nature that is uniquely real and true exclusively to the individual, and not so to other people to a certain degree. At home, your parents and caretaker will teach you what is \u201cright\" and \u201cgood\u201d according to his or her ways, it might be in an form of personal experience, culture or traditions that represents the Identity of your distinct family unit, it's up to you to from time and time again to adopt that as your personal Belief or decide to discard the belief if you perceive another conflicting idea and beliefs to be superior or preferential to your lifestyle. For example if you are in an democratic country where the Government does not control what you can think or cannot think, what you can say and what you cannot say, then you have the \u201climited freedom\u201d to believe whatever you want to believe in, however the Government too have the same freedom as you and have more and unequal power to persuade and convince you through social psychology and the media to vote for him, her and whatever party. If you are convinced and believe that XYZ Government and it's ideology is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cright\u201d, then you believe based on trust and limited evidence to vote for XYZ. Similar to an Socialist communist country where what could be thought, teach, write and say are dictatored by the ruling central government, your belief are molded more forcefully then the Democratic Government, ultimately both Government achieve their outcome because your beliefs and thoughts are subservient to whatever the ruling Government (Essentially dictate via the Constitution and Law that contains the belief and thought system) which regulates what is right and wrong in the form of: Education control: What is legally allowed be taught in schools and what is banned contentPublic opinion control: What kind of history, information and content is allowed for public viewership to the benefit of the ruling power.Legal and punitive control: Use the criminal law to punish \u201cunaccredited\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d citizens that have ideas, views and practices that does not conform to approved boundaries.E.g. Practice of natural medicine was outlawed in the 1800s and monopolized the pharmaceutical industry Regenerative medicine technology are banned and labelled as pseudoscience for economic control and profit. Cancer research are restricted to carcinogenic treatment of chemotherapy which kills their tumour and cause you to have increase 60% teriary risk of cancer relapse instead of widely available treatments information suppressed for economic control and profit from insurance and pharmaceutical corporations. OPEC collaborate with governments to regulate and inflate oil prices 10\u2013100 times from 6cents/barrel to $1/barrel to profit from the consumer people. 4. Media and expert institutional opinion control: Whatever is not mainstream and allowed to be taught or practiced in the education system is regarded as pseudoscience. When an pseudoscientist or practioners of non-mainstream allowed skill and knowledge have been detected by the government, the Government will resort to legal \u201cseize to desist\u201d measures, lawsuits, secret agent hidden buyover technology contracts or secret agent raids to steal your property and content. The media will spread fake news and start and disinformation campaign to discret your credentials as pseudoscience and block industries from hiring you by destroying your reputation via lies and false reports. Search information on internet SEO platforms will be censored, deleted and hidden secretly to conceal evidence and guide you to belief in whatever they want to present you as truth. Repeat the process throughout your wholelife, and you would believe whatever popular and socially accepted Norms are, which became part of your belief. Some people would coin that as indoctrination and indirect manipulation through the mainstream media, compulsory public education, slavery to 9\u20135 work under Capitalism system, etc. But beliefs are basically an it's an relationship between individuals to individuals, or individuals to an collective. People want to be socially accepted and validated by others to feel loved and part of the community, so as long as everyone thinks and belief the same, it is true enough to the person and to them. People will then habitually go through self-denial and tell themselves half-truths to stop thinking about the truth and simply belief whatever is fed to them and perceived as beneficially enough to make them feel safe, satisfied and happy.
