            "answer_text": "My difficulty in trying to wrap my head around the question and the responses which have been offered by way of answers, has been to figure out the sense in which the question is asked. Is this a factual or an ethical inquiry? Are we speaking, in other words, about relativism in relation to facts or in relation to values? The distinction is important to draw. Antony Flew (A Dictionary of Philosophy) writes, for instance, that \u201cTo be a relativist about fact is to maintain that there is no such thing as objective knowledge \u2026 independent of the knower.\u201d William Frankena (Ethics), on the other hand, distinguishes three different forms of ethical relativism \u2013 namely, descriptive relativism; meta-ethical relativism; and normative relativism. What each of them denies in different forms is the existence of a universal standard for judging right/wrong or good/bad. How we frame the question - relativism in relation to fact or values \u2013 as can be seen from the preceding paragraph, can have different and far-reaching repercussions. Relativism about facts might bring into question everything we do by way of education, for instance. Relativism as to values need not have that consequence. Further, there\u2019s dangerously little we can do to try and win over a person who denies the existence of all objective knowledge. This, I think, is ably demonstrated by one of the answers to this very question, where a picture is painted of a kind of unbridgeable gap between two persons, one of whom asserts that 1+1=2 while the other asserts that 1+1=3. There can\u2019t even be debate in a situation like this. But where we deal with relativism as to values, there can at least be debate about whether, as Frankena argues, \u201cpeople\u2019s basic and ethical value judgements would still be different even if they were fully enlightened, conceptually clear, shared the same factual beliefs, and were taking the same point of view\u201d. Although I have sought to problematize the question, rather than answer it, I hope that in the three examples of relativism proposed by Frankena, there is some indication of examples of individual relativism.

            "answer_text": "I love words. I have a deep love concerning words. The burden of clarity is knowing the reflective opposite concerning my love of words. Individual Relativism: -Ones own acceptance, definition, and practice of, morals and ethics- We collude these terms with multiple influential RELATIVES and the cacophony of philosophical arguing begins to ring loudly. Ex: Cultural, socital, created, tribal, group, pragmatic, existential, religious, instinctual,institutional, and many more, followed by the word \u201crelativism\u201d. How can ONE ever find \u201cINDIVIDUAL relativism in this mess? I am all for philosophy and open discussion. I love them just as I do words. That burden I mentioned\u2026. In my world morals and ethics would not exsist. In my world ethics and morality would be GIVENS. This is MY example of MY Individual Relativism. ",
