Robert once quoted George Bernard Shaw saying: There are those that look at things the way they are, and ask why? I dream of things that never were, and ask why not? Yet Robert was good at getting things done. He did some impressive work bringing some inner city leaders together with local business people to solve problems together. His approach has shaped my philosophy about group problem solving. Our normal approach is all wrong. ",

They use realism to bring their idealism into fruition.Steve Jobs jumps into mind. Richard Branson, and Elon Musk are excellent examples, as well.Those of us who don't have the brilliance, and other qualities that are required for world-class innovator-pioneers, can still be brilliant in our own lives by combining our wishes with the realities of life, by using the greatest secret human power.gshpower.wordpress.com ",
