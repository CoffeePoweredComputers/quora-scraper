            "answer_text": "First of all, take a deep breath and relax. I\u2019m sure that you need some support, and many other people on Quora will be able to console you far better than I am able to do. I will focus on simply answering your question. Gain Their Trust Your parents may be surrounded by friends and relatives who will shun them or worse - simply because of your lack of belief. You may even live in a country (or an area of the USA) where there are legal repercussions. This unfairness and oppression may make you upset and even angry, but you must try to avoid letting that influence your reaction. You have to alleviate your parents\u2019 fears by assuring them that you will keep your non-belief to yourself. Before talking about anything else, before defending your stance, make sure that they understand that they can entrust you to keep it a secret, so that they don\u2019t have to suffer the wrath of their peers. Don\u2019t argue about beliefs, morals, or faith until they are confident that you will not reveal your non-belief in a way that exposes them. This is critical. Explain Your Position It is also very important that your parents understand what it means to be an atheist. If they think that it\u2019s a phase that you are going through, or that you just need more conversion, then they will forever hound you and oppress you. You absolutely must spend a considerable amount of time explaining that you were not indoctrinated by anyone - that it was a realization, not a conversion. Atheists are critical thinkers who are not convinced by rumors and pressure but that are pragmatic - only convinced by facts. Your parents will insist that their religious documents contain only facts. There is no way to change their minds so you must not try to criticize their beliefs or challenge the existence of their god. You must treat the situation as a \u201cboth sides have a right to believe as they do\u201d issue - putting their beliefs on an equal footing with your non-belief. Impress upon them these two critical factors: They cannot convince you of their beliefs, as you have already been indoctrinated and it didn\u2019t work. It just doesn\u2019t work for some people.Atheism is not your religion, is not a belief, did not involve conversion, and does not define you in any way. You simply do not believe in a god.If they are fair and intelligent then you may want to pose the hypothetical question to them: \u201cWhat would it take to convince you that the universe is ruled by a magical rainbow unicorn that will subject you to eternal torture if you don\u2019t worship him?\u201d When they say that that is silly and sarcastic, explain that it wasn\u2019t sarcasm at all, and that it is just as silly as their god, at least to you. Make sure that they understand how you view their god - that it\u2019s not that you\u2019ve chosen a different belief, but that your mind will not accept or believe in the supernatural or magic, no matter how much you try. Assure Them Then there\u2019s this major challenge: You have to \u201cconvert\u201d your parents - at least have them adapt some of their beliefs. They have not only been trained to believe in a god, but also trained to believe that those who have no faith (such as you) are wicked, hateful, implements of the devil. You might want to research statistics and studies to show them that atheists are just as (or more) moral, compassionate, and caring than believers. They may believe that your attempts to convince them are driven by the devil and that they must refuse to listen lest they face punishment. Make sure that they understand that you don\u2019t hate their god or resent him - not any more than you hate unicorns - you just don\u2019t believe in him. Arguments There are very few arguments that can sway a believer. But there are some things that you can say to leverage their faith in order to bolster your stance. Ask them if they believe in a god that is loving and just. Does their god create a person who is a thinker, a skeptic, who analyzes things with common-sense, and then condemn that person for thinking? Is their god so egotistical that he created mankind to worship him? Or is he fair and benevolent and judges people based on their kindness, compassion, and service to mankind? Maybe they can retain their faith yet ignore those mere mortals of their church who pressure them to be evangelistic.Mention that there are many religions and many beliefs, so why would their god allow so many false religions that would doom their members, yet provide no evidence of which one was the correct one? Most religions claim that they are the only correct one and that their teachings are critical to eternal reward, yet they can only offer the words of mere mortals to justify their claim - no more evidence of their belief than any other religion does.Explain that you *cannot* believe - it\u2019s not a choice but inherent in your thought-process. The most you could do is to pretend to believe. But is their god so shallow and unthinking as to be convinced by your \u201cpretending\u201d to believe? You have already agreed (in the first step above) to \u201cpretend to believe\u201d for your family\u2019s benefit - so there is no need to try to fool their god. Moreover trying to pretend to believe in order to \u201cfool their god\u201d would only make you resentful, compounding the disrespect for their god.Closing You are in a very uncomfortable and unreasonable situation. It is a difficult challenge, and I hope you can surmount it. You cannot make your parents change overnight - it will take weeks or months, if at all. And you must be willing to accept some constraints as well, in order that they can accept that there are two sides to the issue. Once you are on your own, if you like, you may then choose to be open about your non-belief. Until then, your parents provide you with food, a home, and family, so you must live within their constraints. Good luck. ",

I'm an atheist too. \u201cAtheist\u201d just means you don't believe in a god. Essentially, that just means I don't need to use religion as a coping mechanism for all my fears and insecurities, because I'm the type of person who actually tries to understand why I have those and grow from it. Not everyone is that emotionally secure, however, and some people feel the need to live in a fantasy to escape from these fears and insecurities. Everyone does this a little bit from time to time, but nothing validates this escapism quite like religion does. Religion doesn't encourage people to face their fears and internal conflicts so they can learn and grow from it as a better and more mature human being. Instead, religion enables and endorses this kind of childish behaviour. It's no wonder that Christianity always refers to its followers as \u201cchildren\u201d. Now, you let them know that you still love them. Let them know that, religious or no, you will do your utmost to do the right thing. I'm not sure what your parents think of atheists. My parents didn't give a toss, and they became less religious after I started talking about it with them, and- surprise, suprise- they actually do more for charitable causes now that we've had that conversation. The thing about believing in a god- atheists don't believe that morality has anything to do with a god. Even if it were the morality of a god, it would still be subjective. There is no evidence that a god exists outside our imaginations. Like I said- it takes a whole lot of maturity and \u201cgrowing up\u201d to leave Neverland. Growing up means accepting that it's okay for you to have these wants and for you to want the world to be perfect, but the world isn't perfect. It's not sponsored by a being who knows what's right or wrong. The universe doesn't hate you, and neither does it love you. Good things happen to bad people, and bad things happen to good people. The reason atheists are a minority is because very few people are able to live with their fantasies and imagination being just fantasies and imagination. At the end of the day, if you want to do good instead of just imagining that you are good, you\u2019ll find it easier to do so the more you are able to take that childish imagination, treasure it, and then realise that was the work of you, not a god, and that it's okay that the world isn't perfect. Aknowledging that the world isn't perfect will enable you to realise what is true, so you can make it better. Religion is the \u201crelease\u201d religious people have for their bottled up fears, anxiety and insecurities. It's like a hypnosis where they temporarily escape from these fears. Alas, escapism is not a good long-term strategy, and the more religious you are, the more these problems will grow the longer you leave them unattended. If you want to find what is meaningful in life, you will have to put aside the fantasy where you are more moral than everyone else on the planet. Research shows that religious people severely overestimate how moral they are compared to everyone else. If you want to be moral, you will have to value what is true. If you want to find what is meaningful, you will have to leave Neverland. Tinkerbell won't solve all your problems. Religious people are too afraid of expressing these fears to those around them, and so they rely on their imaginary friend to do it for them. The thing is\u2026 the imaginary friend inside your head isn't God. It isn't Allah. It isn't Zeus. It isn't Osiris. It's you. You're the one validating yourself, and it's always been you, all along. You don't need to pretend that your imaginary friend is a god to have one and validate yourself. Let your parents know you love them and be yourself. Love, Ray ",
