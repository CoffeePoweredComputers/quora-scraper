            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe that they do. This will all be generalisation of course but at 17 most people don\u2019t have many responsibilities. Most don\u2019t even wash up their own coffee cup, let alone have to worry about things like paying rent. They don\u2019t have to take care of anyone but themselves, worry about putting food on the table, paying for clothes, TV, internet, gas, electric, cars and a myriad other such things. At 17, the focus is on themselves. They rarely notice the sheer amount of effort the adults around them have to put in to simply allow them and their loved ones to get through the day. For a 17 year old, failing a math test is a disaster. For an adult, a disaster is when your family has no food to eat and nowhere to live. As I said at the start of this answer. There will be exceptions. Young single mothers and fathers for example but for most 17 year olds. They don\u2019t yet think like adults because they don\u2019t yet have adult worries and responsibilities. ",

At 17, I had already graduated high school, had two and a half years of part-time work experience under my belt and had created my escape plan which was implemented at age 18. By 19, I was a store manager for a national electronics retail chain and attending college on the company\u2019s tuition reimbursement program. I had to think like an adult. I had P&L responsibility for my unit and had employees who needed their paychecks - which depended on me running a profit. ",

At 17 you DO have to see them as adults and treating them as such will ensure that they will go out into the real world with realistic expectations. Sometimes 17 year olds just want to have fun and not take any responsibility, and they havent experienced enough of the world yet to have the initiative either, so a teen like that would need to slowly be introduced to the adult world. At that age i was already wanting to get a job and a car. I wanted my own money so that i could go out and have fun since i came from a poor background. That was my only option if i wanted things i liked since my mother couldnt provide that. Seeing as how when youre an adult you have to work ANYWAY. What better time to start then the present. ",

Well,at least thats what some really strange arguments seem to want you to think. Yet, really age maturity is a spectrum. At 18, you aren't much more mature than at 17. An 18 year old and a 17 year old are no more different than a 16 and 17 year old. ",

As mentioned by Robert Martin Pollack, this will take another five or so years. What this means is, a 17 year old will make decisions that tend to leave out consideration of what may happen in the mid- to long-future. So, getting a job is good because it will give you money on Tuesday, rather than, getting a job is good because you can build a financial base that will allow you to get your own apartment in a year.
