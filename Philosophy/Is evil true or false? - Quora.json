            "answer_text": "Look at your question and it\u2019s possible answers as you think. It is linguistic, a matter of words and their meanings. Truth or falsity are a property of statements (equations are a form of statement) based upon meaning, accepted standards and beliefs. A decision is made based upon ones accepted standards and beliefs as to what is good and what is evil. Change the standards and definitions and you change what is evil. Truth and falsity ride on the back of meanings, standards and beliefs. The Inca\u2019s religion utilized the ritualistic sacrifices of individuals to appease their gods into activities and judgements in their favor. These bloody deaths were holy, sanctified goodness and statements lauding those practices were true. Today, for most, standards and beliefs have changed and those practices are depicted with discust and horror as evil. The same words, the same activities, the truth or falsity of calling statements about them good or evil has changed with the meanings and beliefs. In a similar manner Michael Jackson made Bad Good in his famous song. A rose by any other name still smells as sweet, but, some say they stink. Clarify the meanings of the terms. Establish the standards of assessment being used for the judgments. Look for the basis of the beliefs leading to those definitions and standards. ",
