            "answer_text": "One answer people love giving is that being selfish is good, everyone is actually selfish and does everything to get something in return. This statement is true and false. Both scenarios can be explained. But first let us study the life we have. whether we like it or not everything is cyclic. The water evaporates and collects into clouds and finally rains, giving back the water that evaporated. We see proof of cyclic behaviour everywhere. Things are born they live then perish and new life is born again. Whether its flowers, fruits, living creatures, day and night. What this shows is that if one becomes selfish then one is breaking the cycle and then harmony is broken. If you become a dead end like, you take things but never give back. You only care for your own comfort and pleasure and never bother about others. If this is the selfish which seems better then its not good and eventually will cause disruption and pain. Coming back to the first statement. A person can claim to be selfish and very happy. For instance a mother will do all for the kid because of the pleasure she gets to see the kid happy. It can be termed that she was being selfish. But this is positive selfish. When you give a lot and receive back it may be called selfish but there is a difference. Doing something with intent to get back can be termed selfish. But doing something selflessly and receiving back is positive selfish. The person would have been happy even if nothing came back. This is a high stage of being selfless and getting rewards. The good we do should be done with the intent that your action will positively alter the society around you. The long term \u2018selfish\u2019 intent is the good of all humanity. So be selfish but selflessly. ",

            "answer_text": "Selfish people think so, but in reality, nah selfish people think that having more means they\u2019re better, but what does better have to do with being happy or being successful, being better means you rely more on what you have rather than what you want. To win in life is to keep living, doing what you wanna do, never grabbing useless things that do stuff that you can do and in more ways, life is more than technology and being successful, life is experiencing the highs and lows of what it gives you, you don\u2019t need money to be happy. Society doesn\u2019t decide whether you should be happy or sad, you make the decision never should someone say otherwise. :) ",

Circumstances may be better for those who are more selfish, but that\u2019s only because others are unwilling to really do anything about their inconsiderate actions. \u201cLife\u201d might seem better to those who are selfish, but they\u2019re just making themselves into the enemies of others. When the others recognize this, their lives will (should) change quickly. This doesn't mean to use violence, but to remember that your words are a weapon. Attack the ideals that cause them to behave the way that they behave, and change that horrible person into a budding human. ",

We are self-full and can share energy and time and love in a way that those who are not can\u2019t. There is no winning in life. We all have our own unique paths and we all, at some point, leave our physical bodies. Some of us allow ourselves to become and grow through out our lives. The becoming and the growing is not winning, it is accelerating as a result of being untamed by fear. ",
