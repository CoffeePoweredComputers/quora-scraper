            "answer_text": "This is a picture of George Stinney Jr., the youngest recorded person in the history of this country to be executed.  He was fourteen years old, stood at five foot one, and weighed ninety pounds when they put him on the electric chair. He was so small that his own head couldn\u2019t reach where it was supposed to go to receive the shock, so they made him sit on his copy of the Bible. One day, in his hometown, in the deep south, two little white girls were riding their bicycles when they stopped to ask George and his sister where they could find a certain breed of flower. When the girls were answered, they went riding off and that\u2019s all they saw of them. Shortly after that encounter, the girls were found dead in a pond. They\u2019d both been brutally battered by a blunt object. George was on the search party to find the girls, but then when they were found dead the authorities immediately suspected George, a child, of having committed such a crime. He swore he didn\u2019t do it. But he was tortured, interrogated, and starved by authorities for so long they bribed him into confessing that he did, telling him that he\u2019d be released and fed if he did so. When George confessed, he was taken to court, and an all-white jury took ten minutes to decide that he was guilty of killing those two girls. His parents weren\u2019t even there to see him, since they risked being lynched if they did so, due to the stigma surrounding the Stinney family during the trial. George obviously didn\u2019t kill anyone. He was probably too small to even pick up the murder weapon and bash two girls with it multiple times. He was not guilty, and yet this horrific, shameful, and disgusting story shows itself in more than one case, many of the victims facing the same fate George did. All of them had one thing in common: They were all black. This is an example of prejudice in its worse form, when this country decided it hated black people so much simply because of pigmentation that they murdered an innocent child. People act like this is all in the past, and we\u2019ve moved on past racism. They act like there isn\u2019t a chance we\u2019d do something ever so despicable again, as to let our own law enforcement kill people like this, or to let civilians get away with it. They\u2019re wrong. The shooting of Trayvon Martin was only eight years ago. While Martin wasn\u2019t killed by law enforcement, his killer was acquitted by law enforcement after he claimed he was defending himself, even though he stocked, chased and initiated a fight with Trayvon before shooting him. This is just one example of this kind of injustice, and there are many more examples, some of which don\u2019t even make the mainstream media. All of this is due to prejudice, which many people have even if they don\u2019t realize it. These are two ways in which prejudice has manifested itself in its worse forms over the past one hundred years of this country, and in it shows how in that span we\u2019ve barely gotten any better. In order to end this prejudice, we have to make sure we end it all, in every human being in this country and in all its forms, no matter how mild or extreme that prejudice is. This is done with education, because racism is the result of ignorance, and you answer ignorance with education. In the words of Nathan Rutstein: \u201cPrejudice is an emotional commitment to ignorance.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Prejudice has two meanings.  One is, preconceived inaccurate ideas about probabilities relating to people.   The other is, preconceived inaccurate ideas about probabilities relating to people, which probabilities are not adjusted in the face of new facts.   The former kind is universal and inevitable, and only harms a society when that society chooses to freak out about it as though it were not inevitable. The latter kind is utterly avoidable, and always hurtful to society by wasting potential: potential use of existing but unacknowledged positive aspects of people; potential positive aspects of existing people that are not yet developed; and potential healthy relationships and dynamics between existing people.
