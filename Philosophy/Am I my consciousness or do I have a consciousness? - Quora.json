            "answer_text": "You have self-consciousness or self-conscious awareness which means you are conscious and know it. Self-consciousness is the knowledge the mind has of its act as its own.Self- consciousness demands a spiritual principle. A person is composed of a body and soul. Matter, and particularly the brain, cannot turn back on itself or reflect. The body and soul are unified into a single unified organism.Just for a few moments consider the fact that you are thinking. That you have thoughts. Either you think your own thoughts or the brain thinks for you. The notion is not only absurd but repugnant. It's repulsive.The brain can generate many things such as singular images, has sense memory and other operations but it cannot form concepts, form judgements, understand, reason. All of these operations transcend sense. They are suprasensuous. If you do not want to hold to the soul as the source of self-consciousness then you still cannot hold to matter as its source. This is why neuroscience will never find self-consciousness in the brain. It is a waste of time and money and research. ",

            "answer_text": "Friends, It is inquired here that Am i my consciousness or do i have a consciousness. As you are/as a man is, in theory, you are your consciousness i.e.you-yourself is consciousness -you, in your ultimate existential meaning, are consciousness. But, in context to you, as you take yourself as who you are, right now, you are your body and you do have consciousness.This is reality of a man, as he is/reality of you, as you are, right now. A man is esoterically aimed to be consciousness from where he is right now. This is called conscious evolution. Till, you remain body/till you remain identified with body, you are body and you have consciousness. It is spiritual technique named who am i? , one of many, which leads you from being body to being consciousness. Essence of technique who am i is not \u201cto think\"but is \u201cto see\"as seeing in itself seperates consciousness from what is not consciousness, leading you to be in actuality. Thanks Q guru ",

Of course, if you believe that consciousness exists as an independent entity outside your brain, then you will reject what I have said here. ",
