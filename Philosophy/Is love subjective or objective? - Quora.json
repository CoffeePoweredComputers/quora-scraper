            "answer_text": "Love can be subjective as well as objective. It depends on the person on how he/she looks at it. However, to be a little more clear, love is mainly objective when the love is for some inanimate or a non-alive object. Examples being love for gadgets, or may be shoes, or bags or other accessories. This kind of love may or may not last long depending on how you look at it. Cause it tends to fade away after we get hold of it. Some times it may retain. Like, if you're working and you buy a car that you've always wanted to. So it becomes objective. Love is mainly subjective when it's towards a person. It's just unconditional. You love the person even if you've had some rough time together. Love for your parents or siblings or relatives are all subjective. Cause you can never replace them with someone else. Hence you tend to love them and care for them always. Objective love on the other hand is conditional. Cause when you look at something, you compare it with another material of the same category and then you choose which one to buy and which to discard. You can't do that with parents or people.  However, if you're someone who is stuck between two people and cannot choose one of the two, then it's a problem. Here I would ask you to wait, think about everything, take time and take the right decision. But if you feel bad for choosing one over the other and then go to the other person, then that's bad on your part. ",

            "answer_text": "Ideas can be subjective or objective. Love is not an idea. It is a feeling or a radiant energy, or metaphysically may be the energetic fabric of our being. Interpretations are ideas, and those interpretations can be subjective or objective, but not love itself. A symbolic pointer is not the reality it points to. To conflate love with an idea (provable, unprovable, subjective, objective, etc.) is one of the great errors of fundamentalism. Please don\u2019t conflate these very different things. Love doesn\u2019t have a reason. Love doesn\u2019t need a reason. Reason deals with ideas. Love does not. If your \u201clove\u201d needs a reason, it is really a form of judgment or approval, which you\u2019ve momentarily confused with love. Love is the centerpiece of all spiritual growth, and virtually all religious traditions. God is love. To the extent we remember and embrace that we are aspects of the One Infinite Creator, we are love. Love is forgiveness and understanding, toward ourselves and others. Love is letting go of expectation and past hurt. Love is being present here and now. Love is the ultimate alternative to fear. Love is a state of being, far beyond ideas. Getting stuck in ideology (subjective, objective, etc.) only distracts us from the journey to love. ",
