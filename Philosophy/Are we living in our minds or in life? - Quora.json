            "answer_text": "Life is a journey. Mind is a path where we all are being dragged in. We get up in the morning thinking why we woke up. And all we do throughout the day is to blame things that goes against us. We all have become so dependent that when we think we forget, what is right? When is it right? How is it right? We always become a part of the herd of sheep. Go with the flow without analysing where we are heading to. Minds are the controller of the body. It would control you till you allow it to do. You are the controller of your own life. You are the mastermind. Then why to listen those unnecessary stuffs which you regret after doing every single day. But next morning, you again go to that place to work. Happiness is within your budget. Pain isn't . So tell your minds to shut there fuck up and just you do what you want to do. Live life like you want. Love shopping? Go and buy stuffs you love. Hate your relationship? Get out of that fuss. Don't have money? Huuh, life is more beautiful than earning dollars, man!!! Want your goals? Go and fight with the goal keepers who are refusing it to make a hit. If we would have been living our life since long , we wouldn't have been so enthusiastic to know the reason behind our sadness, regret, pain and anxiety. Life is simple. We just make it complicated in search of simple life. Yes,at last I can say that we all live in our minds. Do stuffs that help us to earn a living not make a living with happiness. ",
