            "answer_text": "This question will become increasingly relevant as technology advances. What will be the options for \u201credemption\u201d a hundred years from now? When AI, nanotechnology, and human immortality are a reality? For example if someone is sentenced to life without parole\u2026 well what does that mean anymore once human immortality is actually an option? Should the prisoner be denied that technology?\u2026 but if you deny access to the prisoners, is that the same thing as a death sentence? On the flip side, if the prisoner is given the treatment, does that mean they should still spend infinity behind bars? Is that still justice? Probably not. There is no easy answer to this especially for people who have committed truly heinous crimes. I suppose it depends on your definition of redemption and justice. My personal belief is that the continuity of self is an illusion. You *believe* that you are still the same person that you were 5 minutes ago. And you intuitively also believe that you have never died. Humans evolved to have these instincts of self and continuous survival. However I believe (with some justification from science) that these intuitive notions are false. The truth is that your brain is nothing but a vessel which \u201chouses\u201d a continuous stream of conscious moments. Each of those \u201cmoments\u201d is actually a new person (albeit with your memories and neural connections), and the \u201cold you\u201d is now dead. You have actually died countless times. You just never actually \u201cexperience death\u201d because there is nothing to experience- with death, all conscious perception ends. It\u2019s the same situation with everyone else including, evil people. With every moment a new person comes into existence\u2026 but it\u2019s a new person who shares the evil persons memories, his flaws, and his inclinations to do evil things. Nobody can will themselves into existence a minute from now. A new \u201cus\u201d comes into existence, and then we observe what happens. That\u2019s the end of the story. So now what do you do with this new person. Corporal punishment now seems excessive in hindsight. Should this new person be punished at all now, or is that wrong? Here\u2019s my recommendation. We will still need laws and punishment in order to protect the public and deter any future crimes. But what if in the future we give the \u201cbad people\u201d the option to be changed at a cellular level? By this I mean using nanotechnology to physically change someone\u2019s neural pathways in order to actually transform them into a good person for real. Is that not the definition of redemption? To remake yourself into a better person who can bring some good into the world? Give the prisoner the option of taking the change or waiting out their sentence\u2026 I guess. I probably won\u2019t get much support for this opinion. But it seems like the best solution to me going forward. This will never be an easy answer, especially for the loved ones of the victims. ",

            "answer_text": "Are there people who can't be redeemed? Is there a point at which we should stop trying to help someone? At what point is someone acting destructively past the point of help? I note that this question is tagged with the Alcoholism topic so I\u2019ll answer from my experience with that subject. No, no one is irredeemable. I\u2019ve seen people make miraculous recoveries after years of trying without success. I have seen the nastiest people turn on a dime and begin to work diligently at becoming the best people I\u2019ve ever known. Is it my job to redeem everyone that comes across my path, no matter how sick, because of that? Also no. The point at which you give up trying to help someone else is fluid, dependent on who you are and where you are in your recovery and dependent on who they are, the situation they are in and where they are in their recovery. If you are not in a strong position yourself a very needy person can drag you down with them. Even if you are strong, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re the right person to help everyone that comes before you. My yardstick is that I try to keep helping as long as I see that person is still trying. Sometimes they need more help than I can give and I always recommend that people try to find a professional counsellor they can trust as well as talking to other laymen in recovery circles. I have moved people on to other people who I think can do more for them than I can. But I have never given up on anyone. Anyone can get well from the mental illness of addiction. My job is to help them believe that so that they never stop looking for the help they need. ",

            "answer_text": "I love this question. Because it leads me to reflect on the meaning of the word redeem. That is actually a very different question from the second part of what you ask: when do you to stop trying to help someone? That causes me to reflect on how to define help. and the third question you ask is when is someone past the point of help? First, when you redeem something, like a coupon, or a reward card, you are collecting its true worth or value. You are finding out exactly what it is worth. Obviously all humans all living creatures have inherent value and worth. We judge the relative amount of that worth based on sets of criteria depending on our own morals and values and ethics. For some, human worth is based on what a person contributes or how hard working they are. For others, it\u2019s based on a person\u2019s state of innocence or sin and whether they have sought absolution and made amends. For others, it's based on a person\u2019s relationship to you so the closer they are to you in relationship, the more value they have. Everyone has the capacity for growth and change to some degree. Whether the person changes enough to meet your needs, or whether a person changes in a way that is an improvement for your needs is separate issue. It requires you to conduct a cost benefit analysis to determine whether it\u2019s healthy for you to continue a relationship with the other person right now, as they are currently functioning. Not based on your hope that they might someday change to your specifications. Is it healthy to have them in your life right now? ",
