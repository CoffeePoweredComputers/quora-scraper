            "answer_text": "Well, I go along with that good ol' boy, who said, \"Everybody has to believe in something. I believe I'll have another beer.\" Beyond that: I know that the house has a slight but significant edge at a craps table and, if I play long enough, the house will siphon off 41 cents of every hundred dollars I bet. I believe that some night the random distribution of the dice throws at a specific table will -- for a time -- favor the players instead of the house. I just hope I'm there and playing when that happens.[1] I know that I cannot prove the existence or nonexistence of any gods. Nor do I have to. As an atheist, it is enough to say that I have no belief in any god or gods. But I personally believe, though I cannot prove it, that there are no gods and there is no afterlife. (Subject to change upon presentation of credible, objective, verifiable evidence to the contrary.) I believe life is a journey, and we'd better make the most of it, because it's the only one we've got. It is not a dress rehearsal for something still to come. I know the world we live in and everything in it, including our presence here, are the result of a series of random events. I believe that randomness is far more important than almost anything else in our lives.  _______________ [1] This happens fairly often in short spurts or no one would play craps more than once. I'm talking about a long run against the house where the players can do no wrong. It can happen. It will happen. I'd love to have it happen to me. ",
