            "answer_text": "It depends on how different societies\u2019 assertiveness regarding hypocrisy. Or in other words, hypocrisy at light extent maybe accepted or even encouraged in some societies but critized in others. Hypocrisy is kind of gray area in a communication where various societies will have its own benchmark to account whether it\u2019s hypocrisy or not. Here is a case to illustrate: imagine you are an expat in A and C country respectively. And you are asked by a local if you like their country. Society A may value honesty and thus you would be appreciated for giving a realistic answer. Whereas society C may value agree-ability or harmony, then your answer will be favored if you tell them the positive points of life in that society. However, this is given the questioner\u2019s priority, otherwise of course you are free to handle the question whichever way you like it. In my opinion, hypocrisy at light extent kind of promote public harmony and it has a limit of course. Nevertheless I myself a straight forward person who \u201csees something then says something\u201d. Therefore I am not very good at making light hypocritical expression, yet I learn how to express my ideas in a way of not hurting anyone while add a bit humor if I can. This is my personal benchmark regardless of what language I speak and which societiy I live in. ",

The whole \u201cIf you're not doing it, why should I?\u201d of hypocrism is usually how people end up viewing it, and once authority is challenged, authority can be broken down. Sometimes, hypocrisy can be used for stating a point or teaching a lesson, but even these end up feeling unfair and dishonest. The lack of care towards the other party is what makes hypocrisy hard to deal with and gives it negative effects. If one could be a hypocrite while still caring and not breaking that trust, it could be effective. ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose someone could be promoting evil while being a pure person but then, promoting evil is evil. So maybe no hypocrisy can be good. I assume you mean beneficial as \u201cgood\u201d. Of course you can benefit yourself by pretending to be good (many professional politicians can join that club). That\u2019s the fundamental use of the term hypocrisy. ",
