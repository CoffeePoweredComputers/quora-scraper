            "answer_text": "Q. How does Aristotle explain the mean as it relates to humans?  (1) This is one of those things that Aristotle got famous for, without his expecting it. If Ari is with us now, he\u2019ll tell us that there\u2019s no such thing as the \u2018Doctrine of the Golden Mean\u2019. There is something we might call a \u2018doctrine of the mean\u2019. But, there\u2019s nothing very golden about it. (2) The doctrine says that every moral virtue lies at a midpoint between opposed vices. What does this mean? It isn\u2019t a geometrical midpoint.It isn\u2019t a point of moderation either.(3) The doctrine amounts to this. Simply, in order to be virtuous, don\u2019t do or feel either too much, or too little. Like when the doctor advised you to take \u2018the appropriate amount\u2019 of medicine. Not too much. Not too little. But, this is not terribly helpful. How much medicine is appropriate for you, here and now, andwhat is the right thing to do or feel.There\u2019re some rules of thumb. Don\u2019t drink yourself stupid every evening. Be generous to your friends when they need you. Don\u2019t run away at the first sight of your enemy. And so on. Apart from these, you\u2019ve to use your moral sensibility. A philosopher can\u2019t do anything for you. Then, what\u2019s the use of Ethics philosophers, and the Philosophy of Ethics? (4) The question before us is: How do we make a success of our lives? How\u2019re we to flourish, and to be happy? Answer: To be a good human being. To be a finished product of the human species. It\u2019s a matter of having, and consistently acting upon, the virtues. It follows that for you to flourish, you need to live in accordance with characteristically human virtues. (5) Types of Virtues (5a) There\u2019re the virtues of character, aka moral virtues. Courage, generosity, justice, friendliness, wittiness. (5b) There\u2019re the virtues of intellect. Knowledge, wisdom, acuity. These\u2019re superior to the virtues of character. The life of scientific and philosophical study is the highest form of human life. But, not everyone is capable of highfalutin soaring virtues of intellect. That\u2019s fine. Make the best of virtues of character. Especially if you\u2019re in politics. (6) Are virtues merely inclinations then? Yes, and so too, vices. But, they\u2019re not just inclinations to act. Doctrine of the Mean talks about doing and feeling. Virtues (and vices) are inclinations to feel, as well as to act. (7) To be virtuous, must we master our emotions? No. (7a) For example, fear. It\u2019s the emotion involved with courage. We often say: \u2018Brave men are fearless\u2019. Taken literally, that\u2019s false. A soldier who isn\u2019t afraid of a bayonet through his groin isn\u2019t brave. He\u2019s insensible. There\u2019s no virtue in that. You shouldn't try to eliminate your fears. There\u2019re plenty of things it\u2019s rational to be afraid of. You shouldn\u2019t try to master your fears. A brave man isn\u2019t someone who trembles inside, but manages to bottle it up, and get on with the job. That\u2019s self-control. It\u2019s better than nothing. But, it\u2019s not virtue. A brave soldier is often very afraid. He doesn\u2019t have to master his fear. He acts with his fear, not in spite of it. (8) For example, love. You\u2019ll agree it\u2019s insane to suppress all feelings of love. But equally, it\u2019s not good to master your love, if you\u2019ve to force yourself to act in the appropriate loving way when you really don't feel much love. Or, when you\u2019re overwhelmed with passion. A good lover has the right amount of love for his children, for his friends. And \u2018right\u2019 isn\u2019t the same as \u2018moderate\u2019. What would you think of a Mom who has a moderate love for her kids?  Above: Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle's best-known work on ethics. The work, which plays a pre-eminent role in defining Aristotelian ethics, consists of 10 books, originally separate scrolls, and is understood to be based on notes from his lectures at the Lyceum. Nicomachus is his son. ",
