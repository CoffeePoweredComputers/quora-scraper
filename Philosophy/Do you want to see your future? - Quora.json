            "answer_text": "No. I wouldn't like to see my future. Once I see my future I will keep thinking about it, I would keep on trying desperately to make it better, more luxurious, more satisfactory to my materialistic needs. I would forget all about the beauty of the path of life, the experiences I encounter, I people I meet, the rivalries I have, the friends that I make etc. These all are things are the ones that I can enjoy if I don't see my future. Anybody like me would surely choose this beautiful journey over a short lived glory of a destination. Moreover the destination I see may not feel enough for me right now when I see into the future, but maybe it was enough to satisfy the future me as maybe by that time I understood what I really wanted in my life that I don't now. People and persectives change with time. Why break the rule of nature and spoil the fun of life? Future may hold happily, sorrows, joys and what not, but I can only change the today. So why bother my small brain by extra thoughts and tensions! ",

            "answer_text": "No,I am just not interested in seeing my future. To be honest though, when I was young I was very much interested. I was curious to know what the future held for me in so many various fields. But as I grew older I realised no one can actually predict the future. They can tell us how the current planets are placed in the houses of our horoscope and how they will affect us. They will also guide us to overcome the difficulties we are facing by doing various poojas and Homam. Then practicality set in. After introspection I realised why wait for someone to tell us to pray and how to pray. As I pray daily to God I decided to pray with more dedication and love instead of praying mechanically while doing other chores. I continued praying while cooking ofcourse but spent more time in the prayer room. The effect was gratifying and peaceful. I never felt the need to know my future. So that's how it is. ",

It is only that he is hiding it from himself. If I am a boy, I will become man, marry a girl, have kids, grow old and die. This is my future. A few things may change. I may marry very beautiful girl and live in a grand house. Or my kids may become Einstein. But the major milestones are fixed. Just like in business they decide that they will launch product X in some year 2050 and it will cause Y amount of profit, it is fixed that I will die in 100 years from now. ",

I doesn't wish to see my future though, rather I like to see \u201cA Developed India\u201d. We have been as a developing country since number of decades and still it is. I want to leap forward to another 50 years and then 100 years to see how India has transformed. I would love to watch those imaginary animations and pictures, that being shown by government about a futuristic India, in reality. If our Time Machine works fine and bring back us again. I'll share the events here again on Quora and also will let the whole world know for any catastrophic events and World war III(if it happens). ",
