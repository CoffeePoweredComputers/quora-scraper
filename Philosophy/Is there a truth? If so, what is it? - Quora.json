            "answer_text": "Since most people answered with yes, there is a truth (which I generally agree with) I would just like to refer to a theory that kind of goes the other way: Constructivism, or radical constructivism.According to constructivists, there is no such thing as an objective truth (which I assume you meant when you asked your question) but rather everyone constructs their own, subjective truth in their minds. For example: Two people go out for dinner and eat exactly the same food, but their experience of the night might still be very different and subjective to each of them. I think this also kind of goes in the same direction as this thought experiment about being able to see colours: I might recognize an apple as red because I have learnt that this colour that is commonly found in apples is called red, but you on the other hand might also say the apple is red while actually looking at it and seeing what in my mind might be blue or yellow or any other colour. We both think it\u2019s the truth / the objective truth to say this is a red apple, but subjectively we have two very different truths. Now, there is a lot of criticism for this theory, and I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that I support constructivism (some strong criticism concerns for example historic revisionism, the idea that you construct your own personal truth in your mind could be used to discredit for example holocaust survivors) but I thought I could bring it up anyways just to bring another perspective to the discussion.What is interesting about it though is that the constructivist theory has also been applied to education and teaching methods etc.. You can look up Ernst von Glasersfeld if you\u2019re interested. ",

            "answer_text": "Is there a truth about what? If you are asking whether or not there is truth in general, you might find the following argument interesting: Suppose that there is no truth. Then it must be the case that it is true that there is no truth. But if it is true that there is no truth, then there exists something which is true, namely, that there is no truth. But this violates our assumption that there is no truth to begin with. Hence there must be some truth. We might spell out the argument rigorously as follows:  Premise I: Either it is the case that there is truth, or it is the case that there is no truth. Premise II: Suppose that there is no truth. Premise III: If it is the case that there is no truth, then the fact that there is no truth is true. Conclusion I: That there is no truth is true. Conclusion II: It is the case that there is truth.  If you're asking about other sorts of \"truths\" you might want to look into the philosophical debate between realism and anti-realism. These are broad positions that have implications in ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, philosophy of science and other branches. ",
