            "answer_text": "They worked together in Berlin. The relationship between them was called as \u201cFriends in contradiction\u201d I found t the following link: Biografie / Privat / 1909 This a translation made with the help of DeepL translator: Friends in contradiction The relationship between the two famous scientists Einstein (Nobel Prize in Physics 1921) and Haber (Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1919) has been characterised as a friendship \"in contradiction\" (Fritz Stern). Despite different opinions they were friends, despite their friendship they had differences. The two never had any problems with each other. Although Einstein's letters began with \"Lieber Haber...\" and the chemist wrote: \"Lieber Freund Einstein\", they did not go any further. The historian Fritz Stern summed up: \"Einstein was proud to be a Jew, just as Haber was proud to be a German. It honors both men, and Einstein in particular, that the oppression everyone must have felt about each other's attitudes did not seriously affect their friendship. It remained a deep, mostly unspoken contradiction in questions of human existence and intensity.\" Haber had strongly advocated Einstein's appointment to Berlin after the two had met in 1909. When Einstein's marriage with Mileva broke down, Haber and his wife tried to mediate Clara. Einstein, on the other hand, was visibly deeply shocked by the suicide of Haber's wife (who had killed herself, probably out of desperation for Haber's commitment to the \"gas war\"). Above all, Einstein did not share the chemist's commitment to German affairs. In 1914, when Haber, together with many others, made an appeal to the world of culture against the condemnation of the German attack on neutral Belgium, Einstein and only a few other scientists supported an appeal to the Europeans to condemn the war. Conversely, Haber shared the physicist's commitment to a state of Israel only to a limited extent. When Einstein together with Chaim Weizmann collected international money for the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the 1920s, Haber tried to prevent him from doing so, because he feared that Einstein could expose himself to strong hostility from the German public (which actually happened). As much as Einstein rejected Haber's attitudes towards Germany, he even called him a \"tragic figure\" in 1930, whose \"patriotic attitude had been abused\", he was very pleased, that her friend had left the country in the summer of 1933: \"I am very happy\" - he commented mockingly - \"that her former love for the blonde beast [meant was Germany] has cooled down a little bit\".
