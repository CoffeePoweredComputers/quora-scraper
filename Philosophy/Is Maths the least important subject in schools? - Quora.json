            "answer_text": "Hate to burst your bubble but math is one of the most important subjects in school. Mostly because math is everywhere. How do you balance your checkbook?How do you determine how much paint and carpet you need in order to redo your living room?How do you figure out what that car loan will really cost you (compound interest)?How do you compare two different mortgage offers?How do you do your own taxes?Reality is most people have no idea how much math they use in their daily life and will use in their future careers. Can\u2019t do math - forget about becoming an engineer.Can\u2019t do math - forget about studying physics in college. Hate to tell you how many wannabe physics majors who said \u201cI can do the physics but just can\u2019t handle the math\u201d. And that was in first year. Take a course in classical mechanics and consider the question \u201cIf you throw a ball into the air how high will it go?\u201d Welcome to the world of differential equations.Can\u2019t do math - forget about becoming a plumber. I remember reading an article about adult training courses - always oversubscribed - after all, someone is going to show me how to turn a wrench and I\u2019m guaranteed a job at $65,000 to start. Seems those classes go well until the topic turns to the calculation of flow rates (pretty basic math) at which point half the class drops out. Same goes for being an electrician - people quit when they\u2019ve got to figure out the impedance of a series/parallel circuit.Can\u2019t do math - forget about most research jobs. After all, performing statistical analyses is something you\u2019ll have to do and if you can\u2019t understand something as basic as the difference between Type One and Type Two errors you\u2019re SOL.Can\u2019t do math - forget about many jobs at investment banks. And forget about being an actuary at an insurance company.Can\u2019t do math - forget about a degree in any of the STEM subjects.Can\u2019t do math - forget about a degree in economics or business.\u2026\u2026Reality is, except for pure humanities degrees you\u2019re going to have to learn math at well beyond the basic algebra level. (As already noted, that includes economics and business degrees.) BTW, a failure to understand the mathematical underpinnings of any number of things can have disastrous consequences, not just for you but for the economy in general. Think about Michael Li\u2019s Gaussian Copula formula Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street That formula is advanced math. Very advanced. The problem isn\u2019t that the formula was wrong but rather was how it was used. Simply put, people didn\u2019t really understand what was going on. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is. After all, we all learn how to solve quadratic equations, and nobody has ever needed to solve a quadratic equation after leaving school, right? And what\u2019s this deal about Pythagoras\u2019 theorem? Who has honestly needed to use Pythagoras\u2019 theorem after leaving school? Oh, but let\u2019s not leave it at that. What\u2019s the deal with learning about Shakespeare and English poetry? Nobody has ever needed that after school. And what\u2019s the deal about learning who the past Presidents were? I mean, who cares? I\u2019m sure I can still be a functioning, law-abiding citizen without this information. And why do we learn science? I\u2019m not going to become a scientist after leaving school. Yes, maths is the least important subject in school. Actually, no subject in school is important. Or every subject in school is important, depending on how you look at each of them. ",
