            "answer_text": "A nice question: I used to wonder why I am here, until I realised I\u2019m here for the same reason every living creature is here \u2014 billions of years ago something happened that caused a collection of molecules to replicate itself. From that beginning all life has evolved in a mind-boggling diversity that no one can get their heads around. The time scales are too vast, the sheer number of life forms, most of which have already become extinct is too enormous to contemplate. The billions of mutations that had to occur in order to arrive at whales, spiders, humans trees, sea weeds\u2026 leaves me in utter awe at all life, its transience, it\u2019s staying power and the magnificent pointlessness of it all that should inspire awe in every human.
