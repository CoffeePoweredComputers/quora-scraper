            "answer_text": "Philosophy is good for to become an orator, good to become the best politician in the world, a best spiritual guru in the world. All these groups want constant reformation in society through radical rethinking. Bureaucratic fellows always want to stick to the norm with zero degrees of creativity. Bureaucratic administration is another style of terrible administration and destructive administration in our society. It is the worst form of materialistic administration, an unfocused administration of public property. If you master in philosophy, you will become a 100% failure in administration as your screening committee may not understand your worth. Most of the news spread in respect of civil services are false news and I can provide with proof that most are number one in doing blunders throughout their life. If you want to change the nation, you can be a politician and never try to become a glorified clerk. ",

            "answer_text": "The trick is - 'if it works, best & if it lags, worst'. That is not serious, though. Let us be specific and honest. Philosophy is a much loved subject among the UPSC aspirants who come from Arts background (generally). It has the option of manipulation, argue and debate and moulding. Can you be comfortable at that?  Getting deeper: Philosophy questions in the UPSC mains examinations will not be the same as in your graduation or even post graduation days. The questions here will demand your strong arguments, contextual explanations and viable logics. In general, people believe that philosophy is a subject that can buy more marks in examination. However, the person who will go through your answers in UPSC mains, will be HONEST, SCHOLAR and interested in Philosophy. You cannot make his wit astray and score your ground here.  What can you do? If you have even a moderate interest in philosophy, try to go through some books of university level. If you can develop a logic, see your understanding going in any direction and it does not bore you, it's for you. Once you begin understanding philosophy, you have the chances that you can exploit it at any level.  ",
