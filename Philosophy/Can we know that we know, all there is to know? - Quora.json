            "answer_text": "Can we know that we know all there is to know? Nice question. We usually say that we do not know all that there is to know. We believe there are things out there that we do not know about - dark energy, extraterrestrials, wormholes, the start of the universe, lots of things. But paraphrasing your question, \u201ccan we know, can we be sure, whether there really are things unknown to us?\u201d We could propose that we do know all that there is to know. That would be a hard one to argue against. We can\u2019t really know whether there are unknown things without identifying what they might be, and that\u2019s knowledge. We can select anything we say we don\u2019t know, and propose that it doesn't exist. We can legitimately apply that to all those things mentioned above. Dark energy and wormholes could be fantasies, ET is unprovable, the universe may not have had a beginning. Perhaps I\u2019m just restating it, but every time we say we don\u2019t know something, we are saying we know there to be a something that we don\u2019t know. Perhaps there isn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Apparently. I currently have a particular problem with the word \u2018fact\u2019. This is not a word I have really used since I finished my undergraduate degree in Science. That four-year introduction into academia removed most of my resolutions regarding reality. It became evident that \u2018evidence\u2019 is the product of examination. This is obviously and necessarily true, but I wonder how many of us really grapple with the concept. As someone who has just spent a day examining people, I am intensely aware of pre-test and post-test probabilities and the unsettling fact that gold standards for diagnosis change. Anyone who doesn\u2019t see the problem with that probably hasn\u2019t thought about it enough\u2026  No standardized guidelines exist for the biostatistical methods appropriate for studies evaluating diagnostic tests. Publication recommendations such as the STARD statement provide guidance for the analysis of data, but biostatistical advice is minimal and application is inconsistent. (Methods and recommendations for evaluating and reporting a new diagnostic test) Can you believe the paragraph above?! The paper I am citing is from a publication of the ESCMID. That body will be one of those responsible for rolling out diagnostic strategies in a pandemic. Which test should we use to determine who is infected? \u201cIt\u2019s debatable\u201d is the answer. But tests are what tell us the truth!! Yet data does not tell you how to collect or classify data - especially when you are testing a method of classification. The sooner we get this in our heads, the better. So, you can know all there is to know when you decide that all there is to know is what you know. This is what I find happening on Quora all the time - talk of \u2018objective evidence\u2019 and (horror of horrors) \u2018scientific fact\u2019. The case is made most obvious in mathematics: one can know with absolute certainty what a result is - however one can know with equal certainty that such a result is not necessarily applicable to any aspect of our experience whatsoever. Show me five \u2018fingers\u2019 (one\u2019s a \u2018thumb\u2019) and I\u2019ll show you fourteen phalanges. The game is infinite because the boundaries of \u2018what is\u2019 are never known except by axiomatic definition.  So, you know you know what there is to know when you can convince yourself of that. It\u2019s that simple and it always has been. It\u2019s how logic produces perfect precision and it\u2019s called a proof. If we avoid asking what the proof pertains to beyond its own assumptions then we will be fine. Some seem able to do this, and (to be honest) I kind of envy them. ",

I read a few years back, competency goes through four-phases: Unconcious IncompetenceConscious IncompetenceConscious CompetenceUnconscious-CompetenceThe first lacks awareness of what needs to be known. The second is awareness of what needs to be known. The third is awareness that you do know. And the fourth is fluent-awareness that you do know. I believe your question pertains to a phase between the third and fourth-phases listed above. Most would say an all-knowing being is either too advanced on a human-scale or simply doesn't exist. I subscribe to Ayn Rand's line of thought. She suggested we shouldn't complain of our incapacity for omniscience. But to content ourselves with possessing enough contextual-information where survival can take place. We can than improve upon survival, through leveraging that knowledge through tools that save time and effort. I suggest, as Ms. Rand does as well, that we can know enough to get by and improve our lot in life. Yet In short I'd have to say the answer is, no. ",

            "answer_text": "I think things are so numerous that most of them will be always unbeknown to us. So I agree there unknown things. But, as a rationalist I think they may remain unknown because they lack necessary interest or import on our reality to arouse our curiosity about them, or because we may reach an end to scientific production for reasons with no business with knowledge itself. Like a worldwide widespread form of religious fanaticism, or a sudden deliberate ecological return to preindustrial forms of life or the very extinction of our species. Most probably, because the realm of knowledge so so immense that we will never manage to have an exaustive account of facts. Other possibility is that there be a king of randomness ingrained in Nature, so future is contingent, so about future events we will ever bump into surprises. What I think is part of the irrational agenda is conceive of such a a theory, never put in the form of scientific method so it could be tested, but always elusive and speculatory, like in MacCollin, Kant, Chomski, is the one that ascertains that there would be things unknowable to us, on account of the limitations on our intellectual capabilities, not because we lack, ad this is a trivial truth that will always the case, not technological means to endorse or falsify whatever theory at the lack of sufficiently powerful instruments or a minimum amount of previous data. Out of principle, nothing in the World can remain out of possible perception and explanation, however minimum their relation being to other entities, it will always manifest in ways we can assess as cause-effects relation of regular nature. Theory is based on this coexistence in a world that follows some structural laws, and thing that do exist, are exposed to inter\u2014influence. Effects of their interaction with the world. We ourselves are no way different. We are conscients incarnated in a body that travels in the world opposite our boundaries as entrapped minds whenever we use our senses or talk or communicate with other minds. ",

            "answer_text": "I think we can\u2019t. The problem of this topic is that we are not able to understand or see the things as they ARE, but only a representation of the things accessible to our senses and to our understanding. Hence, all of us have a different (in most of the cases very similar) understanding of the things - say for example if several of us are looking at a cup of tea, most of us will be able to agree on that there is a cup, of color whatever with a brownish -golden liquid in there, etc. However, is this representation describing the thing like it actuall IS? I think not. We are all having a certain level of abstractions in our minds, omitting attributes of details the things (in the tea example nobody would care and see the water molecules comprising the tea liquid, nobody would care about the vibrations of the molecules of the liquid and the cup which we feel as heat, etc.) Hence, depending on the level of abstraction and the level of details you look into phenomena, new things may come up you never could have imagined. It is like Max Planck when he started studying physics at the end of the 19th century: one his Professor adviced him to study something else because \u201call is known and there is nothing new to discover in the world of physics.\u201d In the end I expect that at some far future, things might converge and the costs of making new discoveries and answering new questions might become so costly and produce such low gain in knowledge that humanity might define the field as closed and as \u201call that can be known is known\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Knowing is a cognitive function. That\u2019s the mainstream view. But all of us also know in our hearts, know with our souls. Knowing in this form, reveals knowing\u2019s emotive dimension. Then there\u2019s another kind of knowing, knowing in our spirit, the sense of right or wrong, fairness and unfairness. It can feel like outrage, disappointment, disbelief, existential crises. This kind of knowing has no name, but is nonetheless real once you have experienced it. Some call it conscience, some call it ethical reasoning and morality. No one agrees on its name, but this kind of knowing appears to be universal. In what other ways are we able to know, and able to know that we know? Do we still think it is all cognition? All centred and originating in the brain? The evidence is mounting that we have only just begun to emerge from the brain-centred view of knowing. The Brain-Gut Connection Check out also the endocrine system\u2019s effect on the brain, as well as whether our nervous systems are definitionally separate from the brain. Finally, knowing is filtered through our imperfect memory. There are things that we knew yesterday, but today we no longer. Even collectively. ",

We were not able to concieve this all the way up to the point where someone thought it. I have a hard time giving a good explanation of this, but I know very well that in a thousand years from now, we have made discoveries and had ideas that we have yet to think of as a species. Therefore, based on the history of knowledge that we have, we will know things in the future, of which we are yet to concieve. ",
