            "answer_text": "haha, wow, I already hate your teacher, and I\u2019ve never even met them. You might be presented with a book of some sort that has the goal of arriving at the following (largely incorrect) distinctions: that Hume\u2019s self is the result of previous causes, that Socrates sees the \u201cself\u201d as a continuously changing result of your application of virtues, while Augustin\u2019s self is a neoplatonic ideal that can only be truly known if you can understand \u201cgod\u201d, or the prime mover\u2019s origins in relation to your own role (and thus achieve eudaimonia). That could be good enough for a start. But be aware of that Hume\u2019s determinism is not a given, but an ideal result in the rare, rare occasion where one might have the advantage of being able to make a truly informed decision. Hume\u2019s goal, so to speak, is to have knowledge enough that your moral, semi-rational, choices will become deterministically decided. But this happens only occasionally, if at all, and so Hume\u2019s notion of people\u2019s \u201cselves\u201d is not a very flattering one. A much better approach at getting at what Hume believes the self is, is by looking at his idea of how all fancies and thoughts are compounds of sensory input. And that in essence we are often controlled, even compelled, by these notions of compound concepts that are not in any sense rational. Cut them away!, to borrow a line of Hume\u2019s. So it is a selective type of determinism Hume wants to see, rather than that we should be dictated by what would otherwise be a jumble-lottery of fancies, that we would draw out of our impressionable minds at a regular basis. Socrates, meanwhile, certainly has an understanding of the self. And although he nurses it in a process to coax out of his soul the essence of what wisdom is in Plato\u2019s dialogues - you need to understand that his influences comes from the skeptic\u2019s tradition of denying all certain knowledge. The soul and the self might not be as divine as Plato would ofte have it be, specially without the virtues to guide it. But Socrates\u2019 essence is really that of Parmenides, that all is constantly in movement, and ever-changing. Therefore, even though all rational beings might be able to achieve divinity, or knowledge - and even if the reasons for it is that the gods (whatever they might be in this context) have given us faculties to think with - the true reason for knowledge in Socrates\u2019 world would be the potential of cultivating critical thinking. Through dialogue, through refinement, whatever you might suggest - Socrates\u2019 self would still be ever-changing, and through that change be able to improve and grow wisdom. Wisdom that certainly would be founded on the fact that any one of us will not truly know anything that is eternal, or objectively true. Augustine in this sense is of the opinion that the self is always eternal, and to a certain degree always unchanging. I have always been struck with, when I read Augustine, a kind of suspicion that he must have been a terrifyingly childish person in real life. Specially his view of how language is formed is so naive that it is difficult to excuse his usage of \u201cwhy? Because God!\u201d explanation as anything but an intellectual crutch. But if we are charitable, we could read Augustine\u2019s meditations as an account of how no amount of external influences from school, from masters, authority and priests, would ever actually dominate his inner divinity. And so you could explain Augustine\u2019s notion of \u201cself\u201d as a divine existence that one has to know to know anything at all. But it can also be explained - charitably, I might remind you - as the idea that for all the book-learning that Augustine is forced through, these words and that scholarly wisdom is no match for the inner self\u2019s divinity. In other words, you might actually suggest, although I\u2019d advise against it on the exam, to suggest that Augustine\u2019s divine self is actually his critical sense and his ability to question the content of book-wisdom, and so that the \u201cdivinity\u201d Augustin sees is potentially quite critical of all dogmatism. But essentially, Augustine believes that the self is divine, and that it cannot be changed - it can merely be a question of whether you can learn to express it\u2019s divinity. How that is a view you could possibly have after seeing children play for even a few seconds, I do not know. Much less if you actually remember, as Augustin proposes he does, how it was to be a child. But it is still an interesting notion, that this neo-platonic wisdom resides in all humans, and is given to us by god universally. Application of science is divine, in effect, and the understanding of society and community is a commandment by God himself, lest you would waste the divinity given to you. The father of the modern church, so to speak, certainly would have many words for more modern Christians, that is certain, at least. Good luck on your paper? :) ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t answer this question without doing more reading than I am prepared to do at the moment. I can say this. The word self refers to one\u2019s awareness of his unique identity in the world and the apparent command point of his will. All anyone knows and can know about the self is gained from his actual experience of the same. Unlike an object it cannot be given over to the means and appliances of science. The self not being an object i.e., physical, that door is closed. Religious and metaphysical speculations about of the nature of the self necessarily involve presuppositions that are incapable of demonstration and confirmation. In the end we have only our own experience of the self to draw on. That experience, like others of the mind, is untranslatable except into terms which merely reflect what we know directly and cannot know otherwise. ",
