In other words\u2026 What specifically made a microscopic inanimate object become able to \u201clive\u201d and gain the ability to start replicating itself? How exactly does \u201cinvisible\u201d and ridiculously tiny particles (that we can\u2019t even find) exert enough gravitational force to hold our universe together\u2026 when alone all matter should just fall apart and seperate? Is such a thing as true \u201cnothingness\u201d (an area of space where literally nothing exists inside of it on any level) even possible? Or is it an impossibility? What is the full ecosystem that exists at the bottom of the Mariana Trench?
