            "answer_text": "You\u2019d have to define \u201ctruly random\u201d for this question to be answerable. As you seem to indicate, \u201crandom\u201d means only that we lack the capability to predict the result. But that is a description of our knowledge of the system, not the system itself. If you do something that gains you the knowledge, the result ceases to be random (to you). What you seem to be asking is more like the philosophical question, \u201cIs there a process that produces a result without a knowable cause?\u201d That could mean that (A) There is a hidden cause that is impossible to observe, or (B) There truly is no cause. (B) would definitely be \u201ctruly random\u201d if it exists, (A) may or may not be, depending on your definition. Quantum effects like radioactive decay are examples of one of these, but I can\u2019t tell you which. ",

            "answer_text": "Any system that obeys the laws of Thermodynamics or (better yet) Statistical Mechanics is exhibiting the consequences of randomness \u2014 see Thermal Physics. The distribution of annual income in the USA also shows evidence that most financial transactions are basically random, except at the bottom end (because of social assistance) and the top end (because of corruption and the resources to calculate non-random transactions). If the energy sharing in a gas (or the financial exchanges in an economy) are actually not as random as they seem, as we instinctively suspect, then they must be carefully arranging to fit the assumptions of randomness in every regard \u2014 which, IMNERHO, would be a hell of a lot stranger than actual randomness.

            "answer_text": "Measurements of chaotic processes are mathematically proven to include truly-random noise. Macroscopic physical examples are: Fluid turbulence;A double pendulum;Coupled nonlinear oscillators.In general, nearly cyclic behavior and positive feedback are characteristic of such chaotic systems. The source of the noise is in arbitrarily-small state fluctuations. Chaotic processes tend to amplify these small fluctuations into macroscopic variations. For more inormation about the mathematics and physics of chaotic processes, look up \u201cNonlinear Dynamics.\u201d This field has had a lot of progress over the past forty years, starting in the mid-1970s.

            "answer_text": "Radioactive decay is random. If you have an element with a half-life of, say, 100 years, and you take an atom of that element and wait 100 years, there is a 50% chance that it will decay during that time. To the best of my knowledge, this does not depend on the history of the atom or on anything else that happens to it. It\u2019s a random process. From that, you can figure out probability distributions for what happens if you wait less than 100 years, or if you had more than one atom. ",
