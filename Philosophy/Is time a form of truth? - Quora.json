            "answer_text": "Ifeoluwapo Eleyinafe is a wise man. When he asked this strange question some time ago I found it most striking, and I pondered: what could such a query mean? What deep things could we learn from considering such a proposition? Ife is not one to waste time or effort on what I describe (in deliberately offensive terms - so as to discourage myself from it) as \u2018intellectual masturbation\u2019. Hence, I wrestled with this problematic concept of chronological epistemology. Perhaps the statement \u2018it happened\u2019 could indeed be the summa totalis that sinks my favoured indirect realism? Perhaps the inviolable vector of entropy so solidifies the previous positions of my precious Quantum harmonic oscillators that all dynamic symmetry about the t axis is relegated to pure speculation? Perhaps Pilate\u2019s question in John 18:38 might have been answered by his sundial if only the trial had taken place in daylight? Perhaps the thing that exposes the logical sleight-of-hand of Zeno's paradoxes might itself be the sort of complete and consistent foundation on which to establish the Absoluteness that poor David Hilbert sought so passionately? After all, Einstein gave us the means of deriving our Standpoint most exactly, if only we are certain of the Truth of Time.  But, alas, the Old Hymn rings out: Time, like an ever rolling stream, Bears all its sons away; They fly, forgotten, as a dream Dies at the opening day. and I am reminded of the threateningly robust and exhaustingly extensive theses of Vern Poythress in his book on Logic. In what way can Time be simultaneously Transcendent and Immanent? Our language cannot accomodate such mysteries - syntax, argument and style are as time-dependent as the scribe and the scroll. The one thing that must be invariably true for Truth to be Truth is Invariance - and this is the one property that Time cannot possibly possess.  Perhaps St Augustine confessed it best here (Book XI), and perhaps his theories are verified by the fact that his Latin musings have been borne to us by the linguistic drift occurring on the tides of history that disturb the very ocean of Time (itself in evaporating equilibrium) that we might otherwise consider a form of Truth that we might anchor to.  Time is Change by definition. Hence (as Heraclitus suggests) it is the only constant. Its invariance is found in its variability. Thus, as a form of Truth it appears as Irony.  In summary, therefore, I suggest that Time is a form of Truth in that it demonstrates the perpetual absolute relativity that so characterises the unidentifiable and inseparable aspects of Truth. Just as Logicians have learned (see LOGICOMIX for a fun summary of how!) that the basis of reason cannot be defined by the processes it gives rise to (such as Boolean algebra) so we may consider Time to be the most inherent property of all processes, such that it cannot be analysed directly. Time is unfalsifiable, so it is only a form of Truth in the same way that Zero is a form of Number. It is the Most Absolute Thing which (by its most tantalising yet unsatisfactory nature) causes us to seek Truth in the sorts of things to which Irony does not apply. Just as the Set of All Sets that Contain Themselves might appear to have a certain property yet changes its nature on interrogation, so Time is a form of Truth because it isn't.  To conclude, I am aware of a famous statement that both liquidates and solidifies the conundrum of the continuous and the discrete regarding which Augustine confesses his confusion. It is a most ancient sentence, spoken paradoxically in the present tense. It is also a name. It is thus individually absolute and infinitely relatively referential. I think it is the best answer to Ife\u2019s question:  ",
