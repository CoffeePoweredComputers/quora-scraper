            "answer_text": "I assume the question is asked within the Biblical context since you used literal quotation for the phrase. For those who questions the validity of this question, please jump down to the second part of my answer. You are a famous sculptor. You make sculptures of birds, buildings, characters, abstract shapes, etc. One day, you look into the mirror and decide to create a sculpture of yourself. What would you do? You would do your best, and put the most accurate details into this piece so that when others see this \u201cimage of yours\u201d, they may know about you as much and as accurately as possible This is \u201cman created in God's image\u201d. There is a hierarchy in God's design. God intended for everything to perceive Himself through human (His image) and (Christians believe) every human to perceive Him through His Son. It is impossible to exhaustively enumerate the God-like features we have, but to list a few: We are in charge of the universe by God's design, so that other beings are subject to our management; just like He is the Creator and Ruler of all.We demonstrate love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; just like His personality, revealed in both the Old and the New Testaments.We show wisdom in our daily actions and in the interaction with other humans and nature around us; just like how God wisely arranges history and keeps the amazing balance of nature no matter what happens.Being God\u2019s image also grants us privileged status. Spitting on a self-portrait is humiliating the artist himself, so likewise whatever/whoever harms or offends a human is considered a direct offense to God Himself. This includes human-to-human offenses like murder, rape or even verbal curses. People that are generally abandoned by the society still fully enjoy being God's image and thus the divine dignity.You see, when the Bible concludes that all human beings fell short of God's glory(-ious image), we apparently did. We obviously failed every point listed above. Who on earth would be able to tell what God looks like from seeing a human - selfish, greedy, foolish, indulgent, and yet powerless in many ways ? Second Part: \u201cGod is created in man's image.\u201d The claim \u201cGod is created in man's image\u201d is a plausible statement. It is true for some gods like the Greek Mythology, where gods marry, bear children, envy, kill or even get killed. That looks like humans a lot. But the Biblical God? No, simply because He just looks so un-human. The Biblical God holds a ridiculous standard for justice and holiness, which we don't have the slightest close idea. He hates idol worshipping so much, precisely because He resents the idea \u201cGod is created in an image by human\u201d. Many times we humans are amazed that the biblical God is unreasonably cruel (kill infants in wars, throw unbelievers to hell) and unreasonably loving (care for the weak and the abandoned by the society, die for sinners, comfort the heartbroken) than humans at the same time. Many times in the Bible God apparently became frustrated trying to explain to us what He's like and how things work in eternity. How can an author create a character which he cannot comprehend himself? Paradoxically it is necessary for us to believe in a god we cannot comprehend. Because if you can, that god is anyway within the reach of your intelligence and thus cannot be greater than you. Why bother believing in something that's inferior? ",

            "answer_text": "In no sense that we can correctly perceive without divine intervention. To me, the deepest question in the world is \u201cwhat defines physiology and what defines pathology?\u201d. A potent way to summarise this line of questioning is \u201cis inflammation good or bad\u201d?  I like to call it \u201cthe healing fire\u201d. In my warped view, this cascade of interwoven and recursive, self-regulating events forms the crux of life - the competitive tension from which order emerges and the chaotic destruction that heralds death.  Our bodies and the minds that are so inseparable from them are completely dependent upon this paradox of physicality - death begets life which begets death which begets life. It is a cycle of productive frustration. Romans 8:20-21 NIV [20] For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope [21] that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God. \u2026 The reproductive cycle alone exemplifies it. The former forms of parental cells are completely destroyed as they complete the consummation that will become their creative conception.  John 12:24-25 NIV [24] Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. [25] Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. \u2026 God describes Himself in many ways. He is self-defining, self-referential, Triune, living. However, the Name which rightly represents Him is not knowable to us, except by analogy - by an image itself. Philippians 2:5-8 NIV [5] In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: [6] Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; [7] rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. [8] And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death\u2014 even death on a cross \u2026 What image does the one who is the essence of God - the Logos given form - present as His symbol in the world? Nothingness. He made himself nothing. Being found in the form of Man He submits to death. In doing so he proves his innocence. His eschewing of individuality apart from corporate identity, His choice of sacrifice rather than profit, His acceptance of finiteness in place of His rightful infinitude marks His magnificence and mollifys malignancy. His destruction by the rubor, tumor, calor and dolor of the Inflammation of Creation brings restoration and renewal. His death brings Life to the full. Here mysticism and methodism meet. Spirit and Science are sewn together like the trinitarian braid of connective collagen.  How are we made in the image of God? Every part of our beings display the drama that is the Passion of the Christ, and our reason is given grace to perceive some of it. However, this same gospel of hope and peace reminds us that Everything is Meaningless. The Word of God is within us and we are constructed from Fractal fragments of that word. Yet, like the language we use to represent ourselves we have become separate from the speaker by our own attempts at definition. When we are the judges of health, wherefore is disease?  When we are the judges of Christ, the World of Words that Mean Themselves becomes a hall of mirrors and the water of life becomes the vaporous mirage of frustration and demise. In such a world Zero becomes Something and the empty set becomes a pandora\u2019s box of lies. However, when we imitate Christ and are united in Him, then the Symbol and the Signal it Signifies are One such that Pilate\u2019s question is answered and Truth becomes absolute.  A Word whose meaning is taken to be something apart from its form is the definition of Irony. If man exists in the true image of God now then all pain is evil and the whole Bible is the most ironic lie. However, if the image of God is now so marred by some intrinsic injury or infection that the healing fire is required for life to progress then the person of Jesus represents the simple and summary form of that entire narrative. Mere words like ourselves must be included in the Work as a whole to make any sense at all. 2 Corinthians 4:7-8 NIV [7] But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. [8] We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed but not in despair; [9] persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. [10] We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body \u2026  We are the self-portrait that has foolishly claimed the right to define Right. The artist who is the Life that produced the image has condescended to imitating us. We must do the same in order for the calibration of creation to make sense.
