            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 this depends on what you mean by \u201ctruly random\u201d. If you mean \u201cnot determined only by factors from the past\u201d, then we already are pretty certain that every single subatomic transaction is \u201ctruly random\u201d, and the apparent causality we see is due to the extremely low probabilities of anything happening that *appears* non-causal. Bell\u2019s Theorem basically proves that no *local* hidden variables can result in the results we see from quantum mechanics\u2026 so it\u2019s not just that we haven\u2019t found them yet\u2026 they can\u2019t exist. However, a \u201cnon-local\u201d hidden variable would be an effect from the future, not from the past\u2026 so by the definition I gave above wouldn\u2019t be satisfied. If you\u2019re ok with causality coming from the future, then pure \u201cdeterminism\u201d by that definition might be possible. We don\u2019t know. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not. (at least in the sense of not having a pattern) Quantum vacuum fluctuations / virtual particles / quantum foam seem to come closest. And I suspect they are the result of forces acting upon them. The thing is that those forces may be outside our universe. So we may not find out. We also cannot currently explain atomic decay - we can know the half-life of an isotope but we can not predict when any particular atom will decay. This may turn out to be explained by virtual particles. We may one day work all this out, but I doubt that it is happening without a process that could be explained and understood given sufficient information. Those fluctuations explain a lot of things that we currently can\u2019t exactly predict, they create noise in our systems and therefore slight differences in outcomes. Also we consider throwing dice to be random but that really is just our way of saying we don\u2019t have the degree of depth of data handling and perception to predict the outcome. Too many variables for us to deal with. Which doesn\u2019t mean that given the sensing technology and sufficient processing power we couldn\u2019t predict the outcome, making it non-random. There is a statistics definition of random though in which I am wrong - and that the tossing of a coin is random. I assume you meant the idea that events are not based on explainable and possibly predictable processes though? ",
