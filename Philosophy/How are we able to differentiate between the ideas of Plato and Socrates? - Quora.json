            "answer_text": "Well, Plato was not the only ancient source who discussed Socrates. Xenophon also did, as well as a number of Socrates other students in addition to that one Aristophanes play. However, you can dismiss most of the other students as their works are all mostly confined to fragments and are therefore poor in giving us a holistic picture. They only provide certain points of view on specific topics. As for the play it is clearly a caricature and satire and not intended to express accurate opinions. That being said as biased as Xenophon was you can use whatever common points his dialogues and Plato's share to have a glimpse at what Socrates may have thought. That being they only very occasionally agree. Besides comparing Xenophon your best other method is to look at where Plato contradicts himself. Where Socrates as a character seems more interested in questioning and or breaking down others ideas is probably closer to Socrates actual thought. Meanwhile the more complex texts in which Socrates as a character expounds complex eulogies on dense philosophical points that clearly appear out of character. There are instances where I think Phaedo and Republic have Socrates conflicting with himself. Finally, there are intances in somea dialogues, such as Laws or Timeas,where Plato has another figure leading the dialogue, besides Socrates, who expresses opinions. One can safley assume these are basically platonic, obviously Socrates was still an influence but that he isn't trying to express Socrates view. Any instances in these of expressing contradictory opinions to works that feature Socrates is most likely another glimpse at the historical troublemaker. All said and done, it is impossible to truly seperate all their views as he was clearly a massive influence and as we have no works showing him purely we can't truly know. However, these are some of the ways we can tell. ",

            "answer_text": "Easy. Socrates was a critic. His aim was good sport at the expense of the city\u2019s hypocrites, with reference to a moral crusade which may or may not have been sincere. Plato had an academy to run. All his (great) artistry is about promoting that academy, with his sainted Socrates as a guiding inspiration. A good contemporary equivalent is Rich Dad Poor Dad, and best selling author Robert Kiyosaki. The tacky cover, the simplistic prose are all about being understood, not being clever. Plato also wanted to distance himself from the business of being clever, arguably with some success. ",
