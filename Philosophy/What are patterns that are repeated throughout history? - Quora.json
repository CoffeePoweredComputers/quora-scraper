            "answer_text": "Settlement patterns are fluid. People continue to move around and around, and have been doing so since the begininng of time. Empires fall (usually due to the rise of a new empire), but the people remain. Assyria-> Neo-Babylonian Empire->Media-> Persia-> Macedonia->Roman->etc Don\u2019t invade Russia/the Soviet Union (unless you are the Mongols, they seem to be the exception) Also you can\u2019t invade Britain unless you can defeat their navy first. Napoleon and Hitler, I\u2019m looking at you. Trade spurs coloninzation, and colonization spurs trade (or at least it used too) Think trading posts like New York, Detroit, Carthage, Marseille, Toronto, Cape Town, Lisbon etc and their importance to world trade today. Money/profit is the answer to why ___did_____ at least 51% of the time. The other 30% of the time it is God/gods. The last little bit is glory. Leaders who teach nonviolence (Gandhi and MLK) tend to die violently. When presented with superior technology (Rome with Carthaginian boats, Japan with American industrial revltion tech for example) adapt and adopt, or be conquered. Colonies (eventually) will not want to be colonies: give them full membership in the nation state or they will break away. Tightly controlled economies (Mercantilism, Absolute Monarchies, Communism, etc) cannot outperform free(r) market economies for the long haul. Societies often tend to overuse some of their most valuable commodities. Example-Rome and Silphium, Phoenicians exploiting the Murex to local extinction, Europeans needing fur from Siberia or America to supply their needs, etc. Your children will think your hair and music was stupid. They often come around on the music though. You will think their music is just noise. Thats all I got for now! ",

            "answer_text": "What are patterns that are repeated throughout history? High Level View Humans coalesce into groups. They find common goals, set rules, and establish a way of life that centers around those goals and rules. This is what I call the herd mentality. It\u2019s safer to be part of a group rather than go at life alone. At least that\u2019s how most people think. Religious belief evolves and adapts. Since the beginning of civilization religion has played a major role in how humans conduct their lives. Some members resist certain aspects of the religion and create their own branch. They pull in others, thus creating another group (goes back to point number one). One religious idea spawns others. From those other ideas new religions are born. The more knowledge we attain (ex. science) the more sophisticated the beliefs become. The beliefs have to keep up with the facts, even though they often distort the facts. Differences in political ideology and religious belief often set the foundation for conflict. It seems inherent in the human psyche to want expansion. That expansion sometimes requires violence (i.e., war). War is fueled by those political ideologies and religious beliefs, as well as the desire for resources. ",
