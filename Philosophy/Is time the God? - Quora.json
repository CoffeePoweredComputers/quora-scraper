            "answer_text": "A2A. As seen below, Genesis Chapter one describes the beginning of time.  Genesis Chapter One contains 31 verses, of which the name of \"God\" is written in only 25 verses. The remaining 6 verses are 1:13, 1:15, 1:18, 1:19, 1:23 and 1:30 Of those six verses; three are \"days\". Two are \"Light\". And one is \"Food\". Verses 1:13, 1:19 and 1:23 which reference \"days\"...in the original Hebrew text found in the DSS (Dead Sea Scrolls) it reads: 1:13 \"Three\" 1:19 \"Have Double\" 1:23 \"Meaning\" All the \"days\" found in Chapter one, in the original Hebrew DSS text: Each verse ends identically except for the first one. The Text below, is the Original Hebrew Text of the DSS and Genesis Chapter One [All text in brackets]are not present in the original text, they are assumptions of what the missing text might be.  The use of the Cardinal number One, found in the first \"Day\" Indicates this is notreferencing a calendar day (if it were a calendar day, there would be an Ordinal number One present, and it\u2019s a Cardinal one, not and ordinal one.) A Cardinal number one, followed by five Ordinals, indicates positions in time, not days. Apply the 25 verses, which contain the word \"God\", it shows clearly, Genesis Chapter One, is a 24 hour clock. In order to complete a full rotation, it requires 25 verses, as seen in the images below:  As seen below, Genesis 1:1 to 1:31 is a 24 hour clock, and depicts the beginning of time. Reminder: to complete a full rotation of a 24 clock that begins with hour zero, you need 25 verses. Using the cipher 666.6 found in revelation 13:18 to decode Genesis\u2026 it reveals this equation:  God created 3, then said 2, also said 1, then also said 1, said 2 and made 3... Which uncovers the equation; 1 = and =1 In science, the equation above, will become known as the Grand Unification equation, which mathematically unifies all the forces and everything in existence into one neat little equation, from micro to macro scales. - What is the specified origin, of which the absolute, universal, mathematical laws of universe come from? There is an Equal Opposite to all things. In science it is recognized as Baryogenesis. Please see the link for a video that explains it scientifically Baryogenesis Equal opposites  Genesis One, was written to show all the equal opposites and how everything works together. It also shows where it is 6 degrees of separation.  Where they intersect, shows what occurs, and how they work together: Darkness divided from Light, works with Day and Night Sky, Evening and Morning, works with Seas and Earth to put forth... Plants with seed and Trees bearing fruit, work to be fruitful and to multiply\u2026  Everything was created to exist, In The Middle of Time\u2026    I mentioned the Equation is the Grand unification theory, which it is. I am in the process of gathering the information needed to explain further however I am not a scientist which has caused some barriers. But I will post what I have figured out so far. First the math, calculates all the fundamental particles known to science, except for one, that hasn't been discovered yet. Although they are on the verge of this discovery. I know from the math, that it is a light particle which has mass. For those scientists out there, yes I am aware light doesn't have mass. But this particular light particle does have mass. The discovery of a new fundamental particle In the universe, there are a total of 62 fundamental particles. The following image, is the math from Genesis one, in the same order. Harmonic Oscillation Equation  Notice regardless of where you begin; top left going clockwise, top right, going clockwise, bottom left or bottom right clockwise, the equation equals one, begins with one, and ends with =1 without ever ending. It also identifies the fundamental particles:   The Genesis Equation also indicates the way everything works such as Energy:  Gravity & Light:  The Equation also matches exactly, the 25 Verses which contain \u201cGod\u201d in order, regardless of where you begin be it, left to right, right to left, or top to bottom, bottom to top\u2026: The scriptures/verses in Genesis one, are in working order , and equal opposites.  The above information is found in Genesis the Christian Bible. However all religions have a scientific application as well: All religions contribute to the understanding of humanity, evolution and creation. The following is just a few\u2026 The Qu\u2019ran: is the table of elements. And within it, are all the possible elements they will create, from a micro, to macro level. The Sistine Chapel Ceiling, depicts the human, heart, brain and lungs to scale. It also depicts the 24 hour clock found in Genesis one. The Tao De Ching, verse 25, explains the equation found in Genesis. Hinduism explains human functions, action and reaction with the results. Buddhism explains the way of the mind, and human thinking and brain functions\u2026 Again, ALL religions contain part of the scientific understanding of life. ALL religions equally contribute. Back to the contents of the DSS and bible: Genesis 9 Describes Thermodynamics and Entropy and the process of \u201cnatural\u201dselection. Genesis 6 Describes Baryogenesis and how particles annihilate in the beginning of time Genesis 7:4 Describes the Dark Ages Genesis 5 Describes the creation of Human life. Genesis 10:5 Cities Genesis 11:3 Continents\u2026 Genesis 6 :15 The biblical story of Noah\u2019s ark is a metaphor describing our galaxy, solar system, the sun and earth locations and sizes in the Universe. The ark\u2019s size, is describing the size of our Milky Way Galaxy \u201dbe three hundred cubits long\u201d and the size of our solar system \u2026\u201d50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high.\u201d Our Solar System extends to the furthest dwarf planet, Eris, orbits within just a fraction of the larger Solar System. The Kuiper Belt, where we find a Pluto, Eris, Make and Haumea,extends from 30 astronomical units all the way out to 50 astronomical unitsThe ark door is the location of the Sun, the ark window, is the location of Earth. In the story of Noah\u2019s Ark, it explains how everything that exists, is on Earth.  The DATES of EVOLUTION: Dark Ages, Lasted 40 days Light shined after 40 days The Earth was water until it dried. 150 days. The Earth, Universe, the cosmos were forming for 600 days. The Earth began vegetation life On: Sunday, July 27th, Year 600 to October 1st year 600 Animal and Human life: January 1st, 601 to February 27th, 601  The Laws of Nature: All of science is based on what author James Trefil calls the principle of universality: \"It says that the laws of nature we discover here and now in our laboratories are true everywhere in the universe and have been in force for all time.\" As scientists record what they observe, most often they are not just using words and paragraphs. The laws of nature can be documented with numbers. They can be measured and computed in the language of mathematics. Physicist Eugene Wigner confesses that the mathematical underpinning of nature \"is something bordering on the mysterious and there is no rational explanation for it.\" Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner for quantum electrodynamics, said, \"Why nature is mathematical is a mystery...The fact that there are rules at all is a kind of miracle.\" Physicist Paul C. Davies comments, \"...to be a scientist, you had to have faith that the universe is governed by dependable, immutable, absolute, universal, mathematical laws of an unspecified origin. \" - Why is nature mathematical? - What is the specified origin, of which the absolute, universal, mathematical laws of universe come from? The answers are found in Genesis Chapter One. Before you assume this is some religious, spiritual thing...Let me stop you. It is not religious, nor is it spiritual. The answer is mathematical and absolute. See for yourself and judge it after you have finished reading this. Do the math, it adds up perfectly, just as it should. Genesis was translated as a story in words. However the most valuable part of Genesis, has never been known until now. Why?...because Genesis one has a cipher, to decode the text that is written. The cipher key to decode Genesis is 666.6 (revelation 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred three score and six.) Now, there are two things that are crucially important and have been overlooked by all the translators of the DSS (Dead Sea Scrolls) the first, is the cipher needed to decode Genesis. The second, is an oversight which changes everything...most of the world believes, the days written in Genesis chapter one, are literal. However, the number one, to identify the \"first day\" is a Cardinal number One. This Cardinal number One, is followed by all the other \"days\" written using Ordinal Numbers. Which mathematically, and grammatically makes it impossible for those to be \"days\". Ordinals numbers are always used to identify calendar days and must begin with an Ordinal number one, of which is does not. Genesis Chapter One, \u201cdays\u201d are not days at all. They are grammatically, positions confirming Genesis one, is a 24 hour clock and the creation of ALL time. It describes evolution, equal opposites, time itself and how things will function.  Religion & Science, speak different languages. But they are both saying the same thing.Atheism and religions, provide and contribute to our general understanding of humanity EQUALLY. ",

            "answer_text": "The meaning of \u201cTime\u201d is very much absurd to relate with God.For example,say we consider Time as 24 hours a day 7 days a week or 365 days a year(basically just a measuring instrument)or say \u201ccyclical movements\u201d of objects\u2026. The very true definition of Time still does not exists neither it can be because we have made it according to our needs and adjustments and its just a measuring way\u2026. If we talk about NASA new parallel world theory where time moves in reverse(it does not mean time there is in reverse,its just not adaptable or according to what we consider Time in our world) So,if there are multiverse or more than our universe that means \u201cTime woud be different for everyone\u201d and if God is supreme or ultimate creator how can be it different for every world\u2026 But it doesnt mean Time can\u2019t be a god,if it is then that means we are made believed many wrong notions about time or say what we actually say time is its much more complex or opens up a whole new world of theories\u2026. Thus what \u201cTime\u201d really means needs to be understood first then only we can jump or compare it to the \u201cGod\u201d ",
