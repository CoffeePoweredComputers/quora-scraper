            "answer_text": "Anybody reading this question would say that you are a victim of his ideas about progressive education because you can\u2019t even spell his name right. It\u2019s Dewey; not Dewy. Unfortunately, Dewey often gets blamed for everything that has gone wrong with American education whether he was guilty or not. Dewey grew up in Vermont under rather austere circumstances. Education at the time consisted mostly of going over the same material over and over. He felt that the kind of rote learning he was exposed to stifled creativity and the ability of children to learn to think for themselves. He felt the schools, if not joyous and delightful to children, should at least be palatable to them. He did not advocate watering the curriculum and standards, he just believed that children should take a more active role in learning as opposed to being passive recipients of what was drilled into them. What went wrong with the educational system had nothing to do with Dewey. If you go back to the 19th and early 20th centuries, just completing the 8th grade was an accomplishment. The student completing the 8th grade in 1910 probably knew more English, History and Mathematics than the average high school graduate of today. Somewhere along the line, someone got the notion that everyone should have a high school diploma. At the time, high schools had entrance exams that would have today\u2019s college graduates climbing the walls. So they opened up the schools to anyone who made it through the 8th grade. Consequently, the standards had to be lowered to offset the high rate of students who could not master the work. They started calling them \u201cdrop outs\u201d. At some point it was recognized that not everyone could master academic subjects, and this gave birth to the vocational school. So now we have a school system where being able to read or write or do simple arithmetic are no longer impediments to obtaining a high school diploma. And inclusiveness has made it\u2019s way up to the college level. It is now considered unfair and undemocratic to deny someone with an IQ of 80 the advantages of having a college degree. So now we have scads of Forest Gumps out there with their worthless degrees being hired for jobs way beyond their mental capacity in the name of \u201cdiversity\u201d. After all, isn\u2019t it rank discrimination to keep someone from being a heart surgeon just because he can\u2019t spell the word heart? ",
