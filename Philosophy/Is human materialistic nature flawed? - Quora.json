            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It\u2019s part of our evolution, so it\u2019s been very useful. Our economic structure is based on the competition of ideas, which has dramatically increased the progress of our species. Here\u2019s where it\u2019s flawed: Our genes give us better odds of survival and procreation. Competition is key to both. We live in a materialistic world, because showing dominance (that\u2019s the flaw) and accumulating nice things (wealth) raises our status. Individuals with high status are able to attract high status mates, which improves the odds of survival, of their offspring. Just for attempting to raise our status, the brain rewards us, with either serotonin or dopamine. Unless we learn better (this is the fix for the flaw), every emotional impulse is rewarded. This includes being mean, bullying, showing off, getting angry, shouting, and striking out at others. Because they all demonstrate dominant behavior. We give power to a bunch of idiots to make us miserable, with their hurtful words and hurtful actions. The idiots don\u2019t even know why they\u2019re acting that way. Subconsciously, they are trying to raise they\u2019re status, by lowering yours. This is the primitive, 1.0 human operating system. If you learn to control your emotional impulses (learn to control your emotions), then you will have upgraded to 2.0. You will have many more options, in which to respond to the world. You will become unpredictable, and a much more interesting person. In the future, when this knowledge is widely known, the leaders of all sectors of society will be 2.0 humans. ",

            "answer_text": "I Googled materialistic and found a great article from my favorite magazine \u201cNew Scientist\u201d. There are various articles in the 2014 issue all related to us as materialisic humans. This is the intro: Humans are materialistic by nature, but we have an odd relationship with the things we own. Possessions enrich our lives but they also come at a cost, both environmental and psychological. In these articles, we take stock of our ambivalent relationship with material goods, size up the things that a modern human actually needs, consider the ways possessions define us and ponder the future of ownership. First, we look back at the evolution of our instinct for stuff. Article 1: How did we evolve from indigent apes with no possessions into hoarding humans with more stuff than we can track? Our urge to accumulate has deep roots Stuff: Humans as hunters and mega-gatherers Article 2: We invest emotion and memories in our possessions, giving them deep meaning, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make us happy \u2013 it may drive us slightly mad Stuff: The psychological power of possessions There are more articles on the subject in the issue. You can read them to study further the question you have posed. I think the flawed or unflawed take on the idea is much too simplistic. Humans are awesome. We are what we are. ",
