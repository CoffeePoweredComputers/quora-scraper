            "answer_text": "I knew a child once who seemingly could literally ask you a million questions without batting an eyelash. Why is the sky blue? Why is the grass green? How do birds fly ? Where does the ocean come from? Why can't I have pizza everyday? WHY? WHY? WHY? This was many years back and I was more upset at myself than I was at the 4 year olds questions because I didn't have most of the answers to his questions. Damn kid had me stumped. Not only that but I was 14 years older and didn't even think to ask such basic yet profound questions. The kid epitomized that inquisitive philosophical sense of wonder and I felt stupid because I never asked the Why questions of life in those days. I merely wanted to party with my friends and actually thought I had eternal youth for some odd reason. Aristotle claimed that all men desire to know. I wholeheartedly agree and the kid proves the point even at 4 years old. The kid seemed to be blown away with existence itself and everything was filled with wonder for him. My guess is that the kids imagination was destroyed as most parents seem to do by forcing the child to conform to the \u201creal\u201d world of things and told to stop asking stupid questions. The child literally gets his imagination strangled out of him giving up the ghost or inner Muse of inspiration simply because it doesn't fit with practical and pragmatic worldview of the parents. The parents themselves having dead imaginations and given up the ghost of inspiration themselves see no practical purpose for imagination nor the \u201csilly\u201d questions of a seemingly foolish child. When we lose our sense of childlike wonder we too have given up the ghost or inner Muse of inspiration and conform to the world of zombies having been bitten by the vampire of conformity ourselves. So goes the way of the world for many. ",

I\u2019m just a tad suspicious of words like \u2018wonder\u2019 which are somewhat variously defined. So perhaps the \u2018beginning of philosophy\u2019 is asking the questions not so much as define \u2018what is\u2019 as stimulating the discussion that is theoretically never ending. Intermitteantly what of course philosophy can do is suggest the questions that are relevant to ask and of course suggesting the broad possibilities in the form of hypotheses which can then be tightened up to suggest testable questions often answered by other disciplines like science generally.

            "answer_text": "I dunno. If by wonder you mean something like \u201cI wonder\u2026\u201d then that applies to lots of them, but if you mean being awestruck by something, I\u2019d say not so much. The main thing that tends to go with being a philosopher is being argumentative. Philosophy attracts people who like to argue about things. The things they argue about may fall under the heading of \u201cbig questions\u201d (at least at first; philosophers get specialized as they go along) but skepticism is as likely a place for philosophy to start as wonder.
