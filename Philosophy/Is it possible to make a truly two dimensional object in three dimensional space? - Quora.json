            "answer_text": "A2A: The number of dimensions of an object is the number of parameters needed to specify it. Three dimensions are the minimum to specify a rectangular block. A more complicated shape requires more than 3. It's color could be another dimension. Its weight could be another. Its position could require 3 more. A simpler shape can be specified in fewer than three dimensions, but only if the dimensions are not Cartesian. For example, a ball can be defined by just its radius. If you mean to restrict the question to Cartesian coordinates, then a 2-dimensional object would probably not be called an object. It would have to have zero thickness in one dimension, which would argue against its existence. For example, it couldn't be made of atoms. Also, if the three dimensions are two of distance and one of time then yes, even with Cartesian coordinates, a 2 dimensional object could exist in that space. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean. Mathematically? Sure. First, consider the question: do you think you can make a truly three-dimensional object? If so, then its boundary (ignoring tautological mathematical examples) is a truly two-dimensional object. For instance, if you assume the earth has a definite surface, then \u201cthe surface of the earth\u201d is a truly two-dimensional object. Physically? Long story short, not really. Long story longer, it\u2019s a very messy question, because atoms and quantum mechanics and\u2026 ",
