            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t be more sure about something than this. In my entire life i have felt just this thing back and forth. And here it goes:- \u201cEthics and values matter for people until you give them a mask.\u201d People are ethical and hold values because they know that if they don\u2019t then society will find out and their sacred place in the society will be gone straight out the window. They try to act socially so as to be appreciated by the masses. We are still the hunting species. We are constantly searching for something better something more beneficial and in order to get it we have to be competitive. Earlier it didn\u2019t matter what we eat or how we eat. All that mattered was who can survive. And yet somewhere deep down we still have that need for our ego. We don\u2019t give a fuck about compassion and equality. We wanna rule the world and we shall do every fucking thing in order to get that. People are driven by different motives. Lust, love, greed, anger and so many shitty things. We do whatever is needed to satisfy our false ego no matter how bad it is. That\u2019s what life is my friend. ",

            "answer_text": "Ethics,values and civilization are all terms that we use as given without realizing the deep underlying connotations attached to it.We forget to delve into its roots and it becomes a vantage point leading to an unjust application of terminology even when reference points might have changed.Our notion of morality is highly shaped by the ones wielding power and the tools they deploy to portray it as legitimate. We can call ourselves civilized if we experience freedom in following our human instincts and also cherish compassion and empathy towards our fellow human beings. ",

Being civilised is a process that one goes through and trying to understand if all of us are ethical and respect our values is difficult. All we can do is make ourselves and help our close ones achieve this and hence, try to make the world a better place. ",
