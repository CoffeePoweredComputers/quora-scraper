            "answer_text": "A decision problem for which it is impossible to construct an algorithm is undecidable problem. Halting problem is undecidable, the problem statement says that, if your given a program description and an input can you determine whether the program will ever halt or continue running forever. Alan Turing proved that a general algorithm for halting problem cannot exist. ",
