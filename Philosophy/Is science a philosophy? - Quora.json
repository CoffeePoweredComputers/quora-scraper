            "answer_text": "For purposes of this answer I define Philosophy as: various fields of (often esoteric) study and inquiry.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy I will not be defining philosophy as:  one's paradigm or world-view.  Many often conflate the two, but they severely-separate-and-should-be-semantically-severed, lest Equivocation Fallacies start cropping up. To the early Greeks (Pre-Plato /Socrates) Philosophy was science, and philosophers were scientists.  Back in the day, philosophy was a Big Umbrella. I think Themistacles [fact check pending] was the 1st recorded Philosopher who was called upon to build some bridges--an architect.  A early world Philosopher was a Renaissance Man of his day: globally comprehending the processes that lead to the creation to everything he touched or that existed in his environment: from the creation of the fabric in his clothes, to the mining, molding, and tempering of the metal in his jewelry, to the masonry that constructed the walls of a city.   Nathan Ketsdever's answer is partly correct that early capital-s Science as we understand it bloomed it's first cultural budding in the wake of the Enlightenment.  Though it must technically be said, in the Medieval age, a few church illuminaries like Bacon were technically the forefathers of scientific method, but that's largely because back in the day there were only two groups that were educated: basically aristocrats and the clergy.  This pattern recurred in the early Americas: Harvard, Princeton, and Yale all started as religious schools, because at the time of their founding, only the churches had the fiscal wherewithal to bankroll such institutions. The Eurpoean Enlightenment was in part a class revolution, overturning the privilege of the Aristocracy & clergy, tossing classic dogmas on their ear, with degrees of Faith in Logic, Reason, and Science, replacing the receding temporal powers of the once-Imperial Church, (a process who's seed was planted during the Protestant Reformation), the Enlightenment gained cultural influence even as it increasingly explaining away swaths of the God of the Gaps into ever-receding pockets of the unknown. Yes but: Is science a philosophy? As indicated in the past: probably yes, if only because Philosophy was nearly everything learned.  Today, I would have to say no.  Science has developed into a proper capital-s Science.  Philosophy has evolved into it's own art & Capital-s science of the study of abstractions. (Reference the link at the top of this article for a complete study). Subset of philosophy include The Philosophy of Science, and Theology (philosophy with a political twist). However it can be said that philosophy, to varying degrees, informs science, (and again, do not here confuse \"philosophy\" for worldview). Sometimes people will call \"Naturalism\" a world-view-style philosophy.  As you go through these answers, it may become important that a distinction be made between  Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical NaturalismMethodological Naturalism is pure method of science, and invokes the functioning principles with which scientific method work.  Almost no one disputes the efficacy or legitimacy of that. Contrarywise, Philosophical Naturalism, is a philosophic disposition (close to, but not quite comparable to a \"world-view\") that only the natural exists, and that unmeasured/unobservable \"supernatural\" is either  just a mythic construct, or too remote, abstract, or currently misunderstood to be meaningful.",

            "answer_text": "Q. Is Science a philosophy? (1) No (2) Science is what we know. Philosophy is what we don\u2019t know. (3) Philosophy involves speculations of things of which we can\u2019t have definite proof. Once we gain certainty about a subject, it moves from the realm of philosophy to science. (4) Philosophy is important because there\u2019re many things we don\u2019t know much about, or perhaps cannot know much about. Philosophy is thus \u2018incomplete science\u2019. The word \u2018science\u2019 comes from Latin, \u2018to know\u2019. (5) Human beings wondered why the sun rose. The philosophy was that the Sun God rode his chariot across the sky every day. Over time, scientific inquiry - theorizing, experiment, observation - rejected, corrected, amended many of such theories. (6) This ties in to religion too. Human beings have these instinctive needs. The metaphysicalSpiritual, including TranscendenceMorality\u201cScience\u201d, to explain nature\u201cTechnology\u201d, to control natureThese instincts may be fed by religious, or secular spring sources. For example, transcendence may be inspired by religion, or by non-religious sources such as art, music, literature, panoramic natural scenery, sunrise, sunset. We\u2019re moved in ways that reason cannot comprehend. Morality may draw from religious moral codes, or from humanistic, cultural or philosophical wellsprings. And so it is too for \u201cScience\u201d and \u201cTechnology\u201d. Scenario: Prolonged drought\u201cScience\u201d: Ye gods are angry\u201cTechnology\u201d: Sacrifice livestock to appease the gods",
