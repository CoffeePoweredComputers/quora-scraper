            "answer_text": "Is philosophy a sort of moral teaching? No. When two or more people live in the same area they have to adopt some rules about who does what to whom. Any such rule is called a mor\u00e9, French accented e pronounced \"mor-ay\". The adjective form is moral, and the habit of following mor\u00e9s is morality. Mor\u00e9s are arbitrary: they do not have to be right, only accepted. Another group on the other side of the river might have very different mor\u00e9s. Philosophy is \u201clove of wisdom\u201d, a preoccupation with stuff you have made up in your own head. The only rule is \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass your fellow philosopher.\u201d Philosophers make up high-sounding words by adding \u201c-ism\u201d to some concept or somebody\u2019s name. They recite these words in random order so it sounds like they know a heaven of a lot when in fact they are not saying anything at all. And they get very ugly when you point that out. Also, they tend to be lousy teachers. But to give them their due, they are not as bad as math teachers. ",
