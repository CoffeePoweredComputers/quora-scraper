            "answer_text": "i love the question. The sky is not blue and the sun is not yellow they just appear that way due to scattering of light The sky is blue because of the particle size of the atmospheric particles in the sky. This causes blue/ violet light to be scattered more strongly than other colours, giving the impression that the sky is blue( in fact it is transparent and appears violet we just seen it as blue ). It is also common misconception that the Sun is yellow, or orange or even red. However, the Sun is essentially all colors mixed together, which appear to our eyes as White. This can be seen from the space station. This is because our eyes cannot process all the information. The sun actually visible output peaks in green weird hey  Now when we see the sun at sunrise or sunset,it may appear yellow, orange, or red. But that is only because its short-wavelength colors (green, blue, violet) are scattered out by the Earth's atmosphere. This is why the sky is blue to our eyes. Hence only the reds, yellows, and oranges get through the thick atmosphere to our eyes. The more atmosphere in the way the more towards the red part of the spectrum the light becomes.  On other planets this is very different on Mars the sunset appears blue. Mars atmosphere It is made of carbon dioxide and has a lot of dust. This fine dust tends to scatter red light so that the sky appears reddish, which lets the blue light through. On Earth, it is the other way around. Blue light bounces off air molecules giving our sky its characteristic hue. On Earth, we have a wider palette of reds, which is actually amplified by ash from volcanoes and dust from fires. On Mars, we get a cool blue hue.  Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "No. However, this depends on how one defines \u201creally\u201d? There is no doubt when we look at a clear sky during the day it will be blue. This is because the blue part of the spectrum is the wavelength most scattered by the atmosphere. Nonetheless, all colours are a product of our optical nervous system and don\u2019t actually exist outside our minds. When we look up into the sky, all that actually exists is energy vibrating at a wavelength of about 500 nanometers. There is nothing about this wavelength to signify a particular colour. We just happen to have evolved to see this wavelength as blue. As we have gone our entire lives believing the sky is actually blue, this information is at first very difficult to digest. However essentially nothing has changed, other than a new perspective on something that requires deeper reflection. In reality a blue sky is an illusion created by our sensory awareness. Nonetheless, it is an illusion that aligns with the common human experience and therefore remains very useful. This is distinct from an hallucination, which doesn\u2019t align with common experience and is often harmful. By understanding a blue sky is an illusion created by the mind, this is not implying the colour is artificial and therefore not beautiful. On the contrary, this is an understanding of the extraordinary power of our minds to create all the magnificent colours of a sunset. Then to project it out onto the canvas we call nature, to create unsurpassed beauty. ",
