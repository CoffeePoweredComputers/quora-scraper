            "answer_text": "A coherent philosophical position is much like that of a well written book.  It doesn't matter what position one takes as long as ones premises do not conflict with the original parameters or each following premise based on those parameters.    I like using the unfortunate Highlander movie series as an example of movies that break their own premise:  A simple man is born in a small clan that is going to war with another clan.  In battle he is mortally wounded but recovers and is found to be immortal.  Another immortal finds him and trains him to fight in the upcoming \"gathering of immortals\".  Lots of drama, comedy and killing go on, and then the final gathering of immortals happens where they fight to the last one (good against evil) and only one is left.  That one wins the prize of knowing what everyone on earth is thinking all at the same time.  Yay!   Oh yeah, small problem...  The movie makers decided to make a sequel...Oh God!!  Since they had effectively already ended the story but still wanted to make more money, they took the original stories premise based in fantasy and destroyed it in favor of some sort of really bad science fiction semi-comedy with stupid flying surfboard villains who have been directed to kill the original victor.   Now the original immortals are actually from another planet.  Oh and spoiler...  Now the original immortals are now aliens from another planet\u2026  Oh yes and they aren\u2019t dead either...  They never really addressed why or how any of the original immortals who were beheaded are now alive and or why the Korgon (most evil and most terrible villain from original movie) never returns even though he shouldn't be dead now...    Why did I tell you all of this???  Very simply, if someone makes a proposition falling within a certain set of parameters, all other propositions must fall within the original parameters as well as not conflicting with any other propositions.   Now just to be clear, one can have a valid logical proposition that falls within chosen parameters where that proposition does not violate the parameters or itself.....and is still total bull.... because a proposition brought forth from a faulty parameter can pass as being valid if you\u2019re given an unrealistic set of parameters to work with in solving a problem in that environment.   In the real world solutions based upon faulty information don\u2019t work and are usually the source of many problems.  Example of valid argument that is not relevant:   Consider a world where people can fly (parameter). We propose that if we can fly that all environmentally damaging human transportation could be eliminated.  Yay!  Let\u2019s do it right!!??   Not so much, but the original parameters and proposition do not conflict with themselves making them a viable parameter and proposition\u2026even despite the fact that people can\u2019t fly on there own\u2026   So for an argument to have real value we must start from a solid beginning set of parameters and eliminate fantasy parameters that are (at least) currently available to our scientific community.  The rules for parameters and propositions remain the same.    Short answer\u2026\u2026.find the person\u2019s set of parameters that are given as a basis for a proposition.  Analyze the propositions and see if they are cohesive with the parameters, propositions and additional propositions.  If none violate each other or known physical science, it is a pretty good argument. ",

            "answer_text": "There are volumes of books written on logical fallacies. I'm going to simplify those into two predominant issues: 1. False premise. My little boy told me that a dragon is in the back yard so we need to build a moat. Well, he might have a point if there really was a dragon. But since his initial premise was wrong, I decided not to accept the conclusion and we didn't build a moat. I think we got ice cream instead.  2. False connections. This is also known as the Seinfeld \"yada yada yada\" fallacy. A leads to B which leads to our conclusion of C. Well, A may be true. And C could be caused, but the in between stuff is fuzzy.  My little boy told me that out grass is green so that we needed to build a roof over our yard. Why? Apparently, he thought that dragons liked to eat green grass. Our grass is indeed green (true premise). But his supposition that dragons like to eat green grass didn't pan out. You guessed it--more ice cream.  There are many, many books written about fallacies. But these two items really summarize a lot of argumentation problems. Arm yourself with them and you will win many arguments.  For the interested person--One of my favorite books of all time is Plato and a Platypus walk into a bar by Cathcart and Klein. It explains philosophy (with a section on logic) through jokes. It's a short, paperback, easy read. You can learn a ton about logic in about an hour. I have no connection to these dudes. Never met them, so I'm some some endorser. It's just a book I've recommended many times to people with this similar question. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophies come in so many forms which can go beyond thought and logic and extend into even mysticism.  For example, much of classical philosophy was the theological question regarding the existence of god (or God). Classical philosophy in more recent times has turned toward the metaphysical question of what is reality (or what is real?). In general, philosophy is about logic and reason and the validity of the thought process.  It can be helpful to trace any idea, assumption or assertion back to the axioms upon which it is based. Am axiom is a starting point of a thought process which is accepted as a premise for all which follows.  It the axiom is true then the result has a better chance of being true.  If an axiom is false, there is no chance that it will result in truth. An axiom is a thought which is accepted as truth on its own merits.  For example :\"Existence exists.\"  Or \"a=a\"  Or a \"person owns his own body.\"  At least a free person does. Everyone has a philosophy whether or not he is aware of it.  Not all philosophies are valid.  Big topic.  I hope this helps a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "By understanding the principles that underlie clear reasoning.  That is not to say, by understanding what is true, for that is by no means the same thing.  The entire foundation of philosophy is the discipline of thinking clearly.  There is no statement of truth that is, in and of itself, \"philosophy,\" because philosophers have taken countless contradictory positions for the entire history of philosophy; and some non-philosophers have always agreed despite having no clearly articulated reason to do so. I realize that's not a simple, direct answer.  Then again, there is no simple, direct answer to your question.  The true answer is, you must spend years studying how to avoid logical flaws in your thinking, and apply that knowledge to the thinking of others. ",
