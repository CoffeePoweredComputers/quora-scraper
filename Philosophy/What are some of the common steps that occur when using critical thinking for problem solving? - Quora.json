            "answer_text": "The absolute first step in applying critical thinking to any problem is to assume the position that you don\u2019t know what the problem is. \u201c But,\u201d you say, \u201ci know what the problem is.\u201d And therein lies the problem. You think you know what the problem is, set about solving THAT problem, and the solution doesn\u2019t work, because THAT wasn\u2019t the problem. We fail to solve problems, not because we don\u2019t know how, but because we don\u2019t know what the real problem is. The beginning and sine qua non of critical thinking is realizing you don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so little critical thinking going on. ",
