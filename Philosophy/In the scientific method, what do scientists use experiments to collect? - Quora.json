            "answer_text": "Experiments are designed to collect measurements of certain variables under controlled conditions. So the \u201cdata\u201d that is collected in an experiment is influenced by, and reflects upon, three things: The conditions being examined in the experiment.The variables being measured.The design of the experiment, i.e. what instruments are used to set the conditions and take measurements.Instruments is a vague term, which includes actual instrumentation, such as a thermometer, methods for ensuring the validity of experimental conditions, such as double-blinding, and protocols for selecting data points, such as sampling from a population. Because the data collected is so intricately related to the instruments used, it would be more accurate to say that experiments collect data points that reflect the expectations and understanding of the experimenter. As an example, consider the experiment that found humans are born with only two innate fears: loud noises and falling. This was determined by subjecting infants to a range of potentially fearful situations and measuring their startle response. Since we don't actually know whether or how infants express fear, the experimenters decided that the startle response would be the most accurate measurement of fear. They imposed potentially hazardous conditions on several infants, and measured their startle response in each case. From this design, they collected the data for the experiment. Based on the data they concluded that humans are born with only two fears, because the infants were consistently startled under only two of the conditions. However, if we scrutinize the design of the experiment, this conclusion is quite a leap from the data that was actually collected. Assumptions abound, most notably, that startling reflects the fear response of an newly-born infant, and that the conditions explored in the experiment are equally startle-worthy. It makes for a powerful, publishable, but completely erroneous conclusion. Short answer: experiments collect data that is designed to expose some property or behavior of interest to the experimenter, towards the goal of publishing the results. ",
