            "answer_text": "Can you be an anarchist if you believe in God? I think that this is an interesting question. Anarchism is generally understood to be rooted in the rejection of hierarchical power dynamics. A god figure, as generally understood, implies a hierarchy, with the god being placed above humans. This logically makes theism and anarchism conflict. After all, the slogan is \u201cno gods, no masters\u201d. However, where it gets interesting is that this dynamic could be used as a justification for anarchism. The argument that I have heard theistic anarchists use is that we are all equal in the eyes of God. Therefore, no individual should be able to accumulate power over others. While there is still an internalized hierarchy of god over humanity, a person using this line of reasoning can still reasonably be called an anarchist. There may be the possibility of this person claiming to act on God\u2019s behalf if they begin to impose their will on others, though viewing oneself as simultaneously being equal to others in the eyes of God and as an agent of God\u2019s will seems contradictory.

            "answer_text": "That depends. If you come to anarchy via logic and morality, then clearly not as the god concept is at best absurd, and at worst just logically impossible. However if you come to anarchism via political philosophy, AND you exclude the impossible \u201cgod\u201d entity from the set of moral agents (meaning that it would not be morally accountable for its actions) then yes the two are sort of compatible. Also if you limit your view to \u201cthis life\u201d or \u201chere on earth\u201d or some other arbitrary limitation, yes you can be an anarchist for \u201cthis life\u201d or \u201chere on earth\u201d but then allow for a totalitarian and draconian ruler for the \u201cother realm.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. Anarchists shouldn\u2019t be doctrinaire and there have also been actual Christian anarchists for decades, perhaps centuries. Here you have a main choice between saying anarchy for earth monarchy of the cosmos or God\u2019s an anarchist. You can see this by the fact that he doesn\u2019t intervene in human affairs despite theist fantasies of his doing so. Do your thing, suffer your agonies. But do it on your own. I\u2019m here to listen, provide moral support, but that\u2019s about it. This second choice seems more anarchist. Why an all knowing and perfect being would set up a kingdom is passing strange. What, he\u2019s stuck in the middle ages? He\u2019s not powerful enough to avoid bossing people around? ",

            "answer_text": "I think so. Anarchism in it\u2019s essence is based on rejecting the abuse of a person by another. Anarchists are characteristically those people who can not bear the fact of a person uses violence on another; this leads anarchists to search for an \u201carch\u201dless society. As God Almighty is not an human being but the creator of everything I see no reason to not be able to be an anarchist while being a believer. I myself am. ",

Underlying values just need to be left ambivalent, unquestioned or repressed.Anarchism can be \u2018fundamentally\u201d as mystically founded as religion. For the left its the \u2018unquestioned desire for equality\u2019 and for anarchocapitalists, its the non aggression principle (NAP). Seems sensible, but dogmatically espoused.",
