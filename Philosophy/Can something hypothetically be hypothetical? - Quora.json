            "answer_text": "A hypothesis is some account or proposition which you think explains something, or some observation, but you don't yet have enough evidence or understanding to be confident yet. To find out, needs more work - maybe more evidence, maybe more logical analysis, or whatever. Once you are that confident, then it becomes a theory. So - I don't think the description \"hypothetically hypothetical\" is very useful, though one could contrive a possible meaning for it based on how confident you are of your evidence that 'might' cause you to consider the hypothesis to be a theory. My answer would be technically 'yes' but it's a waste of time worrying about it as the concept isn't useful. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's take this slowly: If its hypothetical then it's something which is not really or hasn't really happened or true. If so, then everything hypothetical (not true at the moment but only for the sake of the statement), is in of itself hypothetical. So the answer would be YES, everything is hypothetically hypothetical. I think that makes sense. ",
