            "answer_text": "Of course they are not. That's why they are called illusions. All they do is make us misinterpret a signal (a light, a sound, a feeling etc) Optical illusions are very common and you cannot do really anything about it. The picture created on your retina is itself misleading. All we can do is identify one illusion, and enjoy it (a mirage, a rainbow\u2026)Then comes an illusion where the fault is with us. Our brain can be tricked easily. Though it is mostly because we don't give time to think and start acting. Schizophrenia is something really sad.So, let us not get delusional about illusions and focus on the tangible reality. :-) ",
