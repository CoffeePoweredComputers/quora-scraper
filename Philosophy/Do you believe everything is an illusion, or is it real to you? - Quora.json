At that time even FBI and Soviet Russia with KGB had to approve me. (my term was security levels up the ying yang). quite true.  Life is not an illusion. I exist. I have tv and that is big screen yet the need is not to need this. I have blank walls and know the calls to reach into infinity. Then the walls themselves become 3D holograhic on a level you could only acknowledge as real. Yes at times i do need to call this out DREAM. I do not allow false images of fantasty to cover my minds thooughts. Yes i am full epileptic psychic. Not foolish on big time play of foolish humans but devote adequate time to the future of humankind itself. The world itself sets me into motion. I see with an open mind and that to the man of humanity means i do know how to dream a dream. I can sleep with eyes not sleeping and visions will surmount any area to give me value to a new undiscovered plan. These sort of people do appear here at times. Especially when really rotten stuff is going on upon this world. Flip side of the coin. The future time does not require complete destruction. Nor enhancement and to consider coin as even a topic is beyond the call of being human at all. Groceries and rent. Covid19 is what has been what has stalled your life. Perplexed and unending duress. The actions are no and or knot a start or a finish. No please of the pleas knows even the handiness of underhanded . You wait because 4 you; you do not understand what humanity stood for and has somehow not been acknowledged in knowing; the ; not even the human spirit or being to be understood. Being human is a short term stint. ( say thew clergy \u201cgiveme your lands and coins and then die). take a meaning ful memory witrh you.  did that do it. no you can not shake the time lines that easy and not for you possible not even for 69 more years. What controls your life, is fair up to you at this time. Putting a near full stop on an entire civilized planet is more than what you decide to call a miracle. I can mechanize an entire for war. say no more. no covid19 works for naught of anyone. Dare you think that; then; know that invisible beast has traced humanity through time itself. TRACED yes traced. While self assuming and being replete of barely even having clean feet, Why does the sound of sickness make all of you walk away and abandon and deny them all (who surround and then just a few take up with faithful honor just to help the few) 71K in usa have infection today above yesterday the daily count . Some crowd swimmer in the crowd of rally trump loaded with covid19 swam over top of them all. no mask and covid19 swimmer being passed around. Next time find that one with a jugular vein cut. Another trump henchman perhaps. but someone paid his pocket anyway. ((the notation is his death count already happens)). OR just dare to kiss ; a caringly hug or kiss something by being intimate with trump. down stomach i still have class. Read the others and find your own self following.

            "answer_text": "Illusion is defined as:\u201d a deceptive appearance or impression\u201d and \u201ca false idea or belief.\u201d I can perceive the reality of the illusion better than the illusion of reality. I do not remember his name, but the Tibetan who wrote the book called \u201cThe Tibetan book of the Dead\u201d described in it when he was around 10 years old, the lama that he was with gave him a slap in the chest, and the physical world transformed into energies interacting as patterns. It was an initiation for him to be able to perceive matter closer to its fundamental structure. The Tibetans spent 1000 years developing their sensitivity to another dimension of reality. I know everything is an illusion because of my perception of time and my memories of the last 70 years. The natural ways of nature have been destroyed and replaced with houses and cars. I am responsible for these changes and now I see the error of my thinking. I built houses for 40 years thinking that I was serving human development and individual families. That has turned out to be a big illusion. The last five years has opened up the world of energy, light and love which is all intelligently designed at its natural level. Atoms also carry the burden of consciousness and responsibility. 2020 is a year of action and also one of time. I have been feeling time moving at a very fast pace, especially as some very big events have just taken place and possibly no more than 10,000 people know about them. It is time to awaken to who we are and become aware of our own unique consciousness. I think we are moving very quickly into the shift of consciousness as planet earth prepares for her actions. By 2030 a mini ice age must begin so that she can renew her oceans and the creatures that live in them. At the same time mankind must give up on his crude and polluting technologies ",

            "answer_text": "Do you believe everything is an illusion, or is it real to you? The word \u2018illusion\u2019 might be deceptive here. Perhaps if we say that things aren\u2019t entirely the way we infer them to be, it might sound more palatable. In Buddhist-speak they would say that we erroneously infer things to have \u201cinherent existence,\u201d and that it\u2019s also wrong to say that things don\u2019t exist at all. Rather they have what the Buddhists call \u201cconventional existence,\u201d meaning that things only exist in relation to all other things. To put it another way, the existence of all things depends on the existence of all other things. This is the philosophy of Dependent Origination formulated by the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, originally found in the sermons of the Gautama Buddha as a claim that things only stand because they support each other like sheaves of wheat that stand only because they lean against each other. So, without the other sheaves to hold it up, any particular sheaf would not stand. The pertinence of this notion can be seen when the self is considered as a \u2018thing.\u2019 So even the self has only a conventional existence and not any inherent existence. Hence the Buddhist notion of no self (no inherently existing self). The notion of self dissolves into the melee of interdependent things and its significance diminshes. And since the notion of an inherently existing self is the root of all desire (the feeling of unsatisfactoriness encapsulated in the thought that \u201cthings would be better for me if\u2026\u201d), that feeling of unsatisfactoriness falls away.

            "answer_text": "The Sanskrit word Maya has been wrongly translated as illusion in the English language and this has caused widespread misunderstanding about this concept. \u201cMa\u201d means that which is not and \u201cya\u201d means that which is. Seeing that which is as that which is not is called as Maya or cognitive error. The classical example is that of seeing a snake in a rope in semi darkness. When the light is turned on, the rope is seen as rope and the snake is seen as non-existent. Rope is the reality and the snake superimposed on it in semi darkness is a cognitive error. So there is something out there for sure (cosmos) and in our perception it looks a certain way and we believe that this perception is the absolute reality. That is Maya. Let us take a simple hypothetical example. A man sees a woman as being very beautiful. If he had microscopic vision then he would see millions of microorganisms crawling all over her face and she wouldn\u2019t look so beautiful anymore. If he had near perfect vision then he would see a cloud of sub-atomic particles in the place of the woman surrounded by a vaster cloud of sub-atomic particles making her practically indistinguishable or invisible. Where is the beautiful woman?! Which of these 3 views is the absolute view? None of them! Perception of \u201cwhat is\u201d is not its absolute nature but it is merely our limited and imperfect view. So when we see a beautiful cosmos we should see clearly that it is merely our limited view or Maya and we have no clue at all as to the absolute reality of \u201cwhat is\u201d really out there. According to Advaita Vedanta, there is truly no time, space or cosmos in the absolute sense but all there is, is Brahman in a state of deep peace. This Brahman is the material cause as well as the efficient cause of this cosmos. This cosmos emerges out of Brahman much like a cobweb emerges out of a spider. Both the subject and the object arise simultaneously in what we understand as wakefulness and sink in what we understand as deep sleep. So the simple answer to your question is \u201cI live my life in duality and in duality my pain and suffering are very real and not an illusion. However in my sober moments I have recognized the profound Truth that I am part and parcel of Brahman\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "This generates a lot of interesting thoughts. Consider this: When you look at a photograph, are you looking at the objects in the photograph? No, you\u2019re not looking at the objects because they\u2019re not there. They could be miles away, or they could even not exist anymore. This is pretty easy to understand. This is also easy to understand with astronomical objects. Light requires time to travel. A light year is a measure of distance. When we look at an object that\u2019s 1 light year away, we\u2019re seeing how it looked 1 year ago. How does it look right NOW? We don\u2019t know. To know how it looks right NOW, we have to wait until next year. We never see distant stars and galaxies as they are. We only see how they looked in the past. Even though the increment of time may be extraordinarily small, this is true of EVERY object. Everything in our rooms, or even things we hold in our hands, must be seen by us as they existed in the past. Because the light we\u2019re looking at is carrying an image of how things were in the past. We never see the present world. We only see the world as it existed in the past. So if we are always looking at how things were in the past, and we never see the present, is everything we see an illusion? ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your state of mind for example Religion. Since the dawn of Humans separating from Apes they created Gods or a God in their own images, ideals and desires for power, greed and control to this very day. The Greeks are famous for their many Gods. Yes Jesus was real but not as portrayed by so call interpretations by so many re-writing the Bible from ancient languages and the scrolls. For example Jesus was a very clever genius and a illusionist. He was dark skinned with brown eyes and hair. He walked on water only because he was clever to make believe at night or late evening during low tide to walk upon a shallow sandbank and so on. His real name was Iesus hence above the cross reading I.N.R.I because the alphabet \u201cJ\u201d was not in scribe during the Roman times. The letter \u201cJ\u201d came after centuries later. Iesus Christ was a good person for the benefit of humankind but was seen as a threat by those posing as \u201cGod\u201d. He was also a threat to those of evil beings with bad greedy intentions. I can go on. Another example Moses and his followers who escaped from their enemies did not cross the Red Sea but the Sea of Reeds further up north when the tide rushed in by the time he and his followers got to the other side of the narrow creek it left the enemy stranded when the creek was fully a washed by the upcoming tide. So what is real and not real. Simply place your hand on a hot stove and you will realize one way or another. Take care, stay safe and Dog Bless. jan.anthonisz@live.live.com.au ",

Everything is real but our feeling of being a separate entity, so necessary for navigational purposes / survival purposes, is an illusion. If you want to have an anchor in reality, learn how to feel your existence physically; you are a body. Your body has a brain that produces mind which is what is reading these words right now, but all this time, you are a body. The attention that you are focusing on these words is made by your body, it belongs to your body; you, the map reader / navigator of your body, is reading this language map; can you feel that you are a body? If so, you are real. You are only real when you feel you exist physically. This has nothing to do with any interpretation of what you feel; that is misleading and should be ignored.

To answer your question, I would like to more away from the word illusion and go with simulation (a neurological simulation created by the brain). We know from physics that every object in the world is 99.9999999 % empty space. Because our brain can NOT see and process the data coming from high-speed electrons\u2026so what we see is a \"high speed motion picture show\". We also know that there is a \"blind spot\" in the back of the eye that we are typically never aware of. Our eyes and really only focus on a very small part of reality at one time. For example, if you hold out your and look at your thumb\u2026 this is the only area that is truly highly focused. Because your eyes move through a process called saccade, your brain takes in information from your eyes while it's moving and helps to give you a whole clear picture (simulates) of what you see in front of you.

It is a deep philosophical question as well, so I will put in my two cents. Believing that it\u2019s all an illusion is a road to psychosis. Of what value is anything if nothing is real? Is the Sun unreal? Certainly not, for he will give me a terrible sunburn if I stay out too long unprotected. If I don\u2019t eat, I get hungry, and if food is completely denied, I\u2019d die. Is life or death unreal? Hindu philosophy generated the idea of Maya. This is the idea that the world seems like a dream, but that\u2019s only because we can\u2019t see it as it really is. Once the blinkers of culture fall from our eyes, we can see reality as it really is. ",
