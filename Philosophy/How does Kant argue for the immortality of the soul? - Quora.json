            "answer_text": "Kant does not argue for the immortality of the soul. Kant does, however, argue for the following two positions: It is impossible to know whether soul is immortal or not.It is necessary to believe that the soul is immortal, even if we can never know whether it really is immortal.Denying KnowledgeAs to the first position, Kant argues in the Paralogisms of Pure Reason section of the Critique of Pure Reason that it is impossible to gain knowledge of the soul, or of the thinking self as it is in itself. Experiential knowledge on the one hand will only touch on how the thinking self appears to itself (as embodied), not how it really is in itself. Purely rationalistic methods (inferences) on the other hand, while they transcend mere experience, can only ever analyse the concept of soul, i.e. how the thinking self must think itself \u2013 not how it really is. (For Kant aficionados out there, this means that rationalistic methods only afford us analytic but never synthetic cognition of the soul.) Although Kant can be confusing with his various apparently conflicting statements about the soul, he never wavers on this fundamental point: we cannot know whether the soul is immortal, no more than we could know that it is mortal. It remains beyond knowledge and the scope of scientific metaphysics. But that leaves us free to assume either way based on other grounds \u2013 and to that I turn next. Justifying FaithAs to the second position, in the Critique of Practical Reason Kant nonetheless argues that a moral person necessarily believes in the immortality of the soul. His argument is complex, but its main thrust is this: the moral law obligates us to strive for the highest good (harmony of virtue and happiness), which leads to the following paradox. On the one hand we cannot have a moral duty to do something that is in principle impossible for us, and the highest good is impossible for us to reach on our own in finite time. Therefore we need to make two additional postulates (i.e. assumptions) of practical reason: (i) that God exists to ensure that nature cooperates, as it were, in our quest for the highest good, and (ii) that our soul is immortal so that we have an infinite time to work towards the highest good. (For a more detailed explanation of this, see: Toni Kannisto's answer to Why does Kant need the three postulates of freedom, immortality and God, to arrive at his Categorical Imperative?) Denying Knowledge to Make Room for Faith\u201cLuckily\u201d for Kant, he has already proven that since we cannot know whether our soul is immortal or not, we are free to believe either way. And since the moral law gives us a very strong moral or, as Kant says, practical ground for believing that the soul is rather than is not immortal, we can and indeed should believe that the soul is immortal. Here it must be underscored that by no means has Kant proven the immortality of the soul, or gone against his unmoving claim that we cannot know either way, but he has given us rational grounds for believing in the immortality of our soul and he has proven, as he says, that we are permitted to hope that our soul is immortal.* It is a matter of faith, not knowledge \u2013 and this is the core of Kant\u2019s famous statement in the Critique of Pure Reason: \u201cThus I had to deny knowledge to make room for faith.\u201d (2nd Edition Preface, xxx. * Recall that for Kant the three main questions of philosophy are: What can I know, what ought I to do, and what may I hope? The immortality of the soul falls in the third category as something that on rational grounds we may hope for. ",

            "answer_text": "In The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant says this about the immortality of the soul: \u201cPURE practical reason postulates the immortality of the soul, for reason in the pure and practical sense aims at the perfect good (summum bonum), and this perfect good is only possible on the supposition of the soul's immortality. It is the moral law which determines the will, and in his will the perfect harmony of the mind with the moral law is the supreme condition of the summum bonum.\u201d As usual, you need to understand the language Kant uses before you can get to the kernel of his ideas. You need to know what the perfect good consists of from reading his other writings. But in this passage, he is saying that pure reason aims at moral perfection. To him, perfection is progress towards the perfect good. It is not the actual attainment of this state of perfection, it is the process.\u201cThe principle of the moral destination of our nature--that only by endless progress can we come into full harmony with the moral law--is of the greatest use, not only for fortifying the speculative reason, but also with respect to religion. In default of this, either the moral law is degraded from its holiness, being represented as indulging our convenience, or else men strain after an unattainable aim, hoping to gain absolute holiness of will, thus losing themselves in fanatical theosophic dreams utterly contradicting self-knowledge.\u201d He\u2019s saying that pure reason is naturally drawn to the progress needed to attain the perfect good, which is in harmony with moral law. He feels that moral law is holy and our immortal soul is drawn to its holiness. At the same time, he blasts people who just lie back and let religions make their decisions for them, in the hope that they will somehow be saved without doing the soul-searching moral behavior requires.\u201cFor a rational, but finite, being the only possibility is an endless progression from the lower to the higher degrees of perfection. The Infinite Being, to whom the time condition is nothing, sees in this endless succession the perfect harmony with the moral law.\u201d The Infinite Being, the Immortal Soul is the seat of pure reason. And to the infinite soul, time has no meaning, by virtue of the fact that infinity mean timelessly forever. Also, the progression of the soul towards perfect harmony with the moral law is a fixed and immutable path that is not impacted by the activities of our lower selves.",

            "answer_text": "Some other reasons, not exactly in Kant\u2019s words, but that can be deduced from this moral arguments and from the concept of soul. The concept of soul is an object (a person) which is free and simple (indivisible, an individual). We normally say the soul is immaterial because nothing free and simple can be represented in experience as phenomenon (i.e., everything we experience is divisible in space and is subjected to the law of cause and effect), so the soul, if it exists, has to be a kind of \u201cthing in itself\u201d. Something simple cannot be destroyed, because what is to be destroyed? To be destroyed is to have your constitutive parts spread by the nature. To be able to be destroyed, the soul should be divisible and its parts should be capable to be spread by the nature, which contradicts the concept of a soul. If the soul died, it should lose the faculty of freedom, or it should disappear to nothing. But why would something that exists cease to exist to nothing? Or why would a thing that is free cease to be free? So, while assuming the existence of the soul, it\u2019s pretty difficult to conceive its death. There are moral reasons too. A free being (a soul) has to be considered an end in itself, which means it cannot be simply used like a thing and discarded when it\u2019s no longer useful. If God exists, and if He is also a free and simple being (besides being omnipotent, omniscient, etc.), He is also a moral and rational being and, in this base, He couldn\u2019t simply discard another rational being (a soul) like a thing. So, it\u2019s morally inconsistent to believe that God would create a free being to let it to cease existing. Nothing of these arguments prove the existence of the soul or its immortality. But, if we have to believe we have a soul for moral reasons, it\u2019s highly contradictory not believing, at the same time, in its immortality. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on my understanding of the Prolegomena, he doesn\u2019t. Kant makes the argument that several core metaphysical questions are indeterminate, including: the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and free will. Essentially, it would be possible for the soul to be apparently destructible in the perceived world, while remaining immortal in the world of things as they are in themselves (or vice versa). Since we have no way to perceive the world of things in themselves, and the domain of reason is limited to the perceived world, there\u2019s simply no way to tell. What Kant argues for is what he calls a rational faith in the immortality of the soul (as well as in free will and God). His argument in each case is that, since it is impossible to know one way or the other, we are free to believe what is useful to us, and each of those three ideas is useful to believe in. I\u2019m a little unclear on why the immortality of the soul is useful to believe in, but that\u2019s his argument in broad strokes. ",
