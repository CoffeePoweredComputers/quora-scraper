            "answer_text": "First read about the differences between Western and Eastern Philosophies. THEN see the many different different types of Eastern (Asian, Buddhist, Middle eastern, etc) philosophies. Eastern philosophy or Asian philosophy includes the various philosophies that originated in East and South Asia including Chinese philosophy, Japanese philosophy, and Korean philosophy which are dominant in East Asia and Vietnam, [1] and Indian philosophy (including Buddhist philosophy) which are dominant in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Tibet and Mongolia. [2] [3] NOW specify your question - There are different Western, Easter, Middle eastern and other philosophies, 1Introduction1.1Knowledge1.2Philosophical progress2Historical overview2.1Western philosophyWestern philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world and dates to Pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE such as Thales (c. 624 \u2013 546 BCE) and Pythagoras (c. 570 \u2013 495 BCE) who practiced a \"love of wisdom\" (philosophia)[35] and were also termed physiologoi (students of physis, or nature). Socrates was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he possessed no wisdom but was a pursuer of wisdom. [36] Western philosophy can be divided into three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman), Medieval philosophy (Christian European), and Modern philosophy. The Ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates, such as Plato, who founded the Platonic Academy and his student Aristotle, [37] founding the Peripatetic school, who were both extremely influential in Western tradition. Other traditions include Cynicism, Stoicism, Greek Skepticism and Epicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competing theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of the well-lived life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason (logos). With the rise of the Roman empire, Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca. Medieval philosophy (5th\u201316th centuries) is the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects Judeo-Christiantheological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, metaphysics, the problem of evil were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to Theology (ancilla theologiae) and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of Scholasticism, a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The Renaissance period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust Humanism. Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650). [38] Following the rise of natural science, Modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. [39] [40] [41] 19th-century philosophy is influenced by the wider movement termed the Enlightenment, and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German idealism, Kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism, Nietzsche a famed anti-Christian, John Stuart Mill who promoted Utilitarianism, Karl Marx who developed the foundations for Communism and the American William James. The 20th century saw the split between Analytic philosophy and Continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as Phenomenology, Existentialism, Logical Positivism, Pragmatism and the Linguistic turn. 2.2Middle Eastern philosophy2.3Indian philosophy2.4East Asian philosophy2.5African philosophy2.6Indigenous American philosophy3Categories3.1Metaphysics3.2Epistemology3.3Value theory3.4Logic, science and mathematics3.5History of philosophy3.6Philosophy of religion3.7Philosophical schools4Other approaches4.1Applied philosophyEastern philosophy - Wikipedia 1Indian philosophy1.1Orthodox schools1.1.1S\u0101mkhya and Yoga1.1.2Ny\u0101ya1.1.3Vai\u015be\u1e63ika1.1.4M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u01011.1.5Ved\u0101nta1.1.6Other1.2Heterodox or \u015arama\u1e47ic schools1.2.1Jain philosophy1.2.2C\u0101rv\u0101ka1.2.3\u0100j\u012bvika1.2.4Aj\u00f1ana1.3Sikh philosophy1.4Modern Indian philosophy2Buddhist philosophies2.1Buddhist modernism3East Asian philosophies3.1Chinese3.1.1Confucianism3.1.2Legalism3.1.3Mohism3.1.4Taoism3.2Modern East Asian philosophy3.2.1Chinese3.2.2Japanese3.2.3Korean4Syntheses of Eastern and Western philosophy",

            "answer_text": "Hi Arslan \u2014 thanks for the question. IMO it is essential to study both. At a thematic level, there are profound intersections that help reenforce and illuminate each other (Confucius and Aristotle, Lao Tzu and Heraclitus, etc.). As well as different methodologies (for example, the koan) to understanding a challenging concept or work through philosophical quandaries. There is the occasional bias that Eastern philosophy is somehow \u201cmore religious\u201d than Western philosophy, but that pretty much ignores the dominant influence of Judaism, neoplatonism and Christianity on 1,000+ years of Western thought \u2014 as well as what is really a primarily \u201cphilosophical\u201d framework of Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian Eastern traditions. As a loose generalization: in the West we have a centuries-long pattern of religious thought with a thin veneer of philosophy, and in the East we have a centuries-long pattern of philosophy with a thin veneer of religiosity. You say po-TAY-to, I say po-TAH-to. My 2 cents. ",
