            "answer_text": "A space-time continuum is at least a three- dimensional geometrical space that has the same duration of time ( the same speed of time everywhere) that's why it is called continuum. First of all, there are many space-time continuums as three-dimensional slices at least, each of them corresponding to only one cosmic speed. In ideal conditions, if a point maintains the same cosmic speed, it will travel in the same space-time continuum, no matter the classical degree of freedom of the motion ) ( But these ideal conditions do not exist in physical reality) These continuums can be represented as lines of a physical field called Cosmos ( from our mentors the ancient greeks) The physical matter is distortions of these continuums. Light travels at waves and interacts as photons. Imagine the distortions as waves and for photons, the distortions tend to be circular motions. But the light distorts only one continuum. The elementary particles are already swirling ( circular motions that distort several space-time continuums that can be represented in a four-dimensional space at least) . And the distortions are developed at a greater scale with more and more complex interactions. The energy of all the distortions is the primary energy from the Big Bang, preserved by that field. So, everything around you ( including your body ) what is it? The distortions the perturbations of this cosmic field generated by the primary energy. It is possible at the Big Bang to appear simultaneously; the Cosmos and the Chaos ( that preserved energy) How we break it? How we break the Cosmos? There is the theory of the wormhole but we are not worms and we do not make wormholes. I prefer the butterfly theory. ; we go out the Cosmos, out of the Observable Universe. How we do that? In our space ship, we reduce the speed of time. The cosmos automatically will increase our cosmic speed. Near zero speed of time, our ship will travel with a speed near the speed of light. Near zero speed of time, there is the danger to explode, and all the mass of our space ship will be transformed in photons, without mass. But, now I have to go to work. And my work is not in the physics area. I will continue in the future\u2026 ",
