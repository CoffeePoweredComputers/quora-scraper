            "answer_text": "No. Les Miserables famously pointed out the opposite. If killing and stealing are both wrong, and these are your only choices, do you watch your children die of starvation, or steal some readily available food to give them? If killing is always wrong, is it wrong to kill a killer who is about to kill your family if there is no other way to protect them? If corporations are people and money is free speech, isn't it wrong to want to prevent them from buying Congress? Moral absolutism is situationally blind and therefore often makes the wrong call. ",

            "answer_text": "Moral relativism dissolves the notions of fairness, justice, and rights which hold civilization together.
