            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this lately as I once again delve deeply into Eastern philosophy. I think the difference is just like that between the front and back of an elephant. It is a difference in perspective only. Having said this most Eastern philosophy has come about through introspection, while Western philosopher\u2019s focus has always been on the external. So for example the aim of Western philosophy is knowledge while the aim of Eastern philosophy is self-realization. I would contend that they are both the same object from different perspectives as the Greek aphorism \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd (know thyself) suggests. I clearly remember the warning from one of my early Buddhist teachers that Eastern philosophy is not merely, or even primarily, an intellectual pursuit, but rather always to be grounded in a practice. Having studied both, however, at advanced levels I can tell you one just really has to keep the seeming contradictions in one\u2019s mind. Just like if one was presented with two different pictures of an animal that one has never seen, for example, let\u2019s pretend we don\u2019t know what elephants look like and we have to figure it out from a picture that looks squarely at the front and another one that looks squarely at the rear. Now, I have to add that I am a practicing Catholic, and I believe in the revelation entrusted to the Church. Following Tolkien I would call Christianity the one true (historic) myth. In this sense every other mythology in the world is a partial reflection of Christianity. One problem for us today is that due to its historicity Christianity has so far only been reconciled with Western philosophy. As St. John informs us in his Gospel, Christ is the Logos, and the history of Western philosophy since the Greeks has been primarily formed by the needs of theology up until just a few hundred years ago, when Western philosophy started to break with theology. Now, on the other hand, Eastern philosophy is still largely connected primarily to \u201cspirituality\u201d never really having had any type of theology, culturally. However, Christ isn\u2019t just the Logos, He is also the Tao (and the Dharma, too, for that matter) and as a result our whole understanding of Christianity has been culturally lopsided. Christianity is not a \u201cWestern\u201d religion. It is not only the one true historical myth, but it is also the only true world religion, but so far we\u2019ve only been looking at it from one side. That is historically and culturally it has been successfully married to Greek philosophy, the fruit of which was the \u201cWestern\u201d culture that followed, but it\u2019s real destiny lies in producing a world culture, which seems to be happening through the Chinese today. When China comes to dominate world culture it will not only offer us, as the British and U.S. have, Empire or neo-Empire, but like Rome it will offer the world a truly new civilization, and when Christian theology is equally developed along the lines of Taoism, Confucianism and Chinese Communism, as it has already been along the lines of Greek philosophy, only then will we really have the true sense of the relationship between the front and the back or the \u201cEastern\u201d and \u201cWestern\u201d perspectives. So for right now, we can\u2019t really imagine what the whole animal (elephant) looks like, again we just have hold the seeming contradictions of the two perspectives in our minds as we study/practice both.

(2) \u2018Western\u2019 and \u2018Eastern\u2019 present very broad scopes. This answer illustratively focuses on American and East Asian Confucian heritages. (3) But, firstly, let\u2019s appreciate the Western-Eastern key differences. Sam Qwato's answer to What are the major differences between Eastern and Western philosophies? (4) We now come back to this Quora question. What\u2019re the similarities between Western and Eastern philosophy? Short answer: The greatest similarity is that both heritages depend on a miniscule number of people in society, to power society\u2019s flourish.But, both implement that dependence very differently. Very different pathways.How is that?Western heritage throttles rah rah individualism. Unrelenting hot-pursuit of personal development and aspirations.Eastern throttles communitarianism, societal well-being.Where do the twain meet? (5a) Western (Illustrative: American) Primacy of individualism. If people are free to pursue whatever they aspire, they will be driven to excel by the forces of human nature. Libertarian-nuanced.  Above: The archetype of the species, Ayn Rand Outcome: Darwinesque \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.Low-medium baseline e.g. US public education.Many peaks: Gates, Jobs, Zuckerberg, Ivy LeagueThe few will elevate the many by their bootstraps, good for society at large.(5b) Eastern (Illustrative: East Asian Confucian) Duties / obligations of parent / children range-up symmetrically to ruler / subjects.An orderly society.Societal well-being.Moderation, balance, yin-&-yang, a continuum view (vs healthy tension, binary, polarization).Shame-based (versus guilt) morality. You shame not just yourself but your parents, your family name, your clan, community for generations to come. Fcuked!Primacy of educational achievement\u2192 Parents emphasize education, do their utmost (duty) for children\u2019s education\u2192 Children to excel in education (obligation)\u2192 Meritocracy\u2192 Technocracy\u2192 Respect for authority (vs high skepticism of authority)\u2192 Elites rule\u2192 Elites power society for societal well-being underpinned by duty / obligation.\u2192 Elites who are inclined to turn rogue \u2192 Deterred by the high \u2018cost\u2019 of shame-based morality.",
