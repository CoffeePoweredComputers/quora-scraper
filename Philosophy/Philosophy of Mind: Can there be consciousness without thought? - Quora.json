            "answer_text": "Being bi-polar, I have had to learn that I am not my feelings. My feelings are just something that I experience. This helps me get through bad times by using my thoughts. My thought can be as simple as remembering that as many times in the past I thought or felt that I could not survive whatever trial I was going through at the time, I always did. For I am here in the present, and I'll probably get through whatever I am going through this time.As I learned that the pattern for our behavior is always the process of thought then feeling then behavior, I realized that there are two steps where I can intervene to make my perspective of life and sense of self as healthy and positive as possible. However, that created a quandary.I can examine and moderate my feelings with my thoughts, but with what am I going to examine my thoughts? I believed that my thoughts were me. . . my consciousness. . . my very self! How could I exist outside my thoughts and still be aware?My answer came from a simple exercise that anyone can do to experience (at least momentarily) consciousness without thought. It was comforting for me to realize that I exist somewhere behind my thoughts. My thoughts as well as my feelings are but a subset of the me. *** Please do try this at home*** Every night for a week set aside 15 minutes for this bedtime exercise. Dim the lights and turn off the TV and silence your cell phone. Try to minimize all distractions for a few minutes. Lay down and try to relax your mind. (I have some visualizations that help, if anyone's interested) Allow your thoughts to fade into the background. Do not try to 'not think'. That too requires thought. Let your thoughts come, but just observe them. Don't follow them and don't try to aggressively stop them. Just be aware of them. Your thinking mind will quieten itself if you allow it.As I practiced this, I experienced a moment where all thoughts faded away. As they fell silent, I realized that my conscious awareness was not my thoughts. I wasn't thinking anything yet I was still aware and observing my own quiet mind. Suddenly I realized that my self is something else entirely separate from (yet connected to) either my thoughts or my feelings. This encourages me that although I may never gain mastery over my thoughts and feelings, I can make this walk in the flesh much more pleasant and satisfying by learning to stay centered in my self.  So yes. I believe there is consciousness without thought :) ",

            "answer_text": "Meet my little friend again!   Thought, as the word is used by most people, implies some form of mental activity beyond bare sense registration and initial reaction to this sensation. I will keep this as my definition for now. Most people will associate it with internal speech, however we might also include nonverbal activity like conception of images or other sensations. It could be willed or unwilled. The question is: is there consciousness without this mental activity.I'd say make an appointment with a friend. When you almost fall asleep he will slam your fingers with my little friend. As hard as possible. Then tell me: was there consciousness before thought?Was there a notion 'something hit me' before you screamed from pain? Or any other mental notion? Or was it just pain and a primal reaction based on this pain? It all depends on definition of consciousness and thought to be honest. Both are not well defined. And thus we can argue forever.I prefer to explore based on experience and thought experiments. My small hammer shows with a little pain that before the rage we experience when we find out a friend hit us there is a small moment where we only experience the sense impression and not yet the mental breakout based on the experience.This moment does not last sufficiently long to give a lasting impression. There are other ways to experience this. Many will speak of meditation in this regard. Still, that's a personal experience. The pain you experience from the hammer, the stillness of meditation. I cannot prove you experience pain when I hit you with the hammer, I cannot proof you experience stillness in meditation. Only you can to yourself. ",
