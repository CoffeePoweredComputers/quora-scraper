            "answer_text": "There is no absolute proof of fundamental randomness or \u201cchance\u201d in our universe. This means that it is easier to determine that a process is deterministic than to say that it is purely random. It could be that the entire universe is deterministic and the uncertainty we seemingly observe comes from the fact that we cannot observe all hidden variables giving rise to a process. Thus, it could be that even things that are certain seem uncertain to us due to our observational constraints. What a headache. ",
