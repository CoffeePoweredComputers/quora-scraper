            "answer_text": "Why not both?? Destiny and choices in life..does exist\u2026but they r more like the story games, that have choices and consequences for each choice in it,leading to different endings... Every person probably doesn't have all types of endings, but he have an amount of them\u2026some of them bad some of them good..and some of them is great\u2026 Destiny controls 30% of ur life,and u have the other 70% Here,an example : One day a women was getting out from the building she is working in,and as soon as she step out of the building, a drunk driver came from no where,seems he is going to hit the sidewalk... This woman had plenty of choices, as there was a rich man beside her,and a kid on the other side..and here self of course.... Let's call the \"car\" is a destiny thing..and the allowed choices is her \"life control\" part.. Here choices and only will lead to the good or bad ending for her self\u2026 If she choosed to rescue the rich man for money..who knows, that could get God angry and cause her prisoned someway... \u2026 I know u would say:\"but the child,he has no choice?!\" No,if he died, then this should be the moment of his death, and no one runs from death... If he got a permanent injury.. And that could be a result of a choice,like disobeying his mother... But if he was like a very small child, God could save him,or he knew if the child lived he could be bad person, so God wanted his death at this point\u2026(death is good for the good and bad for the bad,because death is destiny) But if the child got permanent injury then God did that for a wisdom, and this wisdom is in the favour of the child, who knows if that child didnt have that permanent injury, what he will be..God only knows,so he done the best for him. \u2026\u2026\u2026 Definition of science without entering God: Destiny could be another one's choice that could affect ur life directly or indirectly ..or a natural event(like place of birth,or brain IQ or natural disaster) happened randomly or not,that affect someone's life\u2026and we can define destiny by luck\u2026.tho,everyone have another of destinies depends on his choices that affect alot of things,mainly,his existence in place and in time.. And for known,ur choices affect on u and also others,always. ",

            "answer_text": "A story Life is determined by fate, choices and much more yet unkown to us. Life begins with birth, without any choice, yet with equal chances. (Not) being born is determined by choice, though it is also the fate of the choice maker. A chosen fate. Fifty/fifty chance it is. Sometimes not, seemingly not even meant to be, a soul wrecker, a paralizer it is. Life exposes to all sorts of emotions, challaneges, pleasures and all constructs alive beings have invented, but not always proportionally to ones existance. Life exists and communicates, the longer it exists the more simple and complex it appears to be. Sequentially and simultaniously life evolves. Life sometimes feels like a stream of energy beyond ones control, that tries to take one to places, never even considered as a choice, since it was unkown upfront. It is alomst mystical, feeling even predetermined, however seemingly unconscious, yet a choice too. Such a journey permantly shapes life, damages and terminates it. Life as such is deterministic and also not. There is 100% chance that each living will pass away. But that's not life, that is another story. ",
