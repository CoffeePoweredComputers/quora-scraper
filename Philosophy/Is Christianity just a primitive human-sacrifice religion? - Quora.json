            "answer_text": "Religion itself, from the foundation of civilizations was based on sacrifice, often cases human sacrifice. It was a way of ensuring peace in early civilizations: Competition built among different fractions, the building up of tension, the unloading of the problem onto a victim, a scapegoat, and a ritual act of sacrifice\u2026 and what follows? A moment of liberation and peace. This is the hallmark of early civilizations from around the world:  Christianity did away with this system by siding with the scapegoat. Christ is the perfect scapegoat (true man and true God). Carrying the guilt of all mankind, yet completely innocent. And his ritualized death unmasked the murderous foundation of civilizations. It took away the main drive behind the sacrificial system, which is ignorance that the scapegoat is innocent. Christianity is the last human sacrifice religion, because it did away with human sacrifice. This is why the Christ had to suffer and die. For further reading, I recommend the Anthropologist Ren\u00e9 Girard\u2019s book, \u201cThings hidden since the foundation of the world\u201d: Ren\u00e9 Girard - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "I think you might be taking the crucifixion too literally. The point isn't quite how, but why. The reason Jesus was crucified was in order to redeem humanity's flaws and give us a chance to be saved. The reason why it was a crucifixion, not just everybody getting saved just like that (the simple and convenient way people wish for) is because being crucified was the most degrading and humiliating way to die at the time. The Bible is not a \"nice\" book. Jesus wasn't a \"nice\" guy. The reason the Bible is so controversial is because it tells you good things and bad things. Jesus was the same. He criticized the Pharisees (akin to congressmen today, or respected figures) quite often, no wonder they wanted to kill him. ",
