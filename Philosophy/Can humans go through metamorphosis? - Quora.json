            "answer_text": "So, let's start with \u2026 what exactly is metamorphosis. It is biological process occurring in molluscs,cnidarians,arthropods , in which the animal physically develops after birth or hatching.There is a relative change in the animal body by the process of cell differentiation and cell growth. Now, metamorphosis is of 3 types. Complete metamorphosis/holometaboly - it involves stages of egg-larva-pupa-imago(imaginal/adult stage). Then finally there is molting/ecdysis or immature instars(developmental stage) Incomplete metamorphosis/hemimetaboly- it has 3 stages egg-nymph(immature form of invertebrates like insects which undergo gradual metamorphosis) and imago. The nymphs undergo multiple stages of development and each developmental stage is called instar. Instar is actually developmental stage of insect between each molten until the point of sexual maturity. Ametaboly - no metamorphosis, only gradual increase in size, and occurs in primitive singles insects. So, basically metamorphosis is the complete life cycle of insects. Technically humans do not undergo metamorphosis but we do have similar stages of life (adolescence,adult,oldage etc) . The reasons why humans dont undergo metamorphosis is , because the offspring are fully formed inside the mother's womb therefore they do not need further differentiation of body parts (although there is growth and development of body till maturity is reached) Hence, we can say humans are similar to hemimetaboly/incomplete. As we dont wrap ourselves in cocoons. However the biggest difference lies in the fact that humans dont undergo molting or ecdysis. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Can humans go through metamorphosis? Biologically? No. There is no stage in human biology where the human goes from some larval stage to an adult stage in a dramatic transformation (definition of biological metamorphosis). Psychologically? I mean anything\u2019s possible there. Any significant shift/change in one\u2019s way of thinking can be thought of as a kind of \u201cmetamorphosis\u201d in that field. ",
