            "answer_text": "Short answer: Islam, but Bangladesh is officially secular as well. Bangladesh originally had a secular constitution, however a military coup led to Hussain Muhammad Ershad becoming the leader of the country in 1983. He introduced Islam as the state religion of Bangladesh. Also included in the constitution is the following statement: \u201cthe State shall ensure equal status and equal right in the practice of the Hindu, Buddhist, Christian and other religions\u201d. Since the restoration of democracy in 1991, no party has removed this from the constitution, despite Bangladesh being home to people of faiths other than Islam. The reason for this is politically motivated. The current ruling party, the Awami League, is secular and in 2011, reintroduced secularism as one of the Four State Principles. So in Bangladesh, the constitution has a paradox of including both secularism and a state religion. ",
