            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t do it. This is emotional abuse and a way to control another person for not meeting your standards. If you leave a person when life gets tough, but you only go back to them when they are doing well, that make you shallow. It\u2019s best to not think that way, because if you are single, you can\u2019t get angry at them for dating someone else. They aren\u2019t your \u201cproperty\u201d anymore. You have to be ok with that. You can choose to \u201cseparate\u201d for a while for maybe a month and come back. But not any longer. I had a guy do this to me. He cried and told me on the phone that he still loved me and that it wasn\u2019t about anyone else, he just wanted to have time to get his life together and didn\u2019t have time to be in a relationship with me. So I was understanding. He broke up with me but still kept meeting with me to hook up FOR A YEAR. It would be 2 weeks, then it dwindled down to once a month, then every 2 months. I kept running back to him thinking that he made up his mind and we were getting back together. I was waiting for him to \u201cfigure himself out\u201d\u2026 and then I found out from coworkers and friends that he was meeting his ex again (the whole time he was still seeing me) and dating other girls from work. He put me in a sense of false hope, broke my heart, and wasted my time. It fucked me up so much that I\u2019ve had to see a therapist and be put on medications after having numerous mental breakdowns. He is now living with his ex on the opposite side of the country and I am now happily dating someone else. If the both of you can\u2019t grow together, then don\u2019t stay together.  ",
