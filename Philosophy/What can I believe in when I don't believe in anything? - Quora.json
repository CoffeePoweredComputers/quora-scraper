Whatever has appeared, must vanish. The only thing that is constant in the world is change. Everything and everyone that comes in your life is there only for a temporary amount of time. So, believe that whatever you are feeling or going through is temporary. It is not here to stay. \u201cThis too shall pass\u201d This is the Truth and nothing but the Truth. You can run from the Truth, but you can never hide from it. ",

            "answer_text": "We all believe in something even if we don't recognise it as a belief. For example, An atheist will tell you they dont believe in a supreme God or creator of the earth, yet they will get married which is a christen value. Most people use the term \u201coh my god\" naturally as part of their verbal dialect why? You can develop your inner faith, the kind of faith I'm describing here dose not need a religious service or a holy book, it comes from having the direct inner experience of God as a part of your higher - self. I had a debate about beliefs few years back and gentlemen his name was Javier he was adamant he believed in nothing so I ask him why he was alive then? He stopped and thought about it and couldn't come back with an answer. To live is to believe. Science and religion are closely connected even though we have many who turn one into a war against the other. My love for science doesn\u2019t preclude my faith. For me, Science is another language we use to talk about the same miracles faith talks about There is a invisible intelligence in everything have you ever wandered if the sun decided not to come up for a week the whole planet would be effected There is something devine that rolls through all things you cant get ahold of it. A little seedling has tree-ness in it, when we put it into the ground we can't see tree-ness you can't see the tree yet but you know its there. The same goes with you, you have greatness, you have an energy that is so powerful and it flows through you and in everything that you come into contact with. If you begin to trust it you will find yourself experiencing transformation in your life. If you can't belive in a higher intelligence believe in love make love the focus of your life when this is the case you will have no expectations about how others should respond to your acts of love, your higher self invites you to serve and give without anticipation of reward. Love is why we grow, why we have goals, why we have pets why our parents had us. If you still struggle beliving in something. Try and support someone or something outside of your comfort zone it is a beautiful way to build up belief when you see the someone is reaping benifits of their belief and your supporting their beliefs in the midst of your doubt. As you give more of yourself and ask for less in return, serving others becomes a priority. Then you begin to automatically ask the universe on a daily basis how may I serve; it's a beautiful mantra, \"how may I serve.\" I've been blessed to be able to go through a progression of experiences which underscore the value of experience. I myself \u201cbeleive it\" or not no pun instead. I was a none believer but I found my belief in believing in somone else and found that when you seek happiness for yourself it will always elude you, When you seek happiness for others you will find it yourself.
