            "answer_text": "I like the way you asked this question: not \u201ctell me what it means,\u201d but \u201chow can I reflect\u201d on what Plato might be saying. There are multiple angles from which we might probe the allegory; here\u2019s one that hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet. Plato\u2019s character Socrates introduces the allegory by saying something like \u201ccompare the effect of education on our souls to something like this.\u201d Then he describes the prisoners in the cave, what might happen if one were freed, the painful journey to the light, etc. You might reflect on your own experience of education: \u2014Who or what \u201cturned\u201d you toward the light, or helped you see that what you thought was true might not be the whole story? \u2014Why does Plato depict it as a painful struggle? Has that been your experience? \u2014What is it like to go back down in the cave? (Do people laugh, like they do at the philosopher in the story?) \u2014Do you believe, as Plato says, that \u201cthe power to learn is in everyone\u2019s soul\u201d? If so, what nurtures that power and what drains it? This may not be the kind of answer you were looking for, but I do think one fruitful way to engage with the allegory of the cave is to think about it as what Socrates says it is: an allegory about the process of education.

            "answer_text": "Truth is scary to human, we prefer to live in a comfortable darkness instead of facing the light. But a life without light is just a semi life. We have to be brave and choose the truth in every occasion, truth to others and truth for ourselves. It\u2019s hard, as we can see in the original text, in the light people are working, in the dark they\u2019re just listening and observing the shadows. So you have to fight back pain and lazyness if you decide to live your life truly. ",
