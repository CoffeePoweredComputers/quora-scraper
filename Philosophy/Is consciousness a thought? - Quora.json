            "answer_text": "Consciousness is a group of thoughts, specifically those thoughts which concern other thoughts. In a computer, there are electrical signals activating pixels on the screen, others delivering information from the mouse etc.. These mirror our sensory and motor signals. There is also a CPU, processing the mouse signals and turning them into appropriate screen signals. This mirrors the activity in our central nervous system. The process in the CPU can be quite simple, but it can also be layered, with processing of the processes required. This mirrors our consciousness.  The purpose of consciousness is to evaluate our actions, so that we can adjust for the future. It is too slow to be directly involved in any decisions, but can influence our behaviour in the long term. At first, it can be quite scary to consider the fact that we are simply watching events unfold, unable to do anything but judge them. In the end, one must come to terms with the fact that we are objects, goverened by the same laws as everything else, and that free will was a meaningless concept in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Consciousness is the \u2018screen\u2019 on which thoughts appear. Giving us the ability to experience thoughts. Consider a computer as an analogy. The program instructions are running in the CPU. These are like thoughts. But without the screen you cannot experience the output. The thoughts take on \u2018form\u2019 on the screen. You see a \u2018female character\u2019 on the screen. This does not mean the female character exists inside the CPU. It manifests in color and shape which is perceivable to your senses and is then interpreted as a \u2018female\u2019. The instructions and screen are separate things. But since the screen is the only thing we ever come in touch with - it is easy to confuse the two. This mixing leads to interesting troubles. Sometimes the screen might be dirty, or have a dead pixels - due to which all images might seem \u2018bad\u2019. But that doesn\u2019t mean the instructions(thoughts) are bad or good. Our level of consciousness is low or high. Due to which our relation with those thoughts are poorer or better. Once we are able to see this(not learn this) differentiation, that thoughts are just thoughts. That their goodness/badness is just a function of consciousness playing tricks on us\u2026they start losing their hold on us. This is akin to our \u2018mental health\u2019 improving. The thoughts still exist but they impact us less, control us less. The bad memories, traumatic recollections still exist - but now we are OK with them. Thus we become free of them. ",
