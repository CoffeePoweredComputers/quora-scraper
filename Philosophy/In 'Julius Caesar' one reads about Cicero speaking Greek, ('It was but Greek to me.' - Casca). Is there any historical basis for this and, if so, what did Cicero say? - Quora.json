            "answer_text": "I can't tell what he said, but Marcus Tullius Cicero would certainly have spoken Greek as well as both High and Low Latin. (By High Latin I mean the stuff spoken by orators and politicians, by Low Latin the stuff spoken by the majority of the people - which gave rise to Italian - which is Modern Low Latin - and the other Romance languages.) Greek was the language of a large part of the territories ruled by Rome, and of a lot of literature that a man as well educated as Cicero would have been familiar with. He wouldn't have used it in everyday life, (unlike the Russian aristocracy who spoke French as it was more 'cultured' than Russian!) but would have read it and been able to converse in it when needed.
