            "answer_text": "Of course!  Like any human affair, science is deeply affected by confirmation bias. We are in awe of science, but do science fields as they are practiced presently, deserve more respect than philosophy? I think not!  I once was fascinated by the Lord of Science. How could philosophers still try to answer questions posed 2000 years ago, when the Lord of science, a start-up barely 200 years old, could leave philosophers in the dust? I thought philosophy should learn from science. I wanted to know what made science so special, which led me to pursue the logic of scientific methodology in my younger academic me. From the way science works, my conclusion was that of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend: \"Anything goes!\" There is no logic in science. Christal ball reading could be as scientific as lab experiments: We, \"the scientifically-minded community\" just decided to exclude the Christal ball reading from the scientific methodology.  You might want to protest that science progresses thanks to the verification method. \"How naive of you,\" I say. As The Economist reports (How science goes wrong) 75% of articles published in science journals are rubbish. Far less than 25% of published 'scientific' results, from medical to computer science, can be reproduced, and reproduction is how you verify.   So the question is, \"How could science be a load of rubbish?\" The answer, as The Economist correctly locates, is the binary mantra of academia, \"Publish or Perish!\" The academic job market practices cut-throat competition. Publishing is the only way to secure an academic job and to move up the rank and file in the academia.  Given this incentive structure, scientists are always to look out for publishable material. So what can be published and how can one publish?  Above all, the hypothesis should be sexy, not humdrum. To this end, some plastic surgeries on experimental set-ups and the massage of the data are inevitable. A natural beauty (genuine causality) will be replaced by a Silicon beauty (spurious correlation). Being the first to propose the hypothesis is far more important than vindicating the hypothesis. Papers that aim to verify or falsify already existing hypotheses cannot find publishers (<15%). Most papers are published through net-working and through scratching the back of each other. Anonymity is a see-through veil. The objectivity of the peer review is a joke, naturally. One dare not to object to a well-established famous figure's hypothesis. Force is very strong with the famous. Most published papers of 'scientific' field are not the public good, but the personal good. Confirmation bias is inevitable.        ",

            "answer_text": "Science is done by humans, all humans are succeptable to confirmation bias. However, science isn't a belief system, it's a process - tool if you like. One of the things that makes it so powerful is the peer review process. If you have a scientific hypothesis, and dark matter is a good example, you have to publish your hypothesis and let anyone who is working in your field test your ideas to destruction. Those people have no reason to share your findings, so are immune from confirmation bias - indeed many of them will be predisposed to scepticism, because they are working on rival theories. The popular press doesn't help, because it removes a lot of the nuance from theories and hypotheses. In science, rival theories lead to better theories. In religion, rival theories lead to wars. ",
