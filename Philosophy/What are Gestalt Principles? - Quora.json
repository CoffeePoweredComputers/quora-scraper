            "answer_text": "Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception Proximity: The principle of proximity dictates that we tend to group elements together based on their location or \u201cproximity.\u201d This principle allows for the manipulation of perception through well placed and cleanly grouped data. Similarity: The principle of similarity dictates that we are likely to group comparable elements together. This essentially means that from the visual perspective of the audience, similar colors, shapes, and fonts are expected to be grouped together. When applied to client communications, this principle can assist with the removal of unnecessary data elements. Closure: The principle of closure refers to our propensity to \u201cclose the gap\u201d and create complete elements. This concept applies even when portions of shapes and figures are missing. Enclosure: The principle of enclosure dictates that if elements are controlled by a visual border or shading, we will tend to see the objects and elements as unique groups. Like prior principles, this principle can be employed as a foundation for graphical data presentation. Continuity: The principle of continuity dictates that if separate linear elements are positioned within one another, we will tend to integrate all of the parts of the elements. Individual lines will then be viewed less as separate and more as a continuation of one central element. Connection: The principle of connection dictates that our visual pairings are often strongest when there is an actual linear tie. That is, rather than associating elements via color, shape or spacing, we will use a direct lineal connection to establish the foundation for our visual relationship with data. ",
