            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s alive and well, thanks in no small part to Bernardo Kastrup. He has a PhD in Philosophy and a PhD in Computer Engineering and started out in AI research. You can find his books and video interviews here: Here is how anyone can understand the true nature of reality. He\u2019s a very careful thinker and his arguments are always, always sound. That\u2019s what I appreciate the most, his rigorous arguments. I would also recommend Father Francis Tiso\u2019s books on the Rainbow Body phenomena; Tiso took his Masters of Divinity from Harvard and his PhD in Buddhist Studies from Columbia. And I would related to that, Dr. Nida Chenagtsang is a highly regarded master in Sowa Rigpa, the traditional healing science of Tibett; he has a very interesting youtube playlist, covering several topics but with emphasis on vase breathing. Sowa Rigpa is based on the idea of rlung, the Tibetan equivalent of subtle energy. Rlung moves through subtle energy channels located throughout the body.  These same subtle energies are the target in completion stage yogas of Deity Yoga; this Deity Yoga is really what makes the Tibetan Vajrayana unique. Dr. Nida Chenagtsang also has written several books, available on Amazon. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a big question. I do not believe that idealism in the old-fashioned late 19th century sense is a very strong presence in contemporary philosophy. But it isn\u2019t entirely absent from the picture, either. Italo Testa and Luigi Ruggin recently co-edited a collection of essays about Hegel\u2019s objective idealism. At least some of the contributors are sympathetic to at least the broad outlines of the system. ",
