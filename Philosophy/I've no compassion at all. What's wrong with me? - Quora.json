            "answer_text": "All through the details of your questions,  you have been talking about death and not feeling anything. For the people who are dead and gone,  you may feel sorrow or sadness but that has almost nothing to do with compassion.  Compassion is \"concern\" for others pain and suffering and taking \" action\"  to alienate it any fashion, any Manor,  big or small .  Compassion is  concern +action. Ask yourself have you ever fed anyone who was hungry. Have you ever held back the shoulder of your friend who was about to trip over. Have you ever given a nickel to an old begger on the street. Have you treated a waiter at the hotel  with respect another human desrves.? If answer to the above is yes,  you are compassionate.  If it's a no,  then you need help and I am almost certain that it's not the case.  Now let's talk about you not feeling sad about loss of life.  When I was young,  I couldn't understand what people felt when they drowned. Then,  a few years back I almost died if drowning and I knew what it's like to  inhale water and loose consciousness. Now, I can relate to the pain an suffering of drowning but I still can't relate to pain of bullet wound. Don't have any experience of it,  thankfully. Sometimes,  we can relate to tthe suffering of others at a sensation level, relate to it,  identify it at a bodily sensation level and feel bad about it.  Sometimes we can't.  Don't try to classify being able to feel the pain or sorrow as something good or bad? There are always two sides of a coin. So look at the positive side of what you consider as a concern.  If Feeling pain can make you feel human,  not feeling pain can leave  you a happy human. (this is how I will consider the positive of your current situation)  It's the absence of compassion which makes you an animal,  if you understand what Compassion is? Check again with people close to you,  if you are really unkind. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. As far as what you have mentioned in details, I think its a positive side of you or a good quality that you aren't affected by some severe situations whereas on others it creates huge impact.    Its like you are watching scenes of this world movie and playing like an actor who is just playing his best part and rest other things doesn't bother him.   And u are saying I will not affected by someone's death, then what's the need to have a affect on you. I think there is no need. Its the role of other person which gets finished . you have to bother about yours. I doesn't mean that don't be with others, you should or everyone should be with other peoples, help them or do whatever is required but just don't create affect on yourself due to some others situations.
