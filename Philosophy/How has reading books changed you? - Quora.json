            "answer_text": " Reading can transport the reader to a different world and show the world through the eyes of various characters each of them a slice of the writer's reality. The journey from a writer's mind to the free flow of a book to a reader's mind -- to be interpreted in their own way - is a beautiful journey. This is because reading can rewire a human mind. Humans have had written language with them for just around 5000 years, which shows that reading is not essential for the survival of human species. However, it does make us socially more adept and better able to understand people around us and walk through life. The following are some of the impact of the habit of reading : (in my personal experience too) 1 Reading improves cognitive intelligence  Research has shown that reading changes certain areas of the brain and activates certain others. According to neuroscientists, reading \"rewires\" those areas of the brain responsible for spoken language and vision. This improves our cognitive intelligence.Reading can improve the functioning of the brain area that filters the massive amount of visual information that we see every day. This effect can also be observed in adults who learn to read much later in life. A 2013 study from Emory University showed that reading novels could rewire certain areas of the brain, producing biological changes that lasted for up to five days. The study participants read Robert Harris' 2003 novel Pompeii and the areas of the brain that were the most active as they comprehended the story were the ones which showed heightened connectivity the next few days. It must be noted however, that effects from reading do not last permanently unless they are refreshed frequently. 2 Reading helps us understand how other people think and feel  Reading improves our emotional intelligence. Books allow us to hold multiple points of view in our mind at the same time. Someone who reads more is thus more likely to empathise with fellow humans or animals as he/she is able to quickly flow into a third person's perspective in order to see a situation through a different pair of eyes. Reading improves our \"theory of the mind\" - how we think other people are thinking, and \"how we use the states to explain and predict the actions of those other persons\", as the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy states. This \"intuitive philosophy\" allows us to look around us and have a better idea of how people around us are thinking and feeling. This understanding can improve the overall quality of a person's life as it would allow us to act with better judgement and more insight into the feelings and thought pattern of others. Reading helps us empathise much better, allowing us to connect with other people more as it trains us to understand and accept other perspectives. Our executive functioning improves because of these effects on the brain. Our \"theory of the mind\" can be improved by reading narratives, as per a meta-analysis by York University's Raymond A. Mar. The better we understand what is going on in a narrative, the better we would understand the people around us and their actions and intentions. 3 Reading could help tackle developmental disorders  Certain mental disorders are increasingly appearing to arise due to problems in particular brain circuits. A study by Carnegie Mellon showed that \"100 hours of intensive reading instruction improved children's reading skills and also increased the quality of... compromised white matter to normal levels.\" Since reading could improve the communication and 'wiring' between different sections of the brain, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Thomas Insel suggested that these findings could pave the way for a new approach to treating mental disorders. 4 Different reading materials affect our brain differently  Different kinds of reading material and writing style have different effects on our mind. Psychologists Emanuele Casta and David Comer Kidd of the New School for Social Research conducted a study with 1000 participants where each of them was randomly assigned an excerpt to read from either literally fiction and popular bestsellers.The researchers referred to the following excerpt from critic Roland Barthes' 'The Pleasure of the Text' to explain the different effects each type of reading material had on the minds of the reader: Some writing is what you call 'writerly', you fill in the gaps and participate, and some is 'readerly', and you're entertained. We tend to see 'readerly' more in genre fiction like adventure, romance and thrillers, where the author dictates your experience as a reader. Literary [writerly] fiction lets you go into a new environment and you have to find your own way. The participants were then tested with two \"theory of mind\" tests. Those who had read the literary fiction excerpts scored consistently higher than those who had read the popular bestsellers. 5 Reading descriptive words can stimulate brain regions related to different senses  A 2006 study published in Neuroimage shows that reading descriptive words can stimulate brain regions related to different senses. Words like 'cinnamon', 'lavender' and 'soap' stimulates certain regions of the brain, which are not related to language-processing but to smell. If the written material is in sensory language, \"The brain, it seems, does not make much of a distinction between reading about an experience and encountering it in real life; in each case, the same neurological regions are stimulated,\" writes Annie Murphy Paul at The New York Times referring to this study. In 2012, researchers from Emory University reported a study they conducted which showed that when their subjects read metaphors related to texture, the sensory cortex of the brain, which figures our texture patterns through touch, became active.Metaphors like \"The singer had a velvet voice\" and \"He had leathery hands\" roused the sensory cortex, while phrases matched for meaning, like \"The singer had a pleasing voice\" and \"He had strong hands,\" did not. -- states the New York Times article. 6 Reading written material and hearing it read produces the same effect on our brain  Reading written material and hearing it read by someone else produces the same effect on our brain. This was seen in a jointly conducted German and Norwegian experiment where study participants who heard poetry being read aloud and had physical sensations ",

Furthermore,I read to get a scholarship for college and got it.I read to graduate with skipping class at will and when my professors complained in most cases.I simply said, please allow me to read up next lecture notes before test comes up and then evaluate my grades.The end products turns out that I did better. Therefore,reading shapes your life better in terms of awareness,exposure to unbelievable information about a future or imagination you had hoped www.for.It also aids you in communication with people in different subject matters. For instance Elon Musk can better communicate with people who know and did study rocket science through his ability to read and understand . however, in Elon\u2019s case other human abilities are present which others don't possess,but generally reading keeps you informed and not deformed in our world where knowledge rules.

Word Power: My vocabulary improved. Not only I learnt new words, but their usage as well, from reading books. So I became good in written communication.General Knowledge: Books tell me about different places/countries in the world, most of which I can't visit in my life. But I could acquire good knowledge about such places through reading books.People Psychology: By understanding the way characters behave in a story, I could understand basic human psychology, and how people react to different situations.Communication: How people communicate with each other taught me how to communicate effectively with people in real life.Imagination: When reading a story, I travel with the characters. So I am able to visualize the scenes in my imagination. This helped me to visualize future situations in my imagination, and prepare myself in advance for important meetings, interviews, presentations, etc.To sum up, reading books actually made me what I am today!

He shares with you what he analyzed and takes you step by step on shifting your life for the better. 2nd Book: Awaken The Giant Within by Anthony Robbins Great book too. Anthony Robbins takes your through from daily goals to long term mindset shifts. The book will make you process through what you are going through right now and acknowledge you can be more. Then he will give your various senarioes that you can implement into your life. One of the best sections I read from him was \u201cControlling your emotions. Shifting a negative to a positive situation from his mindset is rare. People don\u2019t naturally do what he does in negative situation which is why most people get unhappy in negative situations. This book can seriously turn your emotions and mindset around. ",
