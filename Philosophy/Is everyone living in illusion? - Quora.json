            "answer_text": "We live in illusion because reality itself is a kind of illusion. To have a better understanding we should know what we consider as real and what we consider as illusion. For all practical purpose this world is real, our life is real and our mind it real when we are alive. When I get injured, I feel the pain. The pain is real. Then what is illusion? A dream is an illusion. Dream appears in sleep and when we wake up the dream vanishes. When we see a video on TV, it is not real and it is an illusion because it goes off when you switch off the TV. Then how can reality be considered as a kind of illusion? It is so because reality is something managed by our consciousness. If existence of any entity is real, it is primarily because of consciousness. Existence is possible because of consciousness and consciousness is possible only because of existence. So existence and consciousness are one and the same. Using the TV analogy , the video on TV appears only when there is electric current in the TV. When the current is off the video vanishes. Similarly when the life current in the physicsl body is present, the mind and consciousness are active and reality exists. When life stops, the consciousness ceases to exist and everything vanishes. Then what we consider as reality for practical purposes also vanishes. Reality as well as existence is like a picture projected on a screen, where the consciousness is the screen. When there is no screen there is no picture. Similarly when there is no consciousness, there is no existence and reality. You may now question this conclusion by asking - ' Does this world not continue to exist despite the fact that so many people die every day?\u2019 Yes, the world continues to exist as far as you are concerned even though a lot of people die every day. But when you die, your existence ends and your universe vanishes. That is why the existence of universe is called an illusion. It is impossible to bring you back to life and establish that your universe continues to exist after your death. So the universe is specific for the individual consciousness. Either both of them exist together or there is no existence at all. Then you may ask whether there are infinite universes present corresponding to the infinite minds pondering over it. Yes, there are actually infinite minds and infinite universes corresponding to it. But rest assured because they are all illusions. You may again question how it is possible for infinite universes to exist. You may argue that there is only one universe with innumerable life forms and minds present in it as we experience it. This is precisely the illusion or Maya caused by ignorance. This universe appears to exist only when there is consciousness. When consciousness is gone there is no existence of any entity and the picture of universe vanishes totally. The veil of ignorance clouds the reality. When you ponder deeply, the ignorance vanishes and truth is realised. ",

            "answer_text": "The material world is called Maya - God\u2019s illusory potency. Krishna says: Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the non-existent [the material body] there is no endurance and of the eternal [the soul] there is no change. This they have concluded by studying the nature of both. (Bg. 2.16) So according to Krishna's definition, reality is that which is eternal and unreality, or illusion, is that which is temporary. Note that illusion does exist, but it is unreal in the sense that it's not eternal. Someone may object - if I smash my head into a wall, the pain I feel is very real. How can it not be real? But if seen in the light of eternity it is not real. For instance, I may break my leg today, but 10 years from now it will not be real, what to speak of 100 years from now. It will be as if it never happened. So illusion exists, it is not false or fictional, but the reason it is not considered real is because it is not eternal. It's like a dream. A dream happens, but when we wake up, we understand it was not real. Life in a material body is like that - dream-like. Say, we have a real nice meal today, a week from now, it will be no more real to us than had it been a dream. That\u2019s how life in a material body is like a dream. We'll realize that, if not before, then at the time of death. Death will be a rude awakening for the atheist. So reality and illusion are defined by time. One is eternal the other is temporary. And if you think about it, it makes sense. Anything seen in the light of eternity will be manifested for such a short flicker in time, that it is as if it didn't really happen. Brahma, the god of creation, is said to live as long as the universe lasts - which is calculated to be 311 trillion solar years. So if you live for such an unfathomable length of time, then imagine what a person's life-span on earth of, say, 80 years must look like. I don't even live a second from Brahma's point of view. How real would a person be to you, if he existed for a second? Think about it. If you take 80 years out of 311 trillion years it is such a miniscule portion of time, that for all practical purposes it might as well not have happened. But then again, if you take Brahma's lifespan and compare it to eternal time, it is just as little. However long time is taken out of eternal time, it will still amount to nothing. The duration of the universe will make a lifespan on earth seem completely insignificant, and the cosmic time of millions, billions, and trillions of years will seem totally inconsequential and insignificant from the angle of eternal time. So in the light of eternity, anything that is not eternal is but an illusory glimpse. That's how one can understand that anything which has a beginning and an end is illusory. Only that which is eternal is real. Now, in this world, what is then real, someone might ask. We don't have any experience of something that lasts forever, do we? Yes we do. The only thing, that lasts forever is the conscious self. The soul is eternal, so in the material world the only real thing is ourselves, our real selves, the soul, anything else, including our body and mind, is temporary, and thus illusory. That's why self-realization, according to Vaishnava theology, means to realize one's eternal self beyond the temporary body and mind. Krishna gives a brilliant argument in the Bhagavad Gita to help a thoughtful person experience his eternal self. A person's body goes through different stages of infancy, childhood, youth, old age and finally death. But during all these changes of the body and the mind, the self (the inner sense of I-feeling), or the inner observer remains constant. I am the same \u2018me\u2019 when I\u2019m young as when I\u2019m old. That's one way we can logically understand we are eternal. The human life-form is unique in the sense that it allows the self to understand its own eternity. So the purpose of human life is to connect with the eternal self. If one is simply absorbed in the body and its demands, one is wasting this valuable opportunity - an opportunity that is only available in the human life-form. Eating, sleeping, mating and defending, the soul can do in any life-form, only in the human form can the self connect with eternity, ie. reality. Krishna says: Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. (Bg 2.12) As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change. (Bg 2.13) I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible. (Bg. 7.25)  ",
