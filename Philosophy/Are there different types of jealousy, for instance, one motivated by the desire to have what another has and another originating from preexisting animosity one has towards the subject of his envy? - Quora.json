            "answer_text": "Jealousy and envy are two different things. Jealousy is about wanting to keep what you have to yourself, and envy is wanting what someone else has. Neither is rational but both are highly emotional responses driven by fear. Jealousy is the fear of loss and envy is the fear of helplessness or incompetence. We don\u2019t really own anything; even our lives are borrowed. We will, eventually, lose everything one way or another. It\u2019s important to remember that for two reasons: So that we can appreciate what we have when we have it.So that we can calmly face loss.Keeping these in mind will help you overcome jealousy, as well as envy. Envying what another has is destructive and a massive waste of time. You don\u2019t know what the other person is going through, what challenges they are facing in their lives. In addition, if they have achieved success, it\u2019s because they put in the work. It\u2019s more constructive to learn from them and allow their success to inspire you, rather than to make you feel inadequate. If you envy others because you fear that you can\u2019t achieve the success you\u2019d like to in your life, then it\u2019s best for you to spend your time improving your own skills. What are your strengths? What are your interests? What goals would you like to set for yourself and what steps can you take to reach them? What contacts and friends do you have that could help you achieve your goals? What resources are available to you so that you can either learn a new skill or improve the ones you already have? Once you focus on yourself and your own path, envy won\u2019t come into the picture because you will be busy pursuing your own dreams. Also, those who have achieved success will be sources of inspiration for you and you\u2019ll admire them as peers. I hope this answered your question, I wish you the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question and I get the impression you have given it considerable thought. Are there different types of jealousy? I am inclined to say that jealousy is jealousy what differs are the factors triggering this emotion. Now that is not to say that, your jealousy is the same as someone elses, while I accept that jealousy is jealousy, every other other factor associated with it is different? Most importantly though, there is niothing to be gained though jealousy or any of the other included in the repertoire of negative emotion. The best way I can exoplain it is to say that all negative operates in a descending manner and will only feed on itself and take you with it, Why waste the precious emotional energy that you create for not only no benefit but for detriment. Is it any wonder that religion preached forgiveness and humility. ",

            "answer_text": "Jealousy \u2018is a negative emotion in which an individual resents a third-party for taking away the affections of a loved one.\u201d Jealousy require three people: the one who is jealous, a partner whom the jealous individual desires, and the rival who represents a preemptive threat to these desires. We call this triangulation. Envy is a \u201cnegative emotion of discontent and resentment generated by the desire for the possessions, attributes, qualities or achievement of another.\u201d Unlike jealousy, envy involves only two people, the envious person and the person envied. Both jealousy and envy are based on shame and contempt, the former toward the \u201csplitter\u201d in a triangle, and the latter who believes it unfair that the other person has what one covets.. ",

            "answer_text": "The desire to have what another has isn\u2019t jealousy. It\u2019s covetousness. It has to do with desired things one does not themselves have. Jealousy is more the fear of losing a desired thing, specifically a relationship, one already has. It can be based on animosity for the control the \u201cobject of their desire\u201d exerts over them. But usually it is more just the fear of loss of something upon which someone has become dependent; perhaps even addicted? ",
