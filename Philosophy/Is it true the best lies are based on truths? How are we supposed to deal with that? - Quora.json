            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if the best lies are based on truths, but I can see where that would be a general truism. So let\u2019s accept it as true, and I\u2019ll address the more interesting second question you pose. I think the way we\u2019re supposed to deal with it is to know the facts, as best we can. I\u2019m going to make a distinction here between \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfacts.\u201d Facts are universal. Not all truths are, though. How so? Well, it\u2019s a fact that it\u2019s X miles between Yonkers, NY and Boston, MA. It\u2019s been measured. It\u2019s been documented. It\u2019s an objective fact. It doesn\u2019t care how you feel about it. Truth, however, can be subjective. Not always, but in certain circumstances. \u201cThis chili is too spicy!\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not! It\u2019s just right!\u201d Person A is sensitive to highly-spiced food, whereas Person B enjoys spicy chili. So what Person A says is true for him, as is what Person B says. The fact of the matter is, there is an element of spiciness in the chili. Truth can sometimes be influenced by opinion, background, and other factors. Those factors can also be used by unscrupulous people to deceive others. So, to avoid lies based on truth, know the facts. And don\u2019t accept things at face value. ",

            "answer_text": "In simple terms, honesty is a face to face exchange. It is perhaps best thought of as a transaction between people. In this exchange, we do not always know wither someone is being dishonest. I like to assume that most people are at least willing, to be honest. People if they are not pathological liers generally lie about things they think are valuable, so find out what they value then at least you\u2019ll know why they would lie to you. BUT\u2026 When there is no face to face exchange it is easier for people to be dishonest so be careful with believing what you read, or what people tell you when you do not face to face. ",
