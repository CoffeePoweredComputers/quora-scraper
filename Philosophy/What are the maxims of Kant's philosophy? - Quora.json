            "answer_text": "Kantian maxim of action is the basis for actions. This gives a basis for ethics as explained by Kant. Then comes the categorical imperative. Example: I will do exercise everyday to be healthy.\u201cdoing exercise\u201d is the action and the end result is \u201cbeing healthy\u201d in the above statement. These maxims can generalize to apply at a larger scope. When the subjective principle of maxim made objective it becomes a law. An interesting valid maxim by Kant about his smoking only one pipe a day and later buying a larger pipe is a puzzle.

Hope this helps in forming your own \u201cmaxims\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Kant said to make decisions as if each decision would become a general rule for mankind. I think he was trying to find a non-religious alternative for the Golden Rule, a philosophical rule that people could live by. He called in the Categorical Imperative. But I think Kant\u2019s work was a failure. It is mostly too complicated for people to understand and it is in the end wrong - that he tried to think about thinking using logic alone but his categories and terminology do not match up with modern neuroscience. So, good try, but a failure. Studying Kant is a waste of time. It is an intellectual exercise that leads no where. Kant\u2019s most know work, The Critique of Pure Reason was based on a class he had taught for 30 years. But the book was written hastily in a few months. The writing is obscure, so people think Kant is smart. ",
