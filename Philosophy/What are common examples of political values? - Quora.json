            "answer_text": "A political value is something you believe in that relates to how government should operate, whom it should serve or not serve, who pays for it and who benefits. At the heart of this is the question, \u201cwhat is a public good.\u201d A public good is anything whose benefit cannot be divided, that cannot only benefit those who pay for it. The most commonly cited is national defense. If the government builds a wall of anti-ballistic missiles to prevent bombs from reaching us, you are protected whether you pay taxes or not. At it\u2019s simplest, this is a public good. However, things get complecated and controversial after that because political goods, like all other goods, cost money. For instance, is public education a public good? If you value an educated citizenry, then it is. If you don\u2019t, and you don\u2019t want your tax dollars going to pay for public schools because you can afford private school, then it\u2019s not. Another example, do you value clean air? You may say, \u201cOf coarse! Who doesn\u2019t?\u201d So why then are some trying to defund the EPA? Well, they may say that the EPA regulations inhibit profits for businesses and thus cut jobs. So is the choice here between jobs and clean air? Some would have you believe so but the choice is a false dilemma. You can have clean air and clean jobs. Building solar panel arrays create jobs and has a positive impact on clean air. So a political value often involves a trade off or a perceived trade off. The latest debate over healthcare is a case in point. Under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the political value is that the country is stronger when all it\u2019s members have access to healthcare. But this costs money and requires everyone to have insurance whether they want to buy it or not. So maybe it is not such a good idea. But then how will you feel when you see that babies are dying because their mothers could not afford prenatal care? So, your political values are express by what you want your tax dollars to pay for. Or whether you want to pay taxes at all. If you think that paying for someone else\u2019s health care is a waste of your money because you can afford health care for you and your family then public health care is not a political value for you. And that is fine for you \u2014 until an epidemic breaks out among the uninsured and your kids are exposed and at risk. Then what? ",

            "answer_text": "Economic systems play hand in hand with political beliefs. Liberals value the collecive over the individual. They believe in equality of outcome over equality of opportunity. They believe in a lot of regulation, government intrusion, a big government bureaucracy to support it. If you are going to have higher government involvement and programs you are going to need higher taxes. They believe in a highly regulated form of capitalism. They will force people into markets they create and call it free market capitalism. Conservatism is the belief that big government with its intrusion and regulation stifles economic growth. They believe that government is not the solution, it is the problem. They believe somewhat in individuals being left alone, it is the individuals job to pull themselves up by the boot straps and take care of themselves. A smaller government should require lower taxation. At least this used to be the definition before Trump and Ryans last budget. They believe in a less regulated free market capitalism. Libertarians believe in very small government, with less regulation so taxation should be lower. And that adult individuals should be able to decide for themselves if they want or need something. Most Libertarians believe they want government to leave them alone. Most Libertarians support regulation only in cases of the free market failing. Communism is all about class. They seek to make everyone the same, they don\u2019t believe in private property ownersip and they have killed millions of people trying to make this utopia. The central government plans the economy and places people in jobs the state wants them in. Collectivism is very important, individualism is unimportant. Your rights are subservient to the states. The state supplies healthcare, food, and everything else. You want bread, wait in line! And you only get one loaf. The exclusion to this working class paradise are the political elites. They live far better than their comrades. Regulate damn near everything in your world. Socialism has a lot of the features of communism, with some free market capitalism to try to balance things out. The individual has some choices but they are limited. There is not a whole lot of difference between them and Marxist Communists. In fact Marx said socialism is a necessary step on the way to communism. ",
