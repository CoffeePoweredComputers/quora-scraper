            "answer_text": "Philosophy is extremely useful. But it\u2019s not easy to see why. For many, philosophy is a mental exercise. It has no more practical application than a strategy board game. Some might see it as an art form, a playful pastime to satisfy the soul. Others contend that philosophy can be therapeutic, ameliorating human sorrow. We can learn from Boethius (477\u2013524 CE), for example, how to \u2018take life philosophically\u2019. The Consolation of Philosophy: Boethius, David R. Slavitt, Seth Lerer While these descriptions of philosophy are all very well and good, philosophy has a much more useful role in our lives. Plato\u2019s The Republic, Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince, and Thomas Moore\u2018s Utopia \u2014these are wild speculations on the art of governance. Eventually this theorizing would give birth to a discipline we now call political science. Isaac Newton was practicing \u2018natural philosophy\u2019 in his own time \u2013 not physics. Adam Smith never took a course in economics. In his time he was known as a \u2018moral philosopher\u2019. The mathematician Georg Cantor\u2019s work in the late 19th century was too weird to be considered mathematics at first. It had to go through a philosophical stage before it revolutionized 20th century mathematics. The philosopher William James once said that the first lecture he heard on psychology was one that he gave. He was one of the architects of modern psychology. Many fields of study must go through a hazy, almost mystical stage, before they crystallize into a discipline. Once a group of individuals agrees on what it is they wish to study, and agree on what methods are acceptable, and what methods are unacceptable, a \u2018subject\u2019 or \u2018discipline\u2019 is born. At that point the philosopher becomes an unwelcome guest at the table. He may be thanked but then told that his services are no longer needed because now there is \u2018real\u2019 work to do. American philosopher John Searle summed it up when he said, \u201cPhilosophy is what you do when you don\u2019t know what to do next.\u201d Here is another way to look at it. Many subjects of study can be thought of in two aspects: the theoretical and the practical. Consider these pairings of professionals: physicists /engineersbiologists / physicianseconomists / businessmentheologians / preachersliterary critics / writerspolitical scientists / politiciansThere may be some tension, but always a mutual respect between the theorists and practitioners. Professors who spend most of their time theorizing are sometimes thought of as living in their own little world, removed from the practical world. So where does philosophy fit into this? Philosophy is to the theoretical, as the theoretical is to the practical. Philosophers can be thought of as \u2018meta-theorists\u2019. No question is too outrageous to consider. Other subjects must limit themselves in order to maintain their integrity. Philosophy is necessary, it is important, and it is useful. But its influence is so very general and fundamental, we have trouble appreciating its profound effect. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, I love you. I used Plato\u2019s republic to prop open my door once. There really isn\u2019t much practical use to philosophy, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has no purpose. Philosophy gets you thinking for yourself. It takes you right out of your safe belief system ready to admit that really we know very little, but we make ourselves big in our minds. Philosophy dares to challenge the very way we interpret life, it asks the questions that lead to transformation. The philosopher dares to answer those questions by experimenting on his own mind and psyche. Philosophy may never get you a paycheck, but it will challenge you to live life to the full, in a way the rest of society cannot even imagine. To be a lover of wisdom does not mean, \u201coh, yeah, wisdom. I\u2019m a big fan.\u201d It means to seek answers with your very life, not to think interesting things from an armchair, or having arguments to show off how much you know. Philosophy is the generator of ideas, which in turn make the world move and evolve. If philosophy were a ship, then history would be its wake. Blessings! ",
