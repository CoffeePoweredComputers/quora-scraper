            "answer_text": "Not with any reason or observation of anything close, but there's a few I figure exist. One, as you approach the speed of light I imagine there's more forces which begin to play on you. Two, I don't think the variance in atomic clocks in orbit is directly because of velocity. I think the difference in velocity changes the effects of radiation from the sun which is responsible for atomic decay, hence change in atomic clock measurement. I think the sun is also responsible for two other separate and independent variables, other than raw erosion/ decay; time dilation and rate of progression through the timeline. Were it possible to have an objective reference to measure from, I believe it'd be possible to change the rate at which we travel through time (Not the direction), the duration of the experience of the same unit or segment of time (were you to measure it by some other means than atomic decay), and if we knew how I figure it'd be possible to slow the rate at which atoms decay, presuming the half life is partially dependent on some sort of bombardment of radiation from a celestial body, prolly the sun. Though there's probably some ultra-shielded sub-terranian base somewhere which either disproves my lattermost postulate, or suggests there's no earthbound way to shield from that magnitude of radiation .
