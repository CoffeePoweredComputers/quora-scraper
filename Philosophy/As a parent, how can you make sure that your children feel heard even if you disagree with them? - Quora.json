            "answer_text": "This is a great question! When you are having conversations with your kids it is vital they feel heard and understood even if you both remain at odds over a particular situation. First, hear them out and listen to their words, body language, and emotions. Second, let them know what you heard and ask if you are right in what you said. Next, validate their feelings and position and if you disagree explain why. Finally, the key is to ask them questions about why they take the position they do and get them to think through the position. You guide the conversation not control it okay. Kids need strong parents who can acknowledge their children\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and concerns while being respectful and having proper rules and boundaries in place. Try these things with your child and hopefully you will build lasting relationships through your conversations. ",

            "answer_text": "I made sure my children felt heard by teaching them to argue. There were values in my home that were not up for debate, but the reasons for the values were always open for discussion. There was also life philosophy and values to pass on to my children. Of course the kids were going to make their own choices about their life philosophy and values once they became adults, and knowing how to think and formulate an argument is important to deciding what values to embrace. I always talked to my kids regarding the happenings in the world, about my life choices and my philosophy on living, and I invited them to challenge my beliefs. I taught the kids to argue with facts and logic, if they want to tell me I should feel a certain way they need to tell me why. If it is regarding current events or politics we would go round and round, and I\u2019d compliment their strong arguments and pick at their weaker arguments. When we talked about family rules I would clearly be the final decision maker, but I would listen to their position on my rule, and if I couldn\u2019t come up with a logical objection, I\u2019d change my mind. I remember one of my daughter\u2019s friend\u2019s mother coming up to me at a school gathering to tell me a story. Her and her daughter were bickering in the car while they gave my daughter a ride home. My daughter said that she was glad she didn\u2019t have a mother. When this woman, a bit taken aback asked why, my daughter explained. She said she doesn\u2019t have to argue at home, \u201cmy dad tells me his opinion, then I tell him mine, then he tells me how it\u2019s going to be, no arguing.\u201d Both of my children are adults now and they are both in leadership positions. Knowing how to present an argument and defend it has been important to both of them as the pursue their careers, and I had a lot of fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: \u201cAs a parent, how can you make sure that your children feel heard even if you disagree with them?\u201d This is our family\u2019s Talking Bird.  But it doesn\u2019t have to be a bird - almost any object would do. You could substitute a wooden spoon, cushion, pencil or teddy bear. The point is how you use it. If people are upset and emotional, we will sit down together, and the bird gets passed around. The person holding the bird gets to speak, uninterrupted, about whatever is on their mind. The rules are that other people listen very carefully in silence and does not comment. When the bird-holder is done talking, the next person begins \u201cwhat I heard you say\u2026\u201d and restates as accurately as they can what the bird-holder said without adding anything. The bird holder gets to correct them if necessary until they feel fully understood. Then the bird is passed to the next person, who now gets a turn for speaking and can respond to what the first person said if they want to. When they\u2019re done, the next person starts \u201cWhat I heard you say\u2026.\u201d. Then, the bird gets passed to the next person and so forth. Repeat until everyone has had a turn. Continue for as many rounds as necessary until the issue has been resolved or at least everyone\u2019s point of view has been heard and understood. It is amazing how the \u201csimple\u201d but profound act of listening and feeling heard will dissolve conflict. Once the talking is done, it may still be that a grown up needs take responsibility for setting boundaries and deciding what happens in a given situation. However, they will do so with a full understanding of how other people, including children, feel about the situation - and quite possibly with fresh ideas and solutions. The talking bird (stick, wooden spoon, teddy bear, cushion) works really well for marital disagreements, for talking as a family about issues, or for any situation (perhaps less heated) where two or more people have a need to be heard. I can\u2019t actually remember where we learned this method, but we\u2019ve been using it for years. I realise that it is very, very, similar to the Native American traditions of using a talking stick. I\u2019ve added a couple of links you may enjoy. I promise you that this works, and that you can use it even with quite small children (pre-schoolers). It could very easily be adapted to use in workplaces, classrooms and clubs - anywhere people get together and have a need to be understood and valued. The whole group will benefit when everyone\u2019s thoughts, feelings and insights are shared. This is very respectful way of interacting, and I highly recommend it.

People feel heard when a person actually listens to them and is able to not only regurgitate what was said, but can also show a level of understanding what was said. You don\u2019t have to be a parent to get that. All you have to do is remember what it was like when adults didn\u2019t listen to you because you was \u201cjust a naive kid with nothing to worry about.\u201d The best way to make a kid feel heard is to treat them like a human being first before you treat them like a child. Don\u2019t denote any trouble or thought they voice simply because they\u2019re a child. That\u2019s how you get an introvert. They learn that people either judge or don\u2019t take them serious and start disliking people in general, so they keep to themselves unless they feel like you\u2019re someone they can open up to and be heard.

Lately, as my youngest is now 15, I have learned how important this is, even though I thought I was doing it all along. We are a bit of a \u2018sarcastic\u2019 family, so this has come as a bit of a struggle, as we never know when we are being serious or joking, so I do agree that affirmation of what the child says is important, even if you may not totally agree. There are kind ways of doing that without it turning into a debate, and conversing in a way that leads to an open minded discussion. Learning to agree to disagree is a skill I think the next generation will need a little more practice in then perhaps previous generations. ",
