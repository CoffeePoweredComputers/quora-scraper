            "answer_text": "This is such a big question with so many variables, I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t have more answers here. Either way, though, here are a couple factors that seem to have contributed: In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans. Up until that point it had been the Byzantine Empire, which was the last remnant of the Roman Empire. As such, it was an epicenter for learning and knowledge. When it fell, some of the scholars and more educated Christians who had been there fled to Roman, bringing with them some of their knowledge. The Plague decimated the population of Europe in the mid 1300s. This was a tragedy on a truly massive scale. However, as the plague subsided there was a severe labor shortage. That mean the people who were still around were in higher demand, and thus were able to earn more money for their work. At the same time, the price for things like land and food dropped. Some have argued that this eventually contributed to a growing merchant class, which had the money to fund things like art. With a smaller labor force, there was also a greater incentive for labor-saving scientific innovations. Necessity really is the mother of invention. ",

            "answer_text": "Medieval Europe was lacking in gold & silver coins to have a market economy. Then during the Crusades (1099\u20131291), gold & silver started flowing back to Europe again. But the biggest bonanza was the sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Soon the Republic of Florence began minting gold florins in 1252. The Republic of Venice minted the gold ducat in 1284. Then on Friday the thirteenth of October 1307. The leaders of the Knights Templar were arrested. Their banking services were sorely missed. Merchants began lobbying the Papacy to relax the rules on usury. That led to the rise of banking families like the Medici, Fuggers, Berenberg, Welser et al.   ",
