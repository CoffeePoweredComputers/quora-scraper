            "answer_text": "Hi, Questions about personality disorders are quite common on Quora, and I've answered quite a few. But people continue to be confused about this topic. And that's to be expected! Reading about personality disorders can only give people one perspective of PD's. PD's are very complex mental health conditions. I have found that most mental health workers also find it difficult to understand PD's and find it even more difficult to work with people diagnosed with PD's. So, I will try to include clinical examples of symptoms associated with BPD and NPD and the impact that they have on their sufferers. I will begin answering the question by writing briefly about PD's and how they are classified. I will then move on to describe BPD and then NPD. Finally, I will point out the main differences and similarities between BPD and NPD. If you would prefer a quick list of similarities and differences to glance at, please scroll down to the end of the answer. Both borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder are considered to be Low Prevalence disorders, meaning that less than 5% of the population have been diagnosed with these disorders. Prevalence rates may be slightly higher or lower depending on the country, state and area that you live in. Many people with PD diagnoses generally do not function at a very high level-well not for long anyway! Moreover, people have different and unique levels of BPD and NPD personality traits. The majority of people do not attract a PD diagnosis because they do not meet the DSM or ICD diagnostic criterion. The DSM-IV-TR system allowed an individual to be diagnosed on five domains or clusters. The DSM Multi-Axial diagnostic system group\u2019s personality disorders into clusters: BPD and NPD are considered to be Axis 2 disorders. The APA changed the diagnostic system in the most recent version of the DSM. The DSM-5 diagnostic system is now based on a single axis. The DSM-5 attempts to explain why they decided to change the Multi-Axial system in various sections of the manual. It also states that the new system is better than the previous Multi-Axial system! I don't agree with the APA assessment. I think the Multi-Axial diagnostic system was very helpful.  People diagnosed with Cluster B personality disorders are described as having the following traits: Dramatic,Overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behaviour,Impulse control and emotional regulation difficulties.American Psychiatric Association (2013). The DSM-5 Cluster B Personality Disorder Subtypes are as follows: Antisocial personality disorder,Borderline personality disorder,Histrionic personality disorder andNarcissistic personality disorder.American Psychiatric Association (2013).  I believe that it is important to note that a minority of people actually meet the criteria for an official BPD diagnosis. Instead, most people tend to have BPD traits. People with BPD/traits come from diverse backgrounds. However, the people with the disorder have a history associated with trauma and come from an unstable environment. Many people with BPD experience significant distress in adulthood including ongoing emotional instability. These symptoms can lead to a decline in cognitive functioning. People with few PD traits are better able to cope with life's challenges. However, many people with BPD traits experience prolonged periods of stress. Prolonged stress increases the frequency and intensity of BPD symptoms. People are not born with BPD or inherit it. The foundations of BPD can be traced back to the first few years of life (infancy and childhood). Most people with BPD were abandoned during their early years. These experiences result in significant trauma, disturbed attachment and inadequate bonding with the primary caregiver. Due to the above-mentioned experiences, people with BPD have to contend with trauma directly related to their psyche. They grow up feeling and believing that they are unlovable and unworthy. People with BPD fear attachment, abandonment and shame. The behaviours (acting out) that have famously characterized the disorder can be viewed as defensive in nature. Unfortunately, people diagnosed with BPD often have to endure trauma and other forms of abuse throughout their life. People with BPD have insecure attachment profiles that negatively impact their ability to form healthy relationships and interpret interactions. Attachment profiles or Internal Working Models of Attachment operate at an unconscious level making them very difficult to change. Although the diagnosis of BPD has a set of symptoms attributed to it, we cannot generalise and assume that everyone with BPD behaves the same way. Therefore, you can expect a vast array of behaviours to be associated with people diagnosed with BPD. On top of that very important point, many people that have been diagnosed with BPD also suffer from other co-morbid conditions. That is, someone with BPD can also suffer from an acute bout of depression or anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse and so on. Many clinicians confuse depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder with BPD. Differential and provisional diagnoses can be made by clinicians. Moreover, clinicians usually avoid making a BPD diagnosis in children and adolescents. According to the DSM-5 borderline PD is characterised by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, emotional regulation. Marked impulsivity begins by early adulthood and presents in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment,A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by extremes between idealization and devaluation (also known as \"splitting\"),Identity disturbance: Markedly or persistently unstable self-image or sense of self,Impulsive behaviour in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating),Recurrent suicidal behaviour, gestures, or threats, or self-harming behaviour,Emotional instability in reaction to day-to-day events (e.g., intense episodic sadness, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days),Chronic feelings of emptiness,Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights),Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms\u201d(American Psychiatric Association, 2013, pg.663).  The following section of this answer will attempt to put the above-mentioned BPD criteria in context. I will provide examples of symptoms and behaviours linked to the BPD diagnostic criteria. Impulsivity A person diagnosed with BPD may find themselves making snap impulsive decisions without stopping to consider the consequences (I.e. relationship failure, anger, self-harm). As a result of impulsive behaviour, many people with BPD place themselves at risk! Difficulty maintaining long term relationships People with BPD find it difficult to maintain stable, healthy long term relationships. One of the main reasons for this is because they tend to have a fear of abandonment. They may have been abandoned in the past, particularly during their early years. People with BPD often project and transfer their emotions from previous relationships onto people that they associate with. They interact & behave in a manner that people without BPD just cannot understand. Difficulty sitting with and expressing emotions/over-sensitivity Sensitivity plays a big part when it comes to strained relationships and emotions. People with BPD tend to be empathically attuned individuals. They time I to other people\u2019s strong emotions and have trouble regulating their own emotions. They tend to be overly sensitivity and most fear being abandoned by others. Idealising to devaluing people in their lives I have learnt that it is possible at any therapy session for a BPD client to move from idealization to devaluation very quickly (irrespective of what I say or do). That is, it\u2019s common for BPD clients to idealize a therapist, friend, or partner (basically placing them on a pedestal). Depending on the individual and their circumstances, the BPD person will then suddenly change the way that they feel and devalue the said person. They can change and become angry/expressing rage towards the same person (devaluation). This behaviour is defensive in nature and seems to prevent the person with BPD from developing strong attachments. People with BPD have difficulty coping with stress and understanding and controlling their emotions. They also tend to self-sabotage their lives (consciously & unconsciously). When their stress and anxiety levels get too high, the above-mentioned emotional and behavioural patterns occur. Narcissistic Personality Disorder The term narcissism has been around for almost two thousand years going back to Greek mythology. More recently, Freud wrote about narcissism in terms of his work with the ego and its relationship with the outside world. Like much of Freud's psychodynamic work and terms, the word narcissism is commonly used by our society. In fact, the term is used in the movies, beauty magazines and even politics. Narcissism is part of each person and in healthy individuals can be helpful in their interactions with others and for their self-esteem. In fact, for young people, narcissistic traits are quite common and natural (they are young, healthy, in their prime). According to the DSM-5, Narcissistic PD is characterised by the following criteria: a persistent manner of grandiosity,a continuous desire for admiration, along with a lack of empathy.The disorder presents during early adulthood and can occur in a variety of situations. An individual can be diagnosed with NPD if they meet 5 of the 9 following criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, pp. 669\u2013670). Moreover, in order for a person to meet the DSM-5 Narcissistic PD criteria they must meet 5 of the 9 criteria: \u201c1. A grandiose logic of self-importance 2. A fixation with fantasies of infinite success, control, brilliance, beauty, or idyllic love 3. A credence that he or she is extraordinary and exceptional and can only be understood by, or should connect with, other extraordinary or important people or institutions 4. A desire for unwarranted admiration 5. A sense of entitlement 6. Interpersonally oppressive behaviour 7. No form of empathy 8. Resentment of others or a conviction that others are resentful of him or her 9. A display of egotistical and conceited behaviours or attitudes.\u201d (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, pp. 669\u2013670). When Does Narcissism Become Problematic Narcissism becomes a problem when young people do not grow out of their strong narcissistic personality traits. Moreover, narcissists are created by a particular pattern of parenting whereby their caregivers only reinforce the child's accomplishments and significant achievements. Pathological narcissism develops when individuals require constant reinforcement, approval and confirmation from others about their self-worth and develop an unhealthy obsession. At the same time, the narcissist tends to show disregard and disrespect for other people\u2019s feelings. In fact, they prey on others, enjoy it and show no remorse. Narcissists often come across as confident, excessively grand or ambitious to most people. Although this is really a cover for insecurity, most people are often attracted to these traits and desire to have them. A person with NPD can be triggered by others (they may become angry, depression or show rage) if they are denied narcissistic supply (if they do not get enough attention or reinforcement about how good they are!). If this happens to a narcissist for a prolonged period of time, they tend to decompensate. That is, they may abuse drugs and become depressed, distant and removed. Some narcissists get so infuriated that they have bouts of \u201cnarcissistic rage\u201d. During this episode they abuse and belittle their target. Or they might demand and insist that they be treated differently to others (I.e. special VIP treatment). Hollywood stars, the rich and famous all proudly display narcissistic and hedonistic traits. In fact, when the media report about the rich and famous they always refer to the person\u2019s wealth, lavish lifestyle, above average looks, very attractive partners, how skillful they are and so on. As a consequence, many people are attracted to this type of personality. In fact, people try to emulate their heroes and wish that they could be like them. In clinical populations, only about 2% to 16% of people are diagnosed with this disorder. Many more people have significant NPD traits! In fact, there is significant evidence that the incidence of narcissism in our society has increased substantially over the last two decades.  Case study of Narcissistic Rage A former work colleague of mine (Mr X) with significant NPD traits told me a story. He double parked outside an expensive and busy Asian restaurant in the middle of the CBD and went into the restaurant expecting to dine with his partner without having made a booking. Mr X requested a table of his choosing and told one of the workers that he wanted his car to be valet parked. The worker told him that they do not have valet parking and that the restaurant is fully booked. It was at this point that Mr X went into a narcissistic rage. Mr X screamed at the top of his lungs \"don't you know who I am\" and started banging the front counter with his fists and palms and insisted on speaking with the manger. Once the manger arrived, he abused her and her staff for their incompetence. Mr X insisted that he and his partner be seated at a table that was clearly marked as \"booked\" and that staff members park his car for him. The owner succumbed to his demands and seated him at the already booked table of his choice and parked his car for him. Within minutes he was laughing and in a victorious mood. By the time the entree had arrived Mr X was acting as if nothing had happened. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) BPD and NPD actually have a rate of co-occurrence of about 25 percent (Greenstein, 2017).  Similarities between BPD and NPD include: Both are considered to be a life-long disorders,Both disorders are characterised by a fear of abandonment, andA need for constant attention,People with BPD and NPD do not respond well to treatment using psychotropic medication,A lack of concern for how their behaviour impacts others,Both require long term psychotherapy with limited chances of change or success compared to other disorders like depression and anxiety,A constant struggle with work, family, and social relationships,Displaying overly emotional, erratic, or self-dramatizing behaviours.(Difference Between, 2018 & Greenstein, 2017).  Differences between BPD and NPD include: More men tend to be narcissists, while more women tend to be diagnosed with BPD,People with NPD expect others\u2019 lives to revolve around them, while those with BPD will devote their lives to another person,People with BPD will frantically try to avoid what they consider to be abandonment, while people with NPD are more likely to abandon others,Narcissists believe they are special and that they can only be understood by other high-status people. In contrast people with BPD feel misunderstood and mistreated.(Difference Between, 2018 & Greenstein, 2017).  Empathy in people with NPD & BPD The following section of this answer will focus on empathy. Many people struggle to understand empathy. I will define the process of empathy and clarify whether people with NPD and BPD have the ability to empathise with others. Empathy Empathy can simply be defined as having the ability to share and understand the emotions of others. The level of empathy a person feels towards others is influenced by their genes, the sum of their experiences and their brain. That is, certain areas of our brain have been associated with our ability to empathise with others. Narcissism and Empathy The commonly held belief that people with narcissistic personality disorder are not capable of empathy is incorrect. They have the ability to empathise and understand other people's emotional state. People with NPD cannot experience positive empathy or emotional attachment to others. In fact, people with NPD have good cognitive empathic abilities. They need empathic abilities to better understand what their potential victim is feeling so that they can take advantage of them. Borderline personality disorder and Empathy In his article, Fertuck (2009) suggests that people with BPD are capable of experiencing positive empathy. In fact, he states that when they are not experiencing significant emotional stress, they have an enhanced ability to tune into other people's emotions based on only eye contact. In contrast, clinician's and authors like Shari Schreiber state that people with BPD are incapable of impulse control, lack remorse and the capacity for empathy. I believe that some people with BPD are capable of empathy and indeed positive empathy. I also believe that other people with BPD are not capable of establishing positive empathy. I hope that my answer was not too lengthy and you found it informative. BPD and NPD are complex conditions. Kamal References: American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Personality disorders.

            "answer_text": "This is a very very good question, The main factor that underscores both disorders is insecurity. As a result of the pervasiveness of insecurity for both Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), those who experience these disorders subsequently experience patterns of instability and destructive relationships. Ultimately the issue of abandonment is a dominant recurring theme. Similarity: NPD and BPD experience relationship problems Differences: BPD acts out their intense fears of abandonment to such an extent that they drive someone away. NPD more likely to be the one abandoning as they (this is the simplified version) would rather abandoning before someone has the chance to abandon them. As such this allows a person with NPD reinforce and/or their appearance of superiority. Those with BPD and NPD tens to spend a significant amount of time throughout their lives in isolation and as such will often struggle to hold a job or career due to the inherent interpersonal challenges, impulsivity, difficulty in regulating moods, and/or arrogance. These factors can create a somewhat of a domino effect so that those with either BPD or NPD are at a significantly l high risks of co-occurring disorders, such as (and not limited to) depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar, substance use disorders, eating disorders, and PTSD. Differences: NPD - Presentation of Symptoms Distinct Lack of empathy for othersConsistent boasting about their superior traits and accomplishmentsInsulting others or otherwise making themselves look better at the expense of othersFlattering or criticizing\u2014depending on whether others flatter or criticize in returnExtreme Sensitivity response to criticism or constructive criticism or potential criticismDominating interactions and relationshipsAloof and distant in intimate relationshipsContinual need attention and flatteryFantasising about power, fame, and wealth - delusion thinkingMoodinessImpatienceEnvy, resentment, and revengeDifficulty adapting to changeDifferences: BPD - Presentations of Symptoms Desperate attempts to avoid abandonment either perceived as real or imaginedConsistent dependent and clingy behaviorsCycling between idealization and devaluation of another in a relationshipMaintains an unstable sense of identity and self-imageDemonstration of Impulsive behavioursEpisodic emotional instability, including anxiety or irritabilityFeelings of low, empty, unmotivated, lethargyEpisodes of intense anger and outbursts - tantrums, ragesDissociative Symptoms which includes disconnection from reality and suspicion, and paranoiaSelf-harming behaviours as well as suicidal ideation and attemptsBoth BPD and NPD actually have a rate of co-occurrence of approximately 25 percent. Treatment for both BPD and NPD Centers around psychotherapy, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Additionally pharmacological intervention by means of antidepressants and/or anti-anxiety medications can be used in the treatment/management so as to treat co-occurring and recurring symptoms of depression, anxiety, as well as additional mental health disorders. Treatments typically involve individual therapy sessions, group therapy, or as an inpatient t a residential treatment facility for personality disorders. ",
