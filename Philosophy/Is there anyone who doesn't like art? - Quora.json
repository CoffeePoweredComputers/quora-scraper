            "answer_text": "I lived and breathed art for years, as a curator and as a full-time artist, and I've come to the conclusion that bespoke art - and the market - and the dealer/buyer conspiracy - will eat you up and spit you out if you aren't endowed with the hide of a rhino and the ego of a sociopath. That end of art I do not like, but the act of creation of anything, be it a pure note of music or the perfect sentence, or the surface of a canvas that speaks to the observer, whatever - that I like. That is art. ",

            "answer_text": "Art (that is, valuable painting and sculpture housed in museums and sold in the big art galleries) can seem very elitist and irrelevant to the majority of people, I think.  One has to be taught how to like Art, which involves spending a lot of energy appreciating OPV (Other People's Values--generally, those of people who lived a long time ago).   Globally speaking, the Art World is a kind of subculture when you really think about it (albeit one that generates loads of money).  I'm sure that's annoying and deeply unlikeable to many many people.  That said, even those not into so-called High Culture are probably into some kind of art that speaks to them. A kind of art that demonstrates ideas important to that person or group.  Think, for example, of the kind of religious art  in the handbooks that we get from folks who knock at on the door, wanting to discuss salvation. Or that graffiti of a dead guy from the neighborhood, whom the artist hopes will \"R.I.P. \"  Or a patriotic war memorial. That art has a use in its community, conforms to a certain aesthetic, and has value to many  people.  Many might argue, \"But that's not art.\" I'd answer that, such art, which speaks to the values of a sub-culture or dominant culture, is more likable than most Art World \"masterpieces\".    I guess what I'm trying to say is, at the very least, everyone must  see a use for, and thus \"like\" some art to some degree. ",
