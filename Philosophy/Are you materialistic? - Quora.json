            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t consider myself to be really materialistic. Whenever I spend money on something, it always has some degree of utility or convenience that justifies the cost of paying for it. For example, I am on track to purchase more cell phones in a single year than I have owned in all previous years of my life combined. Next year, I might also do the same with laptops and desktops if the funds are there. There\u2019s actually a good reason for doing so. The first reason would be that I needed phones with the longest battery lifespans/capacity. So I bought one phone and locked it to one of my hometown\u2019s carriers (which at the time had the best plans and prices). Now that their competitor is offering better plans (for some cases which will make economic sense), I needed another phone with an even longer battery life which would work on their LTE band (which my other phone can\u2019t work on even if I got it unlocked). I\u2019m also now in the business of developing my own mobile apps and testing them out on different platforms that my customers will be using. So I purchased other phones with different operating systems like iOS and Ubuntu Touch. That\u2019s 4 phones in one year, two of which are for personal use and another two which are for testing apps. They\u2019re not insanely expensive stuff though. They\u2019re the cheapest models with all the minimum features I need for the purpose which they were purchased for. Here are some other things I\u2019d do if I had the money: If I were to buy a car (with money not being an issue), I\u2019d purchase a Volkswagen XL1 for environmental reasons and not because it\u2019s insanely expensive.As for owning a house, well I\u2019d try to make it as small as possible and I\u2019d build it to be as strong, low-maintenance and energy-efficient as possible. That will cost a bit extra, but it will be worth it in my opinion.I\u2019d also hire one or several people to do all my chores, run minor errands, cook and drive me around, etc. So that way, I could focus more on my work and ideas.I\u2019d buy that Tempur Pedic mattress.I\u2019d fly coach on short trips and only use business or first class on extremely long trips (exceeding 10 hours) where I\u2019m expected to sleep on the plane overnight. I\u2019d only use private charters if I needed to access a remote or inaccessible location for a really good reason.For hotels, my standards remain the same. I\u2019ll stay pretty much anywhere as long as I have reliable power, running water, adequate heating/cooling, no bedbugs, no rusty fixtures etc. If the place is cheap enough, I might not mind if the wifi sucks. I\u2019ll just get an unlimited 4G mobile plan for the week or month with some of the money I\u2019d save from staying at that hotel (as opposed to one of the more expensive ones). I actually did this on one of my recent work-related trips.Essentially, every dollar I spend will have some degree of justifiable convenience or utility. I\u2019ll never purchase something frivolously for the sake of purchasing it to impress others or whatnot. I don\u2019t pander to shallowness nor avarice. I also don\u2019t judge people by what material possessions they have or don\u2019t have. ",

            "answer_text": "I definitely have expensive tastes. I cheer myself up during tedious hours in hospitals by scrolling down Violet Grey and The Line, ogling hundred-dollar bath oils and inordinately expensive bath salts that\u2019s inordinately expensive because apparently they smell like rotenburo air. I roll my eyes whenever someone on reddit bashes Tatcha oil cleanser with the \u201cthere are sooo many other cheaper products, like this and that and so and so and as a wise person you should definitely buy the cheaper one\u201d argument and inwardly scream how they are just not the same, duh I clip and save pictures of beautiful homes and expensive makeup and dresses and when my parents one day make me have a big Chinese wedding, I can\u2019t say there isn\u2019t a part of me that itches for a swarovski clad wedding ball gown. But what\u2019s weird is that I\u2019m actually really relaxed about money. It\u2019s the least of my considerations. The numbers are just not that important to me. I make quite a lot of money now, at least way more than I actually need, and although I get that exhilarating \u201cka-ching!\u201d sensation every time I tab my earnings, it just\u2026 isn\u2019t that interesting to me. I\u2019ve been trying to adult and ask my brother things about wise budgeting and investment practices; but while all the money multiplying and filling portfolios excites him, it doesn\u2019t really do that for me. I dated a person way more financially challenged than me for years, and his financial difficulties never mattered for one second. I don\u2019t actually mind living frugally and considered that back when I still thought of settling down with him. I don\u2019t know- I guess I\u2019m as relaxed about money getting in as much as money getting out. I don\u2019t really care how much money I get, and when I do have money I can be a generous spender, but when I don\u2019t have money, then well I don\u2019t mind it all that much. I UNDERSTAND ALL THIS IS SO UN-ADULT And I\u2019ll try to do better and actually comprehend the value of money. But it\u2019s just something that feels utterly foreign to me, something I don\u2019t enjoy at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say I\u2019m pretty prudent when it comes to materialism. I don\u2019t cherish things for the sake of having them, but I do appreciate quality where relevant. For example, my work bag. I went through several backpacks as a middle and high-schooler because they would just get work out with all the books and the load on the bag and straps day to day. You could rely on a bag lasting maybe 2 years. Then came work. I needed a bag to put my stuff in . I got a targus shoulder bag. \u201cWhatever, its functional and in my budget and is pretty non-descript. I\u2019m not trying to make a fashion statement.\u201d I went through three of those in about 8 years. After the get worn out, but are still working they look sort of sad and don\u2019t make the best impression if you are walking into a meeting from the airport. So, I decided I wanted to buy one more bag. One that was functional, was still understated, but would still look professional. I also wanted it to not look sad as it aged, but age appropriately, and would age over the next 30\u201340 years of my career. It turns out those kinds of bags are expensive. REALLY expensive. I decided leather was the only option. Tumi\u2019s ballistic material even wears out (but I hear the have a good repair policy) and leather would also have a little more personality than black ballistic material. So, I picked out a bag. the exact bag, with the exact color and size and put it on my wish list. My parents got it for me as my b-school graduation present. It continues to be the perfect bag going on 2 years. I take care of it. It takes care of me, and should for the rest of my life, as long as I don\u2019t loose it. Now, the wishlist. I have a set of items I have identified as \u201clast purchases\u201d this includes things like a backpacking bag, a pair of black dress shoes (not for every day work wear), etc. Things I can invest in, will reliably do what they are supposed to do as long as I take care of it. This list isn\u2019t necessarily all premium items. For example, for our new car, we bought a used Subaru Forester. 2 years old. its an incredibly reliable car and should be in shape to give to our son in 16 years if we take care of it. Something every new driver should have - a well-used, reliable, safe car that doesn\u2019t scream \u201cmy daddy got me a BMW - look at me!\u201d So yeah, I\u2019m materialistic, but in the value sense of the material goods. I hate cheaply made stuff that I will just have to continue to replace at annoyingly short intervals. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m rather collectivist when it comes to standard of living so it\u2019s hard to say how materialistic I am. I don\u2019t care much about having my own personal possessions that increase my quality of life, such as a large house or a car, I\u2019d rather live in an environment that offers a good standard of living - I am a very urban person, I like living fairly centrally in a city with top-notch public transport, with a lot of culture, amenities, free wi-fi, a good cycling infrastructure, good maintenance of the city infrastructure, parks, festivals, a well-equipped public library, walkable distances etc. Living in such a city is expensive in itself, so it\u2019s not like the lifestyle I aspire is something anyone could easily afford, but you still don\u2019t own a lot in terms of material possessions, I would rather have the community offer such a good quality of life that it\u2019s rather expensive to be even able to even participate in the community so you don\u2019t even need a lot of possessions on your own. I\u2019d rather pay a a lot of taxes and pay a fairly high rent to live in an apartment that\u2019s just large enough for me to live fairly comfortably (say, about 40m\u00b2) if I benefit from living in a community with a high standard of living and a lot of services that make your life more comfortable. I do enjoy some activities that cost money, such as traveling or skiing. I would like to own a real piano some day. I think I\u2019m willing to spend some money on an expensive bed, mattresses and pillows because a good night\u2019s sleep makes such an important difference. Sometimes I like to cook with somewhat fancy ingredients and I buy a lot of books and occasionally I\u2019ll buy a video game. I\u2019ve always traveled very low-budget and low-comfort, both in terms of means of transport and in terms of accomodation, and the reason was mostly that I could never afford anything else, but to be honest, it never bothered me all that much and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d spend more money on this if I had more disposable income. Even when I slept in a crappy bunk bed in a hostel with 11 strangers in the same room, I rarely felt a desperate wish to have more money so I could finally upgrade my traveling. Sometimes I even consider it a fun challenge to find cheap deals and clever traveling hacks for low-budget traveling. But maybe this will change as I get older and have less tolerance for low-comfort services. On the other hand, I\u2019ve always felt very limited in the possible destinations - I could just never afford to travel outside Europe, so with more disposable income I\u2019d definitely embrace the opportunity to travel the world. But: I am very proud of being one of only 100,000 people in the world who own a copy of the limited collector\u2019s edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard that was sold on Amazon back in 2008 and all copies were sold after a few hours and I was fast enough to buy one for what was a fortune to me. This is the snobbiest, most materialistic thing I\u2019ve done in my life, I guess. A few years ago when I was a tourist in Amsterdam I met another tourist from Ireland who also owned a copy and I instantly bonded with her over this :) ",

I work from here often, my kids don\u2019t go to school, we have a BBQ every week, I swim every morning, so it\u2019s a luxury I really take advantage of. Here\u2019s the living room\u2026 A decent motor. In Malaysia, that means US$150k for a new one every 6\u20138 years. My wife is perhaps the least materialistic person I\u2019ve ever met - she refuses to let me buy her a car for over $30k and won\u2019t change it until it\u2019s destroyed.Business class flights.3 or 4 trips every year to five-star beach resorts in Malaysia with my family. We all work hard. That\u2019s how we chill.Generally have enough to spend, but nothing extravagant. A MacBook every couple of years, clothes from the likes of Gap or Gant, eat out at decent but not posh restaurants, etc\u2026It is materialistic of me that I wanted the above 5 a lot. But it\u2019s certainly not beyond what most would expect of me. I don\u2019t want a yacht, holiday homes, more than one car at a time, fancy food, expensive watches, an Ambani home. And I might be giving up the motor, reducing the list to 4, if Uber can reduce the waiting times. I really aspire to live a simple life, I want to free myself from material wants. Giving up a car would be a big one for me as I\u2019ve always loved cars. I have this huge conflict in my head. Between what I do and what I know is right. Finally, and I feel this is important in answering the question, I am very conscious of the fact that I\u2019m going to be dead soon (<60 years) and it will all go. I realise, and more consciously than most, it\u2019s all kind of meaningless. So am I materialistic? Yes, I am. But I feel I\u2019m mostly not. Perhaps I think too much\u2026 [BTW if I give anything to charity, and I\u2019m not saying I do, I\u2019m not open to discussing it!] ",

            "answer_text": "I thought it was bad to have a lot of money, until someone reminded me that with a lot of money I could do a lot of good, and that was what the concept of the Benevolent Jew was all about. It\u2019s good to have money because it helps you do good for the community and charities. (Of course you can help with time and skill as well.) I also discovered that having a lot of money did not equal being materialistic. I had not separated the concepts in my mind, leaving them both rather murky. I also had to tease apart the idea that you could do important things without money, with the reality that money makes important things easier to do. I did most of the things I\u2019ve done in my life with very little money. I\u2019m not materialistic - owning things doesn\u2019t mean all that much to me, although there are a few things that are important to me to have. I do like more money than not, though. I like the ability to do more good than my time and skill alone can. ",

            "answer_text": "Habib Fanny A2A'd me this. Good thing he requested this answer to everyone, otherwise I'll be astounded how fast he sees right through me. I'm materialistic enough to make career plans according to the monetary compensation, but not yet materialistic enough to date a person merely for the money. Here is what I, a professional cynic, think about money. Hell, a professor once said I was the No.1 cynic in the entire school. I'm not always so materialistic though. I was very idealistic before I left college. I dreamed of changing the world. After I graduated, I found I actually couldn't even change my balance in my banking account, I couldn't afford to see a doctor and I had to think twice before buying a yogurt. This kind of life sucks. Therefore, money is the No.1 thing that would provide me with a sense of security. A strong sense of security. Nothing else. I don't really believe in love or friendship, especially in the adult world at workplace where money is involved. I enjoy buying stuff, especially when I'm stressed out. I resort to retail therapy. Sadly,I can't afford much right now and my bank account balance stresses me out the most. I enjoy buying stuff and paying for dinner for my significant other. My life long dream is to hand over my credit card and tell my SO \u201cBuy whatever you want. The PIN code is 1234.\u201d/ I don't have luxurious hobbies though, but I guess it doesn't hurt to pick up one or two like golf or photography. I long for a materialistically wealthy life, with an apartment on the top floor of a skyscraper in the center of Chicago or Manhattan, a maid to regularly clean the apartment for me, nice furniture, a large TV and acoustic instruments for watching horror movies. Besides, in today's world, having a lot of money means you're successful, and others look up to successful people. If you want your voice to be heard and you want people to take you seriously, be what they consider as successful first. Otherwise, why would they bother to talk to you? At the end of the day, building relationship in the adult world is all about transaction. You have something I want, and I offer something in return. That being said, I actually do have some pursuit outside of money. I want to be an LGBT advocate and a public defender at a state government, neither of which pays well. But I'm doing everything I can to prepare for it, in case opportunity shows up. My theory is \u2014 earn money and consolidate your position in the society first, get some savings and then you can do whatever you like! Besides, it's a terrible idea to make what you like as your first job because your passion would burn out fast during the process of adapting to the professional world and day-to-day grinding over the desk. Yeah, overall I'm a very shallow person. People usually would be surprised by how materialistic I am, given that I have three academic degrees at a young age. Well, I did that because Asians tend to look up to people graduated from fancy schools in the US, and partly because my parents required me to. Hell, I think this answer sounds extremely obnoxious.

            "answer_text": "Yes i am. I love material possessions. Actually, my dog Rummy does more. Like this expensive toy he adores.  He can try his might but he can't destroy it. And if you did not know, Rottweilers have the highest bite force of any dog breed.  But it doesn't end there. I have to buy him more of those to satisfy his materialistic needs.  See the tail wag in the above picture? It's disgusting. He does tell me he loves those toys and wants more of them.  And i have to oblige. Materialism is addictive you know.  And that's not all. He will play with a goddamn table lamp if he fancies that.  There's no end to these materialistic pursuits. Like how he recently coaxed me into buying him shoes.  Come on now. Really? Now dogs want to be sneakerheads? Here's the truth. His feet have chronic infection. It's right under his paws actually. That means it's terribly painful for him to walk when the infection flares up. It's straight up bleeding. He lies on the floor a full day or two, when the infection is real bad. I've tried multiple vets and the vets have tried all sorts of medicines. Blood tests, x-rays, injections. The infection is persistent. It can be controlled and managed, but it hasn't gone away, yet. The shoes protect his feet from bleeding. These materialistic things provide him relief. They enable his walks, and he loves walks. His collection of toys keeps him busy and entertained. Dogs and kids are alike. They get bored easy. And they love their toys. You see, being materialistic is judged in today's world. Spirituality is overrated. The fact is, human beings have been materialistic from the very beginning. Tools, ornaments, totems, better homes, vehicles, thrones \u2014 the list is endless. Material possessions help elevate our life experiences, if we know what we're doing. The trick is to maintain balance and not lose track of the raw natural world. Rummy loves his friends as much as his toys, maybe even more.    There have been times when he clearly communicated to me he wants to spend the night outside. He hangs out with his street buddies and returns home at 3am or 4am, and bangs on the gates. I let him in. I'm happy he knows his priorities in life. On a side note, his materialism has reached a point where he thinks every Amazon package is just for him.  As for me, i love being able to buy the cameras and phones that help me capture these memories. And share them. I also love walking into the store to buy biscuits for my other friends.  ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no, but to some extent I am, despite my claim to the contrary. There are varying degrees of materialism. On one end of the spectrum are those whose identities are wrapped up in their possessions. They are constantly looking to acquire more so as to validate themselves and keep up with others they view as competitors. Rich or poor. Towards the other end are people who own nothing whatsoever. Perhaps not even their freedom. Residing on this end of the spectrum does not disqualify you from being materialistic. These individuals may greatly desire material goods. Their situation makes it difficult to acquire them though. Also at this extreme are people who have nothing and do not want anything. They\u2019re perfectly happy living this way, seeing no need to buy things they have no use for. In my case, I don\u2019t want to have many possessions, but I have far more than most. What I do have is what I need and use on a regular basis. It\u2019s not wrong to be on one end or the other. Owning stuff isn\u2019t a problem in and of itself. The problem arises when people become overly attached. More value is placed on these possessions than on actual people. What\u2019s worrying is this trend appears to be on the rise and is unlikely to be going anywhere in the near future. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really consider myself terribly materialistic. A lot of the things people get with their money and wealth just kind of elude me. I don\u2019t give a shit about having a nice car. If it gets me reliably from Point A to Point B, that\u2019s good enough for me. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a Porsche 911, or a Geo Metro. I don\u2019t give a shit about having a big house. I live in a basement suite with my wife. It\u2019s a bit tight, but I\u2019m perfectly fine with it. Could probably use a bit more storage space, but I definitely don\u2019t need a gigantic house, and will never own one regardless of how much money I make. Same with other shit like big screen TVs, or nice watches, or whatever. The only possession I have I spend decent money on is my PC. I\u2019m a big gamer, and so I invest in a nice PC to play those games. If I won the lottery, I\u2019d buy the best PC I could, and likely put the rest away in savings. That would be my \u2018splurge.\u2019 What I do care about is financial stress. I want to make more money not so I can buy really big and awesome possessions, but so I can stop worrying about money. I hate worrying whether or not we can afford to buy all our groceries. I hate seeing half my paycheque disappear instantly paying student loans. I hate knowing that my car needs repairs, but I can\u2019t afford them, and have to live in worry that it\u2019s going to break down at some point and I won\u2019t be able to get to work. I hate being completely unable to put away a single dime towards savings. So I don\u2019t consider myself materialistic, not in the usual sense of wanting all sorts of fancy things. I want money to be free of financial stress and worry, not to get the latest iPhone. ",

I am a nature fanatic. Does that mean I am not materialistic? No it doesn\u2019t. If I am a nature lover, I want a house at the beach, on the mountains, a tree house, a camp in the desert, and even an underwater house if possible. I want to have a place where I can peacefully retire in solitude after a stressful week. Unfortunately, I am not a saint, and just forests don\u2019t work for me. I like forests, but then, I don\u2019t want to lose out on the facilities I have in the city. At the end of the day, you need to buy things. You need money, home, cars, clothes, shoes, watches and what not. \u201cRoti, kapda, makaan\u201d is a bare necessity, not a satisfactory state of fulfillment. I have not met any person who is not materialistic in the 21 years I have spent in this world. People are materialistic about different things. Some dream about fashion, some about tech, some about cars, some about plain wealth. But everyone dreams to achieve something materialistic, and that is what keeps us going. This very trait is what drives the develooment of humans. Just imagine, if everyone was satisfied on the earth, how would it look like? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Most definitely, I am extremely materialistic, and it\u2019s a character flaw I need to work on. I like having money, I like seeing a large balance in my checking account, I like investing. I like building assets, I like reading about investing, I like saving money. I remember having this be a major problem. As a little kid, I remember the teacher telling us the legend of Hannah and her Seven Sons. \u201cNow, girls, would you pick God or a roomful of toys?\u201d the teacher asked. I raised my hands. \u201cI want the toys.\u201d And I did. God didn\u2019t matter anything to me. Everyone else seemed to want to sacrifice, and I just wanted those toys. I got teased for that. When I was in 7th grade, we were told that a great rabbi could have gone into business, but chose a life of community supported scholarship instead. And I argued that made him a leech on society, since he was dependant on others for support, and that money was all that was mattered. \u201cIf you are relying on my tax dollars to find God, you\u2019re not much of a person,\u201d I said. My teacher asked me what money would do in the World to Come. I asked her what the World to Come had to do with not starving to death. She sent me to the principal, who let me sit and study in the library. I\u2019m very into the material, even if I appreciate the more ephemeral today. One of my motivational quotes is this. \u201cIf you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented.\u201d\u2015 Stephen King AKA, if you can\u2019t produce some sort of material value with it\u2026.you need to examine the value. Now, it still might be worth it, but you do need to check. ",

            "answer_text": "A few years ago, my mother broke her back and had to be operated. It was a major surgery on her spine and lucky for us, I had a job and all three of us were adequately insured by my then employer. Had it not been for that coverage, we would have gone bonkers and I would have been writing an answer on how to deal with personal debts. I\u2019m materialistic to an extent where I need loads of money, money that I can pull out any time to provide best-in-class healthcare to my aging uglies, without having to worry about making a huge dent on my personal savings.I vividly remember what it was like to be poor - less food, sometimes no food, improper medical treatments at government hospitals that possibly fucked up my hearing, quarrels, more quarrels and so on, so obviously I\u2019ve grown more materialistic than someone who grew up in a middle class family. I would like my parents to have a comfortable life. Not a beach house or a farm house or an island of that sort, and they wouldn\u2019t like all that anyway, but a nice house with an open balcony and a cozy swing which my father can use to sit and read his morning and evening papers, while my mother serves him his hot tea and sits aside to catch up on daily gossips.We currently own a hatchback. A tiny one at that. The lowest possible model in the entire range sort of thing. That\u2019s what we could afford. In all honesty, that\u2019s what the bank actually approved of. Though I have now closed the loan entirely a couple years back, every time I or someone else makes as tiny a scratch as possible, my heart rips out of my chest and cries. Because ONLY I know how much blood and sweat went into buying this thing. I\u2019m materialistic to a point where I want to be able to afford repairs or worse case, replace this tiny one with another tiny one without as much as batting an eye.I don\u2019t like swanky shit. I\u2019m not a traveler. All the cool things people do these days, I don\u2019t think its for me. I don\u2019t want to be a vagabond or something of that sort roaming from one place to another. I\u2019m glad for people who like it, but no, its just not for me. I don\u2019t want to bungee jump from Macau Tower or ski in Switzerland. I don\u2019t even like cold weather. I\u2019m currently working on my Table Tennis topspins and I spend about 2000 Rupees (around $30) a month on my coaching and I\u2019m very happy with what I currently do. But, I want to be able to afford a nice holiday even if I really don\u2019t want to travel anywhere. The feeling that I can but I don\u2019t want to, is always better than, I can\u2019t but I don\u2019t want to either. You get me?My family prospers only because of the education we had. If with so little opportunities provided to us having been born in a poor family from a developing country, we could come thus far and become something of substance, I wonder what we could do if we receive the best in class education from a developed nation such the USA. And I want to be able to afford THAT! And that without having to beg or rob our banks here. I think that\u2019s as materialistic as I can get.",

            "answer_text": "I go through phases. As a child and teen, I was pretty frugal and liked to save money. It helped that I wasn\u2019t particularly into clothes and my parents bought me the necessities. I did buy a car in high school, but I saved up and paid cash. My mom paid the insurance. I sold it during my freshman year of university. In college I started to get more interested in clothes, accessories and electronics. I bought a Macbook and a pair of Uggs (don\u2019t judge, they were all the rage at the University of Oregon in the early 2010s). But generally, I didn\u2019t have much money left over after paying for living expenses. I got my first \u201cadult\u201d job in March 2014. My husband\u2019s freelance business took off around the same time. That was the first time in my life that I had significant disposable income (although not as much as I had expected). Luckily, we didn\u2019t go crazy. We stuck with sensible cars (Kia Rios) and paid them both off. We didn\u2019t buy a bunch of liabilities. We paid down my student loans. But we did move into a very nice two-bedroom townhouse and spend a couple thousand on furniture. We had this enormous cream-colored sectional sofa that was amazing to lounge on. We took a few short but expensive vacations. I would go shopping a lot on the weekends. Partly because I didn\u2019t want to keep wearing my high school and college clothes, but mostly because I was stressed. The pressure from my job followed me into the weekends. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about this or that project. So I made a lot of small compensatory purchases to make myself feel better. That, of course, didn\u2019t work. By 24 I was in the grips of a full-blown quarter-life crisis. I had the whole package\u2014a college degree, a good job in my field (not easy for a languages major), a happy marriage, a beautiful home, the latest iPhone, 15 days of paid vacation a year and a higher income than my parents had ever earned. And I was constantly anxious and miserable. I felt trapped in a cycle of working and spending. It was as if someone else had planned out my life for me when I wasn\u2019t looking. The apartment, the furniture, the new clothes no longer brought me any pleasure. They felt like chains that kept me bound to a job I had come to hate. We messed up our taxes and wrote a $6000 check to the IRS. We got into a dispute with the manager of our fancy apartment complex. I couldn\u2019t quit my job\u2014the rent was too high. My job and lifestyle were eating me alive. I started feeling sick and panicky on Sunday nights. By fall of 2015, I knew something had to change. My husband and I came up with a plan\u2014I\u2019d apply to a teaching assistantship in France, he\u2019d apply to grad school in Ohio. We both got accepted and started planning our big move East in summer 2016. That was my anti-materialistic phase. We could only take what would fit in the Kias, so I started getting rid of All The Things. I watched minimalism videos on YouTube. I used the KonMari method of decluttering (from the Japanese book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up). Marie Kondo suggests holding every possession in your hands and getting rid of any that don\u2019t \u201cspark joy\u201d. So that\u2019s what I did. I gave away half my clothes and piles of random things from around the house. It was liberating. I wanted time and experiences, not a 9-to-6 and stuff. (For the record\u2014there are a few select items I wish I\u2019d kept, like my turtleneck shirt and snow pants. But I cannot remember most of the stuff I gave away.) Almost two years later, I\u2019ve moderated a little bit. I never buy things just for the sake of shopping and I still value experiences over things, but I do get new clothes and household items from time to time. We\u2019re planning on buying a condo early next year. But we still drive the Kias, and we paid cash for our older iPhones. I\u2019m really grateful that we didn\u2019t buy any big money pits during our materialistic phase. It was hard enough to escape the work-and-consume cycle as it was. I\u2019m much, much happier now that I have ample free time and can set my own work schedule. I might get more materialistic in the future, but only if I could easily afford it without going back to a cubicle farm. Even then, I would only buy stuff to add joy to my life, not to create a \u201clifestyle\u201d to impress people I don\u2019t like. My quarter-life crisis taught me that consumption doesn\u2019t lead to happiness. Anyone who tells you it does is probably trying to sell you something. ",

            "answer_text": "Like many, I try to make as much money as possible and spend the least amount as I can, but RARELY at the expense of comfort. Although, I don\u2019t confuse comfort with overkill. And that means that I tend to go to great lengths to get the best stuff at the cheapest price\u2014which often ends up actually being free. My main computer, for example, was fished out of the local electronics dumpster. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s bad in any way, however. After I cleaned it up, wiped the hard drive, and essentially refurbished the laptop, it is now the fastest computer I currently have. How fast, you ask? I can run a DAW, Google Chrome, MS Outlook, UTAU, Discord, and run a system scan all at the same time, and nothing lags. And I got it for free! Out of a fucking dumpster!I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth around $250 today, but I got it for free.My monitor is the same deal. I fished it out of the same electronics dumpster, and even thought the aspect ratio is a perfect square (and it also doesn\u2019t have a logo anywhere that tells me who manufactured it), it has worked quite well up to this point. The resolution isn\u2019t particularly impressive, but I don\u2019t really do anything that really requires high resolution anyway.I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth around $50 today, but I got it for free.The phone that I currently use piggybacks off of my family\u2019s plan that we\u2019ve had since last year, so my parents are paying for it. The plan lasts until Summer of next year, so until then, I can use unlimited calling/text/data for free (on my part, at least). It\u2019s also a pretty high-end phone, so I haven\u2019t the need to switch phones anytime soon.$188 per month. I have it for free.I currently live in an apartment with a roommate, and it was my genius idea to split the rent by how many square footage we claim for ourselves. Since I chose the guest bedroom as my room, as well as the attached bath, I only have to pay about a quarter of the rent\u2014my roommate pays everything else, as he\u2019s the only one who uses the living room, nook, kitchen, master bed/bath.$2,440 per month. I pay $650. Don\u2019t worry, my roommate is totally chill with it. He makes a far better income than I do anyway.I don\u2019t have a mattress; I sleep on foldable tatami mats that sit right atop the wood floors. However, this decision to sleep on tatami mats instead of a mattress was not to save money\u2014it was because I liked it.Average price for a good mattress: around $1500. I use tatami mats for $200.My pillow is probably in the top 10 most expensive things that I\u2019ve ever bought. It\u2019s a $1000 Sleep Number pillow. The issue with most pillows I\u2019ve had is that, after sleeping on it for a while, it molds into a permanent shape that becomes very uncomfortable, and must be replaced. So I figured that buying an expensive high-tech pillow that doesn\u2019t lose its shape, lasts for a lifetime, and comes with benefits like natural thermal management, was a much better investment than having to buy a new cheap pillow every few months.Even though its initial price was around $1000, I bought it during a Christmas sale, which bumped it down to around $900, and since I was a new customer, they discounted further down to $850. Through some negotiation with the saleswoman, I only had to pay around $810.I\u2019ve got one blanket and a duvet, both of which are silk. I didn\u2019t buy any of them\u2014they were gifts from a family-owned bedding shop in Taiwan that had very good ties with my grandparents. They\u2019re extremely high quality, and I\u2019ve been told that they would normally be worth several thousand USD.Initial price: $1500+ EACH. I got them for free.My daily driver is a used 2010 Lexus RX, which I got for just a hair under $13,000 because its previous owner was our neighbour when I still lived with my parents. And even though it\u2019s not terribly quick, sporty, or high-tech by today\u2019s standards, it\u2019s still a damn good car. Most of the leather has been preserved because its previous owners used cloth seat covers, and it\u2019s quite comfy. Even though it hasn\u2019t got the Mark Levinson sound system upgrades, it is still better than any audio device I currently own. The car hasn\u2019t needed a single repair every since it was bought, which is nice.Average price today: around $18,000. Saved $5,000.As for most other necessities, I purchase them from MUJI. It\u2019s got unique and high quality items at a more-than-reasonable price.Of course, I could solve most of these problems by landing a job that pays A LOT more than what I currently make, that would demand more of me, but it would infringe on my comfort. Right now, my comfort levels are at the perfect level for me. Nothing major is being compromised, and I\u2019m definitely not going overboard with unnecessary comfort. So, am I materialistic? I\u2019d say I\u2019m in the middle, but probably not \u201cin the middle\u201d in the same way as most others who are also in the middle. ",

            "answer_text": "When my mother showed up at my house with a moving truck, I opened the door wearing a pair of black jeans with holes that exposed the backs of my thighs and my knees. There were bleach stains on the bottom, which had been worn ragged by my walking on the hems. That was the only pair of pants I owned. I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with them. I didn\u2019t leave the house aside from church. I had a skirt for that. We didn\u2019t have money for anything else. Those pants, more or less, covered me. They served their purpose. I still have trouble remembering that my situation is nowhere near as dire as it was, and that I can buy things now. I am so used to living without, and making do with half-broken objects, that my instinct is to make everything last for as long as humanly possible before I cave and spend money. If I\u2019m hungry, I look to flour and water. When I remember I can buy fruit, not for my son, but for me, I feel overwhelmed by my good fortune. I do this weekly. Every week it feels like a miracle. I got a mango the other day. I already wrote about this, but I\u2019m still in awe. I ate it yesterday, the flavor was shockingly nuanced, the texture more stringy than I expected from such soft and pliant flesh. It wasn\u2019t uniform at all. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what mangoes are supposed to be like. But it was incredible. I bought that. It\u2019s difficult for me to discuss material objects without intense emotion. On one hand there is the awe and the gratitude, as I feel with the mango. On the other there is a persistent sense of anxiety; I do not buy things, I cannot buy things. This response is well-learned, conditioned. It\u2019s how I survived. It\u2019s how the lights stayed on. That\u2019s not relevant anymore. But it\u2019s hard for me to see objects I can buy as anything but a threat to my livelihood, as as threat to my physical safety. Before, if I bought a pair of jeans, the electricity might\u2019ve gone out. If I ate too much, our water might\u2019ve gotten shut off. I\u2019ve been out of that situation for nine months now. My situation is comfortable. But after so long living in fear of spending money, it remains difficult to see objects that cost money as anything but a threat. Do I value material objects? Yes, they strike me as incredible and rare and valuable. But I also have an instinctive aversion to them, as spending money, any amount of money, has been a threat to my safety for so long. ",

Not to be irritatingly sanctimonious here but \u201cStuff\u201d has very little appeal for me and I don\u00b4t get any joy from shopping or consuming or having things at all. It leaves me feeling empty and sad. I moved country earlier this year and donated a lot of the stuff I\u00b4d accumulated during my time there and it was such a weight off my shoulders to size down like that. I was never a big consumer but I managed to accumulate stuff regardless. Since getting here in early January, I\u00b4ve bought almost nothing and have got good use out of the mountain of clothes I\u00b4ve accumulated over the years that I bought because I knew they wouldn\u00b4t go out of style quickly. I like to look well presented and I manage that without going shopping every month - I just look after the stuff I already have. The things I have bought has been because I\u00b4ve really needed them, like when shoes have fallen apart. I\u00b4ve tried to buy second-hand when I could (we have excellent second-hand clothes shops here in Amsterdam) and I\u00b4ve no issue with wearing others\u00b4 castaways if they\u00b4re in good condition. I got two lovely pair of Italian leather shoes for 50 Euro in one second-hand shop and people have complimented multiple times on them. My smart phone is a fairly basic model and I don\u00b4t have any fancy gadgets bar a pretty basic laptop. I don\u00b4t have a car (most people cycle here any way and a car would be useless here) and I don\u00b4t care about cars. I don\u00b4t care about brands or labels at all and don\u00b4t get the appeal. I genuinely want for nothing and prefer to spend my money on holidays or going out or just saving it for the future. I really can\u00b4t stand spending money replacing something that works perfectly well. My family and I are doing Secret Santa this year and, like every year, I\u00b4m struggling to think of something I want so my sister had to make a suggestion for me (some snazzy moisturiser or other). I saw that documentary recently, Minimalism and realised I\u00b4d been living that way pretty much my whole adult life and I could happily cut it back even more. Living an uncluttered life and making the most out of what you already have is a really satisfying, less stressful existence. I sound incredibly sanctimonious here, I know! ",

            "answer_text": "To an extent, yes. I like using the premium things in life but I don\u2019t always could afford the price at an instant. I live comfortably right now, more like lower middle class. I probably could place myself in the upper middle class if I put in more hours at work but I value my time too much. Having said that, I live in two rooms apartment in a nice neighborhood with a housemate. We are both flying crews and earned slightly more than most of our peers around same age. We enjoy living the good life: good food, short vacation once every two/three months, splurging on cosmetics (our job requires us to do so), cute clothes once in a while and so on. We both have savings and drive our own car. But lets stop short over there. I am not as materialistic as one would assume. I can say, I am comfortably materialistic without having to go broke. Say, I am a trail runner and I would like to own the best hydration pack for my long rambling runs. Rather than buying cheap things, I would scout for high quality brands and make comparisons. I probably have to set aside money for a month or two but that is OK. It does not create a dent in my bank account. I justify buying these top of the range items as a long term investment. I ain\u2019t got time to be fixing every month due to my lack of awareness to just spend it all at that one time and have the best quality. At times, I go overboard buying things that I probably could not afford. These mistakes are costly and would probably eat away at my sanity till the next paycheck so I am more cautious now. Having said that, I envy my mom. She still lives frugally that every time a hard time cimes knocking on her door, she is not fazed by it. I aspired to live like her, maybe soon, but not at this time. Life is too good to not enjoy it right now. The one thing that I probably took after her is the ability to make/create things from scratch rather than buying the ready made version of it. It has proven to save me lots of money in the long run. Nuralia Mazlan ",

I bought some new ones this year, but the previous batch of suits are now 6 years old and still in regular useBooks. Mostly books. Although increasingly these are ebooks.My mobile phone.I have a nice home cinema system but the newest components are 5 years old and the TV is over 10. I might renew the TV next year. There are also some bad decisions in there. We spent a lot moving our DVDs and BluRays onto a home cinema PC just as streaming made it irrelevant. We probably have far too much on DVD anyway. But as you get older, the realisation dawns that the things worth spending money on are the things you will remember. I want to spend more on travel and adventure. And I probably spend the majority of my post-tax income on my children. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: no. I haven\u2019t bought new clothes since I was in 7th grade, and yes, now I\u2019m in 12th. I work at Panda Express about 25 hours a week and I haven\u2019t spent any of it on anything materialistic. I only spend it on food- is that any better? My parents force give me $20 a week and even though that is not a great sum of money for a week, I feel extremely guilty (I italicized force because I refuse it every time). My family moved from a very tiny house into a slightly larger house in a better neighborhood across from a beautiful park, and the main reason why I love the move is because of the location, not the house. I was content in my tiny house and I would continue to be content if I had stayed there my entire life. I value family time, and it made it virtually impossible to not have family time, as we were practically always running into each other, and I valued the vacations that we would go on every year, spending money on new experiences rather than on a home too big to house a 5 person family. My parents both have cars that are at least 8 years old and inexpensive, despite their ability to buy more expensive and modern cars without causing too much of a dent in their financial situation. My parents always emphasized the importance of health, happiness, and family. Fancy cars didn\u2019t add to that, a big home didn\u2019t add to that, and the newest flat screen 4G 934032GB LTE 4D TV sure as hell did not add to that. I grew up valuing concepts, not things. P.S. I do want to add that I am very fortunate and lucky to have grown up in a more-or-less financially stable household. I take absolutely nothing for granted and I understand that some people may gain \u2018happy points\u2019 from a fancy car or a fancy home, but I was raised differently- with different priorities and interests.

The only debt I have is student debt, and it\u2019s well under 10K by this point. I pay off my credit cards every month. I have a few thousand in savings. This is what I consider comfortable; I don\u2019t live beyond my means and my college payments are on a very comfortable monthly basis that I can easily pop off with a single writing job that will take me 4 hours. Considering I do at least 5 or 6 of these assignments a month and I have income from other sources as well, I\u2019m actually very comfortable financially. That\u2019s what I consider comfortable. Not having to worry about money. I do have nice things, though. I\u2019m typing this on my 2017 MacBook I bought this last month (and it\u2019s a glorious thing). I have Bose and Beats headphones, a big comfy bed, access to all the whiskey I could want, a wardrobe that is probably worth several thousand dollars at this point, and I\u2019m getting ready to go spend an entire month in Europe. So I\u2019ve got nice stuff. I\u2019m well-educated. I\u2019ve seen more of the world than most people probably ever will and I\u2019m in my early 30s. I have multiple career options that I have entrenched resume lip-service for; since they\u2019re all information-based they likely aren\u2019t going to fizzle out anytime soon. I have more than enough to eat. I just don\u2019t really have a desire for more stuff. I\u2019m not terribly big on the idea of homeownership and never have been. I\u2019ve never really wanted a car. I don\u2019t want kids. I mean, I have wonderful electronics, a warm place to live, a comfortable place to sleep, I can dress up nice, and I have ridiculously flexible employment that I can change when I\u2019m bored. I have paid-off credit cards and my debt is subsidized and under control. I can jet-set or pick up employment anywhere around the world if I want to do it. So it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not materialistic, I just have what I want in terms of material things. I\u2019m a pretty happy person overall. ",

Just a one-room flat, some secondhand furniture, a small television. I don\u2019t want to own a car, and I have only a few pieces of cheap, sturdy jewelry that I wear all the time. However, I get very attached to things. I\u2019ve had the same stuffed animals since I was a child; if there was ever a fire, they would be the first belongings I\u2019d grab. I\u2019ve been using the same computer for years, the same blankets, the same pillow. I\u2019ve not had a wardrobe update since high school, and shoe shopping is a nightmare because I can\u2019t bear the thought of replacing my beloved tennis shoes that have traveled so much with me. I don\u2019t replace books when they start to fall apart; I grab tape and painstakingly secure the pages back together. I don\u2019t place much value on these things because they\u2019re expensive; I value them for the memories they carry. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, yes. But it need not be in the pejorative context it seems to be, in your question. Products and services are tools. We humans are surrounded by tools including our voices, hands, types words, internet, etc.. Just tools. How we use the tools (or let the tools use us) is the question. I enjoy the high tech \u201cmaterialism\u201d in western society. But maybe as the pejorative implies, it can become a god (a slave to products/service with us serving it like our master and then it orchestrating us\u2026.the slave and master relationship as we remain deluded in a fog of pleasure and our wants turning into needs). So seeing how that process works, we can use the tools sensibly and if we develop no \u201cgod/addiction\u201d (because we are cautious about using the tools), we are fine. So I think there need be no fear of a materialistic lifestyle IF the master-slave addiction process is well understood. But yes, we humans are a strange addiction-prone species. The concept of a transcendent good god was meant to lift us above these worldly human weaknesses/temptations (material gods). If we voluntarily decide to \u201cserve\u201d the abstraction of \u201cultimate goodness\u201d (agape love), then these worldly temptations become obvious and are easy to avoid (the temptation, not the tool). If my words can be very harmful to myself and others, and I realize it, I can still use my voice but use it more wisely. Avoiding using my voice (the tool) because I know it can tempt me to say things I shouldn\u2019t, is childish IMO. I don\u2019t believe in isolation as a form of restraint. Karl Marx and cult leaders might like that approach, but I don\u2019t. First, understand the temptation is in you, not in the tool and then change yourself so you can use the tool without falling to your temptation. If you cannot resist, then avoidance (putting yourself in your own little prison) is your only choice. But that\u2019s like being a perpetual child needing mommy and daddy to protect you. Not much freedom in that. So maybe we have many immature \u201cgrown children\u201d in society that get addicted to fast food, social networking, entertainment, high status and professionals telling them what to think, etc.. Maybe. But the answer is \u201cawareness\u201d to our addictive tendencies, not condemning the tools. Maybe it\u2019s time to grow up and put our big boy pants on and use and even enjoy the tools without becoming childish addicts (like an immature kid in a candy store getting sick eating). But we all get to choose\u2026.which is why I like being an American. ",

            "answer_text": "Much more so than I would like, and much more so than it\u2019s comfortable to admit. My theory is this: old money isn\u2019t as materialistic as new money. And a recent memory of hunger is likely to trigger a greater desire for material comfort than would otherwise exist. Case in point: I\u2019m more materialistic than your average American, but much less so than your average Ivorian. I have a friend from Venezuela in much the same situation. In the US, materialism is something to be ashamed of or apologetic about. In Ivory Coast, people go out of their way to flaunt their expensive belongings: Look at my expensive car. Look at my expensive clothes. Look at my huge house! That seems crass to me in a way I hope my own behavior won\u2019t seem to my children. How is my materialism different, then? I drive a Lincoln. I bought it used\u2014I\u2019d never consider buying a brand new car\u2014but I wanted a luxury car with heated/cooled leather seats and wooden paneling and all that stuff. Why? I don\u2019t know. I just liked it.I fly first class whenever I can. Why? I like being pampered. And I can afford it now. So, why not?Given my choice of hotels, I\u2019ll generally opt to stay at a Hyatt. It\u2019s not super duper expensive, but there are definitely cheaper options. But staying at a Hyatt makes me happy. And now that I\u2019m used to this, staying somewhere less nice feels like I\u2019m cheating myself out of something I deserve. If I live somewhere cold, as I currently do, I insist on having an attached garage. It\u2019s non negotiable.I like matching my hats with the rest of my outfits. So, in winter, I have hats in several colors: black, brown, burgundy, navy, green, etc. Why? Because it makes me happy. When I buy my adult house, it\u2019s going to be bigger than what I strictly need. Why? I want an office, and an exercise room, and a bedroom. I\u2019d occupy 3 rooms by myself.I like nice clothes. I love soft fabrics that caress my skin. If I buy a sweater, it\u2019s going to be merino wool, or some silk blend, or occasionally cashmere. Why? Those are just the fabrics I happen to like. Interestingly, I can\u2019t stand alpaca or lambswool: I itch like a sonofabitch.I chose a profession that pays more, as opposed to one that pays less but that I might have had more affinity for.I think that about covers it.

            "answer_text": "I have a thing for healthy and tasty food. I have a weak tummy, so I always choose healthy food over fast food. There are not many fast foods to my taste, so I don\u2019t cry over its lack. I don't have to struggle with the constant \u2018drug\u2019 that I see in so many people over wanting to eat fast food and complaining the very next day that it worsened their tummy. At the very best, I like cakes and pastries. Those little fluffy objects are the only cellulite in my body. I am small. Basically, I hate to be unhealthy. I cross oceans to keep my health in check. Then I always wear washed, neat and clean clothes. Since I am hyperhydrotic, I particularly invest in good shoes and socks. Plus, I love water. Bathing means using more than excess water a child of my stature would need for bathing. I can go on without bathing, but when I bath, I bath for real. I like to spend on a healthy and hygienic lifestyle. I like to sleep comfortably. Resting my mind and body is just as important to me as surviving. Reading newspapers refreshes the mind. Having a good internet connection and devices to access it is also what I pay a great attention to. I don\u2019t care about the cost of things, if it\u2019s usable, I am good to go. I am writing this answer on a cheap Redmi phone which doesn't sell anymore now and wearing a much cheaper watch. I don't need to launch a rocket, what good is a costly phone going to do to me? A watch is simply going to tell me time, no matter its cost. So far the only thing that's been costly in my life is my undergrad college \u2013 the one that I am attending now. The fees here is sky high. Lately, I came across Timberland. It's boots are like no other boots I have seen. Note that I am not a fan of boots and extravagant shoes but Timberland\u2019s 6\u2032inch premium boots caught my attention and I haven\u2019t been able to get it off my mind since then. It's too costly to be worn. It\u2019s costly and I like it. I wish to wear them someday. To sum it all, I need a decent way of living to carry on, where my body gets optimum rest and sleep and regains the power to function well the next day. I like to spend on health and body, because that\u2019s what the real struggle in this world is for. If that\u2019s what you would call materialistic, then, perhaps I am one. If not, then I am not.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m among the least materialistic people I know, if by materialism we mean measuring success and accomplishment based on the accumulation of stuff, and equating said stuff with happiness or fulfillment. I could be about as happy living in a bale of hay with a few quilts, or in a van, as in a luxury apartment. That\u2019s only a very slight exaggeration. And yes, while I\u2019m more fortunate than many and do count my blessings in that respect, I have lived under some pretty itinerant and uncertain conditions in my time; this is the voice of experience I\u2019m using, not pure conjecture. It\u2019s not in my nature to derive any kind of sentimental value from inanimate objects \u2014 I simply don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d keepsakes. If Mom gives me something and says, \u201cHere, take care of this, I want you to have it,\u201d then I\u2019ll be touched by that and will certainly safeguard it. Doesn\u2019t mean it will be anywhere near me on the day-to-day. The memories in my head are the keepsakes I live among, for better or for worse. In short: the fewer physical objects (and bills) I have to keep up with, the happier I am. I think this is because inner life has always been far more vivid to me than the environment, even to a fault. I\u2019m not impervious to consumerism, but I\u2019m a damn difficult case as far as that goes, and proud of it. I do have a streak of materialism, I suppose, when it comes to certain gadgets and to the tools of my trade (as a musician). I very much believe in investing in the best equipment for the job, whatever it takes. ",

            "answer_text": "Not very much at all. I try to apply the following principle - when I see something I think I would like I ask myself to distinguish the difference between \u201cneed\u201d and \u201cwant\u201d. If I don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, I usually don\u2019t get it. I am married but we only have one car. My husband has a work vehicle, but he uses it to get to and from work and of course while on the job. We make it work. We are not fad followers. Everyone seems to have a mega home entertainment centre. We just have a t.v. and DVD player. My life is not going to be greatly enhanced by having all of the stuff that will make it sound like we are in a movie theatre. Is it really worth it to spend all of that money (not to mention the hassle of hooking it all up)? I don\u2019t think so. I call that perspective. There was a time when I spent a fair amount of money on clothing but I don\u2019t anymore. To give you some idea of my sartorial state of affairs-I am going to have surgery tomorrow and last week I had to go and buy a nightgown to wear for the week I will be there because my only other summer nightgown is over 10 years old, faded and tatty. I stick to cargo pants and t-shirts for everyday wear and sandals or tennis shoes. The pots and pans in my kitchen are 22 years old. They are still in good shape and do the job so I will keep using them. We seldom go out to eat. Instead, we make meals that last several days. Eating out where we live is expensive and it just feels wrong to spend that much. I do have some things that I do spend a fair amount of money on but I feel it is justified: My garden. I live on 10 acres and have lots of garden space and trees. I also love to put plants in pots both inside and outside. Plants are cheap, but pots can cost a bit. But I get immense joy planting them and looking after them. As for my gardens, I am unable to maintain them due to my health so I have to pay someone. They come once a month to weed, prune, etc. and sometimes plant new things or replace things that have died. At $30 per person per hour plus materials, this can be expensive. But it is worth it because I enjoy the beauty plus it enhances the value of my property. This makes good sense in the long term. Travel. I love to travel whether it is within the country where I live or overseas. I fly at the pointy end of the plane simply because my health means I need to be able to lie down when travelling for 14 hours. To save money, we will rent a small cabin/cottage so that we can make our own meals rather than stay in hotels, which cost more and don\u2019t have cooking facilities. We live within our means, aren\u2019t worried about keeping up with the Joneses and while we live in the now we are always thinking about and preparing for the future. I would like to have a comfortable old age so I try to be sensible now. ",

            "answer_text": "For Christmas I am getting the promise of a few hundred dollars towards a laptop. \u201cPromise,\u201d because no one has a few hundred dollars. And a new laptop only because my current one is borderline non-functioning. I work from home. Having a reliable computer is not really an option. In essence, I am getting nothing for Christmas and I am content with that. I am an avid pursuer of things. I like things. I have spent a lot of time acquiring them only to let them breathe on my shelves like these stagnant little air-suckers. I move. A lot. I\u2019ve moved multiple times a year for the past two years. Every time I move, I get rid of shit because it\u2019s heavy. I don\u2019t want to carry it. If I\u2019m not willing to haul it down the stairs, then it ain\u2019t worth keeping. I\u2019ve acquired fewer and fewer things because each thing I acquire is another thing that must be moved. This is one time where my chronic laziness is a strength. It makes me get rid of shit. I am defensive of my things. I like my things. Slowly but surely, though, I\u2019m letting them go. We lost our house last year. This is not a secret on Quora, not to me, anyway. Great-great grandpa built it, it\u2019d been in the family for a hundred years, yadda yadda yadda. It\u2019s gone now. It\u2019s not ours. It never will be. Saying that makes my breath catch in my throat and I really want to cry now but it\u2019s just a thing. That thing didn\u2019t tell me that good ol\u2019 Grandpa Gus had a fling with the housekeeper after his wife passed. That thing didn\u2019t tell me about the time Grandpa Pete\u2019s pants fell down in the front yard and he finished watering the lawn before pulling them back up (the man had his priorities straight). That thing held nothing. It was nothing. It was the heart of my family but it was not my family. We keep my family lefse and prayers and \u201cmange tusen takk\u201d and our blonde hair but even without all of that we keep our family in us. In the people. Not the things. We keep ourselves in people, too\u2014in the stories they tell, about us, about our world. We are not our things. As much as I would cry at the loss of everything I own, in the end, I am not these things and they are not me. When you die, someone throws your newspaper scraps away, the ones you so meticulously snipped from your favorite stories. Someone donates your favorite books to kids who will rip at their pages and adults who will tatter their covers. Someone boxes up your wedding band and maybe it goes to a family member or maybe someone melts it down, boils it all away. We acquire shit and then we die, and then it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem. As much as I\u2019d like to look at this answer and say \u201cNo, I am not materialistic,\u201d I am because I still want things. Even knowing they aren\u2019t me. Even knowing they will not follow me when I die. I like things. I am not too materialistic, no. But there\u2019s no denying that I am. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of material goods as unfulfilling and hollow has always struck me as incomplete. We\u2019re supposed to value experiences over possessions, but I see them as necessarily intertwined: if you want to go on a camping trip with your family, you need access to camping equipment. Perhaps what folks have in mind is that material possessions which don\u2019t translate into experiences are not worthwhile. Well, yes, but that just sounds like a bad purchase. If you\u2019re effective at ascertaining what you will and will not have constructive uses for, this advice becomes less valuable. I commute across state lines, and I have invested quite a bit of time into figuring out what accessories make this commute work. I have little doubt that this investment has paid off. Some of the things I take every day: A folding bike, for the parts between train ridesNoise-canceling headphones, to reduce stress and distraction from ambient train noiseA laptop, for doing work on the trainAn insulated water bottle, so I can drink cold water throughout the dayWindproof gloves, earmuffs, and a mask, so I can bike comfortably when it\u2019s cold outsideA smartphone, which I use to buy train ticketsIn each case, the most relevant question to me is whether the benefit from carrying the item will outweigh the cost. Asking whether I\u2019m being materialistic feels like a slightly less useful version of the same question. Ultimately, I do tend to think of myself as pretty materialistic. I have positive feelings about taking advantage of consumer surplus, and I keep an eye out for more opportunities to do so. I\u2019m certainly not a minimalist. But I also have no interest in conspicuous consumption or in buying more stuff than I can use. So I guess it depends on the definition of materialistic. ",

            "answer_text": "There are only a few things I need to survive to be honest. A small room with a laptop, WiFi, a gaming console, and a wide screen television/monitor with an output to a 3.1 or 5.1 surround system.  I had this sorted out the moment I got my first job and my demands have never increased further than that. I have just upgraded the television to a larger display size to watch soccer, cricket and formula 1. Of course, I always had my book collection.  Of course, I gave them all way since it is much easier to have everything on a kindle. I know, paperbacks are better, the aroma of a new book is awesome but I had over 250 novels and it was impossible to carry it around as I travel a lot. And the final nail in the coffin were bikes.  I have two of them, and probably would buy one more sometime later. That is all I ever wanted. A small room to rest, books to read and a few bikes to ride. I am not much particular about what I wear, what I eat, where I live as long as I have these things and a mug of beer. I am not particular about brands, social status and all that unnecessary evil the society feeds us.  So, I think I maybe a semi-modern-materialistic person at the most. I am more of a \u2018people-istic\u2019 guy. ",

I don\u2019t care about fancy clothing and will eat whatever keeps my stomach full. I don\u2019t want expensive watches, latest phones or gadgets. I want to make money because: I enjoy traveling and I enjoy cars. Both of these cost a shit ton of money. In order to enjoy my hobbies I have to make a lot of money. Just look at this beautiful piece of machinery, it\u2019s worth it. Growing up, my family wasn't very well off and we had a lot of money problems. I can trace back most of our struggles as a family to the lack of money. That is another reason why I want to have money, whether I need it or not. The freedom that comes with money is important to me.I think that\u2019s about it. ",

I left my job a few months ago to go back to school, and really appreciate my savings which allow me to continue in my lifestyle. I really like being able to take a cab without thinking about its cost, being able to fly across the country instead of taking a train to go home or meet my friends. I like that I am able to go to a fine dining place infrequently without worrying about my budget. I appreciate the Mac which I use throughout the day. Having said that, I don\u2019t fancy fine clothes, a great mobile phone or a high-end car. My fascination is usually either stuff that I use a lot (such as my laptop or my bicycle) or concern for a minimum level of comfort (such as a decent hotel room or an airline of my choice instead of the cheapest available). In conclusion, I think I am fairly materialistic about certain things, while being indifferent about most others. ",

My nest needs to be comfortable, clean, and easy to maintain. No long hours of maintenance and cleaning for me, please. I don't want fashion labels. I do want clothes that fit, feel comfortable, and speak plainly to everyone that I am a person of simple, but respectable taste. I grew up poor for an American.[1] We were poor, but we were privileged. My siblings and I knew beyond doubt that while we didn't have much, that we could become whatever we wished. My brother became very wealthy and a serious materialist. My sister became a serious teacher devoted to a large family and to supporting the accomplishments of her extraordinarily gifted children. Me? I crave experience over stuff. I want to know everything there is to know, feel everything there is to feel, love everyone available to love. All before my ephemeral spark of consciousness fades back into the unknowing fire of univeral being. No, I am not materialistic. Much.

            "answer_text": "Am I materialistic? Hmmnn\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. I own lots of things but I tend to own things that let me do stuff. I don\u2019t buy stuff because it\u2019s the latest or the most fashionable but I do try to buy stuff that I judge to be the best for what I want. I hate shopping. But when I have to buy something I\u2019m too poor to be cheap. I\u2019d rather spend \u00a3200 for a pair of hand made workboots that will last me years, than \u00a320 on a pair that will do just as well for a short time but I\u2019ll have to go through the trauma of shopping for in another six months. If my expensive boots last me five years I\u2019ve broken even. Every month they last after that I\u2019m in profit. The pair I\u2019m wearing just now are six years old so I\u2019m \u00a340 ahead. I have a large expensive custom built house. I couldn\u2019t do without the space, and yes I know seven bedrooms is too big for one man but d\u2019you know what? I built it myself on land I owned and it probably cost me less than someone else might spend on a two bedroom condo. When the kids and the family are round the space is certainly useful. Would I ever spend the same on a two bed condo? No. Don\u2019t care where it is - it\u2019s not worth it to me. Would I like another bigger house? Nah, next one I build will be smaller. I never buy the latest gadget or gizmo. Not if I can possibly avoid it. My laptop is a six year old Dell, my phone a four year old hand me down Samsung from my eldest daughter. I couldn\u2019t care less if they\u2019re fashionable or not. They work, in fact they work very well and that\u2019s all I want. I buy cars that are almost completely depreciated. I\u2019m not going to buy new and lose a couple of thousand the minute I drive it off the lot. I\u2019ve got other things to spend that money on. No I buy cars that are around ten years old, old diesels that will give me another hundred thousand miles or so at negligible cost. I\u2019m happy to put in a bit of work to get it going and keep it going well, but the minute it needs work that costs more than 50% of it\u2019s replacement value - out it goes. I usually get three to five years or so out of a \u00a32500 car. A happy formula I\u2019ve worked to for years. If I had bought it new, I\u2019d have lost more than my total costs for that time on the day I drove it home. What\u2019s the point of that? Would I like a brand new Porsche? Nah - but you might tempt me with an old air cooled 993. As a carpenter though I do have a weakness for buying tools. And I spend far too much on them! For work I buy tools that will do the best job for the most cost effective price - it\u2019s a fine balancing act, often the most expensive tool isn\u2019t necessarily the best. And sometimes the rise in cost for a minimal rise in effectiveness or efficiency isn\u2019t worth the difference in price so I\u2019ll research carefully before buying - but I won\u2019t hesitate to pay what I need to get the right tool for the job. I was talking to someone the other day about my toaster. It\u2019s a six slot Dualit, he said something along the lines of how he didn\u2019t expect me to have something so fashionable. I told him I\u2019d had it for over 20 years, it was second hand and already around 20 years old when I bought it. For \u00a35. Keep something quality long enough and it becomes fashionable again. So am I materialistic? I don\u2019t know. I hate buying stuff, but I buy a lot of stuff - but most of the stuff that I do buy works for a living or lasts a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "10 years ago I had a PS2. I had several games for this PS2 all secondhand. I had a big old TV my grandfather got me before he passed. I had a few toys too most notably a bag filled to the brim with toy soldiers, tanks, jenga blocks and planes. Poundland toys made of cheap plastic. I had a few books mainly from before dad died. Horrible Histories mostly. My clothes were hand-me-downs from my mothers work colleagues (she worked 2 hours a day as a dinnerlady then four hours late afternoon as a librarian). I wore the same school uniform for four years. My school actually gave me shoes on more than one occasion because the ones I had became so worn they had mouths wjere my toes would peep out. Fast forward ten years\u2026 I have a PS2 and PS3 with several secondhand games. The big TV is still here but I use a very small secondhand TV that isn't huge. I still have those toy soldiers somewhere but it's been a long time since I played with them. They seem to be something I would pass onto a son of mine later in life. I don't own nor read many books. I have the entire works of HP Lovecraft on my phone however. My clothes are not hand me downs anymore (well, except a striped hoodie I wear to work). I buy my clothes cheap and my cashmere winter coat I got for under a tenner from a charity shop. Naturally I don't wear a school uniform anymore and I wear two kinds of shoes ; work boots and plain formal cheap shoes. I own a couple band shirts and the odd horror ornament but if I had to grab everything I owned it would not take me a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a complicated relationship with things. On one hand, I really, really like pretty things. I scour thrift stores, refinish furniture, re-hem dresses. I have collections and I have so much artwork, I rotate it, like a museum. There have been several periods of my life where my eye for pretty things and my aesthetic choices have paid my bills. On the other hand, I am very frugal. I hate clutter and bother. I have no urge or reason to impress anyone. I don\u2019t buy what I don\u2019t need or can\u2019t sell in a pinch. I wear a uniform of jeans, boots and black t-shirts most days. I save sartorial splendor for special occasions. I eat nice food, mostly because I cook it myself. I\u2019ve paid off my debt (except for student loans, those are never going away) I drive a serviceable car. I live in a clean, modest duplex. I spend too much time cleaning and arranging my space. I don\u2019t want anything, but I am restless and visually driven. I long for a minimalist life, but I have a knack for acquiring shiny things. I will always struggle between trying to create my own little world and trying to uncomplicated my little world. ",

            "answer_text": "Quite a bit, to be honest. I very much identify with the following quote: \u201cMoney may not buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in a Jaguar than on a bus.\u201d \u2015 Fran\u00e7oise Sagan Let\u2019s be honest, being able to afford nice things is, well, nice. It\u2019s pleasant. Inviting your fiance to an upscale restaurant and spending a great evening is a big benefit, so I want to be able to afford it. Is that necessary? No. I personally would never date a person who insists on upscale restaurants and shuns having a cheap picnic on a deserted beach at sundown. But it\u2019s better to be able to have both options instead of being stuck with one. Will it make your happy? Hopefully you are happy with your fiance no matter where you take her, so the obvious answer is no. But here comes the catch - spending time with your favorite person is something you need to be able to afford. You can\u2019t do that if you are working 2\u20133 jobs to make ends meet; and that brings me to the second, even better quote: \u201cTime is money.\u201d - Benjamin Franklin Usually people say it to express that time is valuable. But it also means that money can buy time. Working in a field where a regular work week pays several times more than some 60+ hour patchwork of part-time jobs means more time is available to you. More time to spend with people you love.More time to do things you enjoy.More time to relax and cherish life.You all know the quote \u201cthe best things in life are free\u201d. Well, that\u2019s not completely true. If you don\u2019t have the time and the money to visit your family, spend time with your partner, raise your children, have a decent place to live, etc. - then chances are you won\u2019t get to enjoy the best things at all. Also, it\u2019s less likely you even get to know these \u201cbest things\u201d in the first place. I moved to Munich for attending university. Munich is the most expensive German city. If I wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford that, I would not have met my girlfriend, would not know half of my best friends, would not have the job I\u2019m having (and enjoying), etc. To conclude, I cherish the benefits of materialism, but I am not blinded by it. I agree that things alone won\u2019t make me happy. And I honestly admire people who are at least as happy as I am who give a sh*t about stuff and live a frugal life. But I personally value the comfort of stuff. Oh, and before I leave: \u201cThe best things in life are free. The second best things are very, very expensive.\u201d \u2015 Coco Chanel ",

However being a huge book lover, I realize I was getting too attached to my book, that is building a library in my room, never wanting to lend or donate the books. This made me feel miserable because while I was really interested in having my own library, the books were untouched since years(after I had read them) and had no one else to read them. This was unfair according to me, since it made no sense for books to sit idle rather than being read. So, this Christmas, I packed 25\u201330 of my favourite books from my shelves, and sent out to people whom I have liked talking to online but could never get a chance to meet. The feeling I got from being the secret book Santa was phenomenal, but more amazing was the whole process of letting go. I felt free knowing I was not crumbling with sadness while having to give those books away. The separation was just fine and I felt amazing to have finally understood that I cared about reading more than physically possessing books(which is a positive sign I think). Also,I can say now, I am not a very materialistic person. ",

It makes Christmas shopping for me very difficult, according to my family. I\u2019d rather have experiences than material things. We have too much crap in this house as it is, and very little of it is mine. I sometimes see things I would like when I\u2019m out and about, but my mind always thinks: \u201cYou\u2019d use this for an hour, get bored of it, and then it would just be another thing taking up space in your house until you donate it to charity.\u201d So I don\u2019t buy it. Instead I go to the nearest coffee place, buy a coffee, have an hour of enjoyment drinking it, throw away the cup, and have zero added clutter in my house. Lately I\u2019ve been thinking that, if I were maybe 5 years younger and never met my wife, I would have totally been on the \u201clittle house\u201d bandwagon. As it was, by the time that became a popular thing, I already had a big house and a family. ",

            "answer_text": "I was travelling in Tanzania and Kenya with a group of friends. Before the trip we decided to put all our money together, share the meals and pay for everything with the common cash. It was one of the best experiences ever. It just felt so natural and smooth not having to think about money; not having to stress about owning things. However, I\u2019m not naive. Even if I support sharing certain things with your neighbours and not counting whose turn it is to pay when you eat out with your friends, different people naturally have a very different relationship with money \u2014 and that may cause problems if you are supposed to share too many things. I also recognize that it really matters to me if my surroundings are beautiful. And sometimes you have to pay for that beauty. So I honestly think I\u2019m not materialistic as in living in luxury; I don\u2019t need a fancy smartphone, and living in a huge elegant house would feel just\u2026 alienating. But I might be materialistic, when it comes to being able to surround myself with vintage lamps from the 60\u2019s or bake my bread in colourful enamel bowls.  (Photo source: Kulho, Finel) For me that means that my home really feels like home. Actually I also think that loving material things is not bad. I prefer to love them enough to take care of them and not having to buy so many new things. ",

I would rather put my money in a piggy bank than a cash register. I still have my baby blankets. For cuddle purposes. Honestly, I'm either a minimalist or a hoarder. The truth is, I have a lot of stuff. I enjoy my stuff. I like my life where I never want for anything. And I dream of a future where I have nothing but the clothes on my back, a plan, and the road in front of me. I have more than I need and I hate that. But I also have exactly what I want right now. And I think that's okay. I will someday have less than most people in the United States and I love that. I embrace that. I look forward to it. And that's okay, too. ",

Well, not because it's not within reachable heights, but that's just not what will make me happy! In that sense I am not materialistic. This makes me happy.  And this.  And this.

I walked into my housemates\u2019 rooms to see photographs, posters, and shelving full of things. When they came to my room, well, to say they were underwhelmed is somewhat something of an understatement. \u201cI appreciate your\u2026 minimalism,\u201d they jibed. \u201cSeriously, Fred, where the hell is everything?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like stuff,\u201d was my blunt reply. And I say it all the time: I don\u2019t like stuff. I think we have too much of it. I will be going to my parents\u2019 for Christmas. They have a lot of things. You can\u2019t get through the front door before you notice some weird new trinket they\u2019ve bought. My dad is especially bad; I think he spends money just for the sake of spending money (not to mention, money he doesn\u2019t really have). So I think this is in part my rejection of that. I can\u2019t stand unnecessary mess. I don\u2019t see the point of keeping things just for the sake of keeping them. I\u2019d go as far as to say I find it unhealthy. Obviously I have my own ornaments and bits and pieces that I keep because they have meaning. If it doesn\u2019t have a purpose or meaning behind it, it gets thrown. That is what I value above all: meaning and purpose. ",

I don't flash money, and have no desire to. I don't own a single designer clothing item. I don't spend extra for names. I still don't fully understand why gold is so valuable. But when it comes to stuff I care about, stuff that makes my life easier, more fun, or more fulfilling, I like to have the money to pay for it. ",

They renovated one of the bedrooms into a sitting room/ library for their daughter as a 16-year birthday surprise. It\u2019s beautiful. They have a small hedgehog which has its own carrying pouch and the heating pad. Looking around I was thinking how we should probably renovate/ upgrade our own home. And maybe even get a heating pad for myself, as I would enjoy it as much as their hedgehog. But, my family is always on the go and out and about so investing a lot of money and time into the house seems to be a waste. Right now we are getting ready to go to a ski area for a week. And I\u2019m OK with the way things are, though I may become a bit more materialistic later down the road as I get older. ",

HE likes nice things. I don't care. But when I compared our childhoods, I kinda understand it. When he grew up, his family was poor and they knew it. He didn't have anything nice and used friends' toys and games. So now that he is an adult, if he sees something he likes he buys it without hesitation. My childhood was different. We were poor but didn't know it. My mom cared more about name brand shoes and clothes than about rent. So we moved a lot, eventually losing most of the nice things we had. As we grew older and my dad left, she was still doing the same thing except only for herself, even leaving is home alone with no food or money while she went out to eat with her man friend. She never brought anything back for us. So there is a reason behind everything a person does, consciously or not. Whenever he goes shopping, I immediately start to worry about how we will pay the rent. Didn't even realize that until I just wrote it out. Explains a lot. I could not care less about materialistic things but he is constantly collecting random nice things, just because. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to be a materialistic person but not anymore. My childhood was very simple just like every other middle-class kid But things changed when I was in my teenage. I started earning at the age of 17. I was a science student but more interested in making money. I borrowed some money from my father and invested in the stock market. Repaid him from the profits and spend the rest on gadgets. I bought everything in the later years ranging from gaming PC to Sports bike, shoes and clothes and whatnot. I had a dedicated showcase in my room made of glass where I kept all my gadgets and their boxes. There was a time when I was crazy about motorcycles and gadgets. Talking about the last few years, I bought 2 Royal Enfield classic 350, bought gadgets for about 1 lakh, spend around a lakh on liquor and cigarettes, laptop, mobile etc But from last year, I haven\u2019t bought a single new gadget. I used to have more 15 pairs of shoes, numerous jeans, and shirts which I never wore.One day I sat down and picked up the things I never used. I gave them away to my friends and people who really needed such things or were about to buy such things.Cut down to present scenario: Now I can tell you what exactly I own. There was a time when I was so materialistic that I never look beyond gadgets but now I barely use them. I have a phone which is only used for taking calls and booking tickets (I travel a lot).You won\u2019t find a single social networking app, shopping app on my phone. Do I regret changing my lifestyle? Not a bit. I feel more organized because I have left with the things that I literally use and not just show-off.I invested that time in reading books and thinking about future business ventures. Earlier I was more living a fake life and thus worried about maintaining an Image. Now I am living a life which I want and without worrying about the image. How did this happen?I would give the credit to my girlfriend and my friend cum mentor Rohit Agarwal. They both taught me the real value of life and how life is not about \u201cPossessions\u201d.Life is not about possessions, cars or gadgets, it is about how much you enjoy it through your experience. Before anyone gets any wrong Idea, I am not against money or basic necessities. I feel money matters and you should use the money to fulfill your basic necessities, but at the same time don\u2019t fall into the materialistic pit. ",

Being from good earning family, I had everything. My own room , vehicle,big house. At that time I don't had importance of all that things. I never thought how one could live without them. I thought people who do not have all this thing can live with necessary things. And their Life goes easy. I just want to thanks to my destiny. Teach me lesson. And let me know the reality. I am fed up of this simple life struggling for everything. For cooking,washing .dusting. I need equipments. To work smoothly. I need home with facilities. To live with leisure. Less or more everyone is materialistic.If they want to live good life it plays important role. And nothing is wrong in it. Yes I want to earn more money to have more materialistic luxuries. ",

I was gifted 2 new pairs of jeans, and I\u2019ll cherish them well, but mostly I\u2019ve worn the same clothes for years, because the were made to last. and when a family member is struggling, I can give them money, and that gives me more pleasure than all the shite, and other things you can buy, material wealth means so little.. I find it laughable that people measure wealth in such a way.. And for those who think I\u2019m religious, stick your religion up your arse, I don\u2019t need a god of any sort telling me what to do is right or wrong.. ",

Until about a year ago I was a student in a foreign country whose only occasional income was from giving private lessons in German (not a very lucrative business, I\u2019m afraid to say). During this time I don\u2019t think I was materialistic at all. I was happy enough I had a first-hand contract for a two-room apartment (a rarity in Stockholm)! Rent, food, public transport and the occasional travels to my family were all my expenses and pretty much all I needed. However, now I work as a PhD candidate at the university I used to study. In Sweden, they actually pay you a salary for that, can you believe it? Since then, I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019ve gradually become more materialistic. Commercials have a much bigger impact on me simply because these days I pause and think to myself: \u201cHuh. I could actually buy this!\u201d When I see something nice that is within my budget I often go ahead and buy it. Simply because I can. I\u2019m wondering what you can extrapolate from this data: should I ever become rich will I be needing to rent a truck for every trip to the mall? ",

I in no way think materialism is the main driver for everybody. But it drives everybody in some way. To be materialistic is in some way to be human. Like I told a good friend of mine the other day, I think we all have an area that makes us super shallow. Listen, I can sit here and say that I don\u2019t compare myself to other entrepreneurs and measure my success against theirs but that would be a lie. Men especially like to keep score. And keeping score is a form of being materialistic. If liking to keep score is materialistic then I\u2019m the most materialistic. Some of us show our materialism in fashion. Not me of course because I\u2019m one bad outfit away from looking like a homeless guy. Either way we\u2019re all guilty of our idolatry. Every person has their version of materialism. It\u2019s the human condition. Sure some of us go to mountain retreats and meditate for 3 days and get rid of 99% of our material belongings, thank you James Altucher. But we all keep score in some way. Deep down every person knows what is materially important to them. And we\u2019re all kind of ashamed to admit it. ",

If you have no possessions its harder to have a free lifestyle unless you have no complex about being \u201cdifferent\u201d and live in the woods or something. In short, Yes, but not more than anyone else. ",

I can\u2019t bear to replace my trainers and I\u2019d love to live in a flat that is kinda of close to my childhood house. When my books fall apart, I attempt to use glue or tape to put them back together- I don\u2019t throw them away. Why should I? I value those objects due to the memories gained from them. Not because they\u2019re expensive. If my house caught fire, my books would be one of the first things that would be grabbed up as I fled. Along with my phone and teddy bears of course. Shoe shopping is hell. Everyone is materialistic in some way I suppose. I\u2019m kinda of a hoarder. ",

Once I\u2019m financially settled, I\u2019ll certainly spend more money on developing a sizable wardrobe. Second, I don\u2019t like having to budget my weekly grocery shopping. I don\u2019t buy the most expensive foods, but I\u2019m generally less happy when I have to eat on a budget. I follow a specific diet, and eating on that diet isn\u2019t fun when you can\u2019t spend a little extra on quality ingredients. Not sure if eating good food qualifies as \u201cmaterialistic,\u201d but it certainly isn\u2019t necessary. That\u2019s it though. Beyond that, all I need to be a happy camper is a gym membership (but to a cheap gym), the internet, a laptop, a coffee shop nearby, and a public library to be a happy camper. Oh, and a car of course, but owning a car in the southwest of the USA is a necessity. When I lived in Europe I got along without a vehicle just nicely. ",

I live alone - Hence my material possessions are a Bed and a mattress,a few utensils to cook and eat,a laptop to connect to Internet and a phone to reach people or for people to reach me along with my shoes and clothing. I am concerned about these - meaning - I think about scenarios where my bed breaks while sleeping or my clothes tear off or my shoes wear out or my 5 year old phone stops working. Back in India - i lived with my mother with TV and music system as additions to other possessions that i mentioned above. I like minimalistic living and hence I am not overly concerned about the material possessions I have. I am willing to let go of these things as I know i can get them back in a while. I have done that earlier. I could do it again. I am money-oriented - In the sense that i was to put my money where my mouth is. I am not big on investments and savings,but whatever i do,I am careful about that. Does this mean I am materialistic ? Definitely, May Be :) ",

I like to have a nice pc to do my work and enjoy some pastime, I don't wanna give up my shopping trips once every few months. I like shiny things, little decorative stuff, I like to either make them or buy them, I want to have that too. I will not ask for money, I will not date you only because you have money but I will work for money because I like my few pleasures, and i want to keep them. They make me happy in all my troubles. Guess this means that money brings me happiness. I don't care I am what I am. ",

I realize that many people throughout the canvas have different opinions and judgements on this subject. But I truly want to become filthy rich! Why? Because I want to create money and make someone happy by using it. That may come in the form of funding an orphanage, or setting up a dispensary or building a school for education someplace where the concept of books does not exist. Besides the spiritual dimension of the materialistic possession that is money, I want to be filthy rich and create happiness for myself by following my passion. I have a thing for vintage cars and motorcycles so I often observe things that I can buy and restore and sell for good money. Maybe keep something for myself . I wanna travel the world and meet a lot of new people and so I wanna make money in the travel business and trot the globe with many people together. Etc.  Answer based on mere opinion.

            "answer_text": "I'm indeed materialistic but in a really different way! I divide my material requirements into two categories. One as essential materials (like clothing, books and basic materials which are much required for the daily runs) and other class as accessory materials (fancy watches, play stations, costly mobiles, jewelleries, etc without which our life won't be much affected). So whenever I feel I buying an accessory material, I buy it after achieving something. For example, I bought a limited edition watch of Sonata signed by MS Dhoni after scoring 98.72% in my X class.I bought a silver circlet to wear in my hand ( because my favourite kannada hero Vishnuvardhan wore it) after I got first rank in XI class and a gold chain on my first rank in class XII.I bought a laptop after a decent GPA of 9.76 in my first year engineering and a bike in my final year engineering after getting a job.So, basically whatever accessory materials I possess are mostly the token of my achievements! So my materialistic life has a meaning and I have a reason for most of my possessions. My desire to possess something has always led me to achieve something good!! Cheers! ",

(-: TL/DR: I know, I know, this is not a particularly satisfying answer, but it accurately reflects the relative lack of concern I have about any supposed measure of my own materialism--indeed, it's really not something I think about much--but yet also conveys my honest belief that I am nowhere near the extremes on either end of the spectrum when it comes to materialism (or minimalism for that matter). Stated differently, I am entirely comfortable with the extent of my own materialism. If that is not good enough, then let me state specifically for the record that, on a scale of one to ten, I am a six. (Thanks for the A2A, Habib Fanny, and based on your own answer to this question, I suspect that you, too, might also be a six...welcome to the middle!) ",

So naturally cost planning is embedded to my thought process.I don't make too extravagant demands from my parents. I prefer clothes that can be worn rather than to show off.I have no taste for aesthetic and gourmet food. Burger King and KFC are for special occasions so I just prefer street food.I am no HYPEBEAST. I buy shoes which are affordable for me (cost planning genes). All these overpriced and hyped brands are beyond my budget.I always try to bargain for things which I don't even need. I don't plan anything specific before buying. I always buy things which have worth to me.Bargaining enables me to satiate my materialism and considerably reduce my overall expenses.I am a teenager and I also have an inferiority complex. I feel jealous when other children use branded goods but I calm myself saying that all things are achieving the same purpose . So just sit back and relax because you have nothing to lose.",

They have won over materialism.As regards me, I am a pure materialistic person. I earn for a family and at the same time try to save for the future. As I am in the fifties I have the fear of limited years of active service. I probably want to earn more during this period and hence an order of magnitude more materialistic than a young person!",

We went inside that one pompous pandal.( The pandal was like a kings courtroom for people to sit) The Baba was yet to come. I heard from his disciples that he is at some place 2km away from pandal and will arrive shortly. Thinking of a Baba as a simple figure. We thought he might be coming on foot. But whoop an Audi came in 5 minutes.Our Jaws dropped and our expressions changed. Then was the time for his pravachan (preachings). Baba- Live simple, everything in the world will die. Don't go for wordly pleasures, just pray to God and devote yourself to god. Satisfaction with small things, less thing is the way of life.( I shortened the speech of half hour, but these were the main highlights.) Then my eyes went to the rollex watch and branded chappals he was wearing. His round full tummy which told a total different story. I concluded something \u201c Live simple with small Audi, small rollex and a few billions of dollars. Don't be greedy. Be ascetic\u201d ",

People don't buy stuff they don't need for the sake of owning them, they do it to impress others. Thorsten Veblen called it ostentatious consumption. This is not materialism, it's symbolism. People are not buying cars, they are buying a way of life, they are not buying clothes, they are \u201cexpressing themselves\u201d. Most of the stuff we have don't fulfill a purely materialistic value. Your house doesn't just shelter you, it projects your personal branding and shows off your earning abilities. They are not tangible things. That's why we consume too much and why we are not materialistic enough. ",
