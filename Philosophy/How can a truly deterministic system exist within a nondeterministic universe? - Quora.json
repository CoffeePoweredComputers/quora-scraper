            "answer_text": "In my humble and scientifically uninformed opinion, only a probabilistic system can exist within a universe that is not entirely deterministic. Stated in the terms of the question, it is my opinion that a truly deterministic system cannot exist within a nondeterministic universe (assuming nondeterministic universe means a universe that is not entirely deterministic). As I understand the concept of hard determinism, if the universe is entirely deterministic, everything that has ever occurred, is occurring, and will occur since the universe came into existence (however that might have occurred) has been fated to occur (and not necessarily for any intentional or deliberate reason) exactly as it has occurred, is occurring, or will occur, and nothing could possibly occur in any different manner. If the universe is entirely deterministic, nothing is left to chance (even if nothing is intentionally or deliberately planned), and everything is the only way it can be \u2014 even if it is impossible to predict in advance (or even understand entirely after the fact) from within the deterministic universe. On the other hand, in a probabilistic universe, where there is an absence of total determinism, there is no absolutely certain path that all things within the universe must follow, and there is, in essence, some modicum of chance. In a deterministic universe, only one thing is possible \u2014 what is. In a probabilistic universe, virtually anything is possible \u2014 except, perhaps, for the possibility that only one thing is possible. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea is that the laws of physics can be precise, even if they operate in a universe of indeterminacy. So thermodynamics can make precise statements about statistical aggregates. Or quantum mechanics can make precise statements about a quantum wave function. Maybe the way to think of it is that there are two orthogonal concepts at play here: determinacy versus indeterminacyorder versus chaosThe former is about how much we can know (and measure) about stuff in the universe (matter, energy, etc.) The latter is about whether the physical world operates according to patterns that we can ascertain and describe mathematically. It is entirely possible for a universe to be indeterminate as well as operate according to knowable laws. ",
