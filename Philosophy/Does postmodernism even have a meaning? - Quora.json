            "answer_text": "Of course Postmodernism has a meaning. Modern art is considered to be art made 1860 to 1970. Post means \u201cafter\u201d when applied to time periods. Post modern art is art made after 1970 - \u201cAfter Modern art\u201d. As long as people keep making art in the style that has become dominate in western culture the past 30 or 40 years their work will be referred to as \u201cPostmodern\u201d. After that, a new style will dominate. Art being made now is called \u201cContemporary Art\u201d but it is clearly in the same overall style as \u201cPostModern Art\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "In my reading, the pride of postmodern literature is that it rejects Reason as a guide, and rejects any Meaning that applies to everyone. The hero of postmodern literature is, generally speaking, Nietzsche. He turned his back on Reason in favor of the Will to Power. He was an avid Anti-Socialist. The second hero of postmodern literature is, generally, Marx, who claimed that Truth is only what the Ruling Class says it is. He was an avid Socialist. The main things they agreed on was that modern society must be destroyed, and that there is no God. Postmodernism is mainly an endless variation of mixtures of Marx and Nietzsche. ",
