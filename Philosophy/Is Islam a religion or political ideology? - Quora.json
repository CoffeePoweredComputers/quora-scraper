            "answer_text": "What\u2019s a political ideology, basically ? A set of ideas developed to gain power over a group of people by adopting certain tactics/strategies. Does Islam expect all muslims to grow up and become rulers ? The answer is no. Islam tells us to manage our respective businesses in excellent ways. Islam lays down guidelines to successful marriage, parenting, social welfare and other humanitarian issues. If Islam had only been a tool to gain power and authority, the following would not had been the response of the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) : When the polytheistic tribal leaders saw the growing popularity of Islam among Meccans, they tried to negotiate a deal with Allah's Messenger. They expected Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) to drop his mission and tried offering him fame, wealth and power. But Allah's Messenger (pbuh) simply refused them, saying : \u201cBy Allah, If they put sun in my right hand and the moon on my left on the condition that I abandon this course, then I would not abandon this course until Allah makes me victorious or I perish therein.\u201d (The Sealed Nectar). Islam is a religion. The only religion that leads you to the true God. Because Allah Himself indicates that there is just one single path to bliss: \u201cIhdinas siratal mustaqeem\u201d.(surah fatiha) The term \u201cSiraat\u201d, in english translated as \u201cpath\u201d, has no plural in the Arabic language. The other words for \u201cpath\u201d in Arabic \u2014 sabeel, tareeq, shari' ,etc. \u2014 do have plurals but not \u201csiraat\u201d. This further exemplifies why the path to paradise is one, single path. If you wander from this, you can't take another route and expect to reach your destination. Rather, you got to restart from the junction you got astray. Islam is a complete religion. It touches every aspect of human life and doesn't leave man wondering as to what's right and wrong. It safeguards the rights of the weak, marginalised and dependents. Islam is a religion introduced by God and He has created it for the guidance of mankind.. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost Islam is a religion. Political ideology is an integrated set of activities and affairs that characterizes the thinking of a group of people involved in managing a nation or a government. In politics it does not require you to believe in a higher power but in religion it is a necessity to believe in a higher divine power. The ultimate goal of Islam is not to rule a nation but if a group of people desire to do so then Islam has elements that can also benefit the nation as a whole when it comes to governance. Previously Rashidun rulers (632 - 661 AD) showed that based on Quran and Sunnah it is possible to rule a country. The ruler has to be honest and just. In Islamic governance, it is very important to treat minority religious groups with care. The constitution of Medina was a perfect example where rights of non-muslims were given a priority. Now I\u2019ll just discuss the religion part here because nowadays you can use almost anything politically like identity, race, color, language and nationality. In order for something to be a religion it has to have certain features. I will try to talk about the major world religions in an unbiased way. All the major world religions exhibit some common traits mentioned below like: a) History of origin (either to a place or person)b) Concept of a deity or a higher powerc) Origin of mankindd) Concept of salvatione) Concept of worshipf) Concept of recorded scripturesg) Basic geographical history For Example: Christianity: originated in Israelfounder was Jesus of Nazareth (4 BC - 29 AD)Jesus as the savior of mankind\u2019s salvation (Jesus\u2019s sacrifice eliminates mankind\u2019s moral debt to Godconcept of higher beings like Father, Son and Holy Spiritshas concept like eternal afterlife, heaven and hellhas forms of worship and religious occasionshas scriptures like Bible (Old and New Testament)Judaism: originated in modern day Palestine; Juda was the fourth son of Jacobfounder was Abraham (2000 BC)Yahweh as supreme beingMaintaining and keeping God\u2019s promise makes you God\u2019s chosen peoplehas concepts of Messiahhas religious texts and occassionsIslam: originated in Saudi Arabiahas concepts of messengers (Abraham, Jacob and Moses etc) and Muhammad was the final oneAllah is the only higher beingbelieved was revealed to Muhammad by Allah during the 7th century ADHumans get salvation and goes to paradise by complete submission to Allah (Islam comes from the root \u2018aslama\u2019 or complete submission to Allah)Humans were created by AllahConcepts of worship like 5 times prayer, fasting, pilgrimage to MeccaQuran as the primary scripturehas religious occasionsZoroastrianism: originated in parts of Persia (modern day Iran)Zoroaster was the founder during 6th century BCbased on concept of struggle between light (good) and dark (evil)used Atar (fire) in worship or as a symbolhas texts like Avestahas concepts of higher beings like angels and demonsJainism: originated in Indiafounder was Nataputta vardhamana (599 - 527 BC)emphasizes asceticism, immortality and transmigration of soulsdenies the existence of a perfect supreme beinggoal is (Moksa or Nirvana) similar to Hinduism and Buddhism but only way is self-denialhas texts like Jain AgamasHinduism: originated in Indiano particular founder, formed through studies of various like minded religious and spiritual teachersbeliefs in supreme beings of various forms and naturesbeliefs in reincarnation (could be in various forms like animals)goal is to achieve moksa (similar to nirvana)meditation, yoga, avoiding bad karma, self-denial leads to moksahas various Sanskrit texts and religious scriptures like Rigveda and Upanishadshas religious occassionsBuddhism: originated in India/parts of Chinafounder was Siddhartha Gautama (563 - 480 BC)no supreme being but all are part of wholenirvana is the cessation of selfmeditation, yoga, self-denial leads to nirvanahas text like Tripitaka",
