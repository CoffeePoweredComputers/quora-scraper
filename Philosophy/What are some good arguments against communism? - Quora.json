            "answer_text": "I would use these arguments; 1 . It\u2019s a Godless religion, giving false promises to people. The vision of classless, moneyless and a society without government is just a pipe dream. It\u2019s really a version of communists heaven, nothing more. Classes do exist in one way or another in a society. A high school drop out should be treated as equal as a neurosurgeon or a scientist, and hence they are socially, and economically equal is laughable concept. 2. The biggest problem with communism is that it says every business exploits labor and make money. The value of commodity is not only dependent on manufacture cost+labor cost as suggested by Marx. Communists seriously need to learn a bit of economics. Perhaps Marx didn\u2019t knew about demand and supply. 2. Marx never worked for a single day of his life. Look it up if you want. 3. It\u2019s based on a sacred book; just like a religion. 4. Communists are intolerant with the people who don\u2019t agree with their ideology. 5. It\u2019s highly impractical that people in one part of country would know about the needs and necessity of other people across every corner of the nation and would be willing to work for someone else\u2019s benefit. Also. people would only work for your benefit as long as they are familiar with you, but the masses are just a faceless crowd. 6. Marx didn\u2019t tell us what to do with people who are not willing to give up their personal property to the state, or refuse to believe in their ideology. uh\u2026murder? 7. No communism has ever worked in history because it is not based on any scientific evidence, but assumptions. All we have are books that tell us how things should work. 8. It starts with \u201crevolution\u201d from the very start, which means forcefully taking over by using violent measures and killing, and then establishing \u201cdictatorship of proletariat\u201d. we know from history that any system with the word \u201c dictatorship\u201d in it, is not good political system. 9. You could never have a kid name Bill Gates or Steve Jobs invent a personal computer in their basement,or Mark Zuckerberg make Facebook and get rich in a communist society. Companies like Apple,Microsoft and Google would not even have started and revolutionized the IT industry if USA was communism like china. Which brings us to; 10. Lack of innovation. Communist society is bad at innovation. China is a proof. All it is ever good at is making cheap crappy copies of a well known product, as no intellectual property rights exists in such country. They are bad on this department. 11. People,especially communist will argue that no communism has ever been implemented and china is not communism, but the thing is, communism is just a fantasy. There will always be class or groups as long as people exist in one form or the other. A common example is,( I am pointing finger at you Communists) You and the ones who hate this very word. You look down upon capitalists and they look down upon you as hypocrites. 12. Death counts by communists are incomprehensible. 13. Do the communist really think that the owner of the business who worked 24/7 and established a company from ground up, has no right to his own company, whereas the person who just happened to work as a janitor for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for the past six months should have the full claim to the company? This is ridiculous concept. ",

            "answer_text": "Communism is based on two ideological pillars: the Work Theory of Value - the theory that the value of a product is given by the amount of work invested in itthe principle of Dialectical and Historical Materialism - the idea that the main motor of societal change is the development of the means of production and the main drive is the essentially materialist struggle between opposites, whose supreme form is the class struggle between exploiters and the exploitedBoth premises are wrong: the Work Theory of Value applies (in limited form) to production of material commodities. Investment Banking, liberal arts, law & consulting, localized services, software engineering or many other form of \u201csoft economy\u201d escape that model. Marx himself avoided banking in his Das Kapital because he knew very well that it goes contrary to his theoriesmany events of planetary importance had nothing to do with the development of the means of production. A couple of examples:the Bubonic Plague changed the work relationships in Europe leading to a wage-based economy, the fundamentals of capitalismthe milk-tolerant genes of the Mongols combined with diminishing of pastures in Central Asian steppes led to Tatar invasions of Europe that decisively pulled the balance of power and influence towards the West - a superiority that continues today (but it wasn\u2019t the case 1000 years ago)the visions of Constantine legalised Christianity institutionalising the Church and the visions of Muhammad produced Islam - both events having a deep impact on humanity while being completely parallel to the development of the means of productionthe truce between Tories and Labour to sustain a coalition lead by Churchill allowed Britain to stand the Nazis - which put the bases of the Anglo-American alliance. Without that truce in Westminster the world today would look very different (even if the Russians would have defeated Germany alone)\u2026. and so on \u2026The proof that Communism was a false dogma stays in the words of Marx himself: he predicted the proletarian revolution to start in England, continue in France, spread to Belgium and Germany. It started in Russia and it was imposed by force in Eastern Europe, China and pretty much anywhere else. Capitalism did not crumble under its own weight - it proved flexible enough to adjust despite its profound inequalities. Ironically, the one that crumbled under its own weight was \u2026 Communism.
