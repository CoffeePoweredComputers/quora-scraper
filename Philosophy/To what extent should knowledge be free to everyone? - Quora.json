            "answer_text": "Knowledge should be free for everybody What does \"knowledge should be free\" mean? Everybody should be taught to read and write.Everybody should get free internet access (e.g. by providing computers in libraries)Scientific studies that were (complete or partially) funded by the country should be put online and be available without charge.Schoolbooks should be available online for free (for everybody, not only citizens!) and as a printed version that only covers the cost of printing. They should be written by teachers that get paid by the country.Any material created by teachers in public schools (that was created while they were employed) should be under CC+BY license.What does it not mean? Privately funded studies can still be kept private. Books written by authors that did not receive public funding can still be sold at any price.Why should knowledge be free? It provides chances for poor people.It could help poor countries.We - as a society - might get better educated and make decisions that are better. What consequences do I draw from this? I write Wikipedia articles / make images for Wikipedia: Benutzer:MartinThoma \u2013 WikipediaI created a free mathematics book:MartinThoma/LaTeX-examplesI share some of my knowledge on my blog:A blog about Code, the Web and Cyberculture.",
