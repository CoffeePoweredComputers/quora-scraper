            "answer_text": "This is not just true in relational quantum mechanics. It was already true in the Dirac-von Neumann interpretation of quantum mechanics, and before that it was true in Einstein\u2019s 1905 treatment of special relativity. It was even true in the Scholium to Newton\u2019s Principia, in which Newton noted that observed values are relative values, and that absolute values are metaphysical assumptions needed only to give his formulae meaning (in the absence of a fully relationist framework, as given by Einstein in relativity and Dirac and von Neumann in qm). As Eddington put it (1923) \u201cA physical quantity is defined by the series of operations and calculations of which it is the result.\u201d IOW physical quantities have no other meaning than that generated by measurement processes determined by observers. The difference between these treatments and relational quantum mechanics is that these treatments relate what is said directly to observed mathematical structure, whereas relational quantum mechanics (like so many modern \u201cinterpretations\u201d) consists only of handwavy arguments showing only that the author has not done his homework. Had he done his homework, he would not have pretended to a new interpretation, but would have realised that he had nothing useful to add. ",
