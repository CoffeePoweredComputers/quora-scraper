If a person has been through hell and is still standing strong, and giving out philosophy on life may be that means that person is urging you to be strong and may be wished if they got that philosophy in their hard times, only then life must've been a little less complicated. Experience is a powerful tool, it is only felt. Philosophical method may not solve your problem but atleast gives you strength to face your problem. ",
