            "answer_text": "No, Karl Marx spoke out against things like imperialism and colonialism. He was ethnically jewish for god's sake, why would he be racist? He was against slavery in the new world and even wrote a letter to abraham lincoln calling for all slaves to be freed in the U.S.A. Ironically lincoln is a hero in the american ethos but he took alot from marx in both his fiscal and social policies. Also if marx was racist than how would his ideas be so popular in places like Angola,Cuba and china which are all inhabited by people of color? Hmm? Would they really follow such a man who hated them? ",
