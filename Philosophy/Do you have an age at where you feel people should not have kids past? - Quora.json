I could not have cared for him properly if my mother had not recently retired and dropped everything to give me the help I desperately needed. (My husband treated his newborn son as if he were a bomb that might explode at any moment. Once our child started talking and walking his father transformed into a good dad.) If it hadn\u2019t been for my mother I would have had to put him up for adoption. In my case, I have a disability; other women might handle it better. In my opinion, you shouldn\u2019t have a child if you are not likely to live to see that child graduate high school. ",
