You can adopt a few avoidance strategies to reduce the fallout. Get over it and enjoy the company of the real friends you have. 8. You learn from failure. Everybody screws up.

Toxic company is bad for you. You know the people I mean. These are the whiners, the pessimists, the miserable ones, the cheap ones, the nasty types, and the prejudiced. They make a lousy team. Try to gravitate towards the optimistic and passionate people who will help you see the brighter side of life. 11. Money is tight. Nobody wants to be stalked by debt or creditors. You have to work out how best to stay within your budget. Think of ways to save, like having packed lunches. Never go shopping without a list. Avoid impulsive buys. Use cash as much as you can. Leave the credit cards at home as they tend to lull you into a fantasy world. 12. Invest in kindness. Doing acts of kindness every day to people at work or those in difficulty will pay handsome dividends. People will return the kindness. Investing in kindness is like having savings in the bank. They will always earn a little interest. What goes around comes around. There is also an added bonus in that it makes you feel good for a while. 13. Be accountable for your behavior. If you behave badly, rudely or take unnecessary risks, then you have to be totally accountable for what you have done. You have to take the responsibility for your behavior. Another harsh lesson from the life arena! Taking the consequences, not blaming others and apologizing for harm done have to be on your to do list. 14. Look forward. There is no escape.

In 1881 a Greek expedition ws commissioned by the US Government to collect meteorological data from the North Pole and was billed as the most ambitious scientific research mission ever dent to the Arctic. Adolphus Greely, a Civil War veteran, and his party made it further North than any preceding expeditions but in in 1883 his ship hit an iceberg and sank. With no food, he and his crew began to starve. Three years later of the original 25, Greely and his emaciated colleagued were found still alive. The rest had perished. Given the length of time they had spent on the frozen barren ice without any food, how had they stayed alive. Half-eaten remains of the deceased crew members pointed to one direction - cannibalism.Even if you are a king, in a battle, you can end up being meat on the hoof! At the battle of Hastings in 1066, this is what happened to king Harold according to an eye-witness. \u201cHe was killed by an arrow through his eye. The first Norman knight split Harold\u2019s chest, driving the point of his sword through the king\u2019s shield. The gushing torrent of blood drenched the Earth. The second knight struck off his head below the helmet and the third stabbed the inside of the belly with a lance. The fourth cut off his leg and carried it away.\u201d",
