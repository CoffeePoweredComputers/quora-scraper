            "answer_text": "I am not much a fan of this type of question, because it invites cherry-picking. I do have two Rousseauvian ideas, one of which is very common today, and one of which I think should be. Rousseau is a very important thinker in the development of the idea (or counter-idea) in the West of the virtues of the natural (and with it the virtue of small scale). Rousseau\u2019s Second Discourse on the Origins of Inequality \u2026. Is an extended argument that men are by nature good (or perhaps amoral) and that civilization corrupts. Rousseau is obviously not the only major thinker to hold this view, but he is one of the few major *political* thinkers to do so. Anytime today that you see someone praising the natural over the artificial, or organics, or small societies, or localism, you can probably see Rousseau\u2019s ideas at work. Rousseau in the *Social Contract* makes a sharp distinction between the sovereign (the general will, which we might think of as the common interest or the common values of the society as a whole) and the government (or administration), and he sees the government as tending to act counter to the general will (and in the government\u2019s own interest). I find this analysis very telling when applied to the major representative democracies of the west. Look at the US, where the standard data show that most people favor abortion, most favor government-mandated health care, most favor increased taxes on the rich, most favor a decent social safety net, and yet the government (given my politics, I\u2019d say as long as the Republicans effectively control one chamber of Congress, and especially when they control more) actively opposes what the people think. (Yes, poll data are not the same as the general will. But you get the idea.) Connected to the above, but really more generally, Rousseau\u2019s ideas continue to be powerful among some critics of contemporary society. This is not surprising, because the Second Discourse is basically a critique of modern society and the Social Contract a critique of modern government. ",

            "answer_text": "Are Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ideas still used today in government and society, compared to those of other enlightenment thinkers? Actually, Rousseau\u2019s politcla ideas were never used, so this question is redundant. The reason is that Rousseau\u2019s idea of democracy has nothing to with either anncient or modern democracy. to give an example, he considered the primarily clan and feud-based politics of Corsica \u2018truly democratic\u2019. Which shows a rather shallow level of knowledge of political Corsica. The only idea of Rousseau that did catch on was that of the \u2018social contract\u2019, accoerding to whcih the citizens of a society enter into a contract to have a government. Again, this sounds democratic (albeit a-historical), but once the citizens have a government there is no further need for actual democracy. Instead, Rousseau goes on about a \u2018will of the people\u2019, about which it is not quite clear where that is supposed to reside. However, Rousseau was essentially a political romantic and we see the idea of the \u2018will of the people\u2019resurface in 20th century Fascism, which, besides its obvious extremism, was also politically romantic. At any rate, Rousseau didn\u2019t have very practical ideas about government and society, as is also exemplified by his bizarre notions on education. (He actually tried hsi ideas on education out on his own son and that didn\u2019t turn out particularly well.) ",

            "answer_text": "I wish, at least, that some governments would adopt his libertarianism (not libertinism) in part. Unfortunately, all governments tend towards more and tighter control over its citizens and the government itself becomes like a \u201cliving organism\u201d (separate and apart from its citizenry) where its main purpose is to survive, grow stronger in power and perpetuate itself. Sadly, all governments move in that direction. As a result, some thinkers want anarchy (not great, either) although I wish we would tend towards LESS government and not more. ",

            "answer_text": "Rousseau\u2019s political philosophy was taken seriously by the Founders of the United States Constitution, along with the other leading political philosophers of Western Civilization, such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Locke, Machiavelli, etc. The Founders pondered the political opinions of all the best thinkers and crafted the Constitution on that foundation. I studied all those political thinkers and was stunned to find their ideas clearly reflected in the Founders\u2019 discussions. Part if the strength of the U.S. Constitution is that it is not based on the thinking of only one or two political philosophers, as, for example, Marxism. ",
