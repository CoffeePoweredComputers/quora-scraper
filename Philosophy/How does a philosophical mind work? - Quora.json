            "answer_text": "I can only speak for myself :) Philosophy is literally a \u201clove of wisdom\u201d. As such, it requires curiosity, a willingness to question assumed facts, and explore new thoughts and areas of knowledge. I do not subscribe to dogmatic philosophical concepts. Wisdom is stated in every(?) philosophic, theological, and scientific discipline. I think that philosophy is holistic and involves the whole of life. I use \u201clife\u201d in its\u2019 most expansive and sometimes esoteric meaning. ",

            "answer_text": "I see an apple. What is the history of the apple? Was it always like this down a long line of ancestors? Of course not. It evolved, there is ample evidence of it. However, how could we know? We can explore the artwork of past generations, to find out how selective breeding changed how the apple looks. Why we went for what we go for largely depends on human tastes, and since human beings evolve much more slowly than an apple, we can assume the remained relatively constant. In this case, an apple today may have tasted just as delicious to someone in the past if we created a wormhole and passed it back to them. In that case, wouldn\u2019t they plant the seeds and have a head-start? What would that do to the apples we see today? Would they be even more sweet and tasty looking? Given that time travel is only science fiction at this point in time and there is no evidence that it will ever cease to be so just yet, especially with all the paradoxes and investigation into the nature of time as an abstraction. I\u2019m going to eat that apple now. ",
