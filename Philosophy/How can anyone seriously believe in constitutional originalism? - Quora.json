            "answer_text": "\u201cHow can anyone seriously believe in constitutional originalism?\u201d Because we don\u2019t believe in slavery. When the corrupt government uses case law and precedence to continuously find loopholes to violate the Constitution, they try to sell the idea of a living constitution to the gullible. Constitution was instituted to secure our natural unalienable rights. Has your rights somehow changed? Do you no longer have a right to life? Do you no longer have a right to liberty? Do you no longer have a right to property? Slaves didn\u2019t have these rights. But thanks to originalism, the words of the Declaration still are relevant, \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed\u201d What is the problem with these principles? How is this thought evil or racist or fascist? Originalism goes to the Constitution, \u201cin Order to form a more perfect Union\u201d This means we can improve our society with time when the government is there to \u201csecure these rights\u201d and allow people in society to \u201cform a more perfect Union\u201d without the worry of people causing us harm like the current government is doing. There are people that lie to us about the actual meaning of originalism, either due to ignorance or purposefully, because they want to change our government. The purpose of the Constitution is to protect our rights. Our rights do not change. People that claim the framers couldn\u2019t anticipate the internet do not understand. The framers said \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d. My email is my personal effects. It is my modern day papers. The government is there. It has the ability to do this, but the Constitution forbids them from looking without a warrant based on probable cause. The government could walk into the post office any time it chooses and look at my mail. The government could walk into the post office and demand they provide lists of all mail and copies of the content. Why don\u2019t they do it? Because they need a warrant. And the framers did know of education. Why then did they not put education in article one section eight? Because that was not a function of securing our unalienable rights. It was left, see Amendment X, to the people. The Education Department is a violation of the Constitution. And the poor education today is the reason they didn\u2019t include it. Originalism is not an unbelievable annoyance. Calvin Coolidge explained quite well why the principles are not open to the \u201cliving constitution. He was addressing the silliness of the racist progressive Democrat Woodrow Wilson and ilk. \u201cAbout the Declaration there is a finality that is exceedingly restful. It is often asserted that the world has made a great deal of progress since 1776, that we have had new thoughts and new experiences which have given us a great advance over the people of that day, and that we may therefore very well discard their conclusions for something more modern. But that reasoning can not be applied to this great charter. If all men are created equal, that is final. If they are endowed with inalienable rights, that is final. If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is final. No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions. If anyone wishes to deny their truth or their soundness, the only direction in which he can proceed historically is not forward, but backward toward the time when there was no equality, no rights of the individual, no rule of the people. Those who wish to proceed in that direction can not lay claim to progress. They are reactionary. Their ideas are not more modern, but more ancient, than those of the Revolutionary fathers.\u201d People that do not respect originalism, do not understand the true meaning. They have been lied to and taught to believe people do not have rights that need to be protected by governments. Bastiat said, \u201cLife, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.\u201c Our rights do not come from government. The Bill of Rights was added after the Constitution, to remind government that these rights CANNOT be violated. And the Bill of Rights didn\u2019t exist in the Articles of Confederation. \u201cIf every person has the right to defend even by force \u2014 his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly. Thus the principle of collective right \u2014 its reason for existing, its lawfulness \u2014 is based on individual right. And the common force that protects this collective right cannot logically have any other purpose or any other mission than that for which it acts as a substitute. Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force \u2014 for the same reason \u2014 cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.\u201c The democracy cannot violate our rights. That is not \u201cjust\u201d and the Declaration says, \u201cderiving their just powers from the consent of the governed\u201d. \u201cBut, unfortunately, law by no means confines itself to its proper functions. And when it has exceeded its proper functions, it has not done so merely in some inconsequential and debatable matters. The law has gone further than this; it has acted in direct opposition to its own purpose. The law has been used to destroy its own objective: It has been applied to annihilating the justice that it was supposed to maintain; to limiting and destroying rights which its real purpose was to respect. The law has placed the collective force at the disposal of the unscrupulous who wish, without risk, to exploit the person, liberty, and property of others. It has converted plunder into a right, in order to protect plunder. And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order to punish lawful defense.\u201c That is what the living constitution is. That is why our children will be paying taxes on money government spent on us and they will also pay their own taxes. That is the evil of the big government big spenders. We are selfish and greedy. Originalism protects the country we inherited for the future generations and when originalism is obeyed we should leave them \u201ca more perfect Union\u201d. Unfortunately the living constitution crowd, the progressives, has been forming a more backwards union for a hundred years. They are taking us away from the protections designed to protect us from exactly them. ",

            "answer_text": "Originalism is nonsense on stilts for dozens of different reasons. Just one of them: the founders did not believe that their intentions mattered in interpreting the constitution. We know this because they were educated in common law, and at common-law the intentions of a document writer do not count in interpreting the document. But your question should not be limited to this constitutional topic. Rather you ask how reasonably intelligent and serious people can believe anything that is clearly false. Creationism comes to mind. The answer is that for most people, beliefs are a way of showing loyalty to their tribe. This is what keeps most religions going. To say you believe something doesn\u2019t mean you believe it\u2019s really true, it means you want to belong to a tribe of people who will protect you, so you mouth the same mottos and slogans that other members of your tribe utter. For most people, their belief statements are really like cheers for a team at a football game. Supporters of Donald Trump today do this all the time. \u201cLock her up. Send them back.\u201c Humans are tribal because the tribe is what keeps us feeling safe from all sorts of dangers. People take their tribal slogans very seriously. The best example now in the constitution is those who claim the second amendment provides a personal right to pack heat in violation of state law. This is absolutely not what the second amendment says. In fact it says almost opposite, since it protects the power of states to choose how they organize their state militias. But for fearful people, feeling that they belong to a tribe that loves guns will make them feel safe, so it\u2019s really easy to understand how serious people believe in this nonsense. ",

I am reading Neil Gorsuch\u2019s new book, \u201cA Republic, if you can keep it,\u201d and it extolls the virtues of originalism as the only interpretive method to interpret the Constitution. What he does not discuss at all in the book is the Heller decision and how wording that had a meaning in 1787 in the 2nd Amendment, which Scalia (who he loved) called prefatory language. 4,500 words including 39 signatories, and the convention delegates added a few words with no binding impact. He also does not explain how first amendment jurisprudence works, with the admonition being Congress shall make no law\u2026. Finally, he refers to Dred Scott as a matter of a living constitution. ",

            "answer_text": "Because we have an understanding that words mean specific things according to the context in which they are used. And the meaning of legal words, specifically, should be immutable in accordance with their context. Laws are crafted to address specific issues and the wording of those laws is chosen for use within that context, giving them a certain meaning and definition. To change the meaning of the words is to change the meaning and application of the law without going through the proper processes. Language changes over time, as does the common definitions of many words, but the law should never be so casually altered. For the objective rule of law to be effective, the meaning and intent of the law when debated and passed must be the meaning and intent that is applied, today and tomorrow. If laws need to be updated, altered or amended, there is a process for doing so. That process has nothing to do with arbitrary or activist redefinition of terms. Judges are tasked with the proper application of law in deciding cases. They are constrained by their oaths to follow the law as written. As the Constitution is the foundation for all legal authority in the country, the laws set down within and in accordance with that document must be applied as the words written were understood in the context of when they were written and approved. Otherwise, the \u201crule of law\u201d (as well as the guarantee of equality before the law for all citizens) becomes suspect. The Constitution is the basis for the Rule of Law in this country and is, literally, the Law of the Land. Thus, common sense and justice mandate that judges utilize an Originalist understanding of the Constitution. ",
