            "answer_text": "To some extent, yes. Being \u2018judgmental\u2019 is one of those qualities like anger, having an impression from superficial observation of appearances (e.g.: \u2018judging a book by its cover\u2019), or acknowledging that some qualities that are not bad too often correlate with qualities that are (e.g.: recognizing the stigmas often have a basis - such as we shouldn\u2019t look down upon the poor as moral bankrupt and prone to be violent criminals\u2026but if you want to walk home in the middle of the night through 1 of 2 urban neighborhoods, one wealthy and one poor, which would you pick?) that gets a bad rap. One could get the idea that these are all dysfunctional, deplorable things\u2026so why are they in the human condition, not weeded out via natural selection? Because they serve some functions! If your daughter dates a guy and you find out he used to beat his now ex-girl friend, hey, glad to hear he reformed, but here\u2019s a thought\u2026NO!!! Let\u2019s say your son dates a woman who\u2019s been a heroin addict and was a drug dealer. Again, glad to hear she\u2019s reformed\u2026but NO!!! It might not be wise to hire her for a job working a cash register, either. You know the old saying about the \u2018exception that proves the rule?\u2019 Well, throw out an example of a stigmatized quality, like I just did, and some people will try to refute your assertion with anecdotal examples of cases where someone really did reform, became a fine, upstanding whatever, etc\u2026 Not good enough. I like the told saying \u2018The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong\u2026but that\u2019s the way to bet.\u2019 Often in life, we don't have the luxury of knowing how things are going to go down. We can work to stack the odds in our favor by factoring reasonably expected probabilities into our decision-making. I\u2019m not talking about antagonizing people to be mean. I\u2019m talking about recognizing possible trouble and avoiding it for the safety and wellbeing of my loved ones and myself. We\u2019re supposed to seek wisdom that we may discern and exercise sound judgment. There are things we\u2019re supposed to be judgmental about. It\u2019s a dangerous quality, like fire, and likewise best handled carefully. But don\u2019t leave home without it. ",

            "answer_text": "I think everyone is judgemental, in their own way. I am a firm believer in \u201ceveryone has the right to have their own opinions and ideals.\u201d However, I drawn the line if someone tries to impose their beliefs or opinions on me. Live and let live! For instance, I am a Christian. I don\u2019t preach my beliefs to anyone, I simply live my life, go to work and try to treat everyone with respect. I\u2019m not a Preacher. I have, however, had encounters with very angry, obnoxious Atheists, trying to change my mind, or \u201ceducate\u201d me on the theory of evolution, or simply call me names because they feel their opinion is correct and I am wrong. WHY? Why not just leave us Christians alone? We\u2019re not hurting anyone. Another area where I have judgments, is current fashion in North America. Some of the clothes that people wear, I just shake my head and smile. But that\u2019s just me and if women feel comfortable walking around in 5\u2033 heels, short skirts, low cut blouses, and too much makeup, then go for it. I also take issue with older rich men who marry young beautiful women. But I suppose that the women are in it for the money, men are in it for sex, each person gets what they want, so live and let live. I have yet to meet ANYONE who is NOT judgemental. If anyone says they aren\u2019t judgemental, I simply don\u2019t believe them. But I keep it to myself (and smile.) No Judging Here ! ",

            "answer_text": "This is kind of a thing with me. I used to make snap judgments about people based on their looks. I would look at a woman in her 60s with her hair dyed pink and think \u201cyou are too old for that\u201c but then I would think \u201cso what? \u201c If it makes her happy, who am I to judge? Or when the fashion for pregnant women changed from maternity clothes to tight clothes, I thought \u201cwhy would you want to show off that big belly when you can conceal it?\u201d But then I thought \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019re proud, good for you!\u201d And then I begin to stop judging people based on their looks but on their actions. But then I thought \u201cI don\u2019t know why this person is acting this way. Did her dog just die? Did her husband leave her? Did his home just get foreclosed on? \u201c And I realized that I can\u2019t judge people based on their actions either. A lot of people do things that are completely out of character for different reasons. And then I came to the conclusion that the harsher I judge people on earth, that is how much harsher I will be judged in heaven and so I make a conscious decision not to be judgemental. ",

My mother was so judgmental and mentally ill, I vowed to be as honest as I could be so I would not be mentally ill like her. In this journey, I found out Jesus represented unconditional love which means no judgment, criticism or condemnation. This is real love. I have spent years out growing my judgment as I want to send out unconditional love which is also called maturity or Christ Consciousness. I catch myself more quickly if I go into judgment and change my attitude quickly today to see only the good in the person, instead. ",

But when we actually start talking to that person we get to know about that person and our opinions or point of view change about them . This is just basic human nature and is a part of life.

Instead I will bare these things in mind but allow these thoughts to be flexible, updated and challenged without having any need to ever form a final judgement that has to be set in stone. There are times when I have to make decisions and draw conclusions based upon the information that I have to hand and so long as I am confident that I can make a decision on what I know then I will do so but should with the benefit of hindsight my decision is no longer appropriate then I will adjust and amend it accordingly.
