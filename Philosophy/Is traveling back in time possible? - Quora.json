            "answer_text": "It is been theorized that it could be possible by traveling fast enough. Since the faster and closer to the speed of light you get the more time slows in your sence. So the theory is if you were to surpass the speed of light time would slow to a stop and then begin traveling backwards for just you. However this has not been proven and would be extremely expensive and difficult to do so. When we sent particles in space going near the speed of light they burned up and disapeared into energy rather than moving up the matter cycle into a gas. So you could either go back in time or burn up and become energy by going fast enough. ",

            "answer_text": "In physically sense - no! But you should differentiate a looking back to data which are historical. A famous example are long ago first time created stars or other orbital objects whose light needed years of time till it came to us. That\u2019s a really looking back in time. ",
