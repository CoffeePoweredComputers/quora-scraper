            "answer_text": "Social anthropology begins for the most practical of reasons: the need for colonial empires to understand their subjects. Early anthropologists were often army commanders or colonial administrators. The reason why such an academic institution as the University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) covers Africa and the Orient is that, guess what, London was the centre of the British Empire, and African and Asian (Oriental) colonies formed most of it. You may take a dim view of this and call it colonialist, imperialist or whatever, but it was necessary at the time, and many anthropologists became in fact advocates and even admirers of the people they studied. Edward Evans-Pritchard\u2019s work on the Nuer of the Nile, which is regarded as classic and is read by every SOAS student, often shows an ill-concealed admiration for this tall and handsome tribe, \u201cstriding along like the masters of the world\u201d. (That was not always the case; the private diaries of Bronislaw Malinowski, another great classic of social anthropology, surprised the whole scholarly world, when published, by showing that he had come to really dislike some of his Melanesian study subjects. But that makes it all the more admirable that his analysis was so rigorous and unprejudiced.) But even after the end of the colonial empires, social anthropology remains a primary instrument for cultures to understand each other - and many anthropologists these days are local and study their own ancestral cultures.

            "answer_text": "In a world where interconectedness increasingly forces very different groups of people to interact every day, anthropology has barely helped our capacity to understand each other keep up with our capacity and will to anhialate each other. Learning how to understand people who are radically different from yourself is anthropology\u2019s greatest gift to humanity. We\u2019d be better off if more people engaged in it. ",
