            "answer_text": "Plato was hardly an atheist, although I am not even sure the term could be applied diachronically. For a long time, \u201catheism\u201d was only an insult, and meant \u201cpeople who do not believe in our god\u201d. The first people To be called \u201catheists\u201d where the Christians\u2014-according to some people\u2014- since the Christians disbelieved in the Roman divinities. Then again, the platonists and neoplatonists theologians were called \u201catheists\u201d by the Christians. Modern \u201catheism\u201d is a version of Christianity; atheists defend the same notion of God (even if it is only to deny it), and are usually more dogmatic than Catholics concerning \u201cMatter\u201d, the second God of Aristotle . I don\u2019t think the word \u201catheism\u201d makes any genuine sense, and it cannot be applied to Plato, who I think, created science (doubt + dialog + observation), which includes theology. Science will be rejuvenated the day theology comes back to academe, so that we can doubt and discuss theories in that field too. Science is doubt, and an awareness that we can\u2019t proclaim truth, but only theories, and these can always be improved upon or abandoned, in any field. The current separation of science and religion is only a political manoeuvre to steal people's money and get control of populations. ",

            "answer_text": "Plato was certainly not a materialist all you have to do is read Phaedo and skip to the death of Socrates. Plato is certainly advocating for the existence of the soul and some sort of spiritual existence. He flat out argues there is life after death.  Of course this does not directly pertain to belief in God but the reader is probably already getting the idea that Plato is not in the materialist club. The Demiurge In Plato's book The Timaeus he describes the Demiurge. The word Demiurge means \u201ccraftsman\u201d. Plato believed there is a \u201ccraftsman\u201d who used the forms (the forms being the original idea of something) to created things out of our physcial world. He seemed to believe that both the world and the Demiurge were eternal. This Demiurge would take the stuff from what Plato called the \u201cRecepticle\u201d and formed our present world out of it. The reason that our world is flawed is because we are living in a world that seeks to copy the forms which are perfect. Because we are made out of the \u201cstuff\u201d from the Recepticle the world can not be as good as the forms (the ideas that are in the mind of the Demiurge). So yes I would say that Plato believed in an eternal creator. Is his idea of God what modern day people think of? Not even close but I do think it fits the bill for being belief in God. ",
