            "answer_text": "Because unless they have been \u201cthere\u201d where the victim stands now, or experienced a similar situation, it can appear \u201cas if\u201d the poor victim is talking nonsense or speaking \u201cout or turn or order\u201d. There is a very old saying, \u201cThe truth is stranger than the fiction\u201d. We have this saying in French too. it means the same thing in both languages. Fictional Detective Sherlock Holmes described this position well, when the writer, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, wrote \u201cAfter every other possibility has been explored, whatever it is that remains, however unlikely or improbable, is the very simple truth\u201d. often the real truth can seem like an incredibly elaborate story, but is indeed the very \u201csimple truth\u201d. Also some people simply refuse to listen because it involves them or someone they know and like. They would rather \u201cpreserve their comfort zone\u201d than face the reality of the truth, that perhaps someone in their circle is not after all what they purported to be, and the one accussing them, however unpopular they might have become, is telling the truth to them. Sometimes criminals band together, and make false and lying witness against innocent persons to try to cover up what they and their friends did. In cases like these, often the victim has the \u201cdevils own job\u201d to convince the Police or otehrs of the truthfullness of their story experiences. Legal Justice is incredibly slow, expensive and frustrating sometimes. but that DOES NOT MEAN the person has given up or stopped the process\u2026.. It has been known to take years sometimes, but the \u201ctruth\u201d will \u201cout\u201d in the finish. it always does\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s fear, either physical fear of being victimized themselves (or someone they love being victimized) or a psychological fear of having their worldview challenged. Seeing a victim of any kind can make people fear for their own safety and disbelieving or blaming the victim is a way to feel safe. \u201cOh, I\u2019d never get robbed, I have an alarm system,\u201d or \u201cOnly trampy girls get harassed; my daughter is a good girl so no one will bother her,\u201d or even \u201cThis is a safe neighborhood, so she must be lying about having been mugged.\u201d It\u2019s not easy to face the fact that you can take precautions, do everything \u201cright,\u201d and still be victimized. It\u2019s also hard to admit that you yourself may have hurt people or allowed people to be hurt, or have bad judgment, which makes disbelief feel better for some people. That\u2019s what\u2019s at the root of parents not believing their child who says they\u2019ve been abused by a family member or parent\u2019s friend or romantic partner. It\u2019s also a lot easier for many people to discount sexual harassment than to think about times when they acted the same way or didn\u2019t intervene when a friend did. ",
