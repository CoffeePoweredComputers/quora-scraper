            "answer_text": "Thankfully no. Telling the truth, keeping promises, treating others fairly, treating others justly, and living courageously are all values. These are some of the key virtues that help establish the foundation of positive human relationships and ultimately civilization. I\u2019m pretty sure most business leadership books are written from that perspective. I\u2019m pretty sure most applied ethics frameworks are written from that perspective on some level. To be fair, to take Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics to the next level, I think you have to take person to person relationships and emotions more seriously\u2014in other words add a layer of emotional intelligence to the mix. I think the Golden Rule does this. I think the Fruits of the Spirit does this. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not at all. I teach it every year and marvel at its wisdom. However it is wildly incomplete and lacking in specifics. It\u2019s sexist and inegalitarian. It\u2019s also tailored to its culture and its times. So it needs untold amount of work. The Ethics is just lecture notes after all. What are all these virtues with no name? ",
