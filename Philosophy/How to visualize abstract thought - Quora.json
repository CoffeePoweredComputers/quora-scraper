            "answer_text": "You do not visualize abstract thought by yourself. It is done for you by your architect of dreams, the expert of the imaginary world who grows and lives within your mind, feeding from a pool of our second hand memories. In any case, if you try and visualize a thought you will simply be lead on a free association activity and find out what is tangentially related rather than what it truly is, but perhaps what things truly are is a result of all the relationships and connections it makes with similar things around it. Isn\u2019t that how we learn and map out information in our brains anyways? From a human perspective, it\u2019s our biased way of knowing. Therefore, as much as we may try to visualize the exact thought, what is exact and related merge so well, we will never be able to tell the difference. ",
