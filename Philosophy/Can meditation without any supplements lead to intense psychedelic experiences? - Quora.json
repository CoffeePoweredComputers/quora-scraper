            "answer_text": "I don't think so.No matter so many spiritual gurus claim that meditation can/will give psychedelic experiences, meditation wont work with junk in human body.By junk I mean toxic air, water and food.Sure it might have happened in the past. Like many centuries ago. But in 2019 we do not have access to purity. Hence these human bodies do not function as they used to or supposed to. However, meditation along with psychedelics is wonderful. It gives access to other dimension.A lot is to be unlearned. EDIT 1: 10 October 2020 Taking my words back. I had forgotten about this post. I have started meditating for last six months ago. I do Breathing exercises like Kapal Bharti (called Breath of Fire in Buddhism) After around 30 minutes yes you do get EXACTLY psychedelic experience. Since I have experience of LSD I can confirm. When I researched about what is happening to me I came to know that it is the Pineal Gland that releases DMT in brain. The effect lasts for a few seconds but the experience is out of this world that I knew. Immense happiness with tears, shivering, etc happened with me. We should never underestimate the power of breath. I realised many many things and I cannot turn back to being what I used to. For eg. what I wrote in July 2019 I cannot think the same way because of the experiences that I got. The entire \u2018space\u2019 is conscious we literally download information. All this sounds like woo-doo but its all true and mystic. I have become spiritual. ",
