            "answer_text": "Philosophy is defined as the fundamental study of knowledge, existence, and reality. When you turn to philosophy to help you figure out what is true, you will stumble upon a couple of fields within philosophy that will help you arrive at truthful conclusions. The first field that will help you identify the truth is empiricism which says that all knowledge is derived from your senses. If life experiences or an experiment generates data which points toward a certain conclusion, then that conclusion is most likely true. The second field of knowledge is rationalism which says that in order for something to be true, it must be logically consistent. When the logical consistency of rationalism is combined with the data centric approach of empiricism, you get the scientific method which is highly useful in the discovery of truth. If we were to dive deeper into the field of rationalism, the field of logic and rhetoric arises. This field makes the claim that logic is a tool, and that there are correct and incorrect ways to use logic. This field helps people identify the truth since it teaches us to avoid misuses of logic that\u2019ll inevitably lead us to the wrong conclusion. The final two fields of philosophy that are useful to take into consideration is objectivism and relativism. Objectivism says that truth exists regardless of if people exist or what our opinion is. Relativism states that truth is relative to the perspective of the observer or the context in which something is assessed. Both of these perspectives on knowledge are legitimate, but operate in different domains. What is the best color is an example of a truth that exist within the domain of relativism. This is because the, \u201cright\u201d answer to this question is dependent on the opinion of the person who is answering it since this question at its core is an opinion question. Objectivism applies when there are very specific truths to be known. For example, if somebody were to ask you what the population of China was, the correct answer wouldn\u2019t be dependent on your opinion. Regardless of what you thought the population of China was, there is a correct way to answer this question and an incorrect way to answer it (The answer is 1.39 Billion). Objectivism and relativism are important fields to know when you are pursuing the truth since it\u2019ll make you mindful of the fact that truth exist in different domains and that you could stumble upon truths that have both an objective and subjective element to them. Why did I mention all of these fields of knowledge within Philosophy? Its because it helps cement the following point: Philosophy helps you figure out what is true since it provides you with multiple ways of thinking about truth that you can use to discover truth. The second part of your question was, \u201cHow will knowing the truth help us become more wise and discerning individuals?\u201d The truth is a gift which keeps on giving. If you have an incorrect view on reality or yourself, but are dedicated to the pursuit of truth, you will eventually stumble upon new information that will allow you to correct for errors in your thinking which stemmed from incorrect premises. Knowing the truth enables us to become more wise since wisdom is heavily tied to the degree in which you have erroneous thinking. Less error-prone thinking helps us to become more discerning since discernment is defined as the ability for you to make good judgements. The more that you know the truth, the better decisions you will be able to make since your decisions will be informed by higher quality data and information. It isn\u2019t an accident that John 8:32 in the bible says, \u201cknow the truth, and the truth will set you free\u201d. It was very obvious to ancient cultures that knowing the truth was the difference between moving toward heaven or building your own hell here on earth. ",

            "answer_text": "You are in an area where some commentators may become very abusive. Both Philosophy and Science are needed to determine the likelihood of something being a Truth. The primary field for discovering Truth was determined by the Ancient Greeks to be Philosophy. What they said, however, was that honest debaters could help indicate that what might likely be true was just an agreement about what might be, but could never be proven. Those Ancient Greeks called Science the other side of the one coin of all knowledge, but again did not profess that Science produced Proof as we dogmatists would like to define Truth! About 20 years ago, Dr. David R. Hawkins fine-tuned Kinesiology to produce a way of determining if the universe determined that a statement was True, as this universe determined it. He went on to develop a Scale of Consciousness using that tool, but many parts of society paid millions to have him and his methodology discredited; there is nothing that most components of present society fears more than Truth! Please understand that Traditional Science cannot, because of how it was developed, do anything more that produce stories that explain data; it cannot produce any absolute Truth! It can tell better stories than we can ever determine in either the field or even the best laboratory. That is usually good enough! Philosophy and philosophers can discus the strengths and weaknesses of ideas and then leave it up to the listener determine what might be closest to any sort of Truth. If you really want to learn the real Truth about a given statement, you could learn how to perfect David\u2019s method and reliably determine the Truth of well-developed statements. Those with the normally-abysmal training in Science will both cry foul and likely get abusive. It is possible for anyone wants to determine Truth to do so; but not if they just want to be proven Right! LoL You can find David\u2019s stuff at https://veritaspub.com/ and go from there! Happy hunting but be prepared to duck! LoL Love and Above to those who seek the Truth! However, even those who know some things to be True may not yet be wise! ",

            "answer_text": "Have to build on previously wisely-built foundations. Each course rises a bit higher and may reach farther than that previously laid-down, in a sense. Philosophy means - Love, and, Wisdom. If anyone becomes wise enough to discover that ocean of love within themselves, they hardly want to do much else, as they, too, are learning, understanding more, and refining materials and techniques and their own way of practical know-how, and it\u2019s kind of a feedback-loop high-adventure. What is more interesting than learning about what, how, where, one is? Can\u2019t teach it so much as it\u2019s so individual a thing. Some basics\u2026 Simple example - If an elevator light goes on and it indicates going-up, why not go along when the door is open? Who knows when the next car will come? It may be a long wait. And there is no limit to how many might go along, depending\u2026 some may claim to be be allergic or phobic to elevators. Some may decide to see if the view is better from a lower level - Some will have read the news of an elevator falling - whatever. And this stuff deals with the nature; inner-nature, in all it\u2019s meanings, of human beings. And what do people want? To be truly happy, not much over-reliance on \u2018stuff\u2019, and to be feeling their peace within, and to be understanding it as well, to be respected and to show respect, kindness and compassion, and have gratitude as a serious, frequent feeling, and to be prosperous and generous in many ways. Truth may sometimes be an apple falling on someone\u2019s head, but that\u2019s only one kind of truth. I\u2019m not \u2018pushing\u2019 Buddhism, but Buddha is reported to have said: \u2018In the search for truth there are certain questions that are not important. Of what material is the universe constructed? Is the universe eternal?\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "If we define Truth as objective and independent from personal bias, Philosophy can help us learn how to think about Truth. Unfortunately, it can't define it. Truth is valuable in establishing a control factor or median, in relation to variables from a scientific perspective. Truth gives us a standing plane of what is known. From there, Philosophy can allow us to percieve what might lie beyond the known. Wisdom is reflection of experience over time. We can discern from Truth likely theories that coincide with the known. A certain level of Humility should also be taken into account, as our Ego likes to be Dogmatic in application. When we know the truth, we base everything off of that, instead of seeking other possibilities, and Philosophy is invaluable in that area. ",
