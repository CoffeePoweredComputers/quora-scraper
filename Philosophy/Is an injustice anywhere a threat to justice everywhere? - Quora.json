If you want to believe that there is a material threat being made to the idea of justice by the existence of injustice anywhere, you're welcome to. You could say it goes with the pursuit of ending injustice where one finds it, regardless of the utilitarian value of the act (though I think there is typically I've associated with altruism [because I'm an optimist]), and if that helps you be more just, who am I to advise you to the contrary?Like I said, though, I don't think it's rational or healthy to believe truth value of the quote.

            "answer_text": "It depends on what sort of surrounding you live in and what sort of people are around you. What I mean to say is whether people take that injustice as a challenge to convert it into justice or as an example which could be followed for years ahead . Not everywhere injustice is made an example it is to be taken as a challenge and then the outcome will be a symbol of 'taking a step against wrong gives you the right result'. ",
