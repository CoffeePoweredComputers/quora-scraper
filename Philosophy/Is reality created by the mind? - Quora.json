            "answer_text": "NO There is stuff out there, beyond ourselves - real stuff which = reality You also have a local reality which = YOU Your local reality, YOU, is a independent unit with its own detection system. This detection system detects both the stuff out there and yourself So the nervous system and brain (detection system) take the detected signals, processes the signals (the processing, also known as mind) assembly's a picture of the stuff out there along with an assessment of how you fit in the picture So not so much as mind creating reality as your detection system detecting reality and the processing of the detected signals being interpreted (mind processing) and looped back to keep YOU up to date with reality Some will point to the lag time of information (sound, light etc) leaving stuff, the detection moment and time for the processing to occur, assessment time as being evidence we are not experiencing reality News flash - the lag time is part of reality ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps one should consider first how we define the word reality,a creative dictation to present meaning and understanding to ourselves.We ask questions,with a presentation of words,defined in meaning,as we see it.Not perhaps as things truly are,as to what we perceive within our own comprehension.For reality isn\u2019t one vision,but a multitude of many,living together,co-existing in existence.The mind creates illusions,not realities.For it knows only what it has been taught and can only fabricate from its millions of flashcards,that it has collected.For in searching for what one calls reality will surely find that the definition of reality will rest with several other questions,that would even make reality relative to existence.For reality is never ending,and ever changing as by our definition to the word(The world or the state of things as they actually exist,as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them)So in reality as to whats real will never truly be determined.For reality changes reality ",
