            "answer_text": "The Waters Foundation offers great teaching tools for systems thinking: Home - Waters Foundation  I also really admire the Stockholm Resilience Centre for the research they do on complex issues, such as climate change, land use etc. Their planetary boundaries framework is a really clear way to communicate the limits to changes humans can make to our earth system. I followed their online course about Planetary Boundaries and can really recommend it: https://www.sdsnedu.org/learn/planetary-boundaries-and-human-opportunities-fall-2014  The Theory U | Presencing Institute framework by MIT is great as well.  I followed part of their online course last September and I really enjoyed the more people centered approach compared to other systems thinking methodologies.  The Natural step is also a really useful framework: http://www.ruralsustainability.org/files/TNSFrameworkGuidebook1.pdf  I love the book by Donella Meadows: Thinking in Systems, A Primer.  http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/129200/2ee4a14a158e824b867e07ad95005643.pdf?sequence=1  As a game, I really like the idea behind Eco (ECO - Strange Loop Games), it is like Sims, but than about building a society and staying within ecological, financial and social boundaries.  The Santa Fe Institute (Home | Santa Fe Institute) is the birth place of systems thinking and they offer an online course as well. It is more focussed on modelling systems with Netlogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)  My first introduction to systems thinking was when I followed this amazing course at TU Delft: Agent Based Modeling of Complex Adaptive Systems (Basic). You can explore the course contents, including lecture videos.  Hope this helps! Great that you are interested in Systems Thinking, it's a life long obsession for me :)   ",
