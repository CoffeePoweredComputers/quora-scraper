            "answer_text": "What I think is ment my the statement life always finds a way, which is also an answer to your second question is as I see it: That life alternates between the general and the prescise, and it is the prescise that runs into all kinds of problems while dealing with its surroundings. To make it more clear what I mean by alternate between general and precise: It is the spectrum between everything and just the one thing. The general is ultimately all species and all species are a force for life that outlasts situational and specific problems way more than, a species, or a group, or an individual which struggle with very specific problems. Life produces an almost infinite amount of versions of itself. So the death of an individual, a group, a species or even a whole pantheon of species (as with the mass extinctions) only means that the force of generality has now after the previous order of the food chain is gone alot of potential space to fill. Life always has the ability to make versions of itself that have just the right set of tools for the environment. To quote Pearl Jam: \u201cIt\u00b4s evolution baby!\u201d ",

On earth, a lava stream is one example of an environment that destroys all life. On the other hand, in most other terrestrial environments some forms of life can occur, even in boiling hot water. ",
