            "answer_text": "\"Necessity\" is one of the most important categories in Philosophy. It is part of the categories in Kant's Table of Categories, so it is a \"synthetic concept a priori.\" This means that it is logically indisputable. Even though you can't put the category of Necessity under a microscope, or see it with a telescope (though you can see mere \"examples\" of it that way), it is still as real as any atom or supernova. One can see it close-up when contemplating the Cosmological Proof of the Existence of God. We face the Cosmic God. We are finite (even tiny) and mortal. The Cosmic God is infinite and immortal. How do we then, prove such a God, when we are \"finite\" and God is \"infinite?\" The answer comes down to Being. We are human beings, alive today -- but not 120 years ago, and not 120 years from now. We are finite beings. Why are we alive? How do we come to be alive in the first place? The ultimate answer is that we BORROW our Being from an ETERNAL BEING. In other words, for finite mortals to exist at all, there MUST BE a totally NECESSARY BEING, which begins in the infinite past and goes into the Infinite Future. That is Necessity. The Necessity of Infinite Being. And that is God. There, in a brief nutshell, is the Cosmological Proof of the Existence of God. ",

            "answer_text": "Necessity is used in three ways in modern philosophy - each very different in use and meaning than the others: (1) Necessity as modality. In every possible situation, if something is true, then it\u2019s necessary. Another way of putting this is, if something\u2019s true in all possible world\u2019s then it\u2019s a necessary truth. Consider tautologies like: (*) 1+1=2 and (**) All umarried males are bachelors. Necessary truths are possible truths but not all possible truths are necessary! Modal logic specifies this relationship! (2) Necessity as a logical relationship between truth conditions or propositions. As in \u201cit\u2019s necessary and sufficient.\u201d \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d is a famous cogito proposition declared by Descartes as the bedrock of knowledge. Why? Because thinking means there is something thinking. (I know I\u2019m thinking because I\u2019m thinking about myself thinking). If I\u2019m thinking, then there must be something I am. I am a thinking thing. According to Descartes, this is the only thing you can know with absolute unconditional certainty (probability of 1). Let\u2019s look at that a bit more to understand this second kind of necessity. See how the antecdent (the part after the \u201cif\u201d but before the \u201cthen\u201d) entails/necessitates/makes necessary the consequent (all the stuff after the \u201cthen\u201d). The consequent is entailed by/follows/must be true if the antecedent is. This is the basic concept behind or underlying deduction and modus ponens. So, \u201cI think\u201d is sufficient for \u201cI am\u201d (there could be other antecedents that are sufficient for \u201cI am\u201d). \u201cI am\u201d is necessary for \u201cI think\u201d (if \u201cI am\u201d were false, then so would \u201cI think\u201d - that\u2019s modus tolens). If something is both necessary and sufficient (e.g. - if and only if) it occurs always and only when the other does/is true always and only when the other is. Quite close to identical but not exactly (identity entails sameness whereas necessary and sufficient just means identical truth-values or occurrences but not necessarily the identity of the two things being compared). (3) Necessity as in wants, needs, and desires. Basically what the other author talked about and is framed in the practical ethics/discussion about instrumental reasoning and motivation debates. Necessity here means what you need to survive or to accomplish some specific goal (end). Wants are desires that can express such necessities but they don\u2019t have to. Like when you go to the store as kid and your parents say, \u201cYou don\u2019t really need that toy, you just want it.\u201d ",
