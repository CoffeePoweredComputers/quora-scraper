            "answer_text": "No - I wouldn\u2019t say so. (Disclaimer: my first degree was PPE.) You do pay a price in in-depth knowledge, because you only have time to do a part of what your friends doing \u201cpure\u201d P, P, or E have to do. I felt this when I came to be a research student, because I had absolutely zero idea about what was going on in some research semiars. On the other hand, you do end up with a breadth that they might lack. More generally, I\u2019m deeply suspicious of the idea that we might call any degree useful or useless, because I don\u2019t think that utility is the right lens with which to examine education. Most humanities degrees - hell, most degrees in any discipline that isn\u2019t explicitly vocational - are \u201cuseless\u201d in some sense. But they are a sign that you\u2019re able to think in a certain kind of way about the world, and to sustain that thought at a certain level. Not all value is in utility. The one warning-klaxon about PPE, and PPE from a particularly old English university whose name begins with a vowel, is that it does appear to churn out a disproportionately large number of inexplicably cocky sociopaths and mainline them into the political class.

            "answer_text": "It depends on one\u2019s perspective. Is any college education useless? For those who do not value education, yes, but to those of us who believe that no education is useless, no. But from a more tangible point of view, a PPE degree is very useful for individuals who intend on going to law school, for aspiring politicians, for those who wish to pursue graduate studies in Economics or Political Science, and assuming one attends an elite college/university like and Claremont McKenna, Duke, Michigan-Ann Arbor, Penn, Princeton, Wesleyan etc\u2026a PPE major with a good GPA (over 3.7) should be able to get a job at an Investment Bank or Management Consulting firm.
