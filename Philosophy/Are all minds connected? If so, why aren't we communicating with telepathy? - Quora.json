            "answer_text": "Hello, I do think that the minds are connected through Universal Consciousness and that telepathy is real and possible. I think that it requires the consent of everyone involved and sadly many people simply refuse to acknowledge the possibility of connecting over distance mentally (kind of like how telephones and radio waves were unfathomable 500 years ago). I also think that telepathy requires a lot of study and practice in order to work effectively and it helps if the people doing it are already spiritually enlightened. That said, if telepathy is based on Universal Consciousness, wouldn\u2019t the people using it need to elevate their minds and spirits to the level of Universal Consciousness in order to access the power of telepathic communication? I think that this is a big reason why telepathy is only used by very few people today. Another facet of telepathy to consider is the bond and connection between the souls that are communicating. Communication is always a two way street and psychic communication is no exception. ",
