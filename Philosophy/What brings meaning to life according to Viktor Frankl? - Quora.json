            "answer_text": "According to Viktor Frankl, there are actually three social maps \u2014 three theories of determinism that are widely accepted. These theories explains the nature of man and woman and \u201chow they will respond to a particular situation in their life\u201d. Let us categories them in three groups: Group A: Genetic Determinism. Group B: Psychic Determinism Group C: Environmental Determinism Genetic Determinism \u2014 basically says that your grandparent did it to you. That\u2019s why you have such a temper. Your grandparent\u2019s had short tempers and it\u2019s in your DNA. It just goes through the generations and you inherited it. In addition, you\u2019re Irish, and that\u2019s the nature of the Irish people.Psychic Determinism \u2014 explains basically your parents did it to you. Your upbringing, your childhood experience essentially laid out your personal tendencies and your character structure. That\u2019s why you\u2019re afraid to be in front of a group. It\u2019s the way your parents brought you up. You feel terribly guilty if you make a mistake because you \u201cremember\u201d deep inside the emotional scripting when you were very vulnerable and tender and dependent. You \u201cremember\u201d the emotional punishment, the rejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn\u2019t perform as well as expected.Environmental Determinism \u2014 basically says your boss is doing it to you or your spouse, or that bratty teenager, or your economic situation, or national policies. Someone or something in your environment is responsible for your situation.Critical Analysis: There are many questions regarding these theories. How accurately and functionally do these deterministic maps describe the territory? How clearly do these mirrors reflect the true nature of man? Do they become self-fulfilling prophecies? Are they based on principles we can validate within ourselves? My Own Opinion: In my opinion these three maps are good for some people but I am not totally agree with these three maps of determinism of nature of man. Human being behavior is a so vast study and so complicated, so much complexity is involved in that; it always have a surprising factor. I am of the view that \u201cwe as human being conditioned to respond in a particular way to a particular situation or particular stimulus\u201d and this response is based on somewhat over own self-awareness, freedom to choose, imagination, conscience and independent will\u201d. Reference: Story of Viktor Frankl Let me share a story with you that I read in one of my favorite book \u201cThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\u201d written by Stephen R. Covey. The Story of Victor Frankl. Victor Frankl was a deterministic raised in the tradition of Freudian psychology, which postulates that whatever happens to you as a child shapes your character and personality and basically governs your whole life. The limits and parameters of your life are set, and, basically, you can\u2019t do much about it. Frankl was also a psychiatrist and a Jew. He was imprisoned in the death camps of Nazi Germany, where he experienced things that were so repugnant to our sense of decency that we shudder to even repeat them. His parents, his brother, and his wife died in the camps or were sent to the gas ovens. Except for his sister, his entire family perished. Frankl himself suffered torture and innumerable indignities, never knowing from one moment to the next if his path would lead to the ovens or if he would be among the \u201csaved\u201d who would remove the bodies or shovel out the ashes of those so fated. One day, naked and alone in a small room, he began to become aware of what he later called \u201cthe last of the human freedom\u201d\u2014the freedom his Nazi captors could not take away. They could control his entire environment, they could do what they wanted to his body, but Victor Frankl himself was a self-aware being who could look as an observer at his very involvement. His basic identity was intact. He cold decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him. Between what happened to him, or the situation/stimulus, and the response/action to it, was his freedom or power to choose that response. In the midst of his experiences, Frankl would project himself into different circumstances, such as lecturing to his students after his release from the death, camps. He would describe himself in the classroom, in his mind\u2019s eye, and give his students the lessons he was learning during his torture. Through a series of such disciplines\u2014mental, emotional, and moral, principally using memory and imagination\u2014he exercised his small, embryonic freedom until it grew larger and larger, until he had more freedom than his Nazi captors. They had more liberty, more options to choose from in their environment; but he had more freedom, more internal power to exercise his options. He became an inspiration to those around him, even to some of the guards. He helped others find meaning in their suffering and dignity in their prison existence. In the midst of the most degrading circumstances imaginable, Frankle used the human endowment of self-awareness to discover a fundamental principle about the nature of man: Between situations/stimulus and response/actions, man has the freedom to choose. Within the freedom to choose are those endowments that make us uniquely human. In addition to self-awareness, we have IMAGINATION\u2014the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality. We have Conscience\u2014a deep inner awareness of right and wrong, of the principles that govern our behavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thoughts and actions are in harmony with them. And we have independent Will\u2014the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences. By sharing this story to you my purpose is wake you up and get rid of this stress, anxiety and depression. Leave the bad thoughts that what will happen, stop thinking about negative and be positive, because whatever the situation is right now, it far much better than if you prisoned in one of the Nazi Camps. So be grateful to God that he has given you time to think, to polish and refine your skills, to learn new skills, to analyze your life and goals, to think of your family, to develop and strengthen your relationship with your love ones, to stay at home, to spend time with your family, to spend time reading books, to spend time learning about different practicing religions of the world, thinks of the third world countries, think of the poor, do something for humanity, to do creative work, to understand the nature, listen to the voice of the birds, listen to the voice of air , what message they bring to you. Think of those who died, if they have given the options to stay at home, they will be happy to accept millions of years staying at home.
