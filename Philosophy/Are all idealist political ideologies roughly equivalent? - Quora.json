            "answer_text": "\u201cAre all idealist political ideologies roughly equivalent?\u201d I suspect you are trying to ask something other than what these words say. I suggest you rewrite it. Perhaps you meant to ask something like \u201care all idealist political ideologies equally unrealistic?\u201d The answer to that would be a firm \u201cno.\u201d Some are based around real human behavior and some are not, so no. As written, it\u2019s logical to assume that you are implying that people who are living under a violent dictatorship, are having the same amount of fun, and experiencing the same amount of personal freedom as people who are living in a restrained democracy with established rights and so on. The answer to that is obviously \u201cno\u201d as well. So. What did you really have in mind? ",

It really doesn\u2019t matter how attractive or abhorrent is the dream - it\u2019s the idea that people are justified in using force to make it happen that makes it evil. ",
