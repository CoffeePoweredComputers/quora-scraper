            "answer_text": "Start with a cleanse. Throw out the story of your life if you are not a hero in it. Buy a beautiful, brand new notebook. On the very first crisp, clean, blank page, write out your story. Take an objective look. Is it sad? Is it angry? Are you unlucky? Does it blame everyone else? Are you a victim? Do you have a sense of agency or do things seem to happen to you? On the next page, change something. Own up to something. Be more accountable. Be more powerful. You have a whole notebook to page by page change your portrayal of the story of your life. As the story in your notebook changes, notice the shifts in your real life. Stop bad-mouthing you. Does your inner voice criticize you, put you down? Can you really work on something if your enemy is on the inside? If you are talking to yourself in a way that you would never speak to someone else, shut that shit down. Don\u2019t spend any time with people who are not good for you. Is there anyone in your life constantly putting you down? Anyone you feel is toxic? Is anyone draining your energy? Do you have \u201cfrenemies\u201d and can\u2019t explain why? You are fully responsible for the people you surround yourself with. Stop comparing yourself to others. When you tell yourself someone has it better than you, you are never even getting the full picture. Focus on the work you have to do on yourself. Inside. Look inside. Inside is where it\u2019s at. Not outside. Don\u2019t carry things that weigh you down. Are you feeling bitterness, anger, resentment, a drive for revenge? These things are the same as trying to get through a desert carrying poison instead of water. Throw it out. Let it go. Put it down. Forgive. Forever give up on getting anything perfect. Instead, take risks. Do a terrible job and watch what happens. (I\u2019ll just tell you. Ready? Nothing. Nothing happens.) Every day, be absolutely relentless about learning something new. Say no to things you don\u2019t want to do. This will often be met with disapproval. It might result in you losing some of those frenemies we talked about earlier. But, it will open up more time for you to do the things you need to. There. Now that you have more time, more energy and a new perspective, here are some things to add to your life. Nurture the glorious people who love you. Give them two things. Your time, and your full, complete attention. Come into the fact that you\u2019re the boss. Forget about approval, what people will say or the fear of possibly making a mistake. (I\u2019ll just tell you. Ready? You will. You will definitely make a mistake.) What do you really want? What do you really want to do? Be your boss. You are your boss. Own up to it. Make a list of things you are good at. In that same notebook that contains the evolving story of your life, make a list of things you are good at, or a list of things that fill you with pleasure. Do more of those things. They can make you feel competent (I\u2019m a good listener!) or they can make you feel happy (I love walking barefoot in the grass!) Either way, discover, collect, list, repeat. Make a list of things you find challenging. By \u201cchallenging\u201d I don\u2019t mean \u201clikely to cause you bodily harm\u201d. I mean things that make you uncomfortable that you know you need to do. Walk up and talk to a stranger. Ask someone out. Speak up. Develop opinions. Check off every single thing on your list. Start small. Start big. Either way, feel proud of all the times you did things you thought you couldn\u2019t do. Learn to accept compliments. One of the great ironies of life is that it feels like criticism has a special, VIP pass right into our soul and compliments are not allowed in until they show ID and then upon inspection are asked to leave immediately. Let them in. Say thank you. Take care of yourself. For me, this means eating better. Working at getting more sleep. Exercising regularly. Making a commitment to getting into shape does wonders for your self-esteem, teaches you about discipline, perseverance, dedication, and facing challenges. So much goodness rolled into a single objective. Practice being a better person. Be kinder and more considerate. Do what you think is right. Every time I am mean, petty, cruel, dishonest, I suffer more than anyone. Other people get to walk away from me. I can\u2019t get away from myself. Realize you have every kind of resource at your fingertips. If I am feeling blue, irritated, anxious, tired, I get help. I go to a yoga class. I read a book. I talk to someone I love. I find solace in the kindness of strangers. I go for a walk and make it a point to appreciate the color of the sky. I notice things around me that are there to support me if I fall. I mean, even my seat cushion can be used as a flotation device. ",

            "answer_text": " We all have unimaginable powers that we do not know exist, and ,since we rarely use this strength on daily basis, It slowly weakens and hides in the bottom of our chambers. Here are ways to develop and cultivate you inner strength and boost self esteem: Do things out of your comfort zone:I know this seems cliche and overused, but I speak from experience. I was a very introverted and pessimistic person. I used to stray away from any big social group and expect the worst from everything. What did I do to overcome it? Joined a language course and took it upon myself to speak with everyone in my class. I made an amazing group of friends because of that.Went out with different groups of people( not necessarily friends) every time I saw a chance. Many times I would ask them if I can join. which brings me to the next pointAsk more questions. Ask random people around you about things you have in mind. You can stumble many times upon a fruitful conversation. Also ask people about things you want, even if you think its embarrassing.Joined the debate team. I had to stand multiple times in front of audiences and express my ideas in a heated conversation. It wasn't easy and I didn't do the best job, but I learned and grew a lot from that experience.Now these are only the things that I can list from the top of my head. Here\u2019s my advice for you, every time you stress and feel anxious about something,ask yourself whats the worst that could happen? Most times it would appear as something harmless and even if its something that you think might hurt you emotionally, challenge yourself to do it and recover from it. Any pain that doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. Destroy harmful habitsDestroy your need for gratification from your phone or lustful habits by taking a cold shower. By doing such an action, you push yourself knowingly to something that is not physically pleasing. You endure some sort of pain for only the mental reward. This is an act that builds pure strength.Challenge yourself to wake up early at the same time everyday. This destroys laziness and build willpower and dedication.Challenge yourself to do a productive act everyday. Label a skill that you would like to learn and stick to it on daily basis, even if you only practice it for 30 minutes.This destroys procrastination and build creativity and productivity.Ill end this answer by using a motivational quote to get you started powerfully  ",
