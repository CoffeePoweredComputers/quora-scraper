            "answer_text": "There is hardly any similarity between utilitarianism and Kantianism. Utilitarianism states that what makes an action right is that it produces the greatest amount of happiness (not just your happiness, but others as well). Hence, any action that does not produce the greatest happiness is wrong according to utilitarianism. For example, if you had to kill a mass killer in order to save a bunch of people and it makes them happy, utilitarianism states that the act is right. However, Kant doesn\u2019t think the rightness of the act depends on consequences. Rather, the rightness of an act depends on acting on a maxim that one can consistently will as a universal law. This sounds like a mouthful, but basically Kant\u2019s point is that if you want to do something and you aren\u2019t sure if it is OK to do it, you would have to ask what the world would look like if everyone does it. If everyone does the act, but as the result the act no longer makes any sense or serves any purpose in that world, then the act is not morally permissible. For example, if you wanted to steal, but suppose you weren\u2019t sure you would have to ask \u201cwhat if I made a moral law that everyone could steal?\u201d In a world where stealing is OK, there wouldn\u2019t be such a thing as ownership because everyone takes everything from everyone. But stealing is literally impossible if nobody owns anything. So there can\u2019t be a possible world where stealing is OK because there wouldn\u2019t be any ownership. Consider another example. If you wanted to break a promise, but you weren\u2019t sure you would ask \u201cwhat If I made a moral law that everyone could break a promise?\u201d In a world where everyone breaks a promise, there wouldn\u2019t be any trust at all. But breaking a promise assumes that there was an initial trust in the first place to be broken. If there is no trust, nobody would believe you if you made a promise and there wouldn\u2019t be any point in breaking it. Hence, a world where promise breaking is OK wouldn\u2019t make any sense. These examples exemplify Kant\u2019s categorical imperative where you are only allowed to act according to a principle that you can will as a universal law. You can\u2019t act according to a principle in which stealing and promise breaking are OK because you can\u2019t will those principles as a universal law. Willing them as a universal law would lead to a nonsensical world where stealing and promise breaking don\u2019t make any sense. A utilitarian would allow lying and stealing as long as they produce the best consequence for everyone. For example, consider Robin Hood. He steals from the rich in order to give their goods to the poor. Robin Hood\u2019s action made a lot of people happy at the expense of a small amount of wealthy people. A utilitarian might say that Robin Hood\u2019s action is right, but Kant would say that stealing is wrong because if you willed it as a universal law it would be self-defeating. ",

            "answer_text": "The primary similarity between Kant\u2019s ethics and utilitarianism is that there is an objective Good which can be sought. Kant argued that one should act in a way that can be willed for all other persons. For example, you shouldn\u2019t lie because you wouldn\u2019t want everyone else to lie, too. Utilitarianism argues that one should act in a way that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Using the same example, one shouldn\u2019t lie if refraining from the lie would produce more good for a greater number of people. There is also the distinction between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism, but I won\u2019t muddy the waters with the differences between those two. In any case, Kant\u2019s view and utilitarianism presuppose a distinction between right and wrong, whereas a philosophy like Nietzsche\u2019s immoralism would dispense with this distinction. The primary difference between Kant\u2019s deontology (the fancy name for his ethical theory) and utilitarianism, is that Kant viewed an action as right or wrong without respect to the consequences, whereas utilitarianism views an action as right or wrong only with reference to the consequences of the action. Utilitarianism is a species of consequentialism, in other words, whereas Kant\u2019s theory is not. The famous thought experiment distinguishing the two views is that of lying to a Nazi soldier. Suppose you are hiding a Jewish family in your home and a Nazi soldier comes by asking you if you are hiding any Jews. Under Kant\u2019s theory, to tell a lie is always wrong and therefore one ought to tell the truth even in this case. Under utilitarianism, the consequences of telling the lie are far better than the consequences of not telling the lie, so the right thing to do is tell the lie. If one tells the lie, the family is safe; if not, the family dies. There is greater good for a greater number of people in telling the lie, and therefore to lie in this case is the right thing to do.
