            "answer_text": "I have no fear, and because of non-stop news coverage, very little about this virus is unknown. If you subtract the number of people who died as a result of idiotic governmental orders to admit infected patients into nursing and assisted care homes, and also those who were already sick with pre-existing conditions, the death rate of this coronavirus event hardly merits the description of a \u201cpandemic.\u201d I reserve such words for plagues that kill millions, taking at least a quarter of the entire population to their graves. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a minor, middling, or major inconvenience. Covid-19 qualifies as a middling inconvenience, aggravated by a media-induced panic. I am 68, a cancer survivor, and still in uncertain health, yet, I am unafraid. I go shopping regularly to supermarkets, and big box retailers like Costco and Super Walmart. I don\u2019t wear a mask, and I don\u2019t panic if another person comes within 6 feet of me. I may or may not wash my hands after using the restroom, and I touch my goddam face whenever I feel like it. Here in Arizona, we\u2019ve had just over 700 deaths from the virus. However, 140+ were on the Navajo reservation, over 300 were in nursing or assisted living homes, leaving fewer than 300 deaths among the general population of over 7.2 million. Statistically, that\u2019s nothing to get too excited about. And with the coming of our gloriously hot summer and our humid monsoon season, both of which are supposed to be fatal to the virus, the pandemic will dissolve into the mists of history. Gotta go now - restaurants are back open - thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "I take one day at a time. I am blessed to have a relatively secure job and I follow a set of coronavirus guidelines, which I have listed below, to protect myself and my family. It doesn\u2019t guarantee that I won\u2019t get sick, but it makes it less likely and gives me a sense of control. I keep busy, watch minimal news and stay off social media other than quora. Keeping up with the daily body count is not particularly useful so I only listen to the news to see if there are any breakthroughs, but I think it is still a little early for that. I find that keeping busy is the best to ignore fear, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you are busy doing or thinking about things to do. As Forrest Gump might have said \u201cMy momma always told me that an idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop\u201d. I find that helping others is a great way to boost myself too. Wear a face covering and eyeglasses (non-prescription if your eyesight is good)When you go out, keep your distance from others. If you are jogging, don\u2019t run right behind anyone elseDon\u2019t stay too long in places where people linger - restroom stalls/sinks, cash registers, etc., because the air there is more likely to have the virusTry to avoid touching surfaces that you don\u2019t need to.If you touch a surface outside your house (or even in your house if you already have a sick person), make sure you don\u2019t touch your eyes or nose for at 30 minutes or until you wash your hands thoroughly. This is an important thing to remember when you bring in your mail, groceries, etc.When you bring in something from outside, you can either (a) leave it alone for a day (if it has a porous covering like paper/cardboard) or 3 days (it has a non-porous covering), or (b) take it out of the covering, dispose of the covering and wash your hands - when you take it out, don\u2019t touch the inside contents with your bare hands. You can use a pair of gloves or small towels that you use for this sole purpose and set them aside after you are done, or you could use a paper towel or something disposable.When you come in from the outside, wipe the doorknobs with a disinfectant because you have to touch them to come inTake vitamin C (1000 mg or more) every day; A multivitamin every day will help you get zinc and vitamin D which are important for immunity.If you take the above, your risks of catching the virus will be highly reducedKeep a stock of zinc based cold lozenges. If you feel the symptoms (dry cough, sore throat, loss of smell or taste), start taking them.If you are at home and are struggling to breathe because of the infection, hospitals have found that laying on your stomach makes it much easier to breathe.",

            "answer_text": "Fear?  Oh, yes, the overwhelming media coverage is causing significant anxiety.  Suggest people wake up and check out the statistics regarding the yearly flu pandemic.  That is not a mistake.  Every flu season, thousand become ill and many die.  COVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus in the same family as that which causes SARS and MERS.    It is, however, a fantastic vehicle for increasing racism and bigotry.  Trump is a legally-documented racist:  United States v. Trump, NY, 1973.  He also laundered money through his casino:  FinCEN v. Trump, 2015.  Then there is the university that New York State determined was illegal and fraudulent.    Yes, FEAR -- the man in the Whitehouse is destroying America and people are loving him for doing just that.   Every other word out of his mouth is a lie, yet people swear he speaks gospel.  He is the first U.S. President to have web pages dedicated to recording his lies.  They provide text, date and location. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m 65. I\u2019ve survived boats capsizing, an airplane crash, car crashes (for awhile there it seemed that everyone wanted to bonk into my car), ski crashes while competing in downhill races, ski crashes while in speed skiing events, fires, cancer surgery, and other stuff that isn\u2019t popping into my mind right now. I don\u2019t fear death. I don\u2019t fear much of anything. So Covid-19 doesn\u2019t bother me much at all. Although while we are alive we have no reason not to assume we mortal, we all know we are going to die. The question is when and maybe how? Death is a waiting game, it makes life interesting. However in actionable terms, assuming suicide is out of the picture, we are spectators to our own demise. My assumption about it then is that it doesn\u2019t really matter when and while we all imagine we are going to die with our family and friends surrounding us, and all is tranquille, and the last thing we see is the gaze of those people and maybe the sun setting on the mountains, that won\u2019t happen. We die alone. Fast or slow it makes no difference in the end. What matters is how we spend our whole lives, not those last few moments when we die. That means understanding risk, and living within our own risk capacity. Uncertainty is a given. There is no way to predict future events. The complexity of our world generally prevents that. We make guesses and hope for the best, but events overtake us constantly. We should think about that, and plan for those weird events such as a epidemic, and have some materials on hand that may help us get through one better than we would without a plan. Other than that, relax and wait. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I hope that everyone that will read this is healthy and safe. Now, to be honest, I fear more for the elderly people that I care about (grandparents (father\u2019s side), neighbours\u2026), than I fear for myself. I am 20 years old and I practically don\u2019t leave my house since 13 of March, I only opened a few exceptions (taking walks int the forest to clear my mind and visiting my boyfriend since he got surgery, I only see him once a week and besides, he doesn\u2019t leave the house much either\u2026). I actually don\u2019t fear much for myself because I avoid leaving the house, and I wash my hands regularly. I am more afraid of the consequences of the actions caused by the simple mentality and thoughts of the mid-age and younger generations. My country, Portugal, is already returning back to normal, although I believe is still too soon (we were told that 300 people got infected just yesterday) and people are visiting cafes, go to the beach and don\u2019t care anymore\u2026 This following weeks I have been hearing my father saying this: \u201cOkay, we are not elderly so even if we catch it it wouldn\u2019t be that much serious. It doesn\u2019t affect mid-aged or younger people that much.\u201d By this, you can see that he has no clue of what happens with your body if you contract COVID-19. My parents don\u2019t understand how the transmission chain works either, after all, you can\u2019t control what the other people touch, and their health habits. Yet, my parents don\u2019t mind going, sitting in the cafes, touching things\u2026 My fear? My grandfather\u2019s health, since we live next to each other and my parents have contact with him every day. By their everyday actions, I have seen that they are not very considerate about my grandfather\u2019s health. On the mother\u2019s side of the family things aren\u2019t good either. They all were so immature that in the middle of the chaos they organized a birthday party for my grandmother, and all the family went! Note: the family add a fight in the past so, only me and my sister were supposed to go to the party (since my parents are not talking much to my mother\u2019s sibling). Both me and my sister knew that going wasn\u2019t an option for us, we didn\u2019t want to risk our healths, or put another\u2019s life at risk. The funny part was that my parents were playing mentality games at me and my sister to force us to go there (just to cause a good impression). Something like: \u201coh, go there, everyone will be there except you two and they will think bad of us if you don\u2019t show up\u201d and \u201cyou felt bad when your grandparents (mother side) missed your birthdays during all of your childhood, and now she will feel bad if you don\u2019t go there too\u201d. Eventually, we didn\u2019t go, because: The number of people there would be around 20 and the house is very small.We actually don\u2019t have many connections with the mother\u2019s side of the family so we always feel excluded, plus since we are the only grandchildren who are in the university my grandmother always tries to show us off to their neighbours (something that I don\u2019t like).My grandparents are elderly and although I don\u2019t like them much I didn\u2019t want to take a risk.University online exams were coming and coming fast.But, we called her to give her a happy birthday though. Now, to my surprise, two weeks later, my mother gets a call saying that one of her sister\u2019s neighbours was infected. And that sister and their family contacted the infected person and they all went to the birthday party. And that sister didn\u2019t do the test and wasn\u2019t even willing too. Now, imagine the risk that me and my sister could have been exposed too just to satisfy my parent's ego when it comes to family image (that is their life priority, trust me, and I have more stories about it that I am willing to share if the readers want). Anyways, we eventually fought about the matter, to make them understand the consequences that could have become a reality if we went there. But no matter how many times we fight about it, they never truly understand, because it\u2019s a question of mentality. Note: Even on the father\u2019s side the family image issue remains, since my oldest uncle and my dad have that siblings rivalry were one always wants to surpass the other. They brought their life achievements into the rivalry and even their kids became a part of it (they even lied about me to everyone which is sad). I would be happy to get some comments with your honest opinions and advices. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not as difficult for me as it might be for others. In a sense, I feel as though I\u2019ve been expecting something like this most of my life. I am 68. I have worked for just over 50 years and made good pay, so my Social Security is generous, though not enough to cover my expenses. I still have to work to meet my financial goals. I am unemployed, but when I work, I am well paid. That also means that I can draw the top unemployment benefit, which is quite generous in my state. And I had money saved up. All this means I can survive for not quite 6 months after my last job ended, which is something few can say. I am in good health, and if something happens, I am on Medicare and have an excellent Medicare Advantage policy from a well known insurer. The only prescription medicine I am on is a generic that costs just $12 for a 3-month supply. The nature of my work is such that I can work from home, if the client allows it. I have to do so many work searches a week to qualify for unemployment, though I usually get no response or acknowledgment whatsoever from those online applications. I get many phone calls from recruiters, though I can\u2019t understand anything they are saying except \u201cMichael\u201d and \u201ctechnical writer.\u201d What usually happens is that a recruiter calls at just the right time, and something falls into my lap from outer space. I have literally been contacted by a recruiter on a Friday morning and found myself put to work in the client\u2019s office the following Monday morning. I order everything, including groceries, delivered to my door, and when the delivery person arrives, I stand several feet away or simply let them leave the package and go on before I open the door at all. I leave my apartment just once a day to walk 5 miles for exercise. I have not been in an enclosed space with others since March 18. I ordered a set of men\u2019s hair clippers and cut my own hair, though I couldn\u2019t figure out how to attach the comb attachment, so I had to shave myself bald, and I now look like Mr. Clean. I am symptom-free. I have ordered something advertised as a military-grade respirator, but it hasn\u2019t arrived yet. I had to cancel a paid-up and nonrefundable trip to a European city, planned for May, to visit my son and daughter-in-law and even lost out on a job opportunity because they couldn\u2019t work with that gap in my schedule\u2014ironically, I realized only a week later that the trip would not be possible. I\u2019m sorry all that happened, but in the light of the spread of COVID-19, canceling the trip was necessary. In early March, I bought about 30 rolls of toilet paper, though not all at once. Since I am on a high-fiber diet, a single roll of toilet paper lasts me a little over a week. At the rate I\u2019m going, I can last until Columbus Day. I have ordered multiple rolls of paper towels from Amazon, though shipping is slow, and it may not arrive for a few weeks. I had met with an attorney in February to draw up a new will, power of attorney, etc., but the attorney had to close her office, because her county was put on lockdown (now, so is mine), so I can\u2019t get the documents witnessed or notarized. However, she held a class on Zoom for any clients who were interested, to write a holographic will, which is valid in my state. My children are in their 30s. My daughter is living with her mother 700 miles away in another state, and we will be catching up by phone tomorrow evening. My son and his wife are in Europe. They were in a country where the infection rate and death toll were climbing quite rapidly, but they were able to get back to her native country where the count is quite low and are nicely set up in an apartment owned by her parents. I Skype with them about every 3 weeks. I have no grandchildren. My apartment suits me better than just about any place I\u2019ve ever lived. My living-dining area is about 20 feet long and 17 feet wide, with 10-foot ceilings. I have eight bookcases set up there and my 65\u2033 wall-mounted TV. I have a spacious patio-balcony. I can literally be in my apartment all day and not go out at all, though that seldom happens, and I do not feel uncomfortably confined. Although I now realize there is no scientific basis to Myers-Briggs personality types, I still find INTJ a useful shorthand for a cluster of traits that I believe are true of my makeup. It means that I have spent much of my life feeling as though I were in a dark room full of an unruly crowd of people who were wailing, cursing, kicking, punching, and eye-gouging, and I was the only one with night vision goggles. It also means that I always try to figure out what is going on and look ahead. After hearing about environmental pollution in junior high school, I remember dreaming one night that a noxious cloud of smog had reached my part of the country and was covering everything with a brown haze, and as I choked and gasped, I thought \u201cOh, no, it\u2019s finally happened!\u201d By around February 5, when the total number of COVID-19 cases in the world numbered only in the hundreds, I was already sitting down drafting quite detailed instructions to my kids about what to do if anything happened to me. I met with the attorney in February and told my son that this whole thing put my planned European trip at risk. I did this not having any idea how rapidly the disease would spread. But I knew two persistent strains in American culture: Disdain for getting details right, which is how the CDC distributed a defective test.Locking the barn door after the horse is stolen, which is why we have to take our shoes off at airports.I have thought most of my life that a very large part of humanity were screwups, blundering through life in a daze, knocking things over and then demanding to know who was responsible, vaguely sensing their folly and resenting anyone who saw it with a clear eye, and ready to congratulate themselves for their ignorance. We see all that in who we have elected President and the fanatical support of his base. When I realized Trump was going to win the Republican nomination, I googled \u201cmove to Canada.\u201d But Canada has quite strict financial requirements, and I don\u2019t qualify. When he was elected, I briefly considered leaping to my death from my balcony, but didn\u2019t wish to distress my kids. COVID, to me, is just one more layer of icing on the cake we baked when we elected Drumpf. He didn\u2019t invent it, but he is responsible for making the outcome worse and is working even now to expose more of his own citizens, whether he realizes it or not. As I commented on another thread, for a head of state to actively support measures whose likely outcome is to cause more of his own citizens to sicken and die is a situation without precedent, as far as I know, in human history. No, I didn\u2019t know I was going to find myself in a worldwide pandemic, but I already witnessed, first-hand, the conditions that could lead to this over 20 years ago when I spent three weeks in the hospital after a serious automobile accident and found myself having to act like an air traffic controller because so many doctors, nurses, and orderlies kept screwing up, because their minds weren\u2019t on their work. Many people just don\u2019t pay attention. And they get pissed if you point it out to them. People like that elected our President. He was already the most dangerous man in the world by virtue of his access to nuclear codes, but his position of authority in the time of a pandemic is, in its own way, infinitely worse. So if someone asks how I will deal with the uncertainty, I think \u201cWhat uncertainty? This was always one possible outcome, though, admittedly an extreme one.\u201d There is an episode of Black Mirror in which some people break into a warehouse and alert a robotic watchdog, who relentlessly pursues them. There is little or no chance of evading it. If it gets near enough to you, it will either do something to cause your head to explode, or it will spit small fragments of glass that will lodge in your throat too close to your jugular to be removed without causing you to bleed to death anyway. I have sometimes felt as though I were being pursued by that dog. The people on whose behalf it prowls around were too dim to have invented such a thing, but it serves their purposes perfectly. That is life in a high-tech society in the time of Trump. Or as I commented in another thread, like the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire: a once-great city destroyed because a dumb animal in a barn kicked over a lantern, and now, there are mainly smoking ruins and nothing left but to begin rebuilding. I don\u2019t dwell much on the fear and uncertainty, because my personal circumstances let me live in some degree of safety and comfort, because my friends, most of whom I am in touch with via Facebook, all seem to be surviving, and because I am convinced that my children are as safe and secure as they can be under the circumstances. What will happen to me? Will I get a job before my money runs out? Who knows? Will I ever see my kids again? It is logically possible that I may not. But past a certain point, I refuse to let myself be troubled too much by something that I have known, since childhood, could be a possibility, by virtue of the ignorance and folly of so much of humanity and, in particular, the anti-intellectualism and disdain for learning of so many of my fellow countrymen.

            "answer_text": "COPING UP WITH INEVITABLE CHALLANGES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC The spread of coronavirus has disrupted lives of many people across the globe on their mental and physical health. We all are going through rough patch. Everyone is suffering some kind of mental agony be it\u2019s a child, young generation or elder people . As we remain confined within our houses, we tend to get more use to televisions, mobile phones, internet which is leading us to consume more and more news, rumors and misinformation as media has lot of undesirable and unwanted news (LOL). No outdoor activities, financial stress, job loss. All these abrupt changes has widely contributed to mental and physical trauma (combined with fear of getting infected or losing loved ones). Now it\u2019s safe to say that we are experiencing one of the most uncertain times in history. But if we keep feeding our brain with everything that can go wrong, things can be worse for our mental health. This year will go down in history as one of the downs. Time passes and this shall too pass since TOUGH TIMES NEVER LAST, TOUGH PEOPLE DO. What matters entirely is to choose our attitude towards such hurdles. If we are constantly aware and preparing ourselves for each of the uncertainty and bad events we can prevent us from such fear and anxiety. If we analyze, some people tolerate such uncertainties without any stress and continue living in an easy going manner while others find such challenges to be distressing. Why? How do they cope up? They believe on words spoken by Charles R. Swindoll - Life is 10% of what happens to us and 90% of how we react to it. Let me elaborate the above words: Unpredictable events will occur, uncomfortable experiences will come into our life as most of the things are out of our control such as natural disasters, viruses, diseases, other people reactions, behaviour etc. What here we can do is to control our actions and reactions. Anticipating future will just keep us more and more stress in present. \u201cWorry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength.\u201d\u2015 Corrie Ten Boom Now, another question that will pop up in readers mind is, how do we control that? We need to think that how we are spending our time, where we are putting our efforts and energy into. In such challenging times, we need to shift our focus to things or actions that can help in solving our problems because we don\u2019t know what the future holds. However, we can prepare for some serious outcomes by creating an action plan. There is also a special report in Time magazine that best way to reduce stress is by \u2018\u2019fighting stress before it even starts, planning things rather than letting them happen.\u2019\u2019 For example, if you are stress about the financial crunch, create a plan to earn more through different sources, cutting variable expenses, saving more and investing some of the saving into low risk opportunities. If you are worried about the work load responsibilities, share the work load with the family members. Involve your children into household activities and teaching them learn new things. Have trust. They will enjoy! Similarly, if you are worried about the physical health, adopt some self-care techniques at home. Be fun, be creative, but whatever you do, do it for yourself because you deserve it. There is much much content about how to do simple workout at home to cut your body fat and keep it fit. Try to take those actions which can be helpful in improving your personal relationships, career, finances and others. There is always something which we have control on. It\u2019s time to take pro-active steps to support your mental health during these unprecedented times. Don\u2019t limit your efforts and energy into things which will keep your more distress and exhausted. With patience we all will be able to build the tolerance power to such uncertainties, control over emotions and eventually building mental strength. ",

            "answer_text": "I was planning to retire this year when my job moved online. I\u2019m postponing my retirement until I\u2019m forced to return to work in person. I have too many pre-existing conditions to risk that in the absence of a vaccine. I know I am luckier than most as I have adequate of financial resources even with my retirement savings taking such a hit. I\u2019m slowly starting to move money out of out the market even though I dumped a bunch of money into it when it went quite low. That is because I think it is coming back for the wrong reasons (states opening up prematurely) and its resurgence will be short-lived. I\u2019ve bought an oxygen meter and considered buying an oxygenator but finally decided against that. I have a CPAP that could be used in an emergency. I bought masks when the first case of community spread occurred in California even though I live in Mississippi. I bought a hazmat suit which I plan to use when I fly to California in a few weeks (it is safer than Mississippi right now.) I have nine rental properties and seven of my tenants are current on the rent for which I consider myself lucky. The other two will pay up once our state gets its act together on their unemployment insurance. I provided their kids with chromebooks so they could keep up with their homework. Beyond that, I drink tonic water with orange juice even though I don\u2019t think things like hydrochloroquine and high dozes of Vitamin C are effective. I also take aspirin each day because the virus is now known to cause blood clots. Beyond that I go out as seldom as possible and wear a face mask when I do. But don\u2019t tell me not to touch my face. It only makes my nose itch. Beyond that I do what little I can to help where I can. ",

I am controlling what I reasonably can: I am keeping my distance from others, I am using PPE where appropriate, I am giving my house a bit of extra cleaning, though since there is no one here couging and sneezing over anything there isn\u2019t a lot of point going overboard on it. I am also taking the various scare stories that social media spreads so easily with a big, big pinch of salt. There are a lot of scaremongers out there who revel in spreading miserable rumours. I fight back with a dose of truth: no there is no evidence of reinfection; the vaccine production takes time, but it is going fine; no it isn\u2019t a genetically engineered bioweapon; 5G towers causing it? Are you a complete idiot? I suppose I have a bit of advantage with this sort of thing as I can read a research paper and the gist of what is going on more easily than most because of my education in genetics. I can see the attempts at propaganda and fear mongering a mile off and if someone makes a claim I demand to see evidence to back it up. Peer reviewed research papers or it didn\u2019t happen. Knowledge of history helps too, there\u2019s nothing going on here that we haven\u2019t seen before as far back as the Black Death.

            "answer_text": "Not to feel deep concern for the future at all in this situation would probably be insane. To cut down or eliminate the actual fear, we need to proactively do all we can to protect ourselves and others, effective or not. In other words, sitting and doing nothing would probably be scarier and more depressive of the general survival potential than actively doing something against it. There are obvious things we are expected to do, like staying home, keeping distance and washing hands, and we should do those things. So the first thing you can do to curb your fear is know the enemy. Know your enemy. A virus is not a live organism, it is a protein molecule enveloped in fat. It is very fragile, it has no intelligence or a will to survive, it is a thing. It\u2019s only protection is a thin layer of fat. It can be destroyed by dissolving the fatty layer with soap or a chlorine bleach solution, which seems to attack the protein directly. Virus dissolves in hotter temps and high humidity. It can be deadly but it is also relatively easy to destroy.There is more we can do, effective or not. Some things you could do may or may not save you in the final count but just the fact of you feeling that you are standing up to this menace may boost your system and help you in many ways and if push comes to shove it may boost you over the edge. So the below are not THE cures and nobody claims they are, but these are remedies used by people per my research IN ADDITION to everything officially mandated: 2. Cut up a clove of garlic and swallow the pieces like pills with water in the morning 30 min before any food (do not chew). Russians use this and claim it to be effective in cleaning the blood and the liver of toxins and thus boosting the immune system. 3. Maintain a sensible sleep and food schedule. Exercise a bit. Eat organic. Eat your veggies. 4. Meditation. This should probably be #1, the Simple Breathing meditation, where you put your attention on the sensations of your breathing and nothing else, eventually stopping the usual thoughts merry-go-round in your head. That is tremendously beneficial to your body and to you as a spirit. There are other meditations and there is a special immune-boost meditation I can provide, always free of charge. Anyone interested contact me at thevoidofpotentiality(at)gmail(dot)com. I\u2019ll always do whatever I can to help. ",

The biggest is that you can\u2019t get bread or something that will keep, thanks to the selfish hoarders who buy all they can. The virus doesn\u2019t scare me. I\u2019ve got a scar on my arm from a serious virus.  Smallpox. \u201cThe risk of death following contracting the disease was about 30%, with higher rates among babies.\u201d This little bug doesn\u2019t seem to worry with children or babies, just the elderly. And, even then, it\u2019s only a 15% mortality rate IF you\u2019re elderly and already sick. If you\u2019re healthy, maybe 3%. These are probably diabetic or something that weaken their immune system. No, what worries me is the PEOPLE who are panicking. I haven\u2019t seen a police vehicle in over two weeks, maybe three. The last time I was out, people were speeding like maniacs. Not just 10mph over, but at 100mph or more. Most were from out of state, and from states that are locked down, like California, New York, Illinois, and Florida. They just can\u2019t stay at home. I\u2019ve heard that police have stopped responding to 911 calls, like burglary, and some have even resorted to asking criminals NOT to do things. WTF?! Honestly, I think this is behind the whole massive buying of ammunition. People realize that they\u2019re on their own, no help from the government, and it scares them. I don\u2019t think it will get that bad, but you never know. In cities, maybe. I mean, they already kill each other over $5 at ATMs. As I said, the biggest issue is not getting what is needed. Now, with Walmart deciding that people will be standing outside to get in or in line for hours to get out. I could probably drive an hour or so to the city, but that\u2019s a pain and it\u2019s running over with infected people. If they had stayed at home, this wouldn\u2019t have spread. ",

I wanted to do a bungee jump but my Chiropractor advised against it!!! I am an avid reader and have a lot of books to read, just got a book thru the mail on rock painting, took a class about 17 years ago, so need to read it and see what supplies I need, I have already got 4 lovely rocks out of my rock garden.

It is the main topic on every news report, unless of course there is the latest comical \u2018revelation\u2019 from Washington. The fear is something else. This is a truly horrible virus from what we hear. However at almost 76 there is the everpresent fear of imminent demise from any number of things the media are only too eager to remind us about. This virus is the main one at the moment, but if it wasn\u2019t there we would still have strokes, heart attacks, assorted cancers, over eating, over drinking, asthma attacks, falls and just everyday living. We can never be certain to see the sun go down when we have seen it come up. Life itself will see us off one day no matter what. Curtently I am more afraid of the local doctor obeying the PM\u2019s suggestion by prescribing cycling as an addition to my monthly pill delivery. Living half way up a long steep bank going anywhere on it would probably result in ending the trip in an ambulance. ",

For young people there is barely more risk, perhaps no more risk, than bad flu. I also know, as more than one expert is saying, that Covid is not going away. We\u2019ll probably all get it eventually. I\u2019m also very well informed on nutrient levels and immune system. A search of scholarly data bases for vitamin A, D and zinc and respiratory infection/disease, yields a shocking number of positive articles from well-respected institutions. These are supplements I take. I almost never get colds, certainly not the flu. I think I may have already had Covid, but like many with the same story, I\u2019m not running out to find a test. So we are quietly excluded from the infection fatality rate denominator, again making Covid look far more serious than it is. (I am over 65.) ",

I am a 66 year old male in relatively good health and for me if I get Covid-19 or not is something which causes me no concern whatsoever, since most people who are exposed really experience no serious consequences. I would also mention that I am an American who has lived and worked in Africa for the last 13 years. Over here the disease profile on a daily basis is composed of real health risks that make Covid-19 appear tame in response. I often work in the bush, malaria, diphtheria, typhoid, cholera, and a host of other background health risks are part of business as usual. So I don\u2019t lose any sleep over Covid-19, what does give me cause for alarm is the global economic devastation that will come about because of the Covid-19 global lockdown, which will probably throw the world in the greatest Depression we have ever faced. The way I cope with this is fairly straightforward. I take one day at a time, am thankful the sun rises and have confidence in the collective intelligence of humanity to eventually sort all of this out. ",

Then they sent COVID patients back to nursing homes, just wiping ut most of the populations in those facilities.The radical socialist democrats are hoping to continue to force us to cower under our beds so that we can not get this economy back to the roaring Trump reelecting state that it was before this debacle that has been most concentrated in blue states.Most of what we have heard in the MSM is so tinged with anti- Trump rhetoric and baloney that the poor citizens of this nation are confused.",

I'm trying to sift through the speculation and focus only on the information coming from the researchers closest to it. Because they keep telling us they don't know, they keep saying \u201cwe think that\u201d. We want to know, we want to feel safe and in control. The truth is that right now, why can't. I'm frustrated by how I can't choose for myself. I'm watching my own precarious care (I have a severe chronic condition) go down the tubes. I know what that looks like, I've been there before. I'm going there again, I have no say to stop it. I don't want to catch this disease, who does? I will probably be ok by for me, those body aches mean mind blowing pain. I'm not inviting that in by choice! I work hard to care for my body and surround myself with good loving people. We are physically cut off from each other but we text constantly and zoom frequently. We had a zoom game night tonight. My Bible study is meeting by zoom. All of this is a drop in the bucket. It doesn't take away the fear that this illness could strike my beloved grandmother as we try to modify the plans for her 90th birthday (which is next month). It doesn't abate the severe pain I'm in every day. It doesn't give me the ability to give my daughter the social and physical stimulation she's used to. What does truly help is my relationship with the Lord. I talk to him constantly. He's always by my side and I know he will carry me should the worst happen. My greatest fear is actually myself dying. Not for me but for my daughter. Not because I think she won't have a good childhood without me. Only because I don't want her to have to go through that. I know she will be OK though, God will care for her too. There is nothing that is too big for Him, nothing that is too broken. My heart is best spoken through song and these are a few that say it best.     ",

What I'm worried is the after effects of Covid19, what effects will it have on other organs, since we hear of new symptoms coming every few weeks. We still don't know anything for certain. So the unknown is best tackled by staying very safe, avoiding crowds, avoiding touching public places, avoiding even social gatherings. The point I'm trying to make is, please use common sense. What should you do to avoid the virus. I may appear paranoid, but I can go ahead and quietly practice what I feel is a possible source of contact. So, both fear and everything unknown can be tackled by avoiding everything my mind can conjure up as dangerous. Just yesterday, scientists stated that the viruscan spread as aerosols too. So there you are. You've just got to keep thinking and outbeat the virus. Stay safe. ",

How I responded to most of it is just like most of the rest of you. There have been ups and downs over the last 90 days and it didn't take me much time to realize that this is going to be a long uphill battle. Cleaning the kitchen counters every other day with disinfectant wipes is now down to a weekly cadence. Washing hands that used to happen every two hours is now a three times a day activity. Eating out has now become a life long dream. While we all wait for the magic potion that the medical community is about to come up with sooner or later, am learning to take it one day at a time, and be thankful. I am helping out where I can knowing very well that though small and possibly the size of a drop in the ocean, I am making a difference in someone else's life - even for a day. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "The fear and uncertainty during the COVID-19 crisis is as it was before the pandemic. There were already things going wrong. The ocean was already dieing. Oxygen is slowly being depleted from our atmosphere. Capitalism was faltering. The pandemic is something I expected sooner or later. The way I cope with the anxiety over the inevitable is by giving my full attention to the task at hand. If I think something is coming I want to get it over with. This can feel like a spot that you can't itch. But it's could to practice forbearance and so I take it as a challenge. It helps to take deep breaths and tell myself I'm waiting in a relaxed but alert state. I trust my instincts to take the unknown in stride. Still, sometimes I need comic relief and watching a comedian isn't enough. That's when I engage my imagination and playfulness. The main thing is to have fun and laugh. Stress is hard on the immune system. Laughter is good medicine so I like to always keep a joke within reach. And finally, sometimes I need a few to several whacks with a paddle. This is not for everyone, but studies show that spankings can relieve stress for both persons involved. It might not sound mainstream but there's nothing kinky about it. It's just a good home remedy that's a lot cheaper than psychiatric care. The fear and unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic doesn't seem beyond anything a healthy person can handle. But sometimes I have to express my emotions and it may look like l'm loosing it. And maybe for a second I do. But once I have vented I immediately focus on gathering my strength and continue with the mission. Even if that mission is just to bring something pleasant to each day and share what we've learned that could be of benefit to others. ",

Our home has ten acres and we breed Rottweilers, so as you can imagine we NEVER get unwanted visitors. So there is no fear and very little in the way of unknowns. Our whole country is going beautifully in controlling the virus, but particularly so in this area. Canberra has 440,000 citizens, and the satellite city of Queanbeyan makes it up to around half a million. Currently (as of this morning\u2019s newspapers) there are 8 active cases of COVID-19. 7 are self isolating in their homes with the support of the Department of Health, and one is in hospital. This is the newspaper account of the situation: Canberra goes another day with no new coronavirus cases ONE new case in nine days in a city of half a million people hardly qualifies as fear inducing. I have lived in this area for 40+ years but still can\u2019t believe how lucky I am to find myself here at this time in history! Good luck with your journey wherever you are. ",

On the other hand, I know that the probability of catching it in my country is fairly low, living in a country with 2 million inhabitants, roughly new 30\u201340 cases per day, but almost half of them originating in nursing homes, hospitals or somewhere in relation to those - where I am not. This doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t take precautions: social distancing, keeping people at a distance of 2\u20133 meters (7\u201310 ft), washing hands or wearing mask and gloves when I buy groceries. All in all, it is an annoyance, especially not visiting my (now adult) children, but besides that, it is not a big problem.Yes, Easter holidays are coming these days, normally the bigger family would join together, we will skip it this year. There will be another one, next year. On a scale from 0 to 10, it is a 3. OK, maybe 4 since many stores are still closed. ",

I don't think about the past which can't be changed or the future, which no one can predict, only the present moment. I take several breaths to help myself think better about what I need to do in that moment. This is the opposite of the Freeze, Fight or Flight response we often turn to as a coping strategy. It helps me to take a hard day in manageable chunks, whether that be an hour or a minute at a time. This makes the days, weeks and months of sheltering in, social distancing and dealing with all the consequences of Covid-19 bearable. ",

Luckily it was our home state and I managed to get a job for 2 days per week which I can do from home\u2026 which happens to be at my sister\u2019s house for a few more months, because our own home is being rented out. But keeping on task when there are people home around me all the time watching TV and talking at the tops of their voices is pretty tricky. And there is an overpowering sense of the future being rather different, socially, emotionally as well as economically. It brought home how fragile our constructed worlds are. I feel so lucky to know we own our own home, have a garden to grow things in if we need to. I shudder about the reality of people living in high density or even medium density housing. It also brought home the need for each country to be able to produce its own food and its own basic manufactured goods. And that is not how things are currently set up. And it also reminded me what a ridiculous size the human population of this world is, and how if we had a smaller and less internationally mobile population, we would be in a very different place with this virus. A matter that the world could probably pay attention to, knowing that we don\u2019t have three planets for us to live on. ",

Fear of this silent killer will only lead to panic, panic will lead to people acting in a completely different manner. The media and all the talk of how many people who have died will cause concern of course. The important fact is the percentage is still very low versus recovery rate. I'm not saying you shouldn't be concerned or even afraid of the virus and what it can potentially do, but if it gets to a point that you are fearful of leaving your home to go shopping or for a walk, then it will have a negative impact on your wellbeing. All you can do is adhere to the strict social distancing measures when you are out, and also keeping yourself safe with the correct hygiene processes. If everyone makes this one sacrifice, of which we'll never likely see another global pandemic again in our lifetime, we will all come out of this just fine. Hang in there, you are not alone.
