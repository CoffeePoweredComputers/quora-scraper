            "answer_text": "I know that different states of consciousness can be expressed in the same brain, states that are not necessarily aware of the other states.  For example, in dreaming, I have no awareness of the memories or identity that I carry when I'm awake. When I am awake, I often have serious difficulty recalling my dream experience, so the disconnect between dream life from waking life could be a basis for seeing for multiple minds in one brain. I use the word multiple because the dream states are not coherent with each other, but separate constructions.  Then there is the layering of consciousness, where modes of mental functionality are separated by lack of memory recall and they work semi-autonomously.  People who have experienced serious trauma often repress whatever associations remind them of the trauma, and wall that off area of the mind.  That walled off area will sometimes take over and cause such a person to behave inappropriately in some situation because it resembles something from the trauma time. For example, someone who has been in wartime combat may dive for cover at the sound of a backfiring vehicle, or some other trigger stimulus may induce the person to start fighting. Multiple personality disorder can be seen as several minds in one brain also, but all of these examples are really examples of the fracturing of consciousness, breaks in the internal communications of a single mind in a single brain, either as a defense mechanism or as the product of an organic illness affecting brain function. That leaves the myth of demonic possession, which in my opinion is something that came about as an explanation for the existence of consciousness-fracturing mental illnesses that earlier generations of people could explain in no better way. As far as I am aware, it is one mind per brain, but minds can separate memories and functions into separate areas with little communication and this can take on the appearance of two or more minds per brain.  I will add that this compartmentalization is also normal, enabling awareness to concentrate on the most important issues at hand or as dreaming. When it becomes extreme, whether from organic disease or very high stress, it takes on pathological properties. ",

            "answer_text": "Friend Yes. Two mind can exist in one brain. In one man. With background of his current consciousness-as we observe in all humans in waking period. Let's share; Brain is physical construct. Mind is psychic construct. Consciousness is conscious construct. These three are proportionate to each other,both in quality & quantity,however,on individual scale,each follows different set of laws and different tool for perception. Mind in itself,being stuff of psychic energy is bunch of \u201cMany-Is\u201d,which can be taken as \u201cmany minds\u201d. Out of all these Is or Minds,each of us has one predominant I or bunch of few Is,which is known as \u201cchief feature\u201dand a man is known/identified by his chief feature,as nearly all life events are viewed/interpreted in color of this chief feature. Usually,one person bears one chief feature,but very rarely if two chief features are found in one man,he would not seem consistent/unified on his psychic scale,as one seems very consistent with one chief feature. You may wonder or can't understand such person with two minds/two chief features and being operational on subconscious plane,he-himself view/interpret life events either by one or another chief feature. You may consider as two minds in one brain and backed by one conscious stuff,on back end. Consciousness establishes control over mind and does not allow mind in itself to work on its own end. If some functional disorder is found in consciousness of a person,accordingly,his mind comes out from his conscious control and may work on its own,if he has two chief features,both become loud and dominant and may be contradictory to each other.A man is driven by such two minds,unknowingly and owing to his disturbed consciousness,he never knows his own two contradictory psychic splits-major splits which leads to insanity. Whichever mind/chief feature/major split is in operation in given frame of current on going life event,it comes under conscious,and person is identified wifh,believing that \u201cI am this\u201d,remaining totally unconscious to another mind & vice a versa. Disturbed consciousness is not enable to see/to comprehend both minds/both chief features/two pieces made up of psychic stuff,both simultaneously. Thanks Q guru ",

            "answer_text": "Happened to me once. Was watching a movie, the movie started to turn into a \u201c\u201cfirst person view\u201d type movie. Suddenly, the movie characters mind (let\u2019s call him bob) was mine. I\u2019m sitting there staring at my screen completely convinced that I was thinking in this characters point of view while at the same time I\u2019m thinking in my physical body. When I opened my mouth to speak, the character in the movie spoke what I wanted to say. What I wanted to think, Bob would think, but Bob\u2019s mind was in mine. Or was I in his? Anyways, meanwhile, in my physical body\u2019s mind I was slowly freaking out, I was worried I was going to be stuck in that state. So now, in my mind, I\u2019m thinking what I wanted to think from Bob\u2019s mind while also thinking in MY mind \u201cwhat is going on? Will this end? Am I stuck in this state?\u201d Both of these things were happening at the same time and it was slightly disorienting. It\u2019s difficult to describe what two thinking minds in one brain feels like. So I started thinking about my family, and things that I\u2019m convinced is part my life to sort of \u201cground\u201d myself. It ended as quickly as it happened. Completely shook my understanding of how the mind works. extra: so while this is all occurring, there was this feeling in my mind that was telling me I needed to pick a mind. The one I DIDNT choose would completely go crazy and the one I chose would be mine. Obviously fear and the things that \u201cground\u201d me made me pick mine. ",

            "answer_text": "Think about a terminal server, with various operative OS. You can consider the brain as a kind of computer, with nodes, cables, connections and electrical signals. Within this physical construction some kind of \u201cwindows like\u201d software allows you to run different programs to organise your vital functions and interact with your organs, the external devices.. However to make the system more robust the inner algoritms created a kind of terminal server so the apps can run within different environments enbodied in the general main process. The way the software interacts with the external devices, will so change according the type of operative system you are using. Those systems may change according the houre of the day, the external cirumstances or other shadowed causes. Usually those operative systems are not impermable to each other, as they share common ressources as memories and paterns within the main server. However under some circumstances those ressources are simply locked by the server and so each terminal operative system will run the different softwares in a kind of safety mode using on top of it different sets of privat operative \"virtual\" devices. So if you consider mind not as the server but more as the terminals within, yes the brain can run different operative systems, but not in parallel. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on your definition of \"mind\"  For example, schizophrenics seem to do a good job of having multiple minds in one brain, but that may not be the answer you're looking for. In that case, I'd say no. Each part of the brain contributes to an individual's understanding of the world through the sensory input it processes. This understanding is wound up in networks configured by synaptic weights of synapses between neurons. A \"different mind,\" given that there's only one brain, would have to run on top of the same networks, meaning its experiences, conceptions, and memories would be exactly the same as the other mind. Maybe you're okay with that for your definition of mind, but that is enough to convince me otherwise. ",

This structure is basically the wiring between the two hemispheres that allows them to communicate.  Scientists study how these people function extensively. One fascinating observation is that when the language brain half is asked why it did something (the other half did something) of which it has no knowledge, the language brain will always have an explanation.

There is so little actually known about the brain so far, because science requires measurable data. I do not consider those who can access other minds, lives, timelines, or the Universal Mind, crazy. I consider that they are capable of processing information beyond the perception of those who favour the left brain. We have two minds already when you consider left brain and right brain activities. I expect there is plenty of room for more. ",

            "answer_text": "It is difficult to know. I am not a doctor, but there is a computational theory of the \"I\" that interprets it as a fixed point in a space of prediction functions: Robot's and Human's self: a computational perspective. Although this paper mentions that it is very likely that this fixed point emerges, the truth is that the functions are not continuous, so there is no guarantee that the \"I\" is formed. On the other hand, like any fixed point, nothing prevents that there are several, which would build several \"I\" at the same time. ",

Each of us has a selfish nature that religions have blamed on a \"devil.\"  Each of us has a True Self that serves our best interests and can be trusted, even as a religionist claims we should trust in \"God.\"  There is a \"kingdom of God\" within each of us, identifiable with the peace we experience when we allow our true humanity to shine, a humanity we all share. So, we have one brain, but many parts of our personality.  These different parts war with each other, symbolic of the war between God and the Devil.   ",
