            "answer_text": "Q. To eliminate suffering a Buddhist must not have any desires but isn't enlightenment a desire? -According to Theravada Buddhism, Gotama Buddha said, ignorance is root cause of suffering and to eliminate suffering, one has to eliminate ignorance. - What now, monks, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering; ageing is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering; association with the unloved is suffering; separation from the loved is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.And what, monks, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? With ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be. With the volitional formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, the process of becoming; with the process of becoming as condition, birth; with birth as condition, ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. This, monks, is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.From http://tipitaka.wikia.com/wiki/6... - The Lord said: \u201cBhikkhus, I will teach you Dependent Arising, listen and attend carefully and I will speak.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d those Bhikkhus replied to the Lord.The Lord said: \u201cNow what, Bhikkhus, is Dependent Arising? With ignorance as condition, Bhikkhus, volitional activities come to be; with volitional activities as condition, consciousness comes to be; with consciousness as condition, mind-and-body come to be; with mind-and-body as condition, the sixfold sense-field comes to be; with the sixfold sense-field as condition, contact comes to be; with contact as condition, feeling comes to be; with feeling as condition, craving comes to be; with craving as condition, grasping comes to be; with grasping as condition, becoming comes to be; with becoming as condition, birth comes to be; with birth as condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come to be. That is how there is an origin to this whole mass of suffering. And this, Bhikkhus, is called Dependent Arising.\u201cBut from the complete disappearance and cessation of ignorance, volitional activities cease; from the cessation of volitional activities, consciousness ceases; from the cessation of consciousness, mind-and-body ceases; from the cessation of mind-and-body, the sixfold sense-field ceases; from the cessation of the sixfold sense-field contact ceases; from the cessation of contact feeling ceases; from the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; from the cessation of craving, grasping ceases; from the cessation of grasping, becoming ceases; from the cessation of becoming, birth ceases; from the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair cease. That is how there is a ceasing of this whole mass of suffering.\u201dFrom Dependent Origination ",

            "answer_text": "You are in a burning building and have the choice to die, to extinguish the fire or to find a safe way out.You might find a way to extinguish the fire, at which point you stop. Or you find the situation unsolvable, you find a way out and once you are safe outside the burning building you stop trying to find the safe way out, because there is no more use for it. Desire in Buddhism works similar. There are two types of desire, the type that sets buildings on fire, and the type that extinguishes the fire or tries to find a way out.To state that Buddhist must not have any desires, that\u2019s awkward. They should avoid the kind of desires that sets buildings on fire. But the desire to extinguish fire, it should remain until the flames are out, or the moment you realise that there is no extinguishing, at which point you leave the building. The desire to leave the building will also end when you are safely outside. The desire for enlightenment exists as long as there is some type of fire-starting desire present in life. Once that fire-starting desire is gone, the desire to extinguish the fire or to escape the burning building ends.This indicates that this desire actually depends on the existence of the fire, it is not independent. Since it\u2019s not independent it will end once the depending factor is gone. The desire for enlightenment is a useful desire up to the moment the desires that cause stress end. Once these stress-causing desires end, the desire for enlightenment end as well. The main problem for people is that they have pyromaniac tendencies, constantly setting their home on fire and then desiring to end the flames or to escape them. Stop doing that! ",
