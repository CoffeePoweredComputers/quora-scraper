            "answer_text": "I have had abilities to communicate with the other side since the age of seven. I wasn\u2019t frightened by it but rather intrigued. I remember telling my father about hearing his mom speaking to him from her grave in a heavy Italian accent. My dad would speak to her without saying it out loud and yet I could tell him the entire conversation. I at that time never knew her nor seen a picture of her. She died when my dad was approx 6 months old. I always felt her around me. As years went on I started to notice other abilities, senses that no one else saw or heard. I never discussed with any of my friends in my teens or twenties. I now am able to help people who are facing paranormal affliction. I am partner in a group who does this for non profit. It is like having a sixth sense. I have told things that spirits are telling me that no one knew and it was verified afterwards. I passed over a young boy, who I also captured him on a EVP recording. Approximately 2 years later I met a person from a different state and didnt know me and I was going to get a past life reading and before we started she told me \u201cYou passed a young boy over to go to his family and he is here with his father and they want to thank you for joining them together. She said the boy around 7 or 8 was smiling.\u201d I was so excited to hear this. There is a very thin veil between our world and the other side. I know to just accept my instincts and am grateful for the abilities I have and to be able to help those who need help. PS\u2026.The recording I had was that little boy when I asked how old he was and his reply was loud and clear \u201c7\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "No, you can\u2019t know unless you prove it to yourself. The bigger point is that you should not show others your powers or even tell them you have them. Why? This is because they will only believe you if you constantly show them. Once one gets going with their bragging rights \u2014 you can bet the ego grows. Please understand this next point and take it to heart. You got the powers because you worked the spiritual path and lowered the amount of ego in you. So, bragging by showing off the powers puts back the ego you struggled to lower. Mystics report that not only does the ego come back more powerful, but it will take you longer this time around to reach the ground you gained. Then you have karma. Karma is based on your actions. If you do harm to others that karma is on you. Understand that karma can be obvious and it can be subtle and undetected by you. This is why mystics say that if during your practice you receive powers \u2014 don\u2019t use them and fined a good guru who can remove them for you, if you can\u2019t maintain or control yourself. Once you begin showing off your power, you are no longer walking the spiritual path. The power was given you to show the level you have reached, making it only for your benefit; not any one else. I hope this helps you. ",

            "answer_text": "No, psychic powers are non-existent. No evidence for them at all after years of research, some with a $1,000,000 reward. Some people are very convinced that they possess these powers, but until they can provide robust evidence, I\u2019m sorry to say that they are at best deluded and more likely mentally ill. Most psychics are just faking it to defraud money out of gullible bereaved people. If they wish to prove me wrong on that - bring it on, we will set up some research. The only condition is that when I show you to be a fraud, you have to pay me for the research trial. If you show yourself to have magic powers you get to be the most famous person in the world, and can go and take a six-figure salary from your government - they won\u2019t need spies any more will they? Oh! But I forgot, you don\u2019t need money because your ghostie friends can tell you the next lottery result. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Allison, Personally, I prefer the term psychic abilities. I think there are too many \u2018power\u2019 hungry people in the world! Sometimes people are aware of their abilities from the beginning, sometimes not. It may depend on a person having a self-aware family. My mum spent most of her life keeping quiet about being psychic, (she apologized to me at the end), so I didn\u2019t get validation from her for a long time. I kept my \u2018secret life\u2019 to myself and thought perhaps that many people had the experiences I did but didn\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019ve found out in the last few years that my grandmother and her sister (both of whom I never met before they passed) and my cousin (who I do know and who is still with us) are all psychic. I also have a cousin in Australia who is a Shaman, go figure. In my case, several different people kept telling me I was psychic, and that it would be a good idea to get training. If you are not sure, you can try ESP tests on line like the ESP trainer by Russell Targ, who ran Project Stargate (remote viewing) for the US Navy. It\u2019s a free app you can download and play with. Here\u2019s the main site. Russell Targ | ESPResearch.com I also offer readings to help assess your psychic abilities. Hope that helps. Lots of light Sarah ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings Allison, I\u2019m not comfortable using the word \u2018powers\u2019 as for me it gives the impression of having an supernatural ability when anyone who can demonstrate an ability which isn\u2019t normally accepted by the general population. Dogmatic beliefs, and ritualized fears over the centuries has done its work. We all have psychic abilities, some people choose not to be the catalyst to bring their talents to light, in fear of being judged, chastised for being different. Self-evident for some people, a curse for others and a heck of a lot of work for those people who choose to bare the brunt of everyone\u2019s fears in order to assist others in some way. I feel a lack of knowledge, understanding, imprinted beliefs and the fear of other\u2019s hostility forces some people to hold their own council and keep to themselves their abilities. ",
