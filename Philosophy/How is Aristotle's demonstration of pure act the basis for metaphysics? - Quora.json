            "answer_text": "I am not sure it is the basis of metaphysics, after all, it is a conclusion based on his analysis of causality and the movement from potentially to actuality. I should think that his notion that relation arises from substance would be the basis. Put another way, Aristotle analyzes being in terms of substance. That would make substance the basis of metaphysics. ",
