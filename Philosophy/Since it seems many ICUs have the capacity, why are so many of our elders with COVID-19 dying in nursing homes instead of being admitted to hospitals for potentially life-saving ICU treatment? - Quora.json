            "answer_text": "Many patients in nursing homes explicitly request that they do not receive ICU-level care and it is frequently not in their best interests to receive it. Elderly patients in nursing homes are often very frail with numerous comorbidities, and often suffer from dementia. For many of these patients, the chances of aggressive ICU-level care being effective are low, and even if they are, they often have a very limited quality of life, so invasive and uncomfortable treatment such as intubation or ventilation often is of limited if any benefit to them. By definition, most of these patients do not have years of healthy and enjoyable life ahead of them, so \u201clife saving\u201d treatment is often not in their best interests and many explicitly do not want it. Remember that for many of these patients, even if they did have a successful ICU admission and they actually made it out of ICU (many wouldn\u2019t), at best they would have bought a few months of life at best, often of very poor quality (many of these patients are demented, bed-bound or otherwise extremely frail). It\u2019s quite common for elderly patients in this position (or their families), to indicate that if their medical condition to deteriorate, that they would only want care up to a certain \u201cceiling\u201d. Many opt for \u201cward based care\u201d, meaning they would only want treatment on a normal hospital ward, not invasive treatment in ICU. Some indicate they would not want any life-prolonging measures at all, and would only want to be treated with \u201cpalliative\u201d intent- in other words, they\u2019d only want treatment to keep them comfortable rather than delaying the inevitable. Now it is up to the patient and their family\u2019s wishes- if they do want life-prolonging treatment they can still receive it. It\u2019s not the case that we would refuse to treat someone because \u201cthey\u2019re in a nursing home\u201d (although in these situations I would nevertheless make sure the patient/family had been adequately informed of the reality of what more aggressive treatment would entail and what the benefits would be, when they made that decision). In practical terms, we often found in hospital that a more common problem was people were sent from nursing homes to hospitals against their wishes, not the other way around! I remember a few patients who had written signed advanced care directives saying they did not wish to go to hospital if they got sick and just wanted to be kept comfortable, but nevertheless still ended up in hospital. Often this was because despite their directives, the nursing home staff simply didn\u2019t know what to do when they did deteriorate and just called an ambulance. ",

            "answer_text": "I have answered similar questions before. Many elder adults choose not to go to a hospital because they don\u2019t want to be put on a ventilator. Many have living wills that specifically state they do not want a ventilator, or feeding tube, or other aggressive treatment at the end of life. If the family members know that and are willing to accept their loved one\u2019s decision, going to the hospital may not be in the best interest of the patient. It all boils down to quality of life versus length of life. When you are very old, sometimes you just want to go be with your lioved ones who have gone before you. For many people dying is not such a terrible thing. As a nurse I have cared for many people who are put in positions at the end of life that are much worse than dying. Being tethered to a machine that breathes for you and needing to be suctioned constantly would be one of those things. You are attached to the machine with a six foot hose. You can\u2019t get away from it. And new ventilator patients need to be auctioned very frequently in the beginning because the body tries to get rid of it by increasing secretions to push the foreign body out. It can be a terrifying experience. If you believe in an afterlife and have practiced your faith you understand that death is just a doorway to the next part of existence. ",
