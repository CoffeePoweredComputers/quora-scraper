            "answer_text": "I used to be a semi-pro player. Back in the day I played age of empires II at a really competitive level, I used to come home from school and just go at it 1v4 against some school mates of mine. After a while there was one particular guy that was copying my strategies and trying to replicate them faster in order to beat me. He did so. Me, being an extremely competitive person (who doesn't excel at sports overall) figured he was doing that and went over to speak to him about improving ourselves further. We decided to start playing online against other players, we lost. Over and over. We copied them, we beat them. School, homework, back to the grind, on and on. We saw this big tournament coming up, 2v2. We started playing together and we ended up winning it all, we were the best at the time. No prize money back then though, just bragging rights (which to me, is even better haha). From there on I wound up playing empire earth: art of conquest (yet another rts, those were big back in the day). Met this awesome Australian guy playing middle ages only who destroyed me\u2026 ended up becoming great friends with him, and the grind restarted, rinse repeat. Ended up winning some tournaments again so yay! Now, this was all when I had the time to do all the practice a pro player these days has to put. Be it in games, as in sports. Ended up playing League of legends later and also ended up becoming one of the best in Portugal, no big achievement, but I was working now. Ended up getting way surpassed mechanically by the younger kids, and at some point (probably some years too late) I realized I just couldn't keep up with my younger peers. Playing videogames for me was all about being able to compete with people from all over the world, now that I have 2 jobs, I'm quite unable to do so. Even though I still play single player games once in a while, I've given room to other more dear hobbies on my free time. En summa: If I had the required amount of time needed, I'd definitely still play competitively (I'm looking at you retirement!) ",

            "answer_text": "For me, no. I'm a lifelong gamer from the Atari and Commodore 64 days (I'm in my 40s now, married with 2 kids). For me gaming has always been a way to decompress, and I really enjoy immersing myself into the various worlds of the games I play. Now I've never gotten into online gaming with others, I tried it a few times and it's just not for me. I'd rather hunker down and explore a world on my own without having to worry about getting ambushed and killed by those that just wait for a newbie to annihilate (you all know what I'm talking about). Is that my only hobby? Of course not. I enjoy gardening, cooking/baking, hanging out with my kids, I'm a writer, love reading...it's finding a balance that works. However, I do game every day and when there's a new game I've been waiting forever for, I can spend hours playing it. Looking at you Red Dead 2. For some people, I guess you can outgrow them, like you can outgrow anything. I feel that games these days are better than ever though. The single player games I'm into have incredible stories that go beyond the fighting/exploring aspect of the game. I'm going to be an old lady and still be a gamer girl. ",

I lost interest in video games probably 10 years ago now, I even remember it happening. I was playing Battlefield Bad Company in multiplayer, and halfway into a game, I just turned it off and never played a video game again. Can\u2019t explain why, I guess sometimes hobbies just run their course. I don\u2019t play video games of any kind any more, for whatever reason, the entertainment value for me is gone. I think I could probably get back into some single player games, but probably not the multi-player stuff. ",
