            "answer_text": "Have you considered that free will isn't forced? Or that the higher being isn't separate from us? If you consider both of these facts, then choice is free.  If the higher being is the composite of all consciousnesses, and all are co-creating the present moment and all it's possible futures, then nothing is forced. We are all complicit in free will.There are forces that act regardless of our choices. I may choose to jump off a high cliff, but the force of gravity will not make it possible for me to fly. An asteroid may come and smash agains us, and no amount of choices will change that.  The highest order of existence is often beyond our limit of understanding. But it isn't a separate entity coercing it's will upon the rest of existence. It's all part of one huge, orchestrated movement. In it, human beings are free to adjust ourselves and our environment in any way we please. We are so small in the large picture, yet our freedom to engage or disengage creation is what makes a huge difference, both for us and for the higher order. It's the difference between living in a planet and killing it, or living in a planet and treasuring it. It's the difference between an enlightened humanity or am ignorant one. And, though I have no possibility to prove what I'm going to say next, and I'm limited in my understanding, I will venture to say that we make a difference in the big picture, in the entire cosmos.

            "answer_text": "You really opened quite a topic!  The subject discussion of ''free will'' has likely been debated since mankind has been able to think logically. I think you answered your own question; I would argue that free will cannot coexist with omniscience, which I often see ascribed to a creator deity. If  God as an omniscient being foreknows everything, how can man be free? The Merriam Webster dictionary puts it quite well, defining free will: ''freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention''. It is also interesting to note that Islam for example, on the one hand states that:''Reckoning, judgement and reward are based on man's choice of the course  he follows.'' and then adds: ''That choice is of his own making, although the ability to  choose either has been planted in him by God\u2019s will'' (surah six).This discussion will not end here.
