            "answer_text": "The question first of all makes an assumption: Why is criticism of another person bad? In fact, the only way we ever grow is when someone gives us criticism. How can we possibly know if something that we're doing isn't good unless someone or something else tells us? Criticism is a metric. It's an exposure to a new idea and to a new measurement to our action. So, the question is, \"How do we criticize someone well?\" Recently, I was having struggles with women I cared very much about. As a result, I felt uniquely lacking in my conviction. For once, I was vulnerable to what others suggested. Most of the time, I am one of those people who knows exactly what he believes, on any score. (Sometimes, that belief may not be based in the most evidence or empathy, and sometimes it is based on the unmitigated gall that my brain can solve problems that others have yet to despite working harder, but that's simply me). In that moment, I was feeling like a feather being blown about in a hurricane. I was so easy to sway. When we give criticism, we have to be careful about how we are impacting others. Human beings are social animals. We deeply concern ourselves with how we are viewed by others, how we are liked and disliked, how others feel about us and in general. So when you criticize someone, consider, \"Am I asking them to do something a) Fairb) Rightc) Implementabled) Practical\"? There's a million examples. Let's say that we have someone at our work who is perpetually late, under our management. Should we say, \"Grab your shit, you're incompetent and you're fired?\" Okay, sometimes that's actually warranted. But maybe what we should start with is: \"Why are you late? What's the problem?\" If a friend keeps getting angry and blowing up at us, we have to consider, \"Am I asking them never to be angry at me, or am I simply asking them to do something better?\" If I don't ask that question, I might say, \"You're always angry. It's really unpleasant and you're being a jerk\". Now, that might not be unfair, but it's a pretty massive implicit request we are issuing: \"Never be angry, or at least swallow it forever\". How about we ask, \"Okay, next time you're angry, I'd like you to wait a few moments then write down the complaint, and then e-mail it to me later so that way I can hear it in a calmer way?\" That's something that's fair, it's implementable, it's practical. It doesn't ask them to change everything, just to shift a little bit. We can justly be frustrated if they don't accommodate that request. Now, if your habit is that you criticize people unduly and too often, just remember your own flaws and how they might make other people feel. At first, this will be hard, but the more you do it, the easier it will become. So, in conclusion: Don't worry about giving criticism, be worried about giving criticism well. ",

            "answer_text": "As I write this answer, I'm clenching my teeth because I'm presently dealing with a difficult person at work!  To answer the question, it's very hard to avoid criticizing another person, especially if they're uncooperative, abrasive or have other undesirable traits or behaviors. What I've learn is they're usually not impacted by your opinion or critique. Therefore, as others have written, it's best to take a deep breath, and try to move past the negativity and focus on their positive attributes.  Explain your point-of-view, and how what they're doing is impacting your feelings, project, career, etc. Consider whether what the other person is doing is truly related to you.  For instance, are you impacted by your friend who regularly wears unkempt, grungy clothing? Probably not. However, if the person is a co-worker who interfaces with the public, and isn't suitably dressed, then it might be worthwhile to mention how the person's dress reflects poorly on others in the group, and potentially, the employer.  Remember, criticism can be constructive. If possible, frame your critique as a friendly, non-offensive recommendation. ",

One is to be avoided at all costs and the other MUST be limited - you cannot engage in constructive criticism everyday.

            "answer_text": "Hi, Anass, Your clear intention to do so is a good start. So, be clear with yourself. The habit of criticizing others may have roots in your own feelings of insecurity. So, do some spiritual work and you will hopefully come to the realization that you are a totally worthy human being. A great book to help with this is Richard Rohr\u2019s Immortal Diamond. It sounds like criticizing others is a habit. To break it, you need to do things to remind yourself. A twice-a-day journaling where you actually review your actions during the day for this purpose would probably work well \u2026and it would make you a more mindful and aware person altogether. Good luck! Ray ",

Maybe your own parents were very strict on you, making it impossible for you to do anything they did not like. I found a lot of support in psychotherapy.
