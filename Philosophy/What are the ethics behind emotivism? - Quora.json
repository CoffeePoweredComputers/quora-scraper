            "answer_text": "Emotivism is a theory of meta-ethics which equates moralizing with emoting or expressing certain attitudes. This theory is not about how to live a good life - that would be (first-order) ethics - but rather about the meaning and purpose of ethics itself. The idea is that the main function of saying things like \u201clying is wrong\u201d is to communicate your (e.g.) disapproval of lying. Emotivism shares with other forms of non-cognitivism several advantages: Metaphysical naturalism. Everyone agrees that emotions and attitudes exist, so emotivism doesn\u2019t introduce new theoretical objects to explain.Explains motivation. Morals are supposed to guide action, as are emotions and attitudes.Explains intractable disagreement. Our emotions/attitudes often differ from our neighbors\u2019, and if moral debate involves trying to change their emotions/attitudes, then sometimes no amount of debate can succeed.Explains why moral properties track (supervene on) non-moral properties. Emotions/attitudes about (e.g.) lying are sensitive to the other properties of lying: if two instances of lying are identical in all other ways, then your emotions/attitudes (and moral judgments) about those situations should also be identical.",
