            "answer_text": "What would such a universe be, in which no seeing, feeling, touching, etc is possible? In what way could that universe be different from a universe which does not exist, other than we, with our conscious imagination can project our own awareness outside of it and just give the remaining abstraction the name of \"exists\". If we run it the other way, and assume that existence does not require any sort of sensing, feeling, knowing, perceiving, etc then we must ask how and why such things would come to be at all, given that every one of their functions would be mechanically redundant. The universe that exists without consciousness as no plausible way, as far as I can tell, to accidentally develop the possibility of consciousness, let alone the actuality of it. I think that the difficulty in thinking about this philosophical question is that the nature of consciousness is such that it contains limitations which are ultimately a mirage. Our own level of human consciousness is so different from that of other species, that it is easy to think of our particular quality of consciousness as the defining quality, so that plants, bacteria, and even molecules are surely not conscious in a way which is as significant as our own. While this may be true, the question of what it means is another story.  Because consciousness has to do with the framing of experience, perception is not so much a matter of being an accurate or inaccurate model of an external reality, but a way of filtering and shaping experience from the outside in and the inside out. When we see an insect or a rock, we see only the tip of the iceberg which is available to our eyes and skin for inspection. The exterior of the insect is what is seen by through the experience of the cells of our eyes, and the projections of our psyche. It's not that the bug isn't real, it just isn't the same to us in our frame of reference as it is within its local frame of reference, and neither is the universe in general. An insect sees walls as places to walk on, water as something that can be stored in spheres in the middle of a blade of grass, etc. The entire universe could be nothing but nested experiences, even into the subatomic level. As we know, quantum mechanical phenomena are not really conceivable as material objects, but rather as immaterial states of shared tendencies. Isn't that a description of consciousness? ",

Your question has pre-supposed and pre-determined an answer. Please forgive me for saying so, but you are mixing up the paradigms of Spirituality and those of Quantum Physics. Sorry, but you are pre-supposing that they operate on the same root principles\u2026 Where, in Quantum or Classical Physics have you found this root of \u2018Consciousness\u2019?? What Consciousness? These relative realities only point to Superposition and Entanglement! Where have you found principles of ABSOLUTE Quantum Consciousness in the Observer?? I haven't found mention of any! Universal Consciousness doesn't even EXIST, according to the Scientist. Now, kindly prevent your mind from tripping over itself, and ponder upon Spirituality for a minute. My friend, you have referred to a Universe, and a Consciousness observing it. Yes? This can only be a Spiritual question. Because this involves Consciousness. Consider this: According to Spiritual Truth, Matter DOESN'T EXIST! Matter and it's Sense-dependent reality is an illusion that Indian Spirituality calls MAYA. The only 'thing' that exists is Conscious Energy. Consciousness. God is Infinite Conscious Energy, according to Indian Spirituality. The Universe/Multiverses are this Infinite Conscious Energy. It's very nature is Consciousness! Now you, the reader of this paragraph, are Conscious Energy. You are The Soul, according to Spirituality. You are merely a subset of the Infinite Conscious Energy. If you cease to observe, or to exist, will that prevent the innate Consciousness of the Universe to exist? No. Because Consciousness will still be observing Consciousness! Consciousness doesn't need eyes or instruments. Consciousness is aware of itself at all times! Still, it is good that the scientifically bent mind is now asking about Consciousness observing Reality. Earlier, people used to only talk about the human's five senses observing Reality. So, yes. Even without our individual consciousness to observe it, the Universe would continue existing quite comfortably. Nice trick question. ",

            "answer_text": "Your father's father's father's father is no longer alive. Surprisingly, the universe still exists. All living things are just a bunch of atoms interacting with each other to remain stable. Our conciousness and the ability to think is also a result of this interaction. So, if we really talk in the language of physics, then this interaction is not at all important for the existence of the universe. BUT Quantum Mechanics (or more precisely - Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) suggests that in some cases, for something to exist in a defined state, we need to measure/observe it. So, if this conclusion is taken to it's extreme limit, it can be said that the moon does not exist if nobody is observing it* (by observing I mean not feeling it's gravity, not seeing it, and not doing anything that tells you about it's presence). The same concept can be applied to the universe. If the lack of consciousness results in our inability to observe things, then the Universe will stop existing (given that no living being in the universe can observe it). *This conclusion is pretty valid at the very small scale (the quantum scale), but it's validity at larger scales is still a topic of debate.

We used not long ago to be the glorious chosen apex of creation, resplendent at the centre of everything, surrounded by our sun, moon and lots of pretty stars spread about by the gods, in tribute to us\u2014 a vast panoply we call for good reason the heavens, all created purely for our delight. Over the centuries, we have had to emerge kicking and screaming out of our comfy cocoon into a cold unfriendly universe where we are relegated to a very average little rocky ball in a remote corner of an insignificant galaxy amongst trillions of bigger and better ones. We could even be a dull little bunch of primitive animals ignored by the billions of far mightier intelligences we can never meet, spread across the vastness of a universe we will never be given access to. So, consciousness, according to us, is our tiny minds. Could the universe possibly go on existing without those? Phew! Now I\u2019m not feeling so good.

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is a manifestation of the Absolute or Universal-mind. The body-mind thinking process seems to need consciousness to function. This is what the mystics say. I am just drawing it out for you what they say.  It has been said that this whole center play of energies below has no physical entity in the body or a place to settle itself into. When it stops functioning like without consciousness then the universe disappears. We operate through the 5 senses and we depend on this energy play below to perceive things. If it stops flashing about in us, then everything we see and perceive disappears. \u201cThey are only appearances that we see and not real.\u201d  Having said the above I do believe that the mind can function with the universal mind. It we force ourselves to stop thinking with the body-mind-consciousness which also brings on silence in the body and mind and then try and think with the universal mind. The thinking with the Universal-Mind is not thinking as you know it but a kind of \u201cbeing\u201d where thinking is like a streaming of information with a no this-and-that thinking like we normally have in trying to figure things out with our body-mind - the figuring seems to have already been done and the results are passed on to us as information. This is where I have been: so just passing on a state of mind to be checked out by others. It is experiential information. If you cannot replicate it then my observation could be wrong. The body-mind-consciousness is what they call a Noumenon - It only appears to be what you see but it is not real. Lets face it there are no colors in the world but just its frequencies. The colors are given by the color senses in the eyes which the brain converts to make color for you. The palette of colors are in your brain and not outside you. The color is created as an appearance only after the frequency had entered your eyes and then brain. It is possible outside of your eyes it is all grey. What a lie in the Truth in you. Because, if you look closely inwards into thyself there are Truths which the mystics have discovered that show what your true self really is all about. What a magical game to play - knowing thyself as you truly are\u2026\u2026 Hence that makes all of reality as we experience it as only an appearance and it is not real in us. What was there before birth and death - was only the Universal-Mind or the Absolute. We are born and the body-mind-consciousness start to figure out appearances. When we die the appearances all disappear and we are back to our source the Absolute/Universal-mind. In that sense the SELF and PERSONALITY that we think so important to us, and which we like to preserve, just does not exists in reality - it has no place to sit to stay permanent after we die. Lights on, personality on, or it feels like personality and lights off all personality gone and no trace of it left behind. We are back to being part of the Universal-mind and waiting for our next manifestation. Please comment if I am wrong. Only in relationship can the \u201cnew\u201d be seen. ",

If you mean human consciousness (/experience) then broadly speaking no, not at all. The universe is much much older than us, and did not spring into being because some plains apes appeared out of the quantum foam. However, Aspects of what we call reality only exist because of us. Time, for instances, only exists as a perceptual tool for human/animal consciousness, and in that sense if all animals died time wouldn't exist.  If you are willing to accept pan-psychism, the idea that literally everything has an consciousness/experience, then you can make the argument that existence and experience are two sides of the same coin, because if some phenomenon isn't observed/experienced by something else - even just cosmic background radiation, the Higgs Field, etc - then it is indistinguishable from it not happening ",

People do make claims like this but their evidence is in essence a subjective impression. People believe all sorts of weird stuff based on subjective impressions; humans are imaginative creatures. People also claim that trees are green, but this is \u201cnaive realism\u201d assuming that the world is actually identical to our perceptions. Just a little analysis (eg, consider color-blindness) reveals that there is clearly no greenness in trees, the greenness is a trick of presentation that occurs as a result of the way the brain is wired. There is no reason to believe the weird things that people believe about consciousness are any more that tricks of presentation, and a bit of imagination and narrative. The brain is complex and we don\u2019t understand it (that much). Humans struggle with simple things like sudoku; they certainly aren\u2019t going to be capable of analysing the brain itself. So, the workings of our own brain are hidden from ourselves; we have a grossly simplified working representation of what is really going on. Most of the fanciful ideas that is believed about consciousness are errors of naive realism, believing that this representation is that actual workings of the brain. It clearly isn\u2019t, and there is a library of psychological evidence that demonstrates that it isn\u2019t. If a bunch of photons hit an eyeball, a bunch of physical effects occur. Some effects may propagate into the brain. Similarly, a bunch of photons hit a rock a different bunch of physical effects occur. Neither of these events will create the source of the photons. ",

Although the representations of mind about the universe are owners, it is assumed that there is a independent essence of the real. Why is this a good bet? Because if our universe is completely owner of mind, so it strictly says nothing of what is that mind. No external reference. All questions become insoluble in the sense that all the answers are allowed. The second: if there is a independent real, it produced other minds who seem different from our. We can not even \u00ab fit \u00bb their vision. All we can do is to pool our representations and compare them. Thus we establish a kind of conceptual mold around the real. It is a collectivist process and not a individualist one. The third: if the universe and its representation in our minds are two different things, disappearance of the second don\u2019t stop the first. However the representations of our minds belong to reality. They are the highest part of his organization (we know presently). If all minds disappeared (including non-terrestrial possible), the universe would lose the top layer of its organization. It would become a heap of stupid molecules. Possibly able to rebuild something else... it has been already very creative :-) ",

To illustrate it further let me take an example of a stone. It is made up of matter as science tells us. But what is the driving force which makes it a stone and not a plant. This driving force is consciousness. There are different levels of consciousness present. We,humans exhibit the highest level of consciousness but everything,be it living or non living exhibits consciousness. So,to separate consciousness from universe is like talking about yin without yang. You might argue that your view of the universe is based on your consciousness and different people will have different views depending on their levels of consciousness. But the truth is their exists one universal consciousness which governs all sub consciousness if we may call them. This consciousness is independent of whether you perceive it or not. It is the driving force in the universe. If it is not present,the universe will cease to exist. ",

But because of consciousness we are witnesses to what we call the universe (or that part of it we are capable of observing), the rest is speculation. Without consciousness the universe and all its elements would go on without us. As it did for billions of years before sapient creatures arose on this planet, and as it will long after our world is extinguished when our sun expands and explodes in a few billion years. Now you might hold that we are stardust and from that inception we became conscious beings. So could there be conscious beings out there? Possibly, but unless we are sure of their existence, that also is speculation. We humans are good at speculating possibilities, but just because we can and do speculate does not necessarily give us sufficient grounds to expect our intellectual peregrinations and ratiocinations to be the real deal. Empirically, there is just us floating in space on a tiny planet circumnavigating a star in or very own cosmos, looking out in wonder \u201cCould the universe exist without us,I wonder\u201d. ",

If a million people look at the moon, not only will they see it, they\u2019ll see it in the same lunar phase \u2014 despite not knowing which phase it should be in. If a million rural people were walking outside at midnight during a full moon, they would see their shadow cast by the moon and be able to estimate its position and phase (from its relative brightness) even though they have no idea where the moon should be or which phase it is in. When they turn around and look at the moon, they won\u2019t be surprised that their estimates were pretty reliable. ",

Physical objects which are also a product of thought, though an actuality, that is, though it has an actual physical existence independently of thought to some extent, is equally a part of this reality because to some extent, how one perceives the physical objective world and objects, would depend on one's own background of experiences and perceptions, is it not? A table is a physical object, and therefore has an existence independently outside of thought, and to that extent, it is an actuality. Yet, it is also a product of thought, and to that extent, it is a part of reality too, is it not? If one were to take away, all that is left of this reality, including the psychological self/ the \u201cme or ego\u201d, what remains? When one\u2019s mind is empty, one\u2019s thoughts ceases. In that cessation, there is the cessation of me, the ego, is it not? What is left of my consciousness if the content of the \u201cme\u201d ceases? My content includes, my experiences, feelings, emotions, ideas, opinions, perceptions, prejudices, desires, love, hatred, anger, jealousy, successes, failures, fears, anxieties etc. This is what defines me as a person, is it not? If all this is removed from my consciousness, what am I left with? In other words, if you removed the \u201cI\u201d from your consciousness, what is left? Emptiness, Nothingness, Silence. And in that emptiness there is a tremendous expanding energy. But that source of creation itself can never be a creation for it to be grasped by the mind.Writings of Priyha Kannan ",

Each and every component of the Whole is an inevitable part of that Whole. The Whole would not be without its parts and every part is an integral part of the Whole. What seems to be up for debate is whether consciousness is a special part or not. Have you heard of general relativity? Part of it explains that there is no privileged place or time, that everything is relative to everything else. I think that principle holds for all the parts of the Whole; there is no privileged part that is more important, more significant, more real, than any other part. Consciousness merely enables us animals with brains to perceive and evaluate those other parts; it isn\u2019t privileged as a part of that Whole any more than water is because it makes other stuff wet. Consciousness enables us to witness other stuff; it isn\u2019t privileged just because it enables us to witness stuff, it just is. And, it cannot not be, just like everything else in existence. ",

It takes on endless permutations and levels that weave and intertwine with one another in a vast tapestry.  To say that consciousness is one thing and existence is another, is a gross misunderstanding of the nature of existence.  Knowing how different fields of consciousness interpenetrate and interact should be a goal of science.  Science is still in it's stone age with it's emphasis on a \"material\" universe separate from consciousness.  The materialist model dominates current thinking and excludes the role of consciousness by limiting it to an epiphenomenon of the human brain.  That is a backward understanding. Yet, the paradigm of materialism is such a dominant or rule set or matrix in human thought, that few see through it. ",

If you mean \u201cknowledge about existence\u201d then sure, only if a conscious observer has gathered knowledge about something existing, only then it can be said to exist. But - on the other hand - if you define existence based on the agreement that things do exist, despite they are not observed and no knowledge exists about their existence or their existential state, then for sure, the universe exists even without someone having awareness about it or knowledge about it.

It is knowable by itself being an integrated being. And, it reiterates, it generates the knowledge of itself, by itself. Life is property of dynamic matter. This property manifests itself as organic life when a dynamic entity reaches a certain level of evolutionary integration, that of algae, for example, in which the phenomenon of individuation appears for the first time in the history of the process of evolutionary integration. And much later, in due time, consciousness appears in the beings that reached the last level of evolutionary integration, achieved to date. Matter = Dynamic Matter + Static Matter. Dynamic Matter possesses energy. Static matter possesses inertia. ",

Although we cannot know the answer to this question for certain, describing the world is a much simpler task if we assume the existence of an external world\u2014a universe that exists whether we perceive it or not. From one of Bertrand Russell\u2019s popularizations of philosophy, I remember the example of a cat passing behind a pillar. Does the portion of the cat hidden by the pillar de-exist when it is covered up? This bizarre question can be avoided very elegantly and simply by assuming that all of the cat continues to exist whether we perceive it or not. What is more, best scientific evidence suggests that, for most of its existence, the universe was not perceived by humans. Early on, before supernovas created heavy elements, it couldn\u2019t have been perceived by any known thing. Unless you believe that the evidence of the universe\u2019s antiquity was put there to fool us all. The latter hypothesis is not testable and can therefore be dismissed from a serious discussion of the nature of the universe. Even Bishop Berkeley, a champion of the notion that being and being perceived are one and the same, believed in an external world that transcends our human perceptions of it, and preserved his philosophy by invoking a great perceiver of the external world, namely God. tl;dr: Although the objective existence of the universe can\u2019t be proven philosophically, realist accounts of reality (i.e. accounts of reality that assume that the external world exists apart from perception) are simpler than idealist accounts of reality (i.e. accounts of reality that assumes that being perceived and existing are one and the same).

No, Virginia, the universe existed for billions of years before there was much of anything more complex than a hydrogen atom. It was not possible for anything to be living until 2nd generation stars had formed from the complex debris of first-generation stars. And then it took additional billions before any living thing could evolve to the point of consciousness. As one biologist said\u2026 \u201cIf we generate reality with our minds, what did the universe look like when there was nothing more evolved than a sea-slug?\u201d But lets take this a bit further. Lets say there\u2019s something to this, and by some magical process a conscious mind is necessary to generate \u201creality\u201d. Where did the conscious mind come from? Did we just pop into existence? Were we \u201cimagined\u201d by some other race of conscious beings? Who imagined them? We very rapidly run into the \u201cinfinite regress\u201d problem that besets ideas of God\u2026 \u201cWho made God?\u201d The whole thing is silly.

We know that for life to exist all the constants have to be as they are now, so if we change some of those constants even a little bit (for example we make gravity slightly weaker) then everything goes haywire. The bosons don\u2019t form, elements are not created, stars don\u2019t burn etc etc. And this happens if you change any parameters (most likely because they\u2019re all somehow connected mathematically through something like string theory or some other theory of everything).

I therefore assume that when I die, the universe continues to exist. Therefore, it would seem reasonable to suppose that the universe would go on existing even after a supernova were to wipe us all out. Let's think of it another way. We tend to think that the universe existed well before humans did, since we trace our origins back through various species who have varying degrees of consciousness. The universe clearly existed before consciousness did. Therefore, after the last conscious being is snuffed out, the universe continues to tramp on. ",

Yes, sound waves would have been produced and other animals would have heard them even if no human did. Even if no animal picked up the sound waves they would still have been produced. Many things can exist without any outside awareness of their existence. I am sitting in a room breathing air that is in the room, but the air is still and I am not consciously aware of its existence. And yet, It is definitely present in the room, so it does exist. ",

I assumed it did because how else can we be, if something wasn\u2019t existing before us. I know my mother existed before me therefore I conclude my consciousness is not necessary for the universe to exist. ",

It was a purely physical affair, and it constituted reality, but there was no consciousness then. And that answers your question: Yes! Consciousness takes the form of neural activity in a brain, or of some analog of that in a hypothetical case. At best, then, it forms no more than the lightest salting on physical reality. Your mistake is to think of consciousness in subjective, mentalistic terms. You do so for the most prosaic of reasons, simply because you encounter your own consciousness\u2014which, again, takes the form of neural activity in your brain\u2014by way of neural connections within your brain in which no perceptual processing takes place, and hence without perceiving it in any way. Since you do not perceive your own consciousness, you do not know what it is, a physical phenomenon of a certain description. But that is irrelevant. Consciousness is one physical phenomenon among indefinitely many, and not a bit more than that. It is time to break free of this subjectivist morass! It is a waste of time. A physical universe can exist without brains, and hence without consciousness. ",

IF MIND\u2019S PERCEIVING IS A PRECONDITION OF EXISTENCE, THEN UNIVERSAL BOUNDARIES CAN NEVER EXIST. We have no idea. We only know theoretically the boundaries are receding and more space is being added. We believe this despite we do not have a perception, mathematics helps us believe that. Universe exists even if our math, physics and philosophy is not there. That is, mind, whether is there or not, these realities continue to exist. Let us assume that infinitesimally small brain existed at a unicellular level at the inception. For the sake of simplicity, let it be around 1B years in Precambrian era. Our solar life is around 4.3B years. Treating brain/mind as a unit, for mind, solar system existed 1B year before if we think mind to be precondition for that. But we cannot say that before that, it was not there. Calculations show it to be of that age, despite realizing it to be a theory only. Likewise, universe is estimated to exist for about 13.7B years. MIND IS NOT A PRECONDITION FOR ITS EXISTENCE. Hope it explains well. ",

So, there is no time dilation or contraction, only clocks run slower or faster according to the external speed of that clocks. But I want to emphasize something. If our Universe (as a physical phenomenon) has a beginning and an end, it is a time that begins and ends in his own reference system of the Universe (time duration) . If there is an end of the universe, it is better to live on the Earth than in a spaceship that moves at a speed close to the speed of light. On Earth you can move and build faster any devices than in that spaceship. So, we might say : \u201cFor the Universe it would all be over very quickly if he had not developed inside systems which: from one point of view it seems to move faster and from another point of view it seems to gain time. \u201c So, that\u2019s the point, that\u2019s the message , that's the rule of the Universe: to gain time. The motion and the gravity are the expression of same rule: to gain the time, otherwise it would all be over very quickly? If the Universe respects this rule, it can be a proof that he has consciousness. ",

Page on sciencealert.com So, now your question .The universe should exist without consciousness  , why?Because after big-bang  the universe came into being and still existed for billions of years without any form of life being  conscious about it.  Secondly, when the universe was consciously thought to be geocentric (earth in the center model of the universe), while it was heliocentric (sun in the center) , the universe didn't even care about what we thought about it. It remained heliocentric . Lastly , the thing is that we are basically trying to impose our thoughts on the universe and trying to test their validity in term of 'reality', linking to consciousness is just one on them. ",

As such the question of existence of any entity can arise only in the presence of consciousness. Thus on a careful analysis you can conclude that this question presumes the existence of consciousness. Even to raise a question about existence, you need the presence of consciousness. The obvious answer is that the universe exists the way it is only because of observation by consciousness. If there is no consciousness this question about its existence or absence of existence itself can not arise and as such the question is illogical and deserves no answer! ",
