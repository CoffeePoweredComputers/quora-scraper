            "answer_text": "I have to disagree with one point the other answerer made, that being that self-deprecation comes from low self-esteem. It doesn\u2019t, and for the sake of the reader, it is NOT self-depreciation, it is self-deprecation, and to be self-deprecating keeps a wise man humble, as to be self deprecating is to be initially introspective in conflict, and important decision making. In the same way many want to lump empaths in with codependents, they also want to lump anything that takes away from the self into a category of deficit, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, simply because those who lack humility, lack both compassion and empathy. This is not to say everyone who is self-deprecating isn\u2019t indeed also codependent and suffering from a low self-image, or low self-esteem, as I\u2019m sure self-deprecation goes a long way in helping oneself beat themselves up. A healthy level of honest evaluation, will include self-deprecation, unless of course one either cannot bear to, isn\u2019t willing to, or is too self-centered to be introspective, such as Cluster B types, and toxic people in general. It wasn\u2019t before we as a society went from Life magazine, to People magazine, to US magazine, and finally Self magazine, that social convention dictated to not put yourself above everyone else is to have low self esteem. I won\u2019t preach, but I prefer my life to be one based on other centeredness, rather than self-centeredness, for many reasons, mostly though, because if I\u2019m not keeping my prideful, arrogant and attention seeking ego in check, who\u2019s going to? Because I believe left to our own devices, we will slip away from a when necessary \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d to a worldview espousing \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d and that to me, is the epitome of narcissism, and God help us if we continue down such a slippery slope as that. I think it\u2019s pretty obvious, as the other answerer said, they are both indeed mutually exclusive, and I will go as far as to say they are also polar opposites. Let another give you accolades, and not your own lips. Thanks for reading, P Musings by Paul In-Ca ",

            "answer_text": "Being a narcassistic is basically being self centred and having a self esteem so low that everything a narc does is to fix his low self esteem. Self depreciating is also because of having low self esteem, but then you don't have to be a narcassist for self depreciation. To answer your question: Yes, they are mutually exclusive. ",
