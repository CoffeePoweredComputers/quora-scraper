            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t confuse immorality with amorality. If you believe X can be either moral or immoral but X cannot be immoral, you are not amoral. If you believe X can neither be moral or immoral, you are amoral. It seems to me that you are not amoral. However, it also seems to me that you are immoral for believing that nothing is immoral. Morality is a contract that rational beings enter in order to govern their conduct. For example, the moral community agrees to maximizing the well-being of the community and to minimizing the ill-being of the community. This is moral ontology. Furthermore, the moral community makes use of rationality, experience, history and science to inform its moral epistemology. Therefore, that which maximizes ill-being is immoral and that which minimizes well-being is immoral. That which maximizes well-being is moral. For example, respecting the autonomy, individuality and equity of the members of the community maximizes the well-being of the community. If you believe harming children (not to be confused with helping children) is not immoral, then you are either irrational or immoral. That is, you violate the moral contract that rational people adhere. You are responsible to the moral community to uphold the morals of the contract as a rational person. However, if you lack rationality, then you are not immoral but sick and we would need to get you some help. Furthermore, from your point of view my view of your belief is moral since you do not believe my belief can be immoral. It seems that we both win. That is, you with your \u201cno\u201d immorality and me with my \u201cyes\u201d morality. ",

            "answer_text": "YES, I\u2019m not here to judge anyone, or to say that I know everything but I will start by saying that throughout history people have depended on law and order to define their quality of life. The Webster\u2019s dictionary definition for immoral is \nNot moral; inconsistent with rectitude, purity, or good morals; contrary to conscience or the divine law; wicked; unjust; dishonest; vicious; licentious; as, an immoral man; an immoral deed. Is this any different for the definition for Nefarious? Which is; Wicked in the extreme; abominable; iniquitous; atrociously villainous; execrable; detestably vile. Well that depends on how important morals really are to you and if nothing is immoral than you can do anything and say that it is ok or \u201cGOOD.\u201d We can go to the KJV bible and find what scripture has to say about good and evil. Isaiah 5:20 King James Version (KJV) 20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Everyone wants to be their own authority, their own God so to speak, but most people understand what happens when that becomes a reality. Greed takes over and having more and more becomes the primary goal, even if it means taking innocent life or life in general to obtain it. How long do you think society would last without morals and values? I had an Atheist friend ask me, \u201cwhy should we as independent people be bound to believe or worship any god?\u201dand he said that we should be free to choose.\u201d I chuckled and said we are free to choose that is the dichotomy of life. Your question actually gives you the answer , \u201care you immoral for thinking nothing is immoral?\u201d Well as long as you understand the question\u2026 If nothing is immoral than good and bad don\u2019t exist and nothing you do would have any consequence. Do you really believe that you can do what ever you want and not have any consequence? So in conclusion: Yes, if you believe that nothing is immoral you would have to be immoral yourself. If I believe that the world is moral and live not in the virtues of a good man how could I say that I understand the value of being moral or how could I say that nothing is immoral when I myself am immoral? I hope this helps.. God bless. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends if you mean objectively, or subjectively. If you don't believe in objective immorality (and through that, objective morality either), then you are a moral nihilist. These people tend to believe that morality is dependent on the person and isn't a natural law that is set in stone. The majority believe that for people, that morality resides on empathy, rationally, consequence, and compassion. These people are accepted by some, and rejected by others. If you do not believe in objective morality, then you don't need to ask if you are immoral. The only person that can answer that is you. If you don't believe in any subjective morality, that would mean that there is no wrong in the world according to your perspectives. This perspective isn't entirely wrong, as we cannot measure reality objectively, but it causes a few ethical issues. This would imply that you think that rape, murder, genocide, stealing, and any other \u2018crime against humanity \u2018 is completely moral and there is nothing wrong with it. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re the former. If you are the latter, I'd reccomend you visit a psychiatrist. ",

If you truly think nothing is immoral, then it would depend on who is judging. If a utilitarian ethicist (think: greatest good for the greatest many) was judging you'd fair a lot better than a deontologist. Although a utilitarian wouldn't like you very much if you did things that brought about bad consequences for the public, it wouldn't matter one way or another what you actually thought. A deontologist, however, would scorn you. Even if, in the end, your actions were \u201cjust,\u201d if your heart wasn't in the right place, you'd be immoral. ",

            "answer_text": "Before you read this, just so you know, this answer might not be correct because I have read a book about ethics and morals long time ago and I might have mixed up some things, so I apologise for it in advance . Now, lets get into it. Yes, you are probably immoral if you think nothing is immoral, but there is more to it. In my opinion, morals are just a bunch of stupid laws that make opportunities for social controll and establishing of authority. They are not very deeply explained by using logics and reason, but instead its appeal relies mostly on human emotions. Of course, even when a person is immoral, it can be ethical. Ethics and morals are not the same thing, even though they are used most of the times interchangebly in common speech. Ethics rely more on reason than the morals do, thus making them be more progressive and meaningful. There can be unethical but morally correct people and vice versa. Here is an example: it was immoral to be gay back in the Middle Ages, and it was sometimes highly acceptable and encouraged to kill such people. The same was with other oppressed groups of people such as Jews, Muslims, Heretics and women. Even though those things were considered to be moral, they are highly unethical. Thus being said, we can conclude the following: If you think nothing is immoral, you are immoral, but that doesnt mean that you are unethical. ",

            "answer_text": "I am here to provide the case that no immoral intention results in a long term negative result, despite the intention being immoral. Now hear me out. Try this thought exercise for example: If you see a stray dog eating your picnic and you smack it, it could grow up and be more aggressive and kill a kid, or it could possibly provide companionship to a suicidal person, or have a ripple effect throughout time in some other way which saves some lives and ends others. These ripple effects are entirely unpredictable. So in the end there\u2019s a 50/50 chance that in two years time from you hitting that dog that the world will be a better place than if you left the puppy to chow down. This goes for any action, moral or immoral. The aforementioned ripples in time are called the butterfly effect in time travel movies and theoretical physics. You\u2019ve probably seen the movies where the hero goes back in time and saves someone (a moral act) but then the present time becomes a hellhole due to the butterfly effect. I would just like to say, also, that being kind and moral sets a good example for others, so maybe those ripples can be used for good if enough people try. ",

Perhaps you can be disappointed in your behavior perhaps with his more important as you're talking about a value judgment. What's really immoral who gets to decide that who's the final arbitrator. My mother once told me a story that my grandmother used she said what if you're dying and you're sitting in a rocking chair you have two weeks to live. How many things will you regret while you're sitting there in the chair watching people walk by. If you're going to regret that while you're waiting to die perhaps you shouldn't do it at all. I will dedicate that to Grandma Haggard aptly called The Rocking Chair test. ",
