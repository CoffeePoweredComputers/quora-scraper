            "answer_text": "Essays and Aphorisms by Arthur Schopenhauer His work was often concerned with the \u201cwill\u201d\u2013our inner drives and power. \u201cFor that which is otherwise quite indigestible, all affliction, vexation, loss, grief, time alone digests.\u201d But he also talks about surprisingly current issues: \u201cNewspapers are the second hand of history\u201d\u2013and that the hand is often broken or malfunctioning. And of course, the timeless as well: \u201cHope is the confusion of the desire for a thing for its probability.\u201d Nature and Selected Essays by Ralph Waldo EmersonEmerson\u2019s essays make us act. They remind us that we are ultimately responsible for our own life, for making ethical choices and for fulfilling our potential. Man\u2019s Search for Meaning by Viktor FranklMan is sent to a concentration camp and finds some way for good to come of it. Finds some way to turn it into the ultimate metaphor for life: that we have little control over our circumstances, complete control over our attitude, and our ability to make meaning out of the things which happen to us .In Frankl\u2019s case, we are lucky that he was a brilliant psychologist and writer and managed to turn all this into one of the most important books of the 20th century. I think constantly of his line about the man who asks, \u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d The answer is that you don\u2019t get to ask the question. Life is the one who asks and we must reply with our actions.\u201d ",
