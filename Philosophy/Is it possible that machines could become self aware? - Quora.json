            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s definitely possible, but it\u2019s tricky because the concept \u201cself-aware\u201d is more than a little fuzzy and obscure. \u201cSelf-awareness\u201d and \u201cconsciousness\u201d are pretty close synonyms. My car has sensors that measure the pressure in my tires. The system monitoring my car is \u201caware\u201d of the fact that my left rear tire has lower pressure than the other three, and it produces an alert light to share its awareness of that fact with me. Does that make my car \u201cself-aware\u201d? Most of us would say no, but then have trouble in spelling out precisely what is missing, that would have to be added to make my car \u201creally\u201d self-aware. The German philosopher and scientist Thomas Metzinger has done a lot of work on consciousness, and part of his view is that conscious beings operate through dynamically updating models of themselves. In one of his books he describes a fairly simple robot that has multiple legs, sort of like a crab. All the processor, that runs the system, records is the position of the robot\u2019s joints and the robot\u2019s position in the lab space. It \u201clearns\u201d to maneuver in its environment by randomly generating 16 models of the relationships between the positions of its joints and its movements through space, trying out what the various models predict will happen due to limb movements and adopting the model that best gets it across the lab floor. If the experimenters then snip off one of the legs at a lower joint, the robot will detect that its favored model is no longer working and will generate a new set of models and test them to find the best way to limp to still get around. The simple robot does have a dynamically updating self-model. Is it self-aware? Most of us want to say no, but we have difficulty in spelling out what is missing. I think this is because of the vagueness in our concepts of \u201cself-aware\u201d and \u201cconscious.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "At least you are asking this question; so many believe they are aware or potentially aware. It is impossible; a machine can only be programmed to emulate the behavior of animals. Awareness cannot be emulated. To imagine otherwise is the same as trying to have a conversation with a store mannequin on the basis of its superficial resemblance to living human beings. Without going so far as to say we humans are sacred beings, there really is a difference between an animal which experiences and a machine which does not experience. What does a machine do? It emulates the behavior of us animals, that is all. When it comes to accomplishing tasks, a machine is quite often quicker, more accurate, more efficient and certainly cheaper than a human. In my opinion, the confusion about this matter of machine \u201cawareness\u201d machine \u201cintelligence\u201d machine \u201clearning\u201d etc. began when the first engineers and programmers of computers referred to the data storage and retrieval systems as \u201cmemory\u201d. Memory is the brain\u2019s attempt to recreate a living experience. That is not what computers do. The resemblance is superficial; but it is enough of a resemblance to tempt us to call it memory when it is not. Same with awareness. ",
