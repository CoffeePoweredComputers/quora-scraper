            "answer_text": "The question you\u2019ve asked is an example of bias in itself. It assumes, for example, that unbiased questions can exist. But what would be an example of an unbiased question? By definition a question is made up of words, i.e. words that you have selected from your vocabulary. But why did you choose those words and not others? Bias of some kind. Another bias embedded in your question is that there is some universal definition of \u2018bias\u2019 out there that everyone understands the same way. This is a sweeping claim, to put it mildly ",
