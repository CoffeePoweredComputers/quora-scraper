            "answer_text": "Depends. Libertarian philosophy revolves around the non aggression principal (NAP). You can do pretty much whatever you want, as long as it doesn't harm others or infringe on their rights. So, if I believe in collective ownership of the means of production, and I find a bunch of like minded people, we can set up a socialist community that owns and shares everything WE OWN. We can't force people to join or stay, but we can make them enter into a contract that legally binds them to our rules. So, when me and my buddies open Marxville, and we do everything he wanted to happen, as long as we do it on our property and with complete agreement, we\u2019re being Libertarian. Now, when you decide to leave (within the limits of our agreement) we stop being Libertarian when we send out a goon squad to keep you in. Or, if you're just passing through the area, and we state (after you walk in) that being here means you are now a permanent member of the society, and so is your stuff, we stopped being Libertarian at \u201cwelcome to the first day of the rest of your life.\u201d That's the thing people fail to understand about Libertarianism. It isn't lawlessness. It sure isn't utopian either. It isn't opposed to other economic systems. It isn't opposed to dictatorships, democracy, theocracy or monarchy. What it is opposed to is being forced to comply against your will when you're not bothering anybody else. It's forcing me to live by your rules on my land. But, you sure as hell better believe you can follow my rules on my land or get the hell off. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on which meaning of \u201clibertarian\u201d you use \u2014 the pre-1960 meaning or the American post-1960s meaning. In the older meaning, \u201clibertarian\u201d referred to a tendency in the socialist movement. They were libertarian because of the emphasis they placed on positive liberty. Positive liberty can be understood as control over the decisions that affect you, either as an individual or as a group. This is also called self-management. Libertarian socialists advocate the re-organization of society on the basis of self-management through all the institutions of the society. The second aspect to positive liberty is equal access to the means to develop your potential, to build and sustain your capacities. Developing one\u2019s skills and cognitive potential is necessary to participate effectively in the self-management of decision-making. The opposite of self-management are top down bureaucratic or managerialist hierarchies that concentrate power over groups of people in the hands of the few \u2014 such as ownership of the means of production by a capitalist elite, or concentration of power in managerilist hierarchies in governance or production. Libertarian socialists thus advocate a worker-managed, socialized economy. The post-1960 meaning of \u201clibertarian\u201d in USA is simply a new label for 19th century laissez faire liberalism with its advocacy of dog eat dog competitive capitalism and Social Darwinist opposition to systems of social provision. They claim to be \u201clibertarian\u201d due to their emphasis on negative liberty. This defines liberty as absence of coercion or physical restraint. Since the employers don\u2019t stick a gun to your head to take a job, they regard capitalism as based on a free relationship between capital and labor \u2014 completely ignoring the coercive power of management, or the fact that capitalism requires a large dispossessed class who are forced to seek jobs from employers, and submit to a tyrannical management autocracy, or face dire consequences (kicked out of your apartment, starvation, etc). This is why libertarian socialists would say the right wing libertarian concept of negative liberty is poverty-stricken concept of freedom. It\u2019s really about how to defend ideologically the autocratic power of the owning and managing classes. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in fact \"libertarian\" originally referred to anarchists. Anarchists are extremely libertarian socialists. Socialism is the communal ownership and democratic operation of the means of production. Authoritarian socialists such as Leninists believe that \"temporarily\" allowing the state to control all industry (think USSR) can be the first step towards a socialist society. In contrast to this, libertarian socialists reject not only state control but often the state itself. They believe in either a gradual or rapid decentralisation of authority, with the end goal being a horizontally structured society based around voluntary cooperation. ",
