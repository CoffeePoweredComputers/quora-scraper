            "answer_text": "How can an Idea change the world? Allow me to explain this with the help of few examples. How would you feel, if you had to go to the river daily to take a bath. Or how would it be if you can see tremendous amounts of drinkable water in a well but could not draw it out for drinking? Well someone felt that pain and came out with the idea of a bucket!  How about keeping your food on floor while eating? Then came someone with the idea of earliest plates  Got many ideas, but can\u2019t express all of them to someone. Write them down using a pen!  Oh! I forgot the most important idea, how about eating raw food? Someone came up with the idea of cooking it!  Do you know why there has been no wars since such a long time? It\u2019s because of this destructive idea! Nuclear Bomb!  You no longer have to walk to your workplace, thank to this idea. Automobiles!  How can any government control the masses. So they came up with this idea, weapons!  Want to assassinate someone but can\u2019t during a face off. What could be done? And then came the idea of using venom, just like snake.  Fed up of burglaries in house. Want an anti-burglary system, lets get a dog!  You no longer need to go 580 miles just to talk to your relative. Call him up!  Perhaps, this list can go on and on. I mean just look around yourself, all that you can see was once someone\u2019s idea. Now do you understand how an idea can change the world! ",

            "answer_text": " What are the ideas that changed the world? Ideas: Many and most have helped to bring change. Ideologies: Many and none could change the world. Some things are often queer in this world. Just as when you click on the question in notification, a slightly different question comes up for answering. Ideas and Ideologies are not same. Ideas are free and flowing and not rigid and come and go and also are not dangerous often. Similarly and generally, a \u2018change\u2019 is meant for the betterment of the situation. Let me answer whether Ideologies could change the world. All ideologies are rigid ideas often running in volumes and with no specific work out and specific end result in anticipation. Since they deal and speculate about human behavior to change according to those ideologies, it is obviously impossible, especially in both Religion and Politics. ",

Those who do know how to think, in spite of never have been taught how to do so, know enough to know what to do with the idea. Perhaps a world changing idea that could be beneficial for everybody might be to actually teach people How to Think, what Thinking is and is not, continuing to an understanding of Thought? ",
