            "answer_text": "Let me start by addressing my philosophy behind taking Philosophy as an optional, Philosophy is all about reasoning, arguments, logic and questions, questions such as What is the world like?, what gives it meaning?, what makes it beautiful? Where does the evil come from?, Who am I?, Why do I feel what I feel?, Why do I think what I think? I must be sounding a psychopath to you, but reasoning, logic & questions are the key factors behind the genesis of Knowledge, According to Aristotle human beings are rational animal. Etymologically Philosophy is derived from Greek words Philos and Sophia, Philos means love and Sophia means wisdom thus Philosophy means a love of wisdom. Plato, in his famous book \u201cRepublic\u201d says- \u201c\u201cHe who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and never satisfied may be justly termed as a philosopher.\u201d This quote defines me very well, I have taste for Economics, Science, Technology, Arts, Music and what not\u2026 For example: Earlier earth was considered flat and the Sun and whole universe was revolving around the Earth, everybody assumed it to be true then comes these scientific philosophers Galileo Galilei, Copernicus told us that the earth is a Geoid and Heliocentric. Earlier everything was philosophy whether understanding human body or climate etc. everything that clearly answered the three basic questions that is Where it has come from?, what it has come from ? & Can it be explained in mathematical terms?, wherever for any particular process or any particular object that answered these questions, those things moved beyond the realm of philosophy and went into the realm of science. Everything that is not completely answered remained in Philosophy, for e.g. Human Behaviour, Nature of reality, valid source of knowledge etc. Now coming to your question, Is it a good optional for UPSC? I have an inductive argument of this question, what is an inductive argument, you\u2019ll learn, if you persist to this subject. It has a concise syllabus, which makes it easy to complete, revise.I am a working professional and don\u2019t have much time to study.Writing answers would be easy once I understand the concepts.Philosophy has helped many aspirants to fetch good marks in the subject.It has an overlap with the GS IV syllabus.considering the above premises I came to logical conclusion that Philosophy is the good subject as optional for me. You\u2019ll develop a strong reasoning and argumentative powers if you do this subject properly, which may help you in the field to get your argument accepted by the people\u2019s once you become an officer. You may get your answer by going through these premises. If you are still reading this, I assume that you have chosen Philosophy, now let me come to your second question that is, What are the strategies to prepare this optional? First you\u2019ll have to complete the syllabus concepts and writing the previous years questions of the pertaining concepts simultaneously or after you complete the syllabus, whatever suits you. You have to keep your sources limited and get your answers evaluated by someone or some teacher. Let me give answers to all your dilemmas in your mind by sharing a invaluable source that I follow It\u2019s Raamasya IAS Academy based in Pune by T. Rammohan sir. It has covered the entire syllabus of philosophy, ethics and various other subjects. you might take a look at its YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChRHCzUbK2AZlgpjdFZSkaw     Here are some videos you might get a look at, you can mail your queries and get evaluation of your answers by e-mail. I hope, I have answered your question. Welcome to the world of Philosophy! Thank You! ",
