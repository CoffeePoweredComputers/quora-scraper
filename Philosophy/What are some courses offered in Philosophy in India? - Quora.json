            "answer_text": "It depends onwhat you wish to study, how long you wish to study and for what? If you want to study Indian schools there are one year diploma courses about jainism, indian aesthetics, vaishavism etc. in mumbai university. There are various vedanta study programmes available short term and long term in various study centres. You can also learn teachings of aurobindo in his pudducherry ashram and through ignou. Buddhist study can be done in one of the oldest varsities of India i.e Nalanda university. In tamil nadu you can find institutes providing courses on shaiv siddhant and vaishanv vallabh. If you are interested in western philosophy as per my knowledge there are no short term courses in india but you can study logic, ethics etc. Branches of philosophy through coursera, edex etc. If you wish to study philosophy professionally you will have to invest time in obtaining masters and phd degree. You can seek admission in it through DU, BHU, JNU, MU etc. You will have to prepare for entrance exams. If you cant invest full time you can opt online distance education from ignou or other such programmes they don\u2019t ask for entrance but an undergrad degree. You can also do Phd from IIT. Please check the criteria on its site. If philosophy is your interest but not your life long commitment i suggest you rather become a didact as in self taught. It will save money and time. You can start by reading introductory level books on philosophy and Darshan( indian philosophy). Being no expert i can only give you an outsider understanding. The career in philosophy looks very bleak and depends upon your interest you can learn philosophy then teach it to other generation(you will have to obtain Phd/clear Net). You can write thesis if you are interested in research aspect. You can become a writer to find your luck towards success. You can become business consultant( though it seems far fetched in India). You can join a publishing house. Mostly people join civil services or other govt profiles after graduating. Overall it totally depends upon you how you utilise your degree. There are various institutions that offer philosophy courses, to find the best institution you should evaluate there syllabus, course work and some recent thesis published. If they are of your interest then its the best institute for you, as philosophy is a very wide course and you will have to classify your intent and interest therefore looking at program outline is very important. I hope this helped. Good luck. ",
