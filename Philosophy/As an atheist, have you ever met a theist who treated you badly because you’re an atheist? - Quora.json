            "answer_text": "Q: As an atheist, have you ever met a theist who treated you badly because you\u2019re an atheist? Absolutely. The most grievous example, in my mid-20\u2019s I took a technical coding contract at a company, working on a new hardware product. It was a six month contract with a private company, one owner. It was interesting, the pay was great, I was highly qualified. For a month I did well, I was weeks ahead of schedule already, my supervisor was enthusiastic about how well we were doing. I was working in-house and getting along with my other coworkers. At lunch, the subject of religion came up, and I casually mentioned the fact that I was an atheist. A week later, my supervisor, seeming dejected, called me into a meeting with the company owner, and an attorney. The owner said there was a rumor going around that I was an atheist. I said I was, but how was that a problem? He told me he thought it was bad for morale, thanked me for my service, but they were exercising their rights within the terms of my contract to terminate my services effective immediately. My supervisor escorted me to my desk, to collect anything I had there. I said \u201cWell, I hope I gave you guys a good start, at least.\u201d He apologized, and told me he wasn\u2019t allowed to use any of the work I did. He had to scrap it and start over. Turns out, the owner was a rabid literalist Christian. No severance, no notice, pick up your things, don\u2019t touch the computer, let\u2019s go. Nothing illegal about this, I was an hourly contractor, like most contractors in the late 1970\u2019s I could be terminated at will for any reason whatsoever. But it was shocking, this guy abandoning thousands of dollars worth of work and setting his project back a month because he found out the code was being written by an atheist. And even though I\u2019m pretty frugal with my finances, it was a financial setback for me, too.  In less impactful cases, I have had girls at school (high school and college) refuse to be in a group with me, because I was an atheist. I wasn\u2019t a jerk, I grew up with sisters and had some inkling of what was offensive. I never touched any girls or made any sexual comments. In other words, I don\u2019t think my atheism was an excuse to avoid me, I think it was sincere. On the flip side, in my 30\u2019s I married a church-going Christian, that knew I was an atheist, and 31 years later we are still happily married, though life becomes more difficult with age and physical degeneration, for both of us.

            "answer_text": "Question: As an atheist, have you ever met a theist who treated you badly because you\u2019re an atheist? Answer: A few years back I lived in a small town in Southeast Texas. I was raising my children as a single Dad. I do not hide the fact that I am an atheist but neither do I go around waving an flag and carrying a megaphone proclaiming that I am. As a result the majority of people who know me are not aware of this fact. There was a small, independent Baptist Church in this town and it had a fire which caused some major damage. Being small they had limited insurance. When they started rebuilding I took a week vacations and me and my children volunteered in the rebuilding project. The Pastor was aware that I was an atheist but no one else in this congregation was. There were 2 older ladies (late 70\u2019s-early 80\u2019s in age) who thought my kids were awesome and that I was such a good Christian Dad. They were so nice and sweet and made sure the kids were safe when I was busy. Every lunch break the Pastor would lead the group in prayer. I did not partake in the prayer but I took off my hat and remained silent out of respect for their beliefs. Then one afternoon midweek the Pastor and I were talking and he was thanking me for taking my vacation time and noted that many of the male congregation were not helping in rebuilding their own church and said something along the lines of \u201cthey should be embarrassed that and atheist was doing more then they were\u201d and one of the ladies heard. Within minutes the news had spread and the gossiping became very loud. I noticed that the children my kids had been playing with had been pulled away by their parents. The two ladies were glaring at me and actually walked away from my son when he walked towards them to get a drink. The men I had been working next to for a couple days had also created some space between us and had stopped talking to me. It continued until the Pastor called a stop to the work and addressed the group. He apologized to me and my kids for the behavior of his congregation and severely chastised them for their actions. He pointed out that for the previous 3 days everyone thought I was awesome for taking a week\u2019s vacation time to help when I was not a member of the Church and suddenly I and my children were some kind of threat that need to be avoided. He pointed out that most of the men in the congregation were absent and I had been there from day one. Many of those present actually took his words to heart and came up to apologize to me and my kids. The 2 ladies however would go out of their way to avoid any contact with me or my kids. A minor mistreatment but one that had a big impact on my kids and how they view theists, especially Christians. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I won\u2019t discuss those times, but I will discuss the incident that made me start being open about my atheism. It was only after 9/11 that I decided to be open about my atheism. I kept quiet before because I knew how upsetting it is to so many people when they find out someone is an atheist. In Fall of 2001 I was still working toward my graduate degree in Mathematics and I was in a program that was putting graduate students in sciences and mathematics into middle school classes to help and to explain various concepts. The point was to try to increase the children\u2019s interest in going into sciences and mathematics. I was paired with another graduate math student. She seemed like a lovely lady. She had worked in the program already and both of us were sent to work with a teacher with whom she had worked before, so they were already friends. The teacher also seemed like a lovely lady. It wasn\u2019t long before I realized they were both very religious, Christian, and both read and discussed religious books. Of course, since the attack on the Twin Towers happened early in the term, it was also a topic of conversation. About a month after the terrorist attack I was helping one of the students when the two other ladies stood together on the other side of the classroom to talk, well within earshot of the 7th graders. When I was done I walked over to join them. They were discussing 9/11 and what could be done to stop such things from happening again. One said \u201call atheists should be killed\u201d and the other agreed. They both truly meant it and they saw THAT as a solution to avoid attacks by religious extremists! I learned then that they thought that all bad things in the world are due to atheists. Obviously I was shocked and I didn\u2019t tell them that I am an atheist, but it started me thinking and paying attention more to what religious people said about atheism. I started to see how much hatred and fear of atheists some religious people feel and I heard many religious people say things that would be outright dangerous to atheists. It scared me because I saw that if these people ended up in control, atheists would be in mortal danger. Remember, these two seeming nice ladies were saying such things in front of children. I realized that the children could easily pick up on these comments and think badly of atheists, too. That was when I decided to start being open about my atheism and stop worrying about how my atheism would upset other people. If I can deal with their religiosity, then they should be able to deal with my atheism. I really do think that people who have bad ideas about atheists have to see that people they know who are perfectly normal can be atheists. I also feel that I have to counteract the negative narrative about atheism being taught to the young. The way I can do that is by letting people know I am an atheist. This is a shock to lots of religious people because I\u2019ve always been considered a \u201cgood girl\u201d with high morals so some who think that atheists are immoral and hedonistic cannot get their heads around that. Maybe they\u2019ll start opening their eyes. ",

            "answer_text": "A theist who treated me badly? No. I\u2019ve been treated badly by many theists. I don\u2019t care to recall the myriad incidents just now, as they are numerous and range from namecalling to assault and battery, but mistreatement for being an atheist isn\u2019t something I find surprising. It made me quite bitter about religion for a long time. I was activly anti-theist for a while. I\u2019ve calmed down a bit, and I can now recognize that religion can do a lot of good for a lot of people. But if you take the spiritual aspect out (going to heaven or what have you), there is no benefit religion provides that you can\u2019t also get without religion, but there are a number of ills that are hard to get without it. I still dislike religion, but I did learn to take a more nuanced view of it, as well as theists, after meeting enough of them who were good people and didn\u2019t act like their more hateful bretheren. Now I view it as kind of a two edged sword. Religion has done a lot of evil in the world, and I\u2019ve been on the recieving end of some of it. But it has also inspired some people to do an awful lot of good.  Original question-As an atheist, have you ever met a theist who treated you badly because you\u2019re an atheist? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. When I was an undergrad, I shared a house with three other guys. We were all nerds on the same course, and it was really fun living with them. One of the guys, let\u2019s call him Toby, was a Christian. His faith never really came up. He was exceptionally hard working and always let me borrow his notes. We would often watch Star Trek or Blackadder together. Great guy. Or so I thought. One day, we were having a beer together and the discussion turned to religion and hell. I casually said something like, \u201cbut you don\u2019t really believe I\u2019m going to hell though\u201d and to my utter astonishment, Toby said \u201cum, actually I do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d It turned out that he did in fact hold the belief that he was going to heaven and I, as a non-believer, would be going to hell. Flabbergasted, I asked why on earth he wasn\u2019t trying to convert me, and his response was \u201cnone of my business, we all have free will.\u201d I cannot think of a more evil or immoral mentality. My housemate was literally saying that he believed that I, and many of our mutual friends, would literally be tortured for infinity. If I believed for one second that another person was headed for infinite torture, I would do everything in my power to stop it from happening. I\u2019ll say it again in case you don\u2019t quite grasp what we are talking about. He believed that I would suffer infinite torture because of my wrongthink. And he simply didn\u2019t care. He didn\u2019t try to get me to go to church with him. He didn\u2019t try to have discussions about God, hoping to save me from that fate. He was quite content to go about his business, happy in the belief that he would be going to heaven someday. And trying to save me from eternal torture just wasn\u2019t worth the awkward conversations. However, I give my old housemate the benefit of the doubt and conclude that he doesn\u2019t really believe what he claims to believe. I think he is trying to satisfy his cognitive dissonance by believing in a kind of \u201cvirtual machine\u201d in his brain. I don\u2019t believe anyone with even the tiniest level of empathy could stand the thought of another person being tortured for infinity. Not really. For me, that solidified my atheism and planted a seed of anti-theism. While I acknowledge and respect that religion can bring comfort and cohesion through its lies, it is extremely good at making people override their innate empathy and hold quite atrocious beliefs while feeling smug and righteous at the same time. Needless to say, our friendship wasn\u2019t quite the same after that. \u2014 Edit: I feel like I\u2019m living in the Twilight zZone. I am saying \u201cINFINITE TORTURE\u201d and everyone around me is raising their eyebrows calmly and saying, \u201cwell, whatcha gonna do?\u201d ETERNAL FUCKING TORTURE!!!!!!!!!! It is clear to me that my friend, like many other Christians, either do not believe in hell, even though they claim to, or have ZERO empathy for other people. One or the other. I don\u2019t believe thay have ever, for one second, actually thought of what eternal torture is? Not torture for 5 minutes (which would be immoral), not torture for a year, which would be horrific, not torture for a billion years, which would be unfathomable. ETERNAL TORTURE! Never ending, ever. How the fuck can they sleep at night thinking that ANY human (or even an animal) will suffer that? Why the fuck aren't they out there every waking moment screaming with anguish, pleading, begging, bribing, doing ANYTHING to save people from that. THAT is what I am angry about. Moderate Christians (who believe in hell) are either deceitful in not believing what they claim to believe, or are complete and utter psychopaths. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I lost my job for it. The trouble was, even though I was told straight to my face by my employer that this was the reason I was being fired he changed his mind and denied this was the reason. I spent $500 on a lawyer and found out that my country\u2019s unfair dismissal laws cover discrimination for religious beliefs but not \u201clack of beliefs\". So had he have said \u201cI'm sacking you for being a Muslim\u201d I would have gotten an unfair dismissal case and sued the crap out of them. To make matters worse, even though I was a good worker and getting 40\u201350 hours work a week I was called \u201ccasual\u201d and the boss simply said \u201cthere is not enough hours for you and that's why we let you go\u201d and then hired 2 new people to take my job. How did they find out I was an Atheist? I had a collgue ask me in the lunch room if I was busy on Sunday? I replied \u201cno\u201d he then asked if I would like to come to his church on Sunday, he said I am more than welcome to bring my family? I politely said \u201cthank you for the offer, but my family and I are Atheist\u201d (exact words). Holy shit! Time just stopped and about 30 sets of eyes within earshot, stared at me. The colleges face looked like I was telling him I had just murdered his entire family, total shock. The next week at work was really uncomfortable, it seemed to spread like a virus that I was Athiest, no one spoke to me at lunch, before or after work with the exception of work related conversation in the office during work hours. There was just over 1000 people in the buildings of the compound I was in and everyone from payroll to the mechanics knew I was Athiest. Right up until Friday afternoon when I was called into the bosses office at 4:00 pm and told that \u201cyour religious views are causing a great deal of issues amongst the staff\u201d. Then told to pack up my desk. I was humiliated beyond belief as the security stood there and watched me pack up a box to make sure I didn't steal anything that was not my property. On the way out whilst being escorted to my car I overheard two now ex-cowokers say \u201cI feel so bad for his daughter, raising her like that is terrable\u201d I turned to face them but the security blocked my path and told me to leave immediately because he was going to call the police in 5 minutes. My story is not unique either, I have met others who have been fired or working in an environment that is toxic as a result of people finding out they are Atheist. They are not always found out in the same manner as me, they are often found via social media that has nothing to do with the company. Across the world Atheists are discriminated against in this 2014 study of the 196 recognised countries on Earth 193 of them discriminate against Athiests in some way or another. Everything from discrimination laws that protect religious people but not Atheists to the death penalty in 13 countries, for being Atheist. The law in Australia is still not changed reguarding \u201clack of belief\u201d and unfair dismissal but we have excepted things such as \u201cgender identity\u201d as a value reason now. People's opinions are unbelievably low of Athiests also. In a 2011 Gallup poll, people hate Athiests more than most groups on the list. The list includes gay men, Muslims, Feminists, Jews, transgender people, African Americans, Mexicans, rapists and pedophiles. All scored significantly higher than the Athiests with the exception of the rapists who were only .5% hated more than Atheists, and the pedophiles which scored bottom of nearly every list. That is pretty depressing to see that we are nearly as hated as rapists. Who would you rather as your next door neighbour, a rapist or Athiest, I would love to chat to some of the participants that like rapists more than Atheists.

While I wasn\u2019t terribly outspoken, some theists I confided in about my doubts treated me poorly. My experience has been with Christianity, and I can say we\u2019re really, really, really\u2026  \u2026really bad about treating people like projects. Most don\u2019t even realize that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing, and a lot of churches don\u2019t realize that\u2019s what they\u2019re teaching their congregants. As a (now former) Southern Baptist, I was taught the total sum of my relationship with non-Christians was to share my faith with them. That was the whole reason to get to know them, and every interaction I had with them was to serve that purpose. Like I said, a lot of Christians don\u2019t realize that\u2019s what the endgame is, or that they\u2019re being indoctrinated that way. It wasn\u2019t until I saw things \u201cfrom the other side\u201d that I was able to empathize with non-Christians who complain about theist\u2014specifically Christian\u2014behavior. I get it, and I\u2019m sorry. They piss me off, too. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't notice it much, but that may be because I spent my life before I called an atheist calling myself a Jew. Which I still do, btw, I just add another adjective to it. But I think that's also because - having already been a religious minority and having never really been in a situation where I felt forced into religion, being an atheist has never really felt like a big deal to me. I have gotten into it with people over things like ghosts and acupuncture - those have quickly turned casual conversation (and once a date\u2026 \u201cmy father's a chiropractor.\u201d \u201cNot everyone! There are chiropractors who work on bones and stuff, they're doing something. It's just the woo stuff, you know, the energy medicine and when they include stuff like acupuncture.\u201d \u201cMy father uses acupuncture in his practice.\u201d \u201cUm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d), but with atheism I've never really cared that much. And again, that might just be the communities I have associated with or my status before that. I remember being chearfully told I was going to hell as a middle schooler by a friend, that stuck. I remember having weird conversations with christians on a school band trip. I remember being treated like an oddity in my college in Texas (\u201cyou're the first Jewish friend I've ever met!\u201d) or being convinced to go out with the campus crusade for Christ people after asking multiple times if this was a campus crusade for Christ thing and being told \u201cno.\u201d So by the time I was convinced that calling myself an agnostic was because of a poor definition of atheist and then referring to myself as an atheist afterward, I was pretty hardened against feeling pushed by other people's religion. Hell, you try growing up Jewish at Christmas. You figure out pretty quick that you are not in the mainstream of the country. I feel a lot of the time like people who go from mildly christian to atheist tend to be uncomfortable with suddenly being in a religious minority. I guess that feels weird for them because they didn't spend 6\u201318 living in a town with three churches and zero synagogues. I get that those coming out of families where religion was more inflicted on the kids may provoke a stronger reaction. That's true with Jews too, btw. I think that a person who escaped a Hasidic community is going to have a much more visceral reaction to losing faith than me - a kid who identified as a Jew, went to temple for high holidays, went to shabbat morning services every here and there, and then just had religion slowly atrophy throughout high school and college. For me, being Jewish still feels important, even if the idea of God does not. And luckily for me, atheist Jews have a long tradition in the culture. The orthodox may not be big fans of us, but conservative and reform? They're all good with us. So again, being an atheist for me has been fine. But I don't know how much that is because growing up Jewish had already prepped me for it. ",

Most people are theists, so it\u2019s them that decide what words mean. Dictionaries are descriptive, not prescriptive. Skeptics are in the minority, and just because a lot of skeptics re-defined \u201catheism\u201d on wikipedia doesn\u2019t mean it also got magically changed in the minds of believers and in the 1950\u2019s dictionaries they inherited from their grandparents. Most people are theists, and most theists define \u201catheism\u201d as \u201cclaims God is not real\u201d not \u201cdoes not believe in God or gods\u201d as many skeptics might foolisly want.

It makes me frustrated because it shouldn't be this way You shouldn't call someone out or change the way you see them because they're something completely different to you This level of prejudice is intolerable from my side I don't think there's an afterlife What's wrong with that? Is it wrong that I see life as infinitely far more worthwhile than any fictional promise of an afterlife that is clearly the product of human arrogance What's wrong with living the life you have now with contentment because this is all we have until proven otherwise Savoring every moment with family because I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to do it again I don't think Hell exists at all and yet I continously receive backlash from those who \u201cknow\u201d better and try to use methods to get me believe and if I don't conform to thier thinking They quote a bible verse about how I'm so foolish Anyway That's a nutshell of my experiences thus far ",

She looked at me directly and said \u201coh no, not everyone will end up going there\". Now her words were general, but her tone was actually personal, the implication being that I would not be getting to heaven and would in fact be going somewhere very different. The poisonous old cow! So I stared her down and just said, \u201cI don't believe in God anyway\". To which she replied, \u201cI pity you\" to which I retorted, \u201cI don't want your pity.\u201d That is the last we have spoken. Turns out her own sister in law also does not speak to her. ",

This would have been about 1985. Anyway, the conversation turned into how The Force was kin to being a religion and the conversation was pretty much centered around that. I don\u2019t even think we ever mentioned Christianity or other religions. Just how The Force might be considered a religion based on the the characters actions in the movies. There was this one burly guy and he finally came over and told us to shut the hell up or he would kick both of our asses. I can only conclude he was offended in some way or believed we were attacking his own religion by talking about another religion. ",
