            "answer_text": "T. Collins Logan is correct when he points out there aren\u2019t many articulate advocates and the organizations pushing this alternative are small. It\u2019s not likely to happen without a mass working class force \u2014 something on the order of the libertarian-influenced syndicalist unions of the 1900s to 1930s. That\u2019s the main problem libertarian socialism faces. But I will take this opportunity to reply to the criticisms of Charlie Fast, which are at least coherently argued: \u201cThe only investors in that society would be the Democratically elected leaders of the labor councils or coops who would likely possess less expertise than capitalists and be less numerous. \u201c Nope. It\u2019s the society which does the investing. Libertarian socialism is based on participatory democracy, rooted in assemblies in workplaces and neighborhoods, and delegates elected to coordinating councils and congresses. The proposals for plans for production are developed in two ways. First, in regard to the social or communal side, the neighborhoods and regional ccongresses develop plans that request levels of public services. So the priorities of how much of the public sector budget is to go to more housing versus more health clinics and so on. It\u2019s not a question of unilateral decision making power of \u201celected officials. Second, there is planning for production by the industry conventions and workers in facilities. These actually would have far more expertise than some moneybags who just invests to make a profit.More: \u201cThus, wealth might even be destroyed under Libertarian socialism because wealth maintenance requires continual investment in a productive endeavor which is something that the people might choose to vote against out of pure folly.\u201d Assertion without argument. You\u2019re assuming the irrationality of the masses. People can make mistakes \u2014 just as capitalist firms make mistakes.\u201cUnder Libertarian socialism, where society is totally Democratic, vested interests such as, for example, truckers, would be able to strongly oppose automation.\u201d Why would they do that? Under libertarian socialism the benefits of technical innovation that increases labor productivity is distributed to the whole workforce. So if automation reduces number of worker hours to produce Widgets, that just means everyone gets to work fewer hours because the available work is distributed among the workforce. We get more free time if we can figure out how to make things we want with less labor time. In reply he says: \u201cSome socialists might counter my point by explaining that more advanced capital leading to higher productivity would be able to give workers a shorter working time. Their claim is true, however, that is not my point at all: my point is that entire industries are replaced under capitalism due to innovation, thus making shorter labor hours for these workers irrelevant since they are completely out of a job.\u201d They may be out of a job there but not out of a job in general since a reduction in workweek across the board opens jobs up elsewhere.\u201cThe tyranny of the majority. \u201c The only alternative to majority rule is the tyranny of the minority which is what capitalism is, where the workforce are subject to the tyranny of the capitalist managerialist bureaucracies. And this is a violation of the conditions of natural justice, since all humans have the potential to be self-managing in the work and their lives \u2014 and this is denied by capitalism. \u201cLibertarian socialists take it on faith that people will naturally develop a more \u201ccooperative\u201d and \u201cegalitarian\u201d mindset towards their fellow neighbor once Libertarian socialism is implemented. \u201c Nope. For libertarian socialists with a syndicalist orientation our view is that the working class only creates in itself the capacity to overthrow capitalism through the building of a grassroots, democratic movement with a high level of solidarity, aspiration for change, and organizational strength and class self-confidence. Solidarity is understood as \u201cAn Injury to One is an Injury to All.\u201d Failure to support the grievances and struggles of particular groups, such as blacks or gays or women, against discrimination would be a denial of solidarity and weaken the whole movement. Thus a movement that aims at liberation for the working class majority also must aim at liberation for all the subgroups of the class. Moreover if the aim is freedom \u2014 understood by libertarian socialists as \u201cself-management\u201d \u2014 then this also means autonomy over those issues that pertain only to you \u2014 your personal self-management. This means the scope of collective decision-making isn\u2019t every single decision since many are the purview of the individual, related to governing their own life and activity where this is not about controlling other adults.\u201cLibertarian socialism collapses due to the prevalence of inequality and how it addresses it. Libertarian socialism attempts to curtail inequality between workers and bosses. However, what it cannot do is eliminate inequality between different organizations. For example, employees in a collectivized Apple would earn far more than employees in a collectivized random farming operation. The workers in the collectivized Apple corporation would naturally perceive that their position was one of the best in society, therefore, they would attempt to monopolize their positions for themselves and their children, thus making it impossible for others who were not born into the Apple cooperative to move up the social ladder, so to speak. \u201c Nope. You\u2019re assuming a libertarian socialist economy is made up of cooperatives that are the collective private property of workers there. Only a minority of libertarian socialists hold that view. The majority advocate a distributed form of democratic social planning. Workers in a particular facility get their means of production allocated socially, not by buying them in factor markets for means of production.",

            "answer_text": "Assuming that Libertarian socialism was implemented voluntarily and without coercion, I can see four problems with it: A lack of investment, leading to a decreased rate of wealth creation or even wealth destruction, leading to a decreased standard of living for most people. Under Capitalism, many more people than under Libertarian socialism are able to accrue capital and invest in the economy, this investment allows for productivity to increase, thereby creating more wealth for more people. Under Libertarian socialism, individuals would never be able to accrue the same amount of capital they can under capitalism, thus there would be a decreased rate of investment. The only investors in that society would be the Democratically elected leaders of the labor councils or coops who would likely possess less expertise than capitalists and be less numerous. Further, Democratically elected officials have different incentives than capitalists. Capitalists are likely to invest in projects which will give them the maximum amount of profit through the maximum amount of wealth creation for the maximum amount of time. Democratically elected officials are, in theory, simply interested in executing the will of the people, and, if anything goes wrong, they simply blame the problems on their successors. Democratically elected officials do not have a long-term interest in what they are doing, whereas capitalists have a long term interest in how much wealth and therefore profit they can generate. Winston Churchill\u2019s argument against Democracy was a \u201cfive-minute conversation with the average voter.\u201d The average voters are simply incapable of voting for the leaders that will generate wealth the same way that capitalists do automatically. Thus, wealth might even be destroyed under Libertarian socialism because wealth maintenance requires continual investment in a productive endeavor which is something that the people might choose to vote against out of pure folly. The crusade against Nuclear power is one such example of the people\u2019s folly.A stagnation of technological progress and innovation. Under Libertarian socialism, where society is totally Democratic, vested interests such as, for example, truckers, would be able to strongly oppose automation. If Libertarian socialism would have been implemented in the 19th century, likewise, the horse and buggy industry would have eliminated the car industry before it could flourish. Artisans and petty merchants would also have eliminated industrialization completely in the 18th century. Some socialists might counter my point by explaining that more advanced capital leading to higher productivity would be able to give workers a shorter working time. Their claim is true, however, that is not my point at all: my point is that entire industries are replaced under capitalism due to innovation, thus making shorter labor hours for these workers irrelevant since they are completely out of a job. This replacement of entire industries is ultimately good and has proven to be a force for good, but the Libertarian socialist system would make this process of \u201ccreative destruction\u201d impossible. Can anyone reading this comment seriously imagine a world where cars did not replace the horse and buggy system, where phones did not replace the telegraph, where online shopping did not exist due to elimination from retail stores? As for the workers who are out of the job, their solution is to simply get a new job. Once, however, capital thoroughly replaces labor, I will admit that capitalism will have to end and none of the problems on this list will really apply. However, it won\u2019t be a Libertarian socialist utopia. Rather, when capital replaces labor (ie, AI, robots, etc) productivity will increase dramatically and scarcity will be rendered a conundrum of the past. Thus, making the whole field of economics essentially irrelevant since economics arises out of scarcity.The tyranny of the majority. It seems that no Libertarian socialist realizes that Democracy is simply a system in which 35 white men can democratically decide to lynch one black guy. Democracy has nothing to do with freedom, and, indeed, monarchy might be a better alternative. Under European monarchies, the governments stole less taxes, incarcerated less people, and ultimately killed less people than what the so-called Liberal Democracies like the United States have done thus far. European monarchies would never have dreamed of imposing an income tax or initiating the so-called war on drugs. No, only Democracy has come up with such perverse programs. Given the context of today\u2019s excessive taxes, can anyone imagine that the founding fathers performed the Boston tea party due to a 3%-10% tax on tea? In a Libertarian socialist society, your co-workers could get around a table and decide democratically to kill you. While Libertarian socialism is not necessarily a guarantee of extreme tyranny being imposed on the minority by the majority, Libertarian socialists can never exactly explain how or why this would not happen. Libertarian socialists take it on faith that people will naturally develop a more \u201ccooperative\u201d and \u201cegalitarian\u201d mindset towards their fellow neighbor once Libertarian socialism is implemented. That appeal to emotion is not good enough for me. As a minority (Hispanic-American), I do not want to be enslaved by my fellow workers or my fellow citizens.Libertarian socialism collapses due to the prevalence of inequality and how it addresses it. Libertarian socialism attempts to curtail inequality between workers and bosses. However, what it cannot do is eliminate inequality between different organizations. For example, employees in a collectivized Apple would earn far more than employees in a collectivized random farming operation. The workers in the collectivized Apple corporation would naturally perceive that their position was one of the best in society, therefore, they would attempt to monopolize their positions for themselves and their children, thus making it impossible for others who were not born into the Apple cooperative to move up the social ladder, so to speak. The workers in cooperatives do not have the same incentive as the capitalists which is to hire only the best workers to generate the maximum amount of profit, regardless of where these workers started out on the social ladder. Rather, the top interest of the cooperative workers is to keep their positions in the family. This is already evident when one looks at Mondragon and how its workers pass on their positions to their children. If the people at the top of the social ladder keep their positions in the family, the people who are born at the bottom will naturally stay at the bottom and their children will as well, thus instating a situation of true forced generational poverty. Under capitalism, people do have an astonishing chance of either moving up or down the social ladder: over 80% of millionaires and 60% of billionaires are self-made. Under Libertarian socialism, where everybody keeps their cooperative membership in the family, the children of the poor will be poor and their children will be poor as well.Now that I have brought up 4 points against Libertarian socialism, let us look at 12 points against capitalism and debunk them or explain why they really are not problems unique to capitalism at all: Most substantial innovations were created by the state: To a certain degree, this is true as most corporations or businesses will not take a gigantic risk of developing new technologies. The state has been what may be called the chief inventor. However, this is not necessarily a point that supports the state. My belief is that society should move to a more Voluntaryist model wherein different communities can decide their own laws and way of life, and individuals simply move to the communities in which they would like to live in. If a certain people in a certain community wanted to voluntarily pay taxes to develop certain technologies, they would be more than welcome to do so. We do not, however, need a state to develop new technologies. On another note, while the state may be the chief inventor, businesses are the chief innovators. For example, while the internet was developed by the government, the current form that the internet has taken was pioneered by private interests.The IMF and the world bank shove free markets and neo-liberalism down the throats of developing nations, thus causing poverty: The IMF and world bank are certainly predatory institutions but they do not support free markets. Rather, they support an economic scheme wherein they will propose to lend to developing nations, the loan goes to the local oligarchs of the IMF or world bank\u2019s choice, who then use that money to simply enrich themselves, then, once it is found that the nation cannot repay, the IMF or world bank demands that their public utilities be sold off to the same aforementioned chosen oligarchs to repay the loan. This is obviously neither a free market or capitalism because it is an instance of a state, or, what I would call, a \u201cpara-state\u201d institution going against free market principles and deliberately forming or helping an already existing monopoly/duopoly.Protectionist policies help development: It depends on how one defines \u201cprotectionism\u201d and \u201cfree trade.\u201d True free trade does not require an agreement, it is simply spontaneous. \u201cFree trade\u201d agreements as they currently exist are full of regulations and patent restrictions that only help the top corporations and destroy or hurt smaller corporations. Ask yourself this: if protectionism was good, why don\u2019t US states implement tariffs against each other? Better yet, why don\u2019t individual municipalities implement tariffs against each other? In fact, it seems that trade without an agreement being necessary between states has facilitated the development of the United States and many other nations.A 3rd of the food produced each year ends up in landfills and is never consumed, \u201cthose greedy capitalists.\u201d This is true, however, much of this food is simply food that has gone stale. Aside from that, however, I am more than willing to admit that this debacle is due to greed; that is, if the food was donated to the poor, the prices of the food would overall go down, reducing profitability. That being said, however, what is the alternative or solution to stop this behavior? Cooperatives would do the same as the capitalist enterprises do since they also do not want their profits to be undercut. The state has always produced shortages when it is tasked with producing food. The fundamental problem here is human greed \u2014 an insurmountable situation. The solution to this is to look at new ways to produce more food and for developing countries to truly free up their markets and their economy, as it has always resulted in an increased standard of living and an increased rate of consumption for their citizens. Take Rwanda, for example, it was at one point one of the worst cases of genocide. Now, Rwanda, thanks to capitalism, is quickly becoming the most successful African country and food consumption is increasing rapidly. It is undeniable that capitalism produces amazing results.Capitalist enterprises produce goods that are designed to break. This is currently true but is not necessarily because of capitalism. Apple, for example, can monopolize certain features of the iPhone due to extensive intellectual property regulations. This decreases competition and allows Apple to get away with offering an inferior product. In a Voluntaryist society, chances are that these intellectual property rights would either not exist or would not be as strenuous as they are now. Therefore, companies will have to compete with one another and continuously offer a better product or service than they do now due to intellectual property restrictions.Ethical consumerism is impossible: In a voluntaryist society, retaliation against bad business practices would be far easier because there would be no state protecting the businesses. There will be private law companies which will be far more accountable to the people since people would simply switch to another private law company if disillusioned with their particular law provider. This means that law companies will naturally be in a position wherein they have to prosecute bad business practices whilst the state can quite easily be taken over by capitalists (especially under Democracy) and does not, therefore, serve the interests of the people. Thus, the solution is to abolish the state.Capitalism and property are not a part of human nature: Even many non-human primates have a conception of private property. Property is absolutely intrinsic in the human species. Hell, the only way that Libertarian socialists can even begin to provide a reason for collectivizing the property of others it that it is really the property of the workers as they are the ones that work on it. The most fundamental argument for Libertarian socialism (although it\u2019s wrong) is based on property. Therefore, even Libertarian socialists fundamentally believe in property. In fact, they base all of their arguments on it. Here is a link in regards to property ownership in non-human primate species: https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&context=psych_facpubThe workers own the workplaces in which they work since they are the ones who physically work there. Exchanges between workers and employers in capitalism are inter-temporal exchanges. That is, the capitalist has a low time preference which means he is willing to wait months or even years before his product can be adequately tested and put on the market. The worker has a high time preference which means that he wants his wages within a short time period such as in one or two week intervals. Marx observed that the only way that society could accrue the wealth to \u201cmove on to socialism\u201d was through capitalism because the workers themselves would not shift to a low time preference and start businesses under socialistic principles (Democratic control of the businesses) because they were not willing to take the risk that came with doing such. Thus, because the workers could not have created the wealth we enjoy today in society, the capitalists were necessary. Obviously, this means that the Capitalists are the rightful owners of their capital and businesses because, without them, society would never have amassed such wealth. Thus, Libertarian socialists are simple thieves.The capital that the capitalists used was acquired unjustly. No, this is untrue. Capital is created by individuals who have a low time preference and are willing to save before they can spend money. Imagine if you were deserted on an abandoned island, the first thing that you would do is scour the island to see if there were fresh water and shelter. Supposing that there were fresh water and a cave you could reside in, you would soon turn to asking yourself how you would acquire food. You would realize that you could either fashion a spear, a net, or a boat. The spear allows you to catch 3 fish per day and takes a few hours to fashion, the net allows you to catch 6 fish per day but takes 2 weeks to create, whilst the boat allows you to catch, say, 24 fish per day if you use it in conjunction with the net but it takes you 4 weeks to create. Obviously, since you are a rational individual, you choose to fashion the spear first. You catch 3 fish on your first day. However, since you have a low time preference and you do not want to be stuck living in subsistence poverty forever, you will save 1 fish and eat 2 fish per day. Since it would take you two weeks to fashion a net, you will consume 28 fish throughout this period. Therefore, you must continuously put aside 1 fish per day for a period of 4 weeks if you are ever to fashion a net. Supposing that you were able to save 28 fish, you would spend 4 weeks fashioning the net without worrying about acquiring fish. A net would allow you to catch 6 fish per day. Let\u2019s suppose, however, that you still wanted to fashion a boat because you wanted to live more splendidly. To achieve this in the quickest time possible, you set aside 4 fish per day and eat 2 fish per day. Since you will consume 56 fish in 4 weeks, you must save for 2 weeks in order to acquire 56 fish at the rate of saving 4 per day. Then, you will fashion the boat for 4 weeks eating two fish per day. Once you have fashioned the boat, you will be wealthy as you will be able to catch 24 fish per day, 8 times what you were originally capable of catching. In a population of human beings, time preference varies; some like to save now and consume later and some like to consume everything they ever get at once. Time preference varies due to biology and culture, different populations often have different time preferences. Once you understand time preference, much of society makes sense. Let us go back to the island: suppose that someone else washes up ashore, you have been catching fish at a rate of 24 per day, putting 12 fish away every day for a big project for, say, 2 weeks; this means that you have 168 fish. However, your boat has broken and you can\u2019t use it anymore. Your new neighbor on the island originally is unaware of you but you soon make him a proposition: that he can fashion his own boat with the capital he needs (you will provide 56 fish for him) as long as he gives you half of what he catches. This allows you to forgo hunting completely and still get to keep what you were hunting, ie the 12 fish per day. This exploited no one and was not unjust. If you had not provided the 56 fish for him and helped him out initially, he would have had to go through as much pain as you did initially. Then, once he has fashioned his boat and begins producing fish for you, you can forgo hunting for fish completely and specialize your labor for other matters. For example, you can fashion a large sign on the island alerting passing airplanes that you are stranded. Did you exploit him through providing interest from the capital that you created? Nope. Did you require a state to enforce that property? The answer is no because your neighbor on the island would not want to face the repercussions if he was hiding fish from you. Who is to protect him? Alas, the state is who usually protects thieves but in this situation, there is no state so it is simply a man-to-man transaction.Capitalism is not voluntary, a workers only option is to work for a capitalist or starve. Guess what, buddy? Your only option, as it has been throughout history, is to work or die. Nobody will provide after you forever. If you don\u2019t work, you die. That being said, though, some cooperatives do exist; you could join one of those or start your own, you could also join a commune. You could also start your own business or go off into the wilderness or onto a deserted island and live off of nature. However, if you won\u2019t work for either yourself or somebody else, you will die.Capitalists exploit workers and will pay them the least amount possible, capitalism is \u201cwage slavery.\u201d No, there is no one forcing you to work for a particular capitalist; no one is holding a gun up to your head and coercing you to work for Apple and not Microsoft. Transactions that are not coerced can automatically be said to be voluntary. Voluntary=lack of force. Voluntary transactions can be said to also be non-exploitative. However, let me approach this topic more thoroughly: The capitalist is the one who risks his present capital for a very dismal success rate (most businesses fail). Thus, capitalists actually perform a very positive and essential service for workers as they eliminate the risk on the part of the workers by taking all of the risks onto themselves and by paying them before he has paid himself. When the capitalist can finally put his product on the market, he must hope that it sells so that he can continue paying his workers and also finally pay himself. If the product sells badly, he goes out of business and his name is ruined; he lives in a trailer park for the rest of his life if he failed really badly. If the product sells well, the capitalist benefits from assuming all of the risk and stress it took to get there; he might become rich! Capitalism is about voluntary transactions; workers can quit anytime and do anything else to earn their livelihoods such as start their own business or start a coop. Thus, the wage system is not \u201cSlave labor\u201d as many socialists claim; rather, it is a voluntary and moral system which has produced the greatest amount of wealth in human history for most of society. I would also go back and read my refutation of number 8 and 9 because time preference does factor in this; that is, of course, that transactions in capitalism are intertemporal exchanges between people with high and low time preferences. While it is true that capitalists do attempt to pay their workers the least amount of money they possibly can, the only occasion in which wages will actually be low is when the government interferes by instating regulations that stifle competition. When there is competition in the labor market, the turnover rates for businesses start becoming much, much higher. Turnover rates are the percentage of employees that leave a company within a certain period of time. Turnover rates which are too high increase the labor costs and reduce profitability because the capitalist then has to spend more to train his workers only to have them leave to another workplace after they have garnered experience. Thus, the capitalist is faced with only one option: increase the wages to reduce the overall labor costs and to gain higher productivity. This is why Henry Ford started paying his workers $5 a day. With high competition, the capitalist increases wages to reduce his overall labor costs. If we want wages to increase, we quite simply have to repeal the regulations which stifle competition. Naturally, repealing these regulations would reduce income inequality as well since the market share that individual companies have in particular industries would be more spread out and workers would be paid more due to there being more competition for their labor.Since not all workers will become rich, capitalism is unjust; capitalists propagandize that if anyone follows their system, they will become rich which is untrue. Not all workers will become rich because many do not have the time preference required, the ambition, the intelligence, the luck, or access to capital. However, not all scientists will rise to the level of Albert Einstein, not all engineers will become one of the best in their field, not all book writers will produce a masterpiece, not all politicians will become president. Just because not everyone will rise to be one of the best in the world at a particular thing, should we make it impossible to achieve individual excellence in their particular field? No, that would hurt all of us since we obviously benefit from Einstein\u2019s contributions or Tesla\u2019s contributions. We benefit from the contributions of capitalists because they invest in productive endeavors, producing greater productivity and therefore wealth, they advance present capital for future capital, they take on all of the risks, and they help drive society forward. Indeed, not everyone will rise to the level of being one of the top 1000 wealthiest people in the world. However, that being said, over 80% of millionaires are self-made and over 60% of billionaires are self-made, showing that capitalism does entail great social and economic mobility. The greatest benefit of capitalism for workers is a rise in living standards. In the 18th century, Louis XIV, who was nicknamed the sun king because he believed that members of his court should revolve around him just as planets did around the sun, had 50 meals prepared every time he ate. Louis XIV would simply choose the meals he wanted and discard the rest. Nowadays, ordinary workers can go the supermarket or local food markets and buy thousands of ingredients to make tens of thousands or millions of dishes; they can also go to local restaurants to have options of thousands of individual dishes. Capitalism has enabled ordinary workers to live better than kings as pretty much everyone in developed capitalist countries have access to more food than Louis XIV did. Therefore, the appeal of capitalism is not that all workers will become millionaires; rather, it is that their standard of living will get remarkably better as time goes on, and I consider this to be virtually indisputable. Further, those individuals who do have a low time preference will find that they can save money and invest in their children\u2019s future, enabling their children to achieve excellence. Capitalism is not an individualist system at all, it is a system in which individuals seek to better their children\u2019s standard of living and their children\u2019s children seek to better their children\u2019s standard of living. This is why the standard of living in capitalist countries gets better and better as time goes on.",
