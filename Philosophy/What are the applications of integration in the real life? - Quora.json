            "answer_text": "So the question is to give examples where a quantity is directly measured in real life, and next actually integrated with e.g. time or distance. While there are many examples of quantities that could be calculated by integration, there are few examples where this is actually done. E.g. the speed of a car equals the time integral of it\u2019s velocity. This is a fact. But as far as I know, no car manufacturer does this. In fact, in most cars the number of revolutions of the wheels are measured and next multiplied by their averaged circumference. The speed of the car is derived from the number of wheel revolutions per time unit, and that is a differentiation process. A more precise method is to calculate the distance travelled from GPS location measurements, as in your car guidance system. Next the speed of the car is found by differentiation with time. Still no true integration involved. One example where true integration is applied is in analog electricity meters of the so-called \u201cFerraris type\u201d, names after Galileo Ferraris - Wikipedia. This meter has an aluminium disk rotating at a varying speed that is directly proportional to \u201ctrue\u201d electrical power. The angular displacement of the disk, which equals the time integral of rotation speed, then is directly proportional to the time integral of electrical power, and thus the energy used. Modern electronic electricity meters mimic this process by measuring power and integrating it with time numerically. ",

            "answer_text": "Some examples: Distance is integral of speed with time.So, your car\u2019s distance meter is an integrator of its speedometer. Energy is integral of power with time.So, your electricity meter(measuring kilowatt hours) is an integrator of your house\u2019s momentaneous use of electrical power (in kilowatts) over a month. Volume in a liquid container is integral of the surface of the liquid with height.Indispensable to calculate the amount of water in, say, a reservoir. Loosing or gaining weight is the difference in the integrals of daily input (what you eat) and daily output (what your body looses by the various dejection mechanisms).Capital gain is the integral of the interest rate with time. Only, they do not do it over infinitesimal time differentials dt, but over finite time differences \u0394t like days, months, years. So it is not a true \u2018integral\u2019 in the mathematical sense, but a sum of finite parts.",
