            "answer_text": "I am an over-analyser of everything, and this is really bad in exams. But to answer your question, here is what you should/could do and why: Analyse what you see/experience. Ask yourself: Why/how. Logic isn\u2019t logic unless there are \u2018rules\u2019; by this I mean laws of physics/biology/chemistry/behavioural science, and importantly, rules within context. You see a smashed ceramic mug. How was it broken? Was it melted by heat? Did it dissolve in water? No. Sudden impact caused the brittle substance to shatter. Without these rules, literally anything can happen and everything would make sense.Understand that in real life, there is no supernatural/\u2019act of god\u2019 events. Otherwise the last sentence in 1 above would occur. Let me use a famous tv show episode as an example: In \u201cI Dream of Jeannie\u201d (for those of you who do not know, \u201cI Dream of Jeannie\u201d is a comedy show about an American astronaut who accidentally finds a genie and becomes her master when she moves in with him), there is an episode in Season 1 where Jeannie the genie appears on a yacht deck where Tony the astronaut is and no one else is around. Some people on the yacht sees her arguing with Tony, from inside a room. These people walk along the window of the room and as they pass a wall segment (you cannot see through walls), their view is blocked for a moment. During this short moment, Jeannie suddenly disappears at will (as a genie, she can appear or disappear instantly at will), and with no one else on deck, Tony is charged with pushing her overboard. If this was real life, and you saw 2 people talking on a boat deck and suddenly there was only 1 person, would you think: That person was beamed up by aliens? Disappeared at will? Became invisible? No. You would most likely think that person went overboard, because you know physical things cannot instantly disappear and invisibility technology has not been invented yet. Whether that person jumped or was pushed is another matter that requires deductive reasoning ie more logic. If you abandoned logic and rules, literally anything could have happened to that person. That person might have been taken to heaven by god without dying (as mentioned in the bible), a deep sea creature might have suddenly jumped from the ocean to grab them (the Kraken), a butterfly could have eaten them, maybe they didn\u2019t go down and flew up instead \u2026 Logic bound by rules are needed when coast guards and police search for victims who fell overboard, no coast guard or police would search the air, they would search the ocean.Understand logic within context: this how fictional stories are made believable and sensical. While it has its flaws, Back to The Future is a great example. Time travel is not possible, yet the movie makes sense within it\u2019s own fictional context.Understand what is and is not plausible/feasible by considering the chances of something happening. Possible is not the same as plausible/feasible. For example, it is possible to win the lottery\u2026 but not feasible to buy an entry for all the possible combinations because your expense will be greater than the win.Also I recommend watching a few good episodes of The Big Bang Theory, if you have not already. The character Sheldon [used to] be very good with analysing everything with logic. ",

            "answer_text": " Thinking with your heart is not always good for you. At times logical thinking can prevent you from making or repeating mistakes that may cost dear in future. It is assumed that people who think with their left brains are logical whereas those thinking with their right brains are more emotional and intuitive. Some people are born with high deductive ability which they cannot give up even if they try. Logical thinking can be a curse or boon; depending on the situation you are in. Logical thinking can blow off the mist created by emotions to show you the reality and factualness of the situation or people. When you become a logical person, you will be able to differentiate between truth and lies, solve your problems effectively and take right decisions which will benefit you and others. Often, the truth is staring back at us, but we tend to ignore it as we are blinded by our emotions. These are 6 easy ways that can help you think more logically, so that you will be able to look at the world more clearly with right reasoning. 1. Small details are important: Sherlock Holmes said, \u2018The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.\u201d The clue to logical thinking lies in being observant and noticing details. If you watch a person closely, you will be amazed to know how easy it to tell a lie from truth. Do not try to change facts so that they fit into your belief system, but build your beliefs on the facts. The trick of observation can be developed through practice and perseverance.  2. Work with puzzles: Logical thinking is improved when you work on puzzles like Rubik\u2019s cube, which demands deduction of results from all possible angels. The solution for puzzles is often described by the mnemonic SMART, which means the deductions should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bounded. Puzzles and games which involve rational thinking exercise the brain to work on logical thinking. With time thinking logically becomes a habit.  3. Hold on to your own beliefs: Do not give in to arguments that show that all people believe in it, so it is true. There was a time when everybody believed that earth was flat and center of the universe, including all the major religions of the world. There is no need for you to accept something as true, just for the reason that you cannot prove it to be wrong. Hold on to your logical thinking and beliefs that come with it, no matter how much pressure others mount on you. Never underestimate the power of intuition and gut-feeling as illogical, as they can be quite reliable at times, especially when they are your own.  4. Build formidable defense against emotional blackmail: Not many people like it when you think about them rationally; hence, they are bound to distract you with emotional blackmail or any other defense mechanism they are familiar with. If you are not strong with your own defense against such strategies, you will yield to the pressure sooner or later. Beware of your own defense mechanisms which may have developed over the period. When people try to vague, ask them to be specific and explain exactly what they mean.  5. Ask yourself questions: When you are doing something irrational, stop and ask yourself the question why you are doing it? Look at the action and resulting consequences from all possible angles before moving ahead. Keep aside bias, patronizing and prejudices while making your decisions. Slow down, take deep breaths and be calm. You cannot be logical when you are stressed and running in hurry. Answer your questions honestly, racking your brain for right information.  6. Be prepared to handle the truth: Many people stop being logical just because they are afraid to face the truth. Preparing yourself to handle the truth is the first step towards becoming a more logical person. Beware that truth can be quite painful at times; but there is no reason in living in a false world. Do not ignore facts, data, clues or cause that holds light to truth because you are afraid what it may reveal. Prepare yourself to handle the bitter truth.  ",
