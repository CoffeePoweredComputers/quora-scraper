            "answer_text": "It depends on what you consider irrelevant. I am a college English teacher. For many years, I felt that Chemistry & Biology were irrelevant. Now, by a strange twist of fate, I teach Biology & Chemistry. But you could say that, at least, I studied these subjects in school, at some level. So, to some extent, they were relevant to my schooling, if nothing else. Let\u2019s take something else, something non-academic, like baseball. I have tried my hardest to understand the rules of baseball. I can\u2019t. A guy who hits a home-run is forced to stop playing for the rest of the innings. The same guy can\u2019t hit 2 home-runs in the same inning. At the same time, someone who strikes out three times in a row, also continue to play in the inning. So, whether you are really good or really bad, the result is the same. I don\u2019t get this. And you know what? I DON\u2019T CARE! It\u2019s irrelevant to my life. I teach baseball players all the time. I\u2019ve even taught some famous players when they were already stars in the major leagues. Still, I\u2019m teaching them English, not baseball. So, I\u2019ve learned a little about baseball. How does that benefit me? Really, it doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t see how it ever will. But, when I came to the US, years ago, I really wanted to understand baseball and American football because I thought this type of knowledge would help me understand US culture. I now know enough to know that I don\u2019t want to learn about these sports. So, the benefit is a kind of a negative benefit. I won\u2019t spend hours and days trying to understand certain sports just because I live in a country where these sports are popular. I know enough to know that the 3 strikes criminal law is baseed on 3 strikes in baseball. But I am neither a baseball player or fan and neither am I a criminal or a lawyer. So, again, really, this knowledge is of zero benefit to me. Relevance, in the end, is based on lifestyle. The POTUS may need to know who the head of state is, of every country in the world. He may never use that information. But it may be helpful, at some point. To me, this type of information will NEVER, ever matter! In the end, irrelevant knowledge mostly just helps to show off a little, sometimes. I won $100 by knowing that Texas is not the biggest state in the U.S. Other than that, it\u2019s never helped me to know which U.S. state is biggest. I also don\u2019t know if a crocodile has a bigger bladder than a lion. And I don\u2019t care that I don\u2019t know. You could say that all knowledge is good. And to that extent, you could say it is useful. But really irrelevant knowledge is useless, most of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "I could certainly agrees to that.We never know what we have in our mind or what we have in stock(not actually physical)(pun intended) might be helpful to others. The more you give to others, the more you get it back. What seems irrelevant to you,maybe relevant to someone else. You can at least pass the information to your friends,relatives, neighbours or perhaps strangers? You may not see it today but in the future,who knows? You might save someone's day,someone's career and particularly a passive investment for your own reward(As a Muslim,we believe our faith in the Hereafter). Well,pass it down and smile because it helps others more than you do. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing wrong with an occasional distraction. Besides what seems irrelevant today may be useful in some unexpected circumstance. Sometimes it\u2019s fun to talk trivia. Just don\u2019t make it an obsession. Trivia is a good way to exercise memory and can sometimes be fun at parties. However it can also be overdone and obnoxious so like all things in life, balance.
