            "answer_text": "It really isn\u2019t. Cultural relativism isn\u2019t a moral framework. Cultural relativism is a tool that was developed within anthropology for the purposes of better understanding cultures in as objective and unbiased way as possible. Cultural relativism doesn\u2019t tell people how to behave in their everyday lives, it tells anthropologists how to think and behave as social scientists in order to better eliminate cultural bias and assumptions from their observations and analysis. This is sometimes misunderstood and there is something of a minor \u2018moral panic\u2019 around the idea. Some people think that cultural relativism makes morality meaningless either because: it prevents groups or individuals from passing moral judgement on each other (eg. forcing them to tolerate harmful behaviour when it occurs in a different culture)or it is the belief that morality is whatever people think it is, according to personal preference or conscience, leading effectively to moral nihilismThere actually is a philosophy which does correspond to a. which is called \u2018normative ethical relativism\u2019. This is a problematic and possibly self-defeating idea. And one that corresponds to b. called \u2018moral subjectivism\u2019 which is equally nonsensical. However, these aren\u2019t really very widespread ideas and pose no real threat to society. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a threat to certain conceptions of morality, which hold that moral principles have fixed, universal expressions, that we all known them whether we acknowledge them or not. And it really isn\u2019t even much of a threat to those, because I\u2019ve never met someone who deeply held to moral absolutism who was swayed in the slightest by deeper understandings of context. What cultural relativism is threat to is the cultural dominance of a certain type of moral thinking. ",

What\u2019s wrong now will aways and was always wrong, though certain values have evolved such as the outlawing of slavery and child labor. The Nazis used that kind of reasoning to justify themselves and were convicted at Nuremberg by natural law which is absolute. This kind of reasoning would\u2019ve absolved them. Examples of eternal evils are murder, rape, incest, bestiality, necrophilia, pedophilia, adultery, theft, kidnapping, cannibalism, etc.). ",
