            "answer_text": "Below is a message I sent to a fellow I'll call \"Mr. Green,\" in response to an essay on his web page (which  I can no longer find online). Not that I loved his site and will miss it, but I almost wish it was still there\u2014just so you could see his side of the issue fully. Basically, Mr. Green's article calls the \"Christian\" God \"evil\" and says he cannot exist, because if he's is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omni-benevolent, yet allows the horrors that exist in the world, it defies all logic.  So, he issued a challenge he boasted no Christian would accept to show how such a God could logically exist. Naturally, his web page did not allow comments (i.e., rebuttals), but he did provide his email address.  So I wrote him the following . . . Dear Mr. Green: Based solely on what you call \u201cthe Basic Christian theology\u201d \u2014 with its definitions of an \u201cOmni-God\u201d who \u2014 though all-powerful, all-knowing, ever-present and always good \u2014 carelessly allows the horrific pain, suffering and murders of the innocent \u2014 I would have to agree: such a god cannot exist. Fortunately, the god you\u2014and, unfortunately, popular Christianity\u2014describe is not the God of the Bible. Therefore, I defer to the biblical definition of God, which is not only logically sound, but infinitely better than the fable you so rightly reject. It\u2019s not my purpose to \u201csell\u201d you on a religious belief or to \u201cprove\u201d anything to you. I only offer \u2014 strictly as a supposition \u2014 a plausible explanation for a God who indeed has allowed evil to exist, but not carelessly and not without good reason or remedy. Popular Christianity blatantly ignores and in many cases directly contradicts explicit teachings of the Bible that reveal a God whose wisdom, power and love for humanity are far greater than any \u201cgod\u201d born of human imagination and wishful thinking. On the other hand, many atheists, skeptics and God-haters know full well of the discrepancy between what the Bible says and what many Christians teach, yet fail to recognize that this merely disqualifies those Christians as the true followers of Christ and legitimate representatives of the way of life he taught. I contend this oversight is in many cases deliberate. Christianity, as it is widely known and taught, contains so many contradictions and irrationalities that it\u2019s easy to refute in open debate. It is, therefore, the \u201cstraw man\u201d by which detractors may avoid contending with the Bible directly. According to itself, the Bible \u2014 or, the Scriptures \u2014 \u201ccannot be broken.\u201d According to itself, only those who obey its precepts can understand its meaning, God\u2019s purpose and his plan \u2014 and only they have the ability and authority to teach them to others. In fact, the Bible itself provides the key to identifying those truly qualified to \u201crightly divide\u201d its content and meaning \u2014 one that immediately disqualifies perhaps every Christian you\u2019ve ever met, heard about, or heard from in our day. It\u2019s modern Christianity\u2019s best-kept secret (though they\u2019re not really trying to hide it). The Bible plainly says that the true followers of Christ \u2014 and therefore the true spokesmen for what he taught \u2014 would be those who not only claim to be his followers, but also keep his commandments. Yet modern Christians say Jesus abolished the commandments by his death! Go to just about any Christian church and you\u2019ll hear them say God\u2019s laws were \u201cnailed to the cross.\u201d The Bible, though, quotes Jesus as saying he did not come to destroy or abolish the law! He also said many would call him \u201cLord\u201d who would refuse to obey his commands, and therefore would not be his. And he said that in \u201cthis present evil age\u201d his true followers would be \u201cfew\u201d in number. Furthermore, a false religion appropriating the name of Christ and with \u201ca form of godliness\u201d would proliferate and supplant \u201cthe faith once delivered\u201d to God\u2019s true servants. And, because they would reject the commandments \u2014 particularly the command to keep God\u2019s \u201cSabbaths\u201d \u2014 they would not be able to fathom his purpose and plan. God\u2019s Sabbaths \u2014 which include the weekly (seventh-day) Sabbath, as well as seven annual \u201choly days\u201d and their accompanying festivals \u2014 provide a \u201cblueprint\u201d of God\u2019s plan for humanity. They portray significant events in human history, each one a critical step in his plan. They provide the keys to understanding the rest of the Bible, and answer the question of why God allows evil to exist and how that can be reconciled with the idea of a wise, just and loving God. Lacking this vital knowledge, many assume one cannot know God\u2019s reasons for allowing innocents to suffer, and should merely accept it as being his will without question. In so assuming, however, they must explain away verses that say God is loving, merciful and wants no one to perish. Following, then, is the missing aspect that reconciles all the Bible says about this into one cohesive and logically consistent view. The fundamental premise on which a view of a perfect God may be built is the biblical claim he is the creator of all things \u2014 and all life, including humans. The question is: why create life? The Bible provides the answer: \u201cGod is love.\u201d This is a direct quote. It doesn\u2019t say God has love, or God gives love or feels love from time to time, but that the very essence of God IS love. This means God\u2019s ultimate reason for everything he does is love. After all, life is a good thing to have, provided the quality of that life is also good \u2014 which is also God\u2019s intent, according to the Bible. As the creator of life, surely he would know how life works and what\u2019s best for those whom he creates. Naturally, if he creates out of love, he also wants to be loved. But love not given of one\u2019s own free will is not love. And love cannot be created by simple decree \u2014 even from an omnipotent God. \u201cThen how can he be omnipotent?\u201d you may ask. Because being omnipotent means God can do anything he pleases, and no higher power exists to prevent him. But God can \u2014 and does \u2014 limit himself! He cannot, then, do what is contrary to his nature, which is holy and righteous and good. For example, the Bible states that God \u201ccannot lie.\u201d Does this contradict his omnipotence? Not at all! It simply means his nature is so perfect he will not lie. Saying God cannot create love by simple decree doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t \u201chard code\u201d thoughts and impulses into people\u2019s minds identical to love; it means God himself has determined that\u2019s not really love. The love God wants from us must come of our own free will. For one\u2019s will to be truly free, then, it must also be free to not love God. To love God, the Bible states, is to keep his commandments \u2014 to obey him. But why, some might ask, if we have free will, does God get angry and punish us if we exercise our free will to do what we want instead of what he wants? Because free will \u2014 which is the ability to choose \u2014 is not the same thing as permission \u2014 which is the right to make a particular choice. God, by definition \u2014 and especially by biblical definition \u2014 as the giver and sustainer of life, lays claim over the lives he creates, and presumes the right to dictate how they should live. By the same definition, he has all power \u2014 which also means all authority \u2014 to enforce his will. He also lays claim, as its creator, over the entire universe. And, consistent with the claim he is love, he plans to share the universe with humanity \u2014 but not as we currently are. According to the Bible, the human heart \u2014 \u201cas is\u201d \u2014 is \u201cdesperately wicked\u201d! The whole world, it says, has been deceived and has lived under the sway of satan, whom it calls God\u2019s adversary. Man\u2019s refusal to obey God is the reason for all the pain, suffering and death you and I both abhor. So does God. He didn\u2019t will that man should become so depraved, but he foresaw it and allowed it to happen anyway. He allows an individual to experience pain and suffering \u2014 even death \u2014 for now, so that he might ultimately end pain and suffering \u2014 and even death \u2014 for that individual, forever. But he also wants that for every other individual. And there lies the dilemma. Individuals harm one another! If God loves both the individual who is harmed and the one who does the harm, then what is he to do? If he wants them both \u2014 wants us all \u2014 to live forever in total happiness, then what\u2019s the solution? The solution is that they \u2014 that we all \u2014 come to love one another the same way God loves each of us. But that would require us to become holy, righteous and perfect, as he is \u2014 a pretty tall order if we\u2019re \u201cdesperately wicked.\u201d How can he pull that off? Again, he can\u2019t simply \u201cprogram\u201d us, because that takes away free will, which makes true love for God and one another impossible. But, what if it were possible for him to impart to us \u2014 with our cooperation, of course \u2014 some of his own perfect character? That is, what if he were willing to share with us his own divinity? God is intrinsically perfect, or perfect by nature \u2014 something the Bible calls holy. He\u2019s perfect in knowledge, perfect in wisdom, perfect in goodness, and perfect in power. Since he has always existed, he has the momentum of an eternity of being holy, so he will never \u2014 can never \u2014 fail or commit error. As created beings, who (at current life expectancies) barely live for seventy or eighty years, and who have free wills, we CAN and DO both fail and commit error. In fact, everything we do (except draw our next breath) we must learn how to do by trial and error and much practice \u2014 from walking and talking to sending rockets to the moon. Most significantly, perhaps the majority of what we\u2019ve learned is through having been told and/or shown. Developing perfect character requires no less than everything I\u2019ve mentioned so far. It also requires time and experience.  This experience, of course, will include pain and suffering \u2014 which demonstrate to us why to avoid error: because it causes pain and suffering. Temporary pain and suffering, then, teaches those who cause the pain and suffering of others, the horrors of pain and suffering, in hopes that they might be sorry for causing pain and suffering and stop \u2014 that they might in turn be allowed to live when God ENDS pain and suffering FOREVER! Again, if God is able to make us to live forever, and wants eternity to be a happy experience for all who live forever, it makes perfect sense to allow pain and suffering for a period of time that will disappear from all memory in the vastness of eternity. In fact, the God of the Bible plainly says this will happen \u2014 once all who learn this lesson and become love (that is, become what he is) are given eternal life, and all those who refuse are (mercifully) destroyed, all the pain and suffering of our brief time on Earth will be forgotten. So will those who are ultimately destroyed be forgotten \u2014 which, for the sake of eternal happiness, is a necessity.  Notice, this is NOT what Christianity teaches.  Christianity teaches that the unrepentant burn forever in a fiery Hell.  The Bible, however, does not teach this. Again, it does teach of a \"lake of fire,\" which the wicked are cast into; but, they are (mercifully) burned up \u2014 destroyed.  They cease to exist.  Your basic Christian will disagree with this \u2014 which is why people like you hate what you think is the God of the Bible. But, before it even comes to that, the God of the Bible has the power (and intent) to bring all the dead back to life.  So, even God-haters like yourself will be awakened, introduced to that God, and given an opportunity (if you've never had one) to know him, be forgiven, and offered eternal life. This will not be some kind of \"second chance,\" but a first real chance.  Because, being merciful, kind, and (yes) all-wise, he takes into account that \u2014 as it plainly says in the Bible \u2014 the whole world has been deceived.  Including millions who call themselves followers of Christ. So, let me issue my own challenge to you: read it for yourself.  Find out about that God from the source.  I dare you to show me where the Bible \u2014 and not those who don't believe it themselves \u2014 portrays this \"Omni-God\" you and Christianity describe. Deny his existence if you must.  Call the Bible the work of men and reject it as having authority over you.  After all, you have the free will to do so.  But have the courage to deal with someone who knows and believes what it says, and \u2014 unless you're afraid of it \u2014 learn what the Bible really says before you attack it. It's without malice or condescension that I submit this response to your challenge.  I have no illusions this will change you into a believer in the Bible or a follower of Christ.  My only hope is that you will consider this on a logical basis \u2014 again, the plausibility of there being a God with a benevolent purpose for what he allows, as I've described. If you are willing to discuss this rationally, civilly, and in efforts to promote understanding or possible common ground between us, feel free to email me (no attachments, please).  [end of letter] Again, naturally, I never got a response from him.  But then, what could he say? ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think the problem of evil is really a big problem for a couple reasons. 1) The Definition of Evil - We're using the term \"Evil\" in two different ways.  For God, Evil occurs when someone violates His rules; rules He set up for humanity to follow in order to measure their use of free will.  By this definition, Evil only exists as part of an obedience test for people; it's not possible for God to be evil, because he can't violate His own will-- His obedience isn't in question.  God could eliminate Evil by eliminating His rules, but that wouldn't deal with people's real concern, which uses a different definition of Evil. 2) The Problem of Suffering - for humanity, pain and suffering are the measure of all Evil.  God may disagree with that definition, but even if we don't call it Evil, it's still in contrast to Goodness.  So if God is omnibenevolent, what's up with all the non-good? I know the Problem of Evil is a Western Theological problem, but I think you can find the solution in Eastern religion. Basically, you can't have the Yin without the Yang. In order for people to experience something good, it has to be contrasted with something bad.  These are relative terms; good defines bad, and vice versa.  Saying you want to keep the good without the bad is like saying you want to keep the tall without the short-- it doesn't make sense; you'd have to get rid of the dimension of height altogether. 3) Value and Free Will - so why do good and bad or pleasure and pain exist in the first place?  Well, I think it's a necessary byproduct of free will.  In order to make choices, you have to have motivation, and that motivation comes from having an array of values  to work with.  If you didn't have value, there would be nothing to deliberate over and no reason to ever choose a course of action.  Granted, you could conceivably have good and bad without free will, but I don't think the reverse is true.  If free will is a priority for God, then it seems necessary that there would be some type of suffering in the world. 4) The Limits of Omnipotence - but if God is truly omnipotent, why can't He just make it so the good can exist without the bad?  Well, there are two different definitions of omnipotence; one is that you can do anything as long as it doesn't violate the rules of logic (which, to me, seems pretty gosh darn powerful).  The other is that you can do anything regardless of logic.  My response above presumes that God is bound by logic.  If God wasn't, then I'm not sure why anybody would bother even arguing, because all answers could be correct simultaneously. ****** So, basically, pain and suffering are necessary to define pleasure and joy, and bad is necessary to define good; furthermore, these relative experiences are necessary to make free will function.  Evil is just a line drawn on the obedience test that is morality, and has nothing to do with pain and suffering. ",
