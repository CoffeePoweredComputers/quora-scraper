            "answer_text": "To what extent is consciousness separable from the physical world?  Above, information enters the brain from outside, then a reproduction of what is outside is made in the brain, and then that reproduction is projected onto consciousness, which is like a field that occupies all of space in the universe. Wherever you go in space, you are able to be conscious. If consciousness was not everywhere, the second you move your head, you will black out, and conscious experience will disappear until you move it back. Consciousness is not made of matter, but does need matter in order to know or experience anything about existence, or some kind of brain. There is no reason to think that consciousness is unnatural, but there is a reason to think that there is more to conscious experience than the matter of the brain. Let me explain: In physics, there is no distinction between past, present, and future, and each of us have our own present. The present seems to be an illusion created by consciousness. Time does not flow, the way we intuitively think it does, and is instead a fourth dimension that is akin to the three space dimensions, but that is not identical to a space dimension.  Above, we have a three-dimensional representation of a four-dimensional portion of space-time. One space dimension has been removed, and has been replaced with the time dimension. Imagine that the rod that is the Earth, stretched out over space and time, is your brain, and that the dark slice is your \u2018now slice\u2019, that is, a three-dimensional \u2018slice\u2019 of a four-dimensional brain. This slice is consciousness, and it moves from past to future through your brain. Your now, and your consciousness, are tied together. If there is no distinction between past, present, and future, it holds that, if the matter of the brain alone could account for consciousness, we should find that we experience our entire lives all at once, and we should find that we don\u2019t experience change in the universe, or in our minds. We would just exist, and nothing would appear to change or move, nor would beginnings and ends appear to occur. I am not saying that consciousness is not physical, just that it is in some sense separate from the matter of the brain. It is like a three-dimensional field moving from past to future through the forth dimension. The brain can detect consciousness, showing that it is physical, and the brain is self-aware, but in and of itself, it is not conscious. It needs a field of consciousness for there to be a conscious mind, and consciousness needs a brain to project information onto it, otherwise it is an entirely blank screen, and does not know that it exists, nor does it know that the universe exists. When consciousness moves beyond where your brain is embedded in space-time, you cease to be conscious, and are thus dead. However, your body and brain are forever there in the past, along with everything you ever did or thought, and you technically never cease to exist.  \u201cNow he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\u201d - Albert Einstein  Here, we see how the balls are already in the pockets before one goes to strike the cue ball, as the past and future are equally real. Imagine you are in a car, and that car is consciousness, then imagine you are on a street that has many houses. Those houses represent thoughts in the brain. As the car drives down the street, houses come into view, and then go back out of view. However, the houses do not begin to exist when they come into view, and do not cease to exist when they are no longer in view. In a sense, all events and things in the universe have always existed, and will always exist. The past is still there behind us, and the future is already there ahead of us, just waiting for a field of conscious to arrive at it. Because of all of this, I strongly suspect that consciousness goes above and beyond the material and activity of the brain, but do think it is still a physical thing that obeys laws. We tend to be tempted to think that consciousness is not explainable, and thus must be supernatural or spiritual. Not only is that an argument from ignorance, which is a logical fallacy, it sells nature short, and insults it by saying it cannot do what it is doing already. The reason that we think that thoughts are not physical objects, is that we have a ghostly conscious experience of them in our consciousness. It is that which makes the color red, which is just photons with a certain frequency being interpreted in the brain, impossible to describe to a blind man. It is what makes empathy and love impossible to describe to a psychopath. It makes chemical reactions in the brain more than just chemical reactions. It makes them conscious experiences that are seemingly inexplicable to us, so we invoke the unnatural out of ignorance of what nature can do. ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is embedded in the physical world,it is inseparable. What is confusing and hard to understand is that existence is not created on a single solid linear field. Existence is the product of layers of information fields that come together to create an exponent field. What we experience in the physical world as being a whole universe of physical matter, is actually the result of metaphysical layers of separate information fields each forming its own metaphysical web or grid and the combination of these information fields is what creates the appearance of something solid, the feel of something solid, the taste of something solid, the sound of something solid and the scent of something solid. The layers that actually make up the physical world are the layers of consciousness; awakeness, awareness without self-awareness, self-awareness and supra-awareness, the layer of thought, the layer of sight, the layer of sound, the layer of feeling, the layer of taste, the layer of reasoning and logic and the layer of fantasy and imagination. All of these layers are compressed by gravity to form the physical world and the physical experience. Because we are conscious beings who are awake, aware and self-aware, we are not the sum of our bodies, but the sum of our personal information. Our personal information consists of all the information we gather and hold. This information includes who we think we are and what we think we look like, our knowledge, memories, emotions, proclivities, personality, character, feelings and perspectives. We are information gatherers who communicate through the channels from our consciousness ( which is contained in a metaphysical field known as the mind,) to our physical brains and when our bodies die, we are released from the gravity lock that held us to our flesh vessels and we return to the layers we came from; the layers of consciousness that hold all information; the layer of awakeness, the level of awareness without self-awareness, the level of self-awareness, the layer of thought, the layer of sight, the layer of sound, the layer of feeling, the layer of taste, the layer of reasoning and logic, the layer of fantasy and imagination and the layer of knowledge. As all our information is held in our minds and not our brains, and we (our identity) is also housed in our mind, we are always active, but are not always perceived by the brain which requires sleep. It is also important to note that when the brain is injured, damaged, or even when the brain is dead, this does not impact us, because we are still active in our minds, continuing to think. We are living information. As long as we hold on to our personal information, our consciousness expands to hold the layers that the information corresponds to so in affect, we are our own universe of information. When we surrender our perspective (our personal hold is our personal perspective), then our information is available to \u201call\u201d and we join the \u201cone\u201d. The all is the combined layers of all information, the one is the one universe of thought that contains all surrendered thoughts (thoughts that are no longer held by their owner). While we are physical, our thoughts will clash with opposing thoughts because the physical realm is one where all information collides and each manifest being has his or her say. In the physical world, wars are fought over whose information will rule the thought beings who reside on earth and we will feel revulsion over information we feel is false. This is because all thoughts carry energy waves and as we are thought beings, we are energy beings carrying a wave equal to our own information. In the conscious universe, without physical for we are not constrained by gravity but we are separate from other thoughts by our wave. Only like waves meet, opposing waves do not so there is no clash and no war. By keeping to our own information, we keep ourselves private and away from the disturbance of other thoughts. On earth, while imprisoned in flesh, we must find privacy if we want to get away from the thoughts of the world and sometimes this means we must shut ourselves away in physical seclusion. If you consider your own thoughts and how you feel to the thoughts of the world, you will discover that consciousness is not separate from the world. You will experience what I have just described and know it for yourself. ",
