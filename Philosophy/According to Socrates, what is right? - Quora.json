            "answer_text": "I never read what Socrates wrote because he only lived what he taught . I will attempt to share some insights . Let\u2019s start with questioning \u2026 What is right action? What is to live rightly? He spoke of the function of a philosopher as a genuine \u2018educator \u2019, being like a midwife who assists in bringing out Clarity; as he engaged in dialogue, gently and patiently would let the labor of posing the right questions , give birth to Truth . His approach was to make clear what is \u2018right\u2019 . Right in what he called to live the truth of our inherent Goodness . As in the eightfold path of Buddha the most important of all is \u201c Right View : Clarity .  To live in Wisdom ( not related to having knowledge) is being aligned with Life\u2019s Intelligence . To be insightful , meet What Is, responding accordingly ( rightly), because life demands action and one cannot act rightly with a confused mind ( which societal conditioning tends to en/ darken ). Right action is true respone-ability , to act not according to personal motives. Correctness or \u2018Rightness\u2019 is acting for the ultimate Good, for the benefit of the whole. self-rightness is arrogance ! So each human being has the responsibility , to be able to act rightly, respond to what the situation requires , not re-act , which is a mechanical action based on pre-conceived ideas. To react is not to be responsabile , to re-act is to repeat old actions from past experience which is not true action based on fresh perceiving of what is actually happening. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine a wheel that is out of alignment and wobbles. Then imagine it is straightened out so it revolves smoothly and in perfect balance. We then say that the wheel is \u2018aright.\u2019 That is how Socrates and Plato understand moral rightness: that which places the soul in perfect balance and harmony \u2014 within itself, and with the entire cosmos. The relevant term in Greek is dikaiosyne, which means \u2018righteousness.\u2019 ",
