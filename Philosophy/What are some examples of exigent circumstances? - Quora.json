            "answer_text": "I has a case once where a search got started because 911 got a call from an address with nothing but dead air on the line. Turns out that static electricity can cause these phantom calls to the 911 emergency line. They still have to check it out, though. Police can enter a home when no one answers the door if they have some reason to think someone might be in trouble. Technically this is the \u201ccommunity caretaker\u201d exception to the warrant requirement, a subdivision of the exigent circumstances rule, all deriving from the word \u201creasonable\u201d in the Fourth Amendment. In my case they checked it out and found a pound of marijuana in my client\u2019s microwave. I never did ask him why he kept his dope in the microwave \u2026 some things you just don\u2019t want to know. Anyway, the \u201ccommunity caretaker\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment doesn\u2019t authorize a full-blown search, but rather just entry into the premises long enough to search for human being in trouble. Since the phantom caller to 911 could not fit inside the microwave, the cops here exceeded the scope of a lawful search and the federal judge threw out this evidence. Client still went to jail for other reasons, but not this illegal search! ",

            "answer_text": "Exigent circumstance An exigent circumstance, in the criminal procedure law of the United States, allows law enforcement, under certain circumstances, to enter a structure without a search warrant or, if they have a \"knock and announce\" warrant, without knocking and waiting for refusal. It must be a situation where people are in imminent danger, evidence faces imminent destruction, or a suspect's imminent escape ",
