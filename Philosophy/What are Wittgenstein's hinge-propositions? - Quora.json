            "answer_text": "In Wittgenstein\u2019s final work, called On Certainty, he identified certain propositions as hinge\u2019s. Keep in mind that Wittgenstein never finished these notes, and it is believed by many that he never fully came to grips with what hinge-propositions were. Although, there are many hints in terms of where his thinking was heading. You really cannot think of hinge-propositions as normal propositions. Normal propositions fit within the scope of epistemology, but hinge-propositions really do not, at least according to many interpretations of Wittgenstein. But how do they differ? To understand how they differ from ordinary propositions, one needs to understand that ordinary propositions can be said to be true or false. So they are statements that do have a truth value. On Certainty is a reply to G. E. Moore\u2019s papers, A Defense of Common Sense (1925), and a Proof of an External World (1939). In these papers Moore identifies certain propositions as true in the name of common sense, but more than this, Moore knows they are true. For example, \u201cHere is one hand,\u201d is an instance of a proposition that he knows. Another might be, \u201cI know the Earth has existed for many years (paraphrase),\u201d and it is these kinds of propositions that Wittgenstein found fascinating. Wittgenstein sees something special about these statements, and sets out to challenge Moore\u2019s view of their status, and in turn also challenges the skeptic\u2019s view, as they express their doubts in relation to an external reality. Part of the language-game of making an assertion that \u201cYou know X,\u201d is another person challenging your assertion, that is, if you know X, then how are you justified in believing you know X. So part of the language-game of epistemology is satisfying oneself (OC, 3). For example, showing those who might express a doubt about your knowledge, that is, that you indeed do know. Also, Wittgenstein points out the negation of \u201cI know\u2026,\u201d which is, \u201cI thought I knew\u2026,\u201d so it does not follow from a claim to know, that you indeed do know. It must be demonstrated. Otherwise one could infer from one\u2019s claim that one knows, that one does know (OC, 13), which would be strange indeed. However, consider \u201cI know I have hands.\u201d What would it mean to know such a proposition in ordinary discourse?\u201d Is this the kind of statement that we ordinarily justify? \u201cNow do I, in the course of my life, make sure I know that here is a hand\u2014my own hand, that is (OC, 9).\u201d Is this the kind of statement that we ordinarily doubt? What would the statement \u201cI thought I knew I had hands,\u201d even mean in ordinary discourse? Consider how out of the ordinary it would be to ask someone to justify the statement, \u201cI have hands.\u201d Furthermore, it is not that you cannot think of a situation in which it would be possible to doubt whether you have hands. It is that in our everyday interactions, to express a doubt about such a thing, seems senseless, or at the very least out-of-place. So Wittgenstein seems to be pointing to something bedrock to our understanding of epistemology, something arational, not justified in any epistemological sense. One can think of these as bedrock beliefs, hinge beliefs, or foundational beliefs. However, the word foundational dredges up foundational theories of knowledge, but Wittgenstein\u2019s hinges are not related to these traditional foundational views, which do maintain epistemological concepts (truth, justification, self-evident, indubitable, etc) in relation to foundational propositions. Wittgenstein separates these hinge-propositions (bedrock beliefs) from the way they have ordinarily been thought of. My own thoughts are that these hinge-propositions are really prelinguistic or nonlinguistic beliefs, at least a certain set of them are. As such they can be observed across cultures, that is, all people exhibit these beliefs due to the structure of reality. No one teaches any human that they have two hands, or that there are independent objects that we interact with. It is just a fact of reality. The implication for epistemology is that justification comes to an end, that is, it ends with bedrock beliefs. At least it seems so. ",
