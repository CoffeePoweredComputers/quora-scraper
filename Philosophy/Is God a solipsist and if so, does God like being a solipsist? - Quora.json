            "answer_text": "Thankfully Christian doctrine can answer this. Solipsism is \u2018a theory holding that the self can know nothing but its own modifications and that the self is the only existent thing\u2019. So, if this were the case then God could not know anything that deviated from His nature. As I suggest in my answer to \u2018What are the things the Abrahamic God cannot do in the Bible?\u2019 self-denial (internal inconsistency) is the one thing scripture explicitly says God is incapable of. Is this equivalent to solipsism? Well, if it were then Sin would not be describable. A solipsistic God would have no sense of any separation from itself. Specifically, it could not say exactly these sorts of words: Matthew 7:21-23 NIV [21] \u201cNot everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [22] Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' [23] Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' The Bible is about the offer of reconciliation (and the miraculous mechanisms of its provision) to a world and a people that are other than God. Where a divine self is all there is then no distinction exists to begin with. Such a stance invalidates the entire edifice of Christian theology. This may be convenient, even arguable (if certain sections of scripture are avoided) but ultimately the suggestion that God is solipsistic makes you God. Spinoza is definitely smart and the intellect evident in his Ethics is enviable. However, given a solipsistic God then envy does not exist - neither does hatred, injustice, infidelity, or criminality of any kind. Divine solipsism makes you myself otherwise (if \u2018otherness\u2019 can be described with respect to God) it is false. Either we are all God together or God knows more than Himself. You\u2019re not going to disagree with me here, are you, \u2018God\u2019? How would you know how to? ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your definition of God. If you accept God: omnipotent, omniscient, eternally omnipresent. Solipsist: Nothing outside the mind should be believed to exist. If ones own mind is the sum total of existence, then all perceived experience and existential things(i.e. the universe) are all merely internal processes of the mind. One test a mind could do to see if it is the only thing in existence is to violate the perceived rules of the universe by mere thought. There is no evidence to even remotely suggest telekinetic ability in humans, and we don\u2019t have full understanding of our minds. God on the other hand, being omniscient, would have no barriers to access any aspect of It\u2019s mind, and being omnipotent, could presumably violate any natural law It wished. This would seem to confirm Its existence as a Solipsist justified. As to your second question, it is somewhat nonsensical; There is no evidence to support the existence of any God, at least ones claimed to have some aspect of the definition I put forth at the beginning. To make an assessment whether this type of God likes or dislikes anything, given there is no rational justification for believing It\u2019s existence in the first place, is much like saying does the Loch Ness monster like tuna.
