            "answer_text": "Q. What are the differences between Eastern philosophy from Western philosophy? What are two different examples of Eastern philosophy? (1a) Be mindful that the Eastern frameset is an indistinguishable mash of religion, culture and philosophy. That\u2019s why this is often uttered in a single breath: Eastern Religions and Philosophies. And Easterners are inclusively Syncretic. No theoretical contradiction in mixing and matching, e.g. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism elements, or Buddhism/Hinduism. (Contrast with the us-&-them tension between the Abrahamic religions of Judaism / Christianity / Islam, on the one level, and Catholicism/Protestantism, Sunni/Shite at the other level.) (1b) In the Western realm, there is often Religion-Philosophy tension to varying degrees. (2a) Western philosophy is centered on healthy (sometimes arguably) Skepticism. It onward breeds challenge and tension, and rah rah loud-&-proud enforced individualism. Religion-Reason tensionReligion-ScienceIndividual-SocietyIndividual-AuthoritySociety-AuthorityBranch-of-Authority - Branch-of-AuthorityWhatever-Whatever, a persistent Fight Club psycheCompetitive, boisterous, colorful, noisy democracy, separation-of-powers, checks-&-balances, Tyranny of the State, Tyranny of the majority.Skepticism, distrust, tension are design parameters to shape political, economic and social models that are robust and trustworthy, to mitigate universal human frailty. (2b) Eastern. Chill Yin-and-yang demeanor. Balance, moderation, harmony, communitarianism, continuum. A glorious polar opposite of the above Western psyche in almost all dimensions. An epic Clash of Civilizations. (2c) This is why Eastern, especially East Asian Confucian heritage societies, often struggle with high-tensioned western liberal democracy. An incongruent clash of Yin-and-Yang versus high Skepticism. This is why there\u2019re a zillion pesky questions on China and Democracy in Quora. A 4,200 year civilization is not going to flip the switch from Yin-&-Yang to high order Skepticism in a blink. DNA.

            "answer_text": "NAGARJUNA, Indian, Buddhist Philosopher (c. 100-200 C.E.) LR/05 Major Works, Madhyamaka Karika ( Discourse on the Middle Way), and Vigraha-vyavartani ( Refutation of Objections) Principle Ideas: I. All things, ideas, events, etc. are \u201cempty\u201d of \u201cown being,\u201d meaning that they do not exist or cease to exist on their own, but rather they exist in relation to other things. \u201cCause and effect\u201d relations could not obtain if things were completely independent of other things. \u201cThings\u201d exist in relation, not independently. II. There is no permanent \u201cessence\u201d of the Universe, such as, for example, the Hindu Brahman/Atman. If we were to use the word \u201cessence\u201d at all with regard to the Universe, we would say that its \u201cessence\u201d is its interrelatedness, or unity. But that is not a separate \u201cthing..\u201d III. In reifying the language and concepts we use to frame our thinking about the world, we mistakenly take our conceptual framework to be the \u201cworld.\u201d This is what most of us do. It is the \u201cconventional\u201d way to think of the world of experience. IV. There are two ways of taking the world of experience, conventionally and \u201cultimately.\u201d We learn about the latter on the basis of the former; and we realize Nirvana (freedom) on the basis of the latter. V. Transcendental Wisdom (\u201cspiritual wisdom\u201d) involves the knowledge that ultimate(ly) Reality surpasses the words used to express, or describe it. VI. We can experience Reality directly, without the mediation of a conventional conceptual framework by \u201ccalming verbal differentiation\u201d through (psychophysical/meditative) practice. VII. Knowing the Truth, i.e. the world as it is without the mediation of an overshadowing, conventional conceptual framework, will set us free. (\u201cenlightenment,\u201d \u201cemancipation,\u201d \u201cliberation,\u201d \u201cNirvana\u201d) Sources: Sue Hamilton, Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction Ian P. McGreal, ed., Great Thinkers of the Eastern World , \u201cNargarjuna.\u201d Nagarjuna, \u201cDiscourse On The Middle Way,\u201d World Of The Buddha: A Reader, ed., Lucien Stryk. =========================================================================== (2nd Cent. B.C.E) \t\u201cBadarayana\u201d wrote the Brahma Sutra, which is a philosophical commentary on what the Upanishads have to say about \u201cBrahman.\u201d The first verse of the Brahma Sutra says, \u201cThen (there is) the inquiry into \u201cBrahman.\u201d And the second verse says, \u201c . . . that from which (occurs) the origin, maintenance, and dissolution (of all that there is).\u201d (8th Cent. C.E.) \u201cShankara\u201d used the Brahma Sutra, the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads as his three basic texts, regarding them as the \u201ctriple foundation\u201d of revealed truth. \u201cRamanuja\u201d accepted these as well. Triple Foundation of Revealed Truth Upanishads (800-500 B.C.E.) Bhagavad Gita (200 B.C.E - 200 C.E.) Brahma Sutra (2nd Cent C.E.) Shankara and Ramanuja (adapted from Great Thinkers of the Eastern World, Dan P. McGreal) Shankara - unqualified Non-Dualism , 8th Cent. C.E. Ramanuja - Non-Dualism qualified by difference, 11th Cent. C.E. Major ideas of Shankara, briefly summarized: Reality or Brahman is non-dual. The \u201cworld\u201d of conventional distinctions is ultimately illusory. Insofar as the world has a \u201cconventional reality,\u201d it is the creative appearance of Brahman (Maya). Brahman and Atman are, numerically, identical, since Reality is non-dual. This is the meaning of \u201cThat art thou,\u201d or \u201cThou art all that.\u201d It is possible for \u201cconventional individuals\u201d to realize Brahman. In order to realize Brahman one must follow the \u201cPath of Knowledge\u201d . This includes meditation. Realization of Brahman (Moksha) is the ultimate goal of human life, since Brahman is Truth/Being (Sat), Consciousness (Cit), and Bliss (Ananda). \u201cMoksha\u201d is the realization of one\u2019s \u201ctrue nature,\u201d or \u201ctrue self\u201d (Atman), i.e. that it is Brahman. As normal, everyday consciousness is to a dream, Moksha is to normal consciousness. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Major ideas of Ramanuja, briefly summarized: Reality or Brahman is non-dual. Metaphysically, the \u201cworld\u201d is grounded in Brahman, as such, the world is real. Brahman/Reality has dynamic qualities. There is a \u201cpersonal savior,\u201d which is a dynamic quality of Brahman. \"Release\" and freedom from spiritual ignorance (Moksha) is possible through devotion to ones\u2019 \"personal savior.\" Realization of the relationship of oneself (Atman) with Ultimate Reality (Brahman) is the goal of human life. Moksha is the realization of the \u201cunity of love\u201d that obtains between the \u201csoul\u201d (Atman) and its \u201cdivine ground\u201d (Brahman). This is the meaning of \u201cThou art all that\u201d (or \u201cthat art thou,\u201d or \u201cthou art that\u201d). Chandogya Upanishad Epistemologically, the objects of \"...all valid means of knowledge...,\" are differentiated, \"...therefore, Reality is differentiated and has qualities...\" , Ramanuja (Hamilton, p.133). Brahman = Sat - Cit - Ananda Being/Reality = Being - Consciousness - Bliss \u201cSat\u201d is translated as \u201cbeing\u201d, \u201ctruth,\u201d or \u201creality\u201d Benedict Spinoza, Dutch , 17th Cent. C. E. Key concepts are (1) \"substance\" (2) \"mode,\" and (3) \"attribute.\" There is one infinite \u201cSubstance\u201d of which all things, ideas, processes, events, organisms and agents are comprised. All these are \u201cmodes\u201d of the one \u201cSubstance,\u201d which can be called \u201cGod, or Nature.\u201d Each \u201cmode\u201d expresses the infinite \u201cattributes\u201d of the one, infinite, \u201cSubstance.\u201d Human modes of substance know two of its infinite attributes, i.e. mind and matter. Substance, God, or Nature has an eternal aspect and a temporal aspect. The eternal aspect is creative; the temporal aspect is created. The mind has union with the whole of Nature. There is one infinite \u201cSubstance\u201d of which all things, ideas, processes, events, organisms and agents are comprised. All these are \u201cmodes\u2019 of the one \u201cSubstance,\u201d which can be called \u201cGod, or Nature.\u201d Each \u201cmode\u201d expresses the infinite \u201cattributes\u201d of the one \u201cSubstance.\u201d Human modes of Substance know only two of its infinite \u201cattributes,\u201d i.e. mind and matter. \u201cNature\u201d has an eternal aspect, which is creative, and a temporal aspect, which is created. The mind\u2019s fulfillment lies in the knowledge if its \u201cunion\u201d with \u201cGod, or Nature.\u201d ",
