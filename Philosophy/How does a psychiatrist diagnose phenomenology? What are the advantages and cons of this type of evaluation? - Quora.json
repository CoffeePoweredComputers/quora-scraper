            "answer_text": "The phenomenological method in psychiatry is not exactly a method. It is more complicated than that; in fact, it is the psychiatrist's own person, as an \"instrument\" to understand the patient; We can say that it is an attitude or a key word: \"empathy\". Okay, I know that this word, like the word gratitude, is extremely worn and used; but what is the idea: empathy does not aim objectively at a person's subjectivity; This is impossible. But we can know a lot about it if the doctor-patient relationship is not asymmetric. Establishing an objective relationship with the patient will not be a good idea. We make an effort. Time is needed; patient memory time and the timing of silence is also critical. Knowing how to listen is also necessary. What is listening? Friend when you ask what it is to hear, to paraphrase Louis Armistrong, you will never know. Perhaps the most difficult to empathize with a person is our lack of humility. ",

            "answer_text": "A psychiatrist does not diagnose in a phenomenological manner, I think. In fact, regrettably, phenomenology has been restricted and relegated to the arts. Those who deem themselves to be properly scientific do not look at the description of what a person is experiencing from their own point of view. Or, they do not look at it very much, I think, before trying to categorize it in terms of some kind of predefined taxonomy of personality types. ",
