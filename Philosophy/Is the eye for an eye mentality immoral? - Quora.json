            "answer_text": "No, it's not immoral. In fact, it was established as a moral principle that everybody has the same value or worth regardless of your place in society. In its original Old Testament setting it was established as a moral ethical declaration that one life is worth no more or no less than another. At a time when it was commonly held that select lives were more important and of more value than others, this ethic was established to declare that this was not true. A rich person's eye is only worth the same as a poor person's eye. ",
