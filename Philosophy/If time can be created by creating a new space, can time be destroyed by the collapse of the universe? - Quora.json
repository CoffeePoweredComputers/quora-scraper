            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t know I would go so far as \u201ccreated\u201d, but there is certainly an intimate relationship between time and space. At present according to physical law and observation, space expands, entropy increases causing time to flow forwards and we remember things as we go into the future. Since a key principle of physical law is time symmetry (reversibility) now consider the implications of something having reversed time. Entropy would have to have decreased to cause this time reversal, space would contract, and memories (information) would be lost. Note I have carefully made no causal link between the expansion of space and the increase of entropy. I am not sure if researchers have ever argued through this chain of logic of a possible link between thermodynamics and the expansion of space. I am likely reinventing the wheel but the argument is as follows: As work is done, entropy increases, and information is produced (by particle interactions) that needs to be stored. It needs to be stored because physical law is time-reversible and without that information being available, that outcome cannot be met. But extra information can only be stored in the spatial configuration of the particles, so it follows that space must expand to provide that additional storage capability. The rate of expansion of space should as a result be related in a fundamental way to the rate of increase of entropy in the universe, which in turn will be a function of how much work is being done against gravity, which in turn will be related to the rate of particle interactions. For example the sun is hot from nuclear interactions doing work against gravity which prevents a collapse and busy increasing entropy as a result. By the logic above, this activity (integrated over the Universe) is also causing space to expand. Because the work is being done against gravity (the only force that extends such distances) it might not be surprising it is a constant in gravitational theory (the cosmological constant) that has a value defined by thermodynamics. Maybe someone can see where I am going here. Since the expansion of space is currently a presumed consequence at least in part of of dark energy and best modelled as the existence of a small positive cosmological constant in general relativity, perhaps the value of this constant is a consequence of thermodynamics and the increasing entropy of the Universe. If the logic above holds, there must be a new formula in physics relating the rate of increase in entropy to the value of the cosmological constant, and hence the rate of expansion. From the argument above, it might be subject to change over time. ",

I have read physicists postulating a far away future time, when all matter is in black holes and the universe is dark. My understanding however is that this would collapse both space and time. The result of this would be a physical (point-like) singularity, just the reverse of the process which gave birth to the universe and started time. Einstein said the same thing, that a singularity would twist all of spacetime up within it. ",
