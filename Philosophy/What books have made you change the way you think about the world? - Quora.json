            "answer_text": " Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari This book has blown my mind, totally. I\u2019ve only had two others in my life that have done the same. The book takes you all the way from pre humanity (sapiens of many species) and the formation of modern human cultures, having existed and existing now. It\u2019s really opened my mind, for example, one chapter in the book examines how our cultures past and present have conflicting values, the most apparent of these today is the values of equal opportunity and freedom of choice. I didn\u2019t realise before reading this book how at odds these two values are with each other. To provide equal opportunity for all you will need to curtail peoples rights to freedom to do as they please, make money and spend the money the way they want to. To create a world in which everyone is free and has the freedom to make money and spend it the way they want to you will need to accept that equal opportunity and or equality cannot exist. I\u2019m giving a very quick summation that cannot do the full and detailed explanation any justice. In another chapter, he deals with the fact that humans (sapiens of various species) are the single most devastating ecological disaster to have happened in the history of the earth. Not just currently as it\u2019s commonly accepted, but wherever / whenever humans through history stepped on to a continent, vast extinctions followed. Did you know that for most of human history across the globe it wasn\u2019t a crime to rape your wife? And that this has only been written into law as a crime in the last 100 years for a hand full of nations! In some places, it\u2019s still not a crime. Living in a liberal society, it truly shocked me! I found that this book made me think, and question much of what I learnt before or had taken for granted. It also makes you realise that we often think highly of our current cultures (west or middle or east) and may look down at ancient cultures. I now look at my current culture differently and I can see how flawed it actually is and that in some way human culture has become more complex but not necessarily better even for all its technology. This book doesn\u2019t deliver opinions and or inflammatory views, it simply gives one the understand and ability to look at your own and other cultures, people, way in a different light. A different angle. It allows you to see the way your own culture, religion or ideology biases the way you see others. I will need to read this book twice to fully gain its value. I will also keep it for children to read when they are ready. This book is an awakening. ",

            "answer_text": "I am surprised that no-one yet answered with Atlas Shrugged...   Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged completely changed my outlook on life. Living in India, coming from a conservative family, and a conventional society, there was a web of bindings that had always worried me at the unconscious level, but I had never realized them properly. (I know this wont make sense to anyone unless they have experienced it) Atlas Shrugged brought these issues into sharp focus. Fountainhead (by the same author, written 13 years before Atlas Shrugged) is on a very similar theme, but in my opinion, deals with less number of issues and in a less mature way. I believe these books are very important for people living in countries where independence of thought is not present or encouraged. Other than Atlas Shrugged, there are many which I consider must reads...    An Orgy of George by George CarlinThis is a funny book and at the same time it delivers the truth about this world. Maybe a bit cynical in places, but priceless nevertheless. Paraphrasing (from a section on 10 commandments):\"Honor your elders\". Obedience, respect for authority - Just another name for controlling people. The truth is that obedience and respect should not be automatic, they should be earned. They should be based on the person's performance.    The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes.This Pulitzer prize winning and absolutely unputdownable immense tome is the story of the creation of the Atomic bomb from the the discovery of the fundamental particles and radioactivity to the creation of  the Manhattan Project and the dropping of the first atomic bombs on Japan. The story is told in an extremely engaging way, and includes many interesting things that people in general do not know about one of the greatest chain of events in human history. For example, did you know that Leo Szilard was the scientist who first got the idea of a nuclear chain reaction to create a nuclear bomb? He owns the patent on nuclear chain reaction (aka nuclear bomb) and the patent on the nuclear reactor with Fermi. He was close friends with Albert Einstein and shares a few patents with him on refrigeration technology ( a fridge with no moving parts ). Szilard was also the first to realize the need for the creation of the atomic bomb by USA before Germany made one of theirs. He understood that he would not be taken very seriously if he himself went to he government to warn them. So, he wrote a letter to President Roosevelt, and took it to his good friend Einstein for review and endorsement. Einstein understood the gravity of the situation and signed the letter. This became the \"Einstein Letter\" which lead to the founding of the Manhattan Project. Szilard didn't like the fact that the military and the government were taking complete control of the bomb, which he thought was a scientific endeavor, and was almost thrown out of the project and only narrowly escaped imprisonment due to endorsement by other great scientists. When the bombs were finally dropped on Japan, he became disgusted with nuclear physics, and started studying Molecular Biology. Doing molecular biology, he invented an experimental method to treat cancer using radioactivity using Cobalt 60 isotope - Radiation therapy. When he got cancer, he used this method to treat himself and made a complete recovery. His method of radiation therapy is used to this day to treat cancer. Created Nuclear Bomb idea - checkCreated nuclear reactor idea - checkCreated cure for cancer - checkNever won Nobel prize or known by anyone after his time.Few people won the Nobel prize by extending his work.One of the greatest unrecognized scientist ever. This book will change how you look at the scientists and leaders involved in the Making of the Atomic Bomb.   Rise and fall of third Reich - William L ShirerThis book is amazing due to the picture it paints about the activities in the political circles of the great nations of the west around WWI and WWII. Watching many spy and thriller movies, I used to be amazed by the ingenuity of the plots and wondered how the authors got such ideas. Well, now I know that real life political circles are much more ingenious. ",
