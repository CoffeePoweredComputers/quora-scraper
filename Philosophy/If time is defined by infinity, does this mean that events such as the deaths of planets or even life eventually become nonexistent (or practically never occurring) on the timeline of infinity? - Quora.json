            "answer_text": "It is true that infinity is non-measurable. However, the OBSERVER has a slight advantage in that the Observer is at the center of infinity. So all that we know is that Earth is at the center of the infinite universe. So the only thing we know for sure is that the center of infinity is where the observer is. The definition of Observer may vary as we enlarge our concept. First we may say that earth is the observer. We may next consider that our solar system is the observer. As the next step we may consider our galaxy as the center of the universe. Finally we may say that our visible universe is at the center of the infinite universe. Now, with regard to TIME, we may boldly say that Time may be infinite but we are at the middle of it. Time has existed an infinite amount of time in the past. Time will exist for an infinite amount of time into the future. Humans may not be there at the beginning of time; or at the end of time. But since matter cannot be created or destroyed, matter and time will be there at all times\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Until there are events, time remains finite. Past events remain past events and do not vanish. If there is nothing left to contribute to events, to perceive time, the time itself collapses into single moment (a time singularity) that lasts infinitely long. During this singular infinity nothing exists and no events occur, until there are \u201csomething\u201d once again. ",
