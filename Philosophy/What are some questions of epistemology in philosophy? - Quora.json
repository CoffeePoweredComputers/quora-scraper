            "answer_text": "Quoted from the Objectivist Lexicon on the ARI website: Quote: Since man is not omniscient or infallible, you have to discover what you can claim as knowledge and how to prove the validity of your conclusions. Does man acquire knowledge by a process of reason \u2014 or by sudden revelation from a supernatural power? Is reason a faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man\u2019s senses \u2014 or is it fed by innate ideas, implanted in man\u2019s mind before he was born? Is reason competent to perceive reality \u2014 or does man possess some other cognitive faculty which is superior to reason? Can man achieve certainty \u2014 or is he doomed to perpetual doubt? The extent of your self-confidence \u2014 and of your success \u2014 will be different, according to which set of answers you accept. \u201cPHILOSOPHY: WHO NEEDS IT\u201d Philosophy: Who Needs It, 3 ",

            "answer_text": "A few epistemological questions that I can think of are: Is Plato\u2019s definition knowledge (justified true belief) still adequate? Or are there now too many Gettier and other exceptions?What is a fact?Is testimony (meaning what somebody else has told you) a reliable source of knowledge?Is science still the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for the discovery of empirical knowledge?Is science concerned only with empirical knowledge?",
