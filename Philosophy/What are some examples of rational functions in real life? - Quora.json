            "answer_text": "A rational function is defined as the quotient of two polynomial functions. f(x) = P(x) Q(x) The graph below is that of the function f(x) = x2 \u2212 1 (x + 2)(x \u2212 3)\u2026which brings me to Love, something completely irrational..or is it? There are two kinds of love called by various names: healthy versus unhealthy, mature versus immature or romantic versus rational. Barbara believes in romantic love, and because she no longer finds it in her marriage, she may be denying herself the chance to find a healthier, longer-lasting type of rational love with her husband. Romantic love is based on pleasure and passion. It is rooted in the self and not the other because it is the emotional high it gives that is paramount and not the needs and feelings of the other. In rational love, passion and pleasure are important but not paramount. It is equally rooted in the needs of the self and the other. In its ideal form, rational love arrives at a point after many years of commitment and struggle at which the needs of the other become as important as the needs of the self. Romantic love is time-limited. The passion usually burns itself out in a few short months or years. When that happens, the believer in romantic love may then try to rediscover it with someone else. Life then becomes a futile search for a continuous emotional high. Based upon commitment and cognizant of the needs of the other, rational love lasts longer than romantic love, perhaps even a lifetime! Although never reaching the high of romantic love, rational love can result in an increasingly satisfactory sex life between a husband and a wife. Sex can become better with each year of marriage as trust, familiarity and fondness are deepened.  Romantic love is based upon an idealized, unrealistic vision of the other. Clouded by passion, it either glosses over the faults of the other or assumes they will be changed with time. Rational love is more honest and realistic. It beholds the other objectively and critically yet still exclaims \"I love you.\" Romantic love can be a function of unresolved childhood problems. It may seek the fusion of the original mother-child relationship that leaves the child feeling completely safe, secure and protected but helpless. \u00adRational love is based more upon maturity and independence. Although able to depend upon the other when appropriate, people who are rationally in love can also stand on their own emotions. Because it depends upon the maintenance of an emotional high, romantic love fears change, growth and aging as threats to its existence. Rational love welcomes change as an opportunity to achieve greater intimacy and to grow together in life, not apart. Since television, movies and Madison Avenue bombard our young people with messages about the glories of romantic love for the attainment of happiness, perhaps we adults should be telling them they are being duped. So, in conclusion..Rational Functions are great to figure out Carpentry or Engineering Problems, Route Planning for Airlines, Optimization of scarce resources in an abundant universe\u2026, but it has not given us any brilliant architecture, insights on Humanity, Epic lives or relationships (unless you sell the software and are called Kill Gates..lol ).

            "answer_text": "I was not really prepared to answer, but given that you asked in an A2A, and given that the answers so far did not understand the question, I will try. First, the definition is needed. A function f is rational if and only if it is the quotient of two polynomials\u2026 that is, expressible in the form f(x) = P(x) / Q(x) where P and Q are polynomials. In particular, if P and Q have degree 1, then f(x) = (ax + b) / (cx + d)where a, b, c, and d are constants. My first examples will both use this. A specific example would be f(x) = x / (x + 1).Customarily, the ratio should be in lowest terms, such as(x + 2) / x but NOT (3x + 6) / 3x (because of common factor 3). For example, an inverse relationship, mathematically y = 1 / x, fits this, as one has a = 1, and b, c, d each zero. A real-life example of this is the ideal gas law: P = k / V where k is a constant, P = pressure, V = volume of gas. Second example. For purposes of illustration, imagine you and your son are immortal. If you are 30 years older than your son (because he was born when you were age 30), in year x of his life, the ratio of your age to his is(x + 30 / x, or the ratio of his to yours is x / (x + 30). In either case, as time goes on, both x and x + 30 (your ages) increase, but either ratio I just gave approaches 1, even though you are always 30 years apart in age. To some people, this feels paradoxical, because if the ratio were exactly 1, the ages would have to be identical! (Of course, the ratio only approaches 1 but never reaches 1.) Interestingly, functions of the form f(x) = (ax + b) / (cx + d) generally are invertible, with the inverse function also rational. There is no need for the polynomials to be linear, as in next example: An object fired straight up from the ground at time t = 0 with instantaneous velocity 100 ft/sec will have height above earth (i.e., position) given bys = -16 t^2 + 100 tand, in this case, for the seconds projectile remains in the air, the ratio (-16 t^2 + 100t) / t is a rational function that gives the average velocity from time t = 0 to time t.
