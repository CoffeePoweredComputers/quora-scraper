            "answer_text": " Following are the different types of consciousness- Unwholesome consciousness: Consciousness rooted in one or more unwholesome mental elements: greed, hatred, and delusion. We consider it unwholesome firstly because it adversely impacts experience, thereby inflicting pain and suffering. Secondly, it is unwholesome because it generates unwholesome volition. Unwholesome consciousness can be sub-classified as: Greedy: Consciousness that is predominantly rooted in greed is primarily responsible for experiences of selfishness, passion, lust, attachments, indifference, sensual pleasure, convictions, beliefs, and so on. Hateful: Consciousness that is predominantly rooted in hatred is primarily responsible for experiences of displeasure, and for the entire range of aversions ranging from minor irritation, resistance, and negativity to violent anger.Deluded: Consciousness that is predominantly rooted in delusion is primarily responsible for experiences of impatience, agitation, skepticism, indecisiveness, indifference, brazenness, laziness, and so on.2. Wholesome consciousness: Consciousness rooted in one or more wholesome mental elements: non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. We can consider it wholesome firstly because it positively impacts experience, thereby generating happiness and peace. Secondly, it is wholesome because it generates wholesome volition. Wholesome consciousness can be sub-classified as: \u00b7 Non-greedy: Consciousness that is predominantly rooted in non-greed is primarily responsible for experiences of joy, generosity, sympathy, empathy, letting go, non-craving, non-clinging, detachment, unselfishness, renunciation, dispassion, contentment, effacement, wealth, happiness, peace, and so on. \u00b7 Non-hateful: Consciousness that is predominantly rooted in non-hatred is primarily responsible for experiences of loving-kindness, patience, forbearance, equanimity, sociability, agreeableness, amity, gentleness, friendliness, calmness, softness, coolness, pleasantness, delight, happiness, bliss, concentration, energy, and so on. Non-deluded: Consciousness that is predominantly rooted in non-delusion is primarily responsible for experiences of freedom, purified views, clear comprehension, pure understanding, pure knowledge, wisdom, mental perfection, sainthood, holiness, spaciousness, oneness, infiniteness, egolessness, and so on.3. Resultant consciousness: Consciousness that is the fruition of accumulated volitional forces (karma). Although it is comprised of the results of the first two types of consciousness, it is neither unwholesome nor wholesome in itself. Resultant consciousness can be sub-classified as: Five sense types: Eye consciousness (responsible for seeing an object), ear consciousness (responsible for hearing an object), nose consciousness (responsible for smelling an object), tongue consciousness (responsible for tasting an object), and body consciousness (responsible for touching an object).Receiving: Immediately following sense consciousness, an object is apprehended due to this type of consciousness. For example, once eye consciousness senses an external visual object, the object cannot actually be seen unless it is mentally received by receiving consciousness.Investigating: Immediately following receiving consciousness, an apprehended object is investigated or examined by this type of consciousness.Registering: Immediately after all the types of consciousness we have mentioned so far have arisen and ceased, this type of consciousness arises and registers the object. It is responsible for creating memories, impressions, volitional formations (accumulated volition that form mental patterns), and so on.Birth and death: These types of consciousness arise at the moments of conception and death, respectively. They are the manifestation of the subconscious, which we will soon discuss. Understanding these two types is necessary for exploring the boundary conditions of human lifespan.4. Functional consciousness: Consciousness that is none of the above (unwholesome, wholesome, or resultant) is functional. It performs the activity of enabling, referring, or determining an object. However, it is not potent enough by itself to generate an experience. Functional consciousness can be sub-classified as: Sense-enabling: This consciousness precedes the five types of sense consciousness. It is the first one to arise in any experience or cognitive process related to seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching. By its arousal, it enables the functioning of the five sense consciousnesses so that an experience can occur. An eye can sense a visual object because this type of consciousness refers eye consciousness to a visual object. Without its arousal, none of the five sense consciousnesses would know what to look for. Using the five material bases (as we have previously discussed) as a meeting place, this consciousness initiates and facilitates interaction between the external world of sense objects and the internal world of senses.Mind-enabling: This consciousness precedes all types of consciousness (collectively known as mind consciousnesses) except the five of sense consciousnesses. It is the first one to arise in any experience or cognitive process related to thinking and knowing. By its arousal, it enables the functioning of mind consciousnesses so that a mental experience such as thinking or knowing can occur. We can think because this type of consciousness refers mind consciousness to mental (non-material) objects, such as thoughts, memories, and impressions. Without its arousal, mind consciousnesses would not know what to look for. Using the sixth material base (previously discussed, see page 000) as a meeting place, this consciousness initiates and facilitates interaction between the internal world and the sub-internal world, which we shall discuss momentarily (see figure 8.1).Determining type: Immediately after the investigating consciousness, this type of consciousness arises and determines and categorizes the object. It is responsible for concluding the discrimination phase of the cognitive process. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a very interesting question. We can broadly classify the Consciousness (let us refer it as C) into two. Manifest and Un-manifest. From the Manifest we have one Supreme Consciousness that in turn manifests as millions of Consciousness as part of the Creation. There is individual C and the collective C. Of the Collective there is C of Humans and C for every animal species, reptiles, plants and trees, marine life, Stones, Mountains, lakes, rivers and so on. Everything exists in harmony. There is Universal C, Global C etc. When it comes to Humans at the individual level, we have C that is of our being, C of the body. For instance it is the Body C that takes care of its functions without us mentally or consciously involving. There are Cs of Religions, Casts and groups. There are also higher levels of Cs, Krishna C, Rama C, Jesus C and so on. At the end it is the Universal C that has manifested as those millions. When we become enlightened, we get connected with the higher C and we get connected to all other Cs and can communicate and command the creation. That is how Lord Krishna, Rama, Jesus and other divine beings do miracles. Higher the Consciousness higher is the compassion for everything that is, and the Compassion itself can create miracles. ",
