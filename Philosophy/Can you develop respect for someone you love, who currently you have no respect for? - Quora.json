            "answer_text": "Yes. You can respect them as a human, who thinks and feels and has insecurities and talents, and is worthy at the very least of being allowed to keep his or her dignity. I spent much of my life at odds with my own father; he has many issues that make him unhealthy for me to spend much time around. There was even a time when I claimed that I hated him. But when he was hurt badly in a car accident, my heart softened toward him. I was suddenly reminded that he feels pain, too, that many of his struggles are outside of his control, and that I was missing out on having a relationship with my baby brothers (24 and 26 years younger than me) who will probably need help coping with having him as a father as they get older.

            "answer_text": "Yes! All you have to do is love them. Sounds confusing\u2014right? But it shouldn\u2019t be. What\u2019s confusing is your question. How is it possible to love someone but not respect them? How do you separate respect from love? I suspect that you don\u2019t really love this person at all. Perhaps you just have a crush on them because of their appearance. And perhaps as you\u2019re getting to know them better, you are seeing a lot of things that you don\u2019t like about them. Sorry, buy your infatuation isn\u2019t going to be enough for you to overcome the things that you don\u2019t like about this person. Nor should you allow that to happen. If you can\u2019t respect someone, then you\u2019re never really going to love them. ",
