            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not a complete language. Many Arabs and Muslims think that the Arabic language is complete it comes from two point: May be it\u2019s the only language that they speak.Because many think that it\u2019s the language of God, there\u2019s a lot of sacredness and a fear of being wrong with it. So they think that they must know only this language because it\u2019s the language that God speaks.Arabs teach that Arabic is superior in the uniqueness of its sounds, but that\u2019s not true. Muslims have been taught the idea that Arabic is the divine language, and God only accepts prayer in Arabic. So for ideological reasons, Muslims want to slant the number of Arabic words upwards to 12 million words. They say that you can\u2019t understand the meaning of the Quran if you don\u2019t study the Arabic language. So Quran is for the Arabs and Islam isn\u2019t the message of God to Humanity if we can\u2019t translate it and give it in the different forms of grammars and vocabularies. Isn\u2019t a cultural war against the other cultures? No people in the world will give up their languages and cultures to people who claim carrying the words of God. If God speaks Arabic, so how does he understand the other people from different cultures? Who creates the other languages? Is there a french God who speaks french? An English God who speaks English?\u2026etc. Arabic is the language of God, and he speaks only Arabic. God knows what is within us, what we are telling ourselves. So I talk to myself in English or in french or in Spanish So God doesn't know what I'm telling myself.\ufeff So I can trick God and He can\u2019t know what I\u2019m telling myself. The Arabic language is surround by a huge political sacredness that stop many Muslims from thinking and developing a fear from the sacred. ",

            "answer_text": "Do they speak those other languages to be able to say that? To have a really fair claim you would need to be able to speak all languages of the world. About 6500. Do they speak all of them? Now, I don\u2019t think that most Arabs or Islamic scholars do that, but whoever does it, does it out of ignorance. The Arabic language is beautiful and very expressive. But there are other languages that are that are beautiful and expressive as well. There is nothing like \u201cmost complete language\u201d. Every language on earth is a miracle because it shows what we humans created to interact with each other. And every language has a different nuance. Sounds are different. Words are different. Grammar is different. Complexity is different. Some are more precise and some are less precise. But all languages make the human interaction possible. And that is beautiful. The amount of letters don\u2019t represent the \u201ccompleteness\u201d of language. The Taa language is a click language that some linguists say have as many as 87 consonants to go with 31 vowels, making for by far the worlds largest inventory. And as you are listing the persian letters. What about the \u0636. It exists in the Persian Alphabet but do you have words with it in the Persian language? Having the largest Alphabet is also no sign for a complete language. ",
