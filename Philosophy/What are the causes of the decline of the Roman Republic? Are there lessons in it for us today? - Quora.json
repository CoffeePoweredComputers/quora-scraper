            "answer_text": "What are the causes of the decline of the Roman Republic? Are there lessons in it for us today? Not really, as no society today is like the late Roman republic. I note that one response attributes the decline of the republic to the rise of its generals and the establishment of a professional army. But having a professional army is not in itself a bad thing, and Rome has had ambitious politicians throughout its history. Armies and their commanders didn\u2019t become a key factor until the 3rd century crisis, long after the republic was just a memory. Commanding an army was in effect just a step in the cursus publicus (political career) of the republic. The cause of its decline may have a deeper rooted origin. With the Punic Wars Rome started on a curious course. With the completion of the incorporation of Italia, a different course was adopted for conquered territory: Sicily became in fact the first Roman province outside Italy proper. Provinces needed administration and their governorship was assigned to (usually) ex-commanders. Colonization (the establishment of Roman and Latin colonies, and the settlement of ex-legionaries) did continue, but the overall administration of any province was different from the system employed in Italy. Apart from the obvious opportunities for corruption of a province governorship away from Italy and the public eye, this province system did appear successful, however. Now let\u2019s go back to those army commanders. It\u2019s true that in the 1st century BC several of them did assume dictatorship illegally (because it was supposed to be a temporary command assigned by the senate) and the Marian reforms did result in a professional army. But the latter may actually have been a significant improvement over the earlier militia-type army, which called farmers away from home during campaign season, and was not open to everyone (unlike the Marian army, which allowed everyone in, in return for state-guaranteed pay). While an ambitious commander might indeed use his army command for political gain, the real power rested with the provincial governors. Which is why the First Triumvirate \u2018assigned\u2019 certain provinces to one of their members. And here we also have the key event: control over provinces had become so important that it had become part of \u2018the political game\u2019 - but completely outside control of the senate. That is to say, the senate did assign the governorship, but the senate itself was dominated by factions linked to a powerful individual. So, in short, commanding an army was not the goal, but only the means to personal power. More importantly, it was not the seat of power, which was still the senate. However, once the senate was dominated by ambitious individuals with sufficient ambition, its deciding power was lost. In name it still \u2018took decisions,\u2019 but those decisions had already been \u2018prepared\u2019 beforehand, outside the senate. I mentioned the First Triumvirate. Of the three men involved, only one was commanding an army when civil war broke out. And the reason it did was not that that man, Caesar, was commanding an army, but that the senate refused to prolong his governorship. By that step the republic sealed its own fate. And killing Caesar later did not change that. Because the senate had already lost its power before the First Triumvirate, and before the rise of dictators. It just didn\u2019t realize it. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree that the downfall was the rise of the generals and decline of the ability of the senate to enforce its will. One thing though, that I think is crucial, is the makeup up the legionaries. When the legions were restricted to only allowing land owners and the nobility to serve they were loyal to the senate and the generals could not use these men against the government. These wealthy soldiers were not professional soldiers and did not rely on their generals to take care of them. This system worked until Rome suffered a series of crushing defeats at the hands of migrating Germanic tribes. Rome needed a larger pool of manpower in order to defeat these invading tribes and replace the tens of thousands of soldiers who had already fallen to them. Enter Marius. He opened the legions to every able bodied man in Italy and ended the property restrictions. Now Rome had the first professional army in history. It was made up of trained full time soldiers drawn from the poor and middle class. These men relied on their officers and general for supplies and opportunities for glory and looting. This is when men like Sulla and Caesar began to command large armies that were completely loyal to them and not the senate. When the Legionaries were wealthy landowners they did not need the care of the generals and were loyal to the republic. Once the legions become comprised of professional full time soldiers who are mobilized year round and have no other source of income they become loyal to the man who leads them to victory and wealth and not the Senate. Tie this in with the good ole boys clique the Senate and nobility had become (they were kinda similar to the mafia), the failure and murder of the Gracchi brothers to reform the republic politically in favor of the \u201cplebs\u201d, and the rise of men like Sulla and more importantly Caesar its pretty easy to see how the republic failed. Caesar killed it however, it had been sick for a long time and the illness was self inflicted by the nobility and Senate. ",
