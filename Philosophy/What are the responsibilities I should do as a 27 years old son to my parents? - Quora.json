            "answer_text": "It depends a lot on the relationships you have had with them all along, up until this point. Giving advice on the responsibilities you should assume being a 27 year old is tough without any history, and even hard knowing it. You weren\u2019t born at 27, and you\u2019ve had a long time already adapting to your parents expectations. What have they been ? Have their expectations changed over time, and do you feel confused, or disagree with them at this point being 27 ? There are so many possible factors, such as if you still live with them, or are out of the house ? Are there others in the home you are to be responsible for as well ? Do you want to live at home, and if not, what are the barriers to finding your own independence ? Is you independence an issue for your parents, meaning they don\u2019t want you moving out ? Long way of saying, it is very difficult to respond to \u201cshould\u201d questions without having enough information. Clarifying your goals should provide you with more understanding of your responsibilities, and the course you should be navigating. Your goals at 27 should not be passive, as in what should I do for my parents, as much as how can I best develop myself as a man now. If you can do both, good, but I would focus on being more responsible to yourself. Grow, develop, mature yourself. Bruce Kugler ",

            "answer_text": "If you are still living in your family home you should be assuming responsibilities within it. This could include regular cleaning, laundry, making meals, etc. If these requests have not been made yet, it would mean a lot to your parents if you could offer. Again, making the assumption that you are still living in your family home, it would also be reasonable for you to contribute monies to your parents for room and board. Being twenty-seven, your parents are most likely a little bit older. In all likelihood they are beginning to review their economic position relative to retirement. Huge numbers of couples discover their savings aren\u2019t sufficient to maintain their lifestyle which often leads to a delayed retirement. In all probability, they will very grateful for this. They will appreciate your thoughtfulness. Oh, yes-please love them too! Be available when they are really in need of assistance. For example, if they incur mobility issues, offer to help them get to medical appointments, etc. It will be important for you to be very observant, though, as parents do not generally want to impose on their adult children and do not ask for the help they need. All the very best of luck to you! ",
