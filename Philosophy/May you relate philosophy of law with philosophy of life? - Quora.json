The last of these four is any and all material wealth we have control over, in any and all forms thereof. In law, all four have value. If other persons take any of the four from you, you have the legal right to be justly compensated for that which was taken. Balance. As for \u201c\u201dphilosophy of life,\u201d each of us values these four factors in proportions best suited to ourselves. Our ranking of them provides the scale by which each of us determines their relative importance, and from that determines our actions day by day, year by year, and so on. Balance. Chris Schneider ",
