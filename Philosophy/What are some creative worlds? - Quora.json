            "answer_text": "A world without rules, but guidelines. Think of Pokemon andTwilight They\u2019re not creative because of the story. They\u2019re creative because they inspired others to create, just like them following their guidelines and turning the story into their own. I can\u2019t even count the many spinoffs Pokemon games or fan-made web-comics that pokemon has inspired. They follow Pokemon set of guidelines even though the people at Nintendo has never verbally setout any. The creator of Twilight inspired a handful of authors as well as giving them success by opening up an audience towards them. The vampire diaries, in my opinion, took the most out of the Twilight audience. Creative world inspire others create just like them. ",
