            "answer_text": "Enlightenment is just maximised brain energy efficiency with no right brain anxiety based desire and an ability to control instinctual desire, I did not in fact desire enlightenment what I wanted was an cure for my anxiety. I did not even know what enlightenment was I just got it by accident the first time, I enjoyed the inner-happiness so much I worked to find a way to restore it to full power. The result is EGMi the scientific path to enlightenment and an end to all human made suffering and bad desire, but it seems when you offer the real thing most humans run a mile they have FOMO fear of being out of the cycle.
