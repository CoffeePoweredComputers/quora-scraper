            "answer_text": "Well, certain political entities did completely expose their various agendas, so that\u2019s a good thing. They also indicated they are (thankfully) incompetent, so there\u2019s that. I\u2019ll be glad when November is over since I\u2019m pretty sure this year from March through today has been all about getting rid of Trump and/or non-RINO U.S. Republican party members. January and February 2020 were pretty good, and after November the remainder of the year should let us know what 2021 will be like. I think it will be a great year compared to 2020, but who knows. I invested in the stock market recently based on a tip I received from AOC. She tried to have a company investigated. Thus, anything a communist does not like is probably a sure thing to succeed. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. It can be a good year for you individually, even if it was a bad year in other ways for other people. For me, 2020 was OK. I didn\u2019t buy into the coronavirus panic, plus I\u2019m a \u201cprepper\u201d so I was already ready for the shortages. I lost some income due to the government\u2019s misguided shutdowns, but I\u2019m not starving. People I know caught Covid-19 and recovered just fine. Someone in my household has the virus right now, so I have been marinating in the virus for a week now. Even so, not a bad year. This year has certainly been better for me than 2015 was (my older daughter was killed in a car wreck that year), and no one would feel guilty about saying 2015 was a good year for them personally, even though it wasn\u2019t good for me. Your experience of the year is subjective. Don\u2019t feel bad if 2020 was a good year for you. Be glad about it. ",
