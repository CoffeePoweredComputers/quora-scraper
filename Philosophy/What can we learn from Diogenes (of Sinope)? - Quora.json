People will bullshit each other just to be polite, and bullshit themselves because it's easier than thinking everything through. But, if you take this all the way, you might find yourself living outside and acting like a crazy person.  So um, mind how you go, then. ",

Instead I should strive to live life on my own terms (unless ofcourse this affects other people). I also learnt to detach myself from my possessions before they become a master of me instead of me being a master of them. ",
