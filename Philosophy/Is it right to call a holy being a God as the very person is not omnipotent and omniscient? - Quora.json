            "answer_text": "As a manifestation of cosmic mind every individual is divine, therefore all are God, it is the will of Almighty, his play, his direction that is seen or unseen. Therefore holy scripture considers that mother ,father, Guru, visited as God in human form. They speak the truth. However, one has to be considerate in chosing a Guru or who has to be accepted as a holyman. They should be rich inside their heart with no external accumulation of wealth, they won't decorate their body to claim superiority over others, they will use the body like a horse and have contol over their senses. Bedides all this they will grace and guide you with their own spiritual power. That is why a real Guru is considered higher then God. A real Guru won't impose Maya and play like God does, but he will enlighten your intellect and illumines your heart. A real Satguru can give immortality to those who Surrender and serve him. . ",
