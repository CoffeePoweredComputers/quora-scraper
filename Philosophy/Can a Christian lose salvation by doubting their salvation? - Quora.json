            "answer_text": "One of the clear teachings of the Bible is that we are involved in a wrestling match with spiritual wickedness in high places. Jesus said of the devil \u201cthat he was a liar from the foundation of the world and the truth is not in him\u201d. Satanic entities attack Christians in the area of confidence. Among other deceptive practices they challenge Faith that there really is a GodThat God actually loves usThat God actually loves youThat you have committed \u201cthe unforgivable sin\u201dThat your sins are too bad to receive forgivenessThat unless you \u201cfeel saved\u201d you are not saved,That you can lose your salvationThat you are not one of the electThat you are in the wrong branch of ChristianityThat your baptism is invalidThat you must be perfect before you can go to heavenThat you have desires that cause you to sin over and over again and God is displeasedThings satanic spirits will not tell you, is that they have fed the temptations to you in the first place, told you its all right and then, once they have you where they want you, are the first to begin the anvil chorus of condemnation. What is the cure? Keep short accounts with God. I John says that if we say we have no sin, we are only kidding ourselves, but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. It is simple to pray. We can do it anywhere, anytime. God already loves you, whether you feel worthy or not. We do not confess our sins to \u201cbecome saved again\u201d. We do it to keep our relationship with God uncluttered and free. It is hard to feel the presence of God while we are under the gun for some fault or bad act. When you accept that he removes that guilt as far as the east is from the west, it is easier to find that fellowship of the Spirit again.Identify \u201cbesetting sins\u201d. These are not the one-off things, but things that we seem to go to regularly. The Scripture tells us to \u201cbe not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind, proving what is that good, acceptable and perfect will of God\u201d. Bad habits make us easy targets for the enemy. We are told, \u201cGod may forgive you for an occasional mistake, but you keep doing this over and over and over. How could a holy God possibly accept someone who refuses to change?\u201d What a lie. It is exactly because we have these things that are difficult to change that Jesus died on the cross. If salvation was easy to get just by being a better person, anyone could do it. As it turns out, no one can really measure up on their own. We all need that grace. Still, you will never enjoy the peace of heart and mind you are entitled to as long as those things still dominate your life and mind. Don\u2019t think because you won victory in some area that it won\u2019t come back and challenge you again. After Jesus withstood temptation by Satan, the Bible says the devil departed from him for a season. Do not ever think our enemy is going to give up. He just retreats, regroups, and tries a new avenue. But if you beat it once, you can overcome it again.Remember that God is a \u201cbig boy\u201d. If he has a problem with you, he has sent his Spirit to help you face it. He really doesn\u2019t need a lot of help. Learn to listen to that still small voice. My experience is that he is kinda like Obi-Wan after he was killed, speaking from the Force. Here\u2019s Luke doing the dumbest thing ever and just lucky to still be alive frozen half to death on the galaxies largest Ice Cube, and here comes the voice of Ben telling him that he has to go to the Dagobah system to complete his training, then disappears. One would think old Ben would be telling him what he did wrong, or telling him where to find a can of Sterno or something, but no. Just simple guidance. God is not nearly so upset by our little problems as we are. He already knows we are going to be all right. He might sneak in some wisdom as needed, but never with condemnation.Remember that the day comes when all this is over. Where you are going, there is no sin, no sickness, no temptation, no Satan. Whatever perfecting you have left to go through will be finished at the gate. You will never wonder about it again. This world will pass away and all things will be new.Don\u2019t worry about your doubts. If you care enough to think about it, the foundation is already laid. We have all had them. They are quite normal. I think I had one last week. It didn\u2019t last long. I have been doing this for a while, I am accustomed to the challenge. God allows Satan to have a go at us. Satan means it for evil, but God knows your resistance will cause you to grow in ways that would never happen otherwise. His promise is that you will not undergo more than you can bear. Satan has limits, as we know from the Book of Job, and at the end of the book, Job had more than he had at the beginning. Satan loses, you win, might as well rejoice. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 4 kinds of people: Those who are saved and know they are savedThose who are saved, but who are unsure of their salvation (a proper reading of the scriptures can ultimately assure them)Those who are not saved and know itThose who think they are saved by their good deeds, but who are not in fact saved. These are the ones to whom Jesus says: \u201cDepart from me, I never knew you!\u201dYour question is about group #2, for which the remedy lies in the assurances of scripture. If we are trusting in Jesus\u2019s work on the cross for our redemption, can truthfully attest that He is Lord of our lives, and believe in our hearts that God raised Him from the dead, we will be saved and sealed with the Holy Spirit as a guarantee. It is His work, and our faith in His work that saves us. The proof of His work and our faith together is a changed life, as the books of 1 John and James (among others) suggest. But it\u2019s really the people in groups #3 and #4 that we should be worried about, as there are eternal consequences for them. They too can find answers in scripture for their situations, for God loves us all, and has made a way for each and every one of us to come to Him if we so choose, as I outlined above. The first step towards saving faith is getting to know God by reading what is written in the Bible. In fact, the book of John explicitly states, \u201cThese [acts of Jeaus] are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ [the promised Messiah of the Old Testament], the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Can a Christian lose salvation by doubting their salvation? According to the teachings of all prophets, salvation is based on obedience, repentance, good deeds, and forgiving others - if we forgive people, God will forgive us. No human sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No human bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has also confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Luke 6:35-38, Matthew 19:16\u201319, Matthew 21:43, and Matthew 25:41\u201346 The only exceptions are the distorted teachings of Paul who taught that Jesus death was necessary for forgiveness of sins in 1 Corinthians 15:3, Romans 5:6-10 , Romans 4:25 Paul taught that people can be saved by accepting Jesus as savior in Romans 5:8, Romans 6:23, Romans 10:9, 1 Timothy 2:3,4,6, 1 Timothy 1:15, 2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 Thessalonians 1:10, 1 Thessalonians 5:8,9 Romans 5:10-11, Romans 5:1, 2 Timothy 1:10, Titus 2:13 The teachings of Atonement were taught by Paul in Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:13-14, 1 Corinthians 15:3, Romans 4:25, Galatians 1:4, 1 Corinthians 5:7, Ephesians 5:2, Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:13-14 But Paul was not educated by Jesus and he failed to teach the wise teachings of Jesus When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:10-14 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who did not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teaches that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without a blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teaches that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main prerequisites for salvation In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation But unless you repent, you too will all perish Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u2018For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u2019 That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance \u2018I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019. We can easily see that the only exceptions are the attractive teachings of Paul to make it easy for people so that he wins the competition against the disciples (like the bad politicians who promise many attractive promises to win) The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free \u201cThen you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" John 8:32 How can you validate my claims? The best advice is to ask God to guide us to the truth. The door is open for everyone to experience divine intervention The wise and merciful father keeps his door open for his children God has more wisdom and mercy than any wise merciful father People can communicate with God at any time Prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have urged us to ask God and taught that God answers the prayers of the obedient believer. Example verses are: Psalm 107:28-30, Psalm 18:6, Psalm 145:18, 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 58:9 Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Luke 6:27-28, James 4:2, Qur\u2019an 2:186, Qur\u2019an 40:60 Even if you are agnostic, you should not have a problem accepting a creator for that marvelous universe, pray to that God. Agnostics do not deny the existence of a creator, they do not like the wrong religion teachings and the bad priests who reap the financial gifts in exchange of the alleged spiritual gifts. Do not call any name like the God of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, just pray to the only true God who has created everything. Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. I have spent years wondering about what the purpose of life is. I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. I had some doubts about the teachings of a certain teacher, I have prayed to God to guide me to the truth I saw in a very clear dream that teacher in a form of a criminal prisoner, has committed evil, waiting for his trial. In another dream I saw a wolf hiding after attacking sheep; I understood that message as the bad teacher who try to mislead people by the bad teachings as Jesus explained in Matthew 7:15-20 \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d. I also remembered the Parable of the Weeds in which Jesus warned us about the enemy who insert false teachings into the scripture in Matthew 13:24-43 \u2018an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat\u2019 Pray and ask God to guide you about the teacher who claims that God does not exist; you will see him in a bad image Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who teaches that Jesus is God Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who claims that God tests us in this life and will reward us according to our obedience and good deeds Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who taught original sin, atonement, salvation not based on obedience but taught free salvation by a savior to die for our sins Pray to God to know the truth about the priests who teach that God created them from his mouth to glorify them and created some other casts from his feet to let them serve the Brahmins Pray to God to know the truth about the priests who teach that it is o.k. to worship Vishnu, Shiva, Rama, or Krishna If you see good roads, green views, good food that could be explained as the true path and the spiritual food If you see those priests in bad images, dirty roads, or rotten food those could be indicators about the bad path of the false teachers and their bad fruits (wrong teachings and deeds) You do not have to accept my views; you may check and analyze the mentioned verses You do not have to accept my claims about communication with God; try to establish your own communication You do not have to accept my personal experience; you know how to communicate with God and it will be your own personal experience Again, do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. Isaiah 58:9 \u2018Then you will call, and God will answer, you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Sadly, most professing Christians are going to lose salvation by never having it. Most of what I hear being preached today is what I call \u201csalvation by bluff\u201d. Everyone tries to declare loud and long that they know that they know that they know that they are saved, on the assumption that just saying it will make them saved. A bit of quiet confidence would be a lot more convincing! But even then, a good strong dose of doubt from time to time might be the best thing for all of us.  Closing your eyes, sticking your fingers in your ears and saying, \u201cI\u2019m saved, I\u2019m saved, I\u2019m saved!\u201d doesn\u2019t accomplish anything. It\u2019s as much an attempt to produce your own man-made salvation as anything could be. Let\u2019s stop trying to out-bluff one another and fall humbly before God, begging him for forgiveness, and doing everything we can to convince him that we have faith\u2026 not in our salvation, but faith in Jesus\u2026 the SOURCE of our salvation. By \u201cJesus\u201d, I mean a lot more than a name here too. We need to convince God that we have listened to his Son, and fully embraced what he has taught, and that we are doing all we can to walk in the Light that Jesus has shed on us all through those teachings. You don\u2019t have to perfectly obey Jesus to be saved; but you do need to try to! That is what real faith does\u2026 just naturally. The Most Famous Bible Verse ",

            "answer_text": "Somebody who doubts salvation can\u2019t have it. If you doubt a fact, can you benefit from the fact? No! If you\u2019re a child, and you doubt your father\u2019s ability to reason better than you, can you inherit the blessings that come from trusting him? Certainly not! And then you multiply that to the spiritual level, where salvation is. If you doubt that God has the ability to provide salvation, like Thomas doubted that JEsus Christ had really resurrected, and was living again, or like the other doubting ones in the Bible, you don\u2019t get any rewards of any kind. Therefore, we must trust God, and trust that he as the ability to be our sun and shield (Psalms 84:11) so that we can have a share of his blessings. It Pays to Fear God ",

            "answer_text": "Salvation\u2026 the act of being saved. Christ is the saviour to be but has not yet returned which means nobody is yet saved. Consider what we are being saved from since that offsite is not commonly taught clearly. Here it is in all its glory. Jesus promised that those who will be resurrected from their grave in the first resurrection after the first death will never taste death again. Those who will be raised from their grave in the second resurrection will be thrown into the lake of fire and burned alive. This is the second death and what the believers are to be saved from\u2026 To answer the question. One saved by Christ after his return, Salvation cannot be lost. Until Christ returns, none are yet saved and must work hard to keep the laws of God and bear the testimony of Jesus Christ with all due diligence that they earn the right to eat of the tree of life. This requires that we study the word of God so that we can determine rightly between truth and lie, not being ashamed on the day of judgement. ",

But there's a hidden meaning that many people don't seem to care to look for. to doubt your salvation in Jesus is to doubt what he was teaching which is for to be good. So in this sense you doubt Jesus because you don't believe in his teaching and it is his teaching that give you your salvation which is for all man to be good. So in this instant if you are saying doubting your salvation it would mean that you don't believe in being a good person. ",

Bible verses like 1 John 3:10 tell us that if we don't love other believers we are not children of God but what if you mess up and forgot to repent a sin before death?
