            "answer_text": "Yes. Here, I'm going to define \"rational\" as deliberative, consciously-reasoned thought and non-rational as (often unconscious) heuristic-based thought, which includes modes like \"gut feeling.\" If a person was only capable of one or the other, he'd be in serious trouble. This is obvious when you consider \"simple\" cases. You can't use instinct to write a computer program. If you try to use reason to walk or ride a bike, you'll probably fall over. We evolved both the abilities to act on instinct and reason, and both have strong use cases and downsides, depending on the situation. Reasoning is much more flexible than heuristic thought. For instance, if you have a habit of refusing to answer phone calls from unknown numbers, you will avoid lots of nuisances. But if it's a set-in-stone heuristic, you may also miss calls from your friend who has an unlisted number. In order to say, \"Well, I'll generally not-answer unknown callers, but since my friend tends to call me at around 7pm, I'll make an exception in the evenings,\" you may have to evoke some more deliberative thinking. Certain thoughts are too complex to be instinctual. The more conditional they are (the more if-thens they include), the more that tends to be the case. So the main downside of heuristics is inflexibility. Species that do all or most of their thinking this way tend to thrive as long as their environments remain stable. You can unthinkingly survive by eating grass if there's always going to be grass nearby. The negatives of rational thought are (a) it's much more costly, (b) it's much slower, (c) it can crash when fed insufficient or contradictory information. If we had to rely on reasoning when running from a predator (or trying to catch a football), we'd be in trouble. Let's look at a simple example: say you like drinking Coke with your lunch, and there's a drugstore across the street from where you work. But every time you go there, they're out of Coke. You can't know for sure whether that will be the case without going inside and checking (and the coke is shelved way in the back). But on any given day, there's unlikely to be Coke there. Three blocks away, there's another store that is almost always well stocked. It's a pain to walk there, but if it's the only place nearby to get Coke, it's worth it to you. Given that the last 16 times you've been to the nearer store they've been out of Coke, what's the best strategy? 1. Simply assume they'll be no Coke there and walk the three blocks? 2. Begin with the assumption that there may or may not be Coke in the nearer store, go inside, walk to the back, check, buy Coke if it's stocked, or leave and walk to the farther store if it isn't? Let's say you could run one of those two strategies as a program in your head. Which would you choose? Which would be most costly? Which is most flexible? Which might wind up with some false negatives? If there are false negatives, is that acceptable or not? It's interesting to tweak the above scenario and make a cost-benefit analysis of whether to go with they simpler program or the more complicated one. Maybe given that we're only talking about three blocks, we might as well run the first program. But what if the farther store were ten blocks away? What if that was true but he closer one only had coke 10% of the time? What about 1% of the time? Above, I noted that heuristic-based thought is more efficient when the environment rarely changes. If 99% of the time, there was no Coke in the nearer store, you'd be best off totally forgetting about it and just \"running a program\" that would, without deliberation, guide you to the farther store. But what if there was a 50% chance of Coke being in the nearer store. What if, 40% of the time, the further store was out of stock? Heuristics are cost-effective when they're simple. When they bulk down with tons of if-thens, they run slower and slower. At some point, it's cheaper to simply switch to conscious thought. I'll note that I'm an overly-rational thinker. Given the way I've defined \"rationality\" here, I hope you don't think I'm bragging. I don't mean I'm especially smart or logical. I mean I tend to consciously deliberate very, very often. I have some friends who are more instinctual. And we seem to have the talents and deficits you'd expect. I am often best (when compared to these friends) at making detailed plans and conscious risk assessments. They continually fail to take all kinds of possibilities into account and sometimes suffer as a result. Meanwhile, they are much more functional than I am in emergencies, when immediate action is required. I get caught like a deer in the headlights. If I'm not given time to think, I often fail. (I have no talent for sports or dancing. I'm good at logic puzzles.) Also, I get into situations where I literally can't make a decision. If the steak and salmon sound equally good to me (or equally bad), I go into a loop. Or I have to flip a coin. My friends can more more easily and quickly break the tie with an instinctual bias. (Heuristic: all things being equal, go with steak.) I am, of course, speaking of degrees. If I were totally unable to rely on instinct and they were totally unable to rationalize, we'd all be in serious trouble. If you're interested in learning more about these two sorts of thinking, how they evolved, what they're good (and bad) at, when we tend to use one or the other, and how they affect our lives, I recommend these books: Amazon.com: Thinking, Fast and Slow eBook: Daniel Kahneman: Books Amazon.com: Moral Tribes: Emotion, Reason, and the Gap Between Us and Them eBook: Joshua Greene: Books The first is about how rationality and instinct affect our general thinking. The second is about how these two modes of though affect our ethics. ",

You eat only salmon to get omega-3s Tim Ferriss style. You end up: Contributing to overfishingDeficient in other nutrientsNot being able to eat out with your friendsGetting nicknamed Fishy TimIn other words: the consequences of one decision make an impact on other parts of your life. Whether you consider the consequences harmful is largely* subjective and value dependent. If you don\u2019t care about the environment, you will not say you ate salmon to excess.If you don\u2019t have friends not being able to eat out with them is not a concern.If you consider your new nickname funny rather than a reputation harm.2/ Waste of resources as harm Usually doing more of thing X comes at a cost of doing less of thing Y. It can result in wasting resources. Warning signs of rationality/cost imbalance: You point out other people\u2019s cognitive biases at every occasion. People don\u2019t want to hang out with you.You take three days to decide whether to eat a burrito with soy mince or kidney beans. Probably not the best use of your time.You started a YT channel where you rant about rhetorical fallacies spotted in the Daily Mail. You spend so much time on it that you lose your job.If you observe any of the above or similar symptoms, please consult Eliezer Yudkovsky. Can you be excessively rational? By definition an excess (of anything) is not good. But, it\u2019s often not the excess of the original thing that harms you, but the externalities. If you spent 100 days using rational methods to pick the most optimal burrito, and die of hunger in the process, it\u2019s not the excessive rationality that killed you, but the hunger (or, more precisely heart attack or cardiac arrhythmia.) Rationality is a way of thinking. Use it with caution, because it\u2019s costly. Which is probably why humans developed, and often rely on intuitions, but before I go on to talk about System 1 & System 2 again, let\u2019s end this answer with an image of a salmon.  *Except for the objective health nutrition damage.  More attempts at rationality on my end: Why are some people more rational and others more emotional?How can I become more rational?What causes people to become angry rather than calmly and rationally considering a concept?",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It is possible to assume that only rational thoughts are valid, and that anything which is irrational is invalid and unimportant. Such assumptions would lead the excessively rational individual to be socially blind, and to dismiss the extremely powerful effects of emotion and identity on human behavior. Likewise, such assumptions would lead the excessively rational individual to be financially blind, and unable to understand or function in a market economy, wherein pricing and value operate based on perception. Human behavior is fundamentally irrational, as it is motivated primarily by emotions and not logic. We are driven to seek the things we desire, and avoid the things we fear. Excessive emphasis on rationality and logic leads to an individual being unable to understand or function in human society. It also leads those individuals, on Quora, to assume that their experiences are universal, and that everything they have not personally experienced is false. I would say that being excessively rational is extremely common on Quora. ",

They enjoy pointing out other people's short comings in the name of being honest, while feel totally comfortable in their own sense of superiority of pseudo-intelligence. They're often arrogant and obnoxious, and yet very insecure. As a result of this insecurity, they parade around with their \"intellect\" just can't wait to showoff their power of logical thinking for other people to see. They put people down. They considered compassion and empathy as stupid and childish. They look down on people who express their emotion freely.  Overall, when someone tell me \"I'm a very rational person\", I tent to avoid them at all cost. Seriously, go tell some other people how smart you are. ",
