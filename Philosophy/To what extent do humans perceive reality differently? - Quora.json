            "answer_text": "Each human perceives reality differently, period. Some people even question existence. In other words, perception is 100% a subjective process for everyone. Your blue is not my blue. Your chicken sandwich is not my chicken sandwich. Going one step further, based on human biology and how procreation works, there has never been an exact copy of you, ever. Even zygomatic twins diverge in the womb and are different from birth on. In all of creation, you are unique. This even works with reincarnation, since no one ever comes back exactly as they left. Good luck with exploring this topic. If you dig deep enough, we should hear from you again around 2050 or so. ",

            "answer_text": "If by differently you mean in a different way than animals think, then it would probably be due to the ability to reason and to recall momories for comparison with new experiences. We are all animals. While some people choose to be offended by this, it's an observable and demonstrable fact. However, we also have a varying capacity for higher reasoning, which makes us somewhat different from other animals. This varies from person to person. Some never truly migrate or grow their minds beyond the threshold of bestial nature. They remain mired in our primordial collective state of ignorance and the inability to truly improve, which is the mark of the beast. Others have an inherent awareness of their own and other's tendency towards regression to the lower state of thinking, and are repulsed by it. Their mode of thinking, their attitude, is expansive and knowledge seeking. They struggle with their weaknesses and lack of knowledge, and thereby become more worthy of the name of true mankind, which is against the negative forces of ignorance and blind belief in the unbelievable. The ability to improve both him or her self, and therefore the condition of mankind and the world as a whole, is what marks true human nature as different from other forms. It is the potential for true goodness, and the leaving behind of base and destructive tendencies and attachments. While it's true that maintaining this course of forward looking improvement is more difficult than falling back into base behaviour, true humans will tend to gravitate back to solid ground when things become disordered. This is unlike the former type of being that constantly reverts to primitive thought and action and ignores the harm done to themselves and to others by doing so. ",
