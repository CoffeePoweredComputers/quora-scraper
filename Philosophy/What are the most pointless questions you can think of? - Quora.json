            "answer_text": "This really depends on what you would consider as \u2018pointless\u2019. Now, think about that word before you answer. As a matter of fact, I really don\u2019t believe there are really any pointless questions. If it is even classified as a question and is given an answer, it automatically has a purpose. The question had a purpose of being answered, and that\u2019s enough point to be not considered pointless. If a question is a question, then it would logically be there to find an answer. Questions themselves have more purpose than we realize. No matter how you put it, questions have a point either way. To us, questions are something you need in order to get an answer. There are no answers without questions. If you think about, answers aren\u2019t technically answers if there is no question. They are simply just statements if there is no question. When we put questions into the mix, that statement (given to answer that specific question) is automatically considered a question. You can\u2019t place down a question and it will be utterly useless. There is a reason that specific question is being asked. There are literally no pointless questions in the universe. As a matter of fact, nothing in the entire world is pointless. Everything leads to something. There is no everything without something. You can\u2019t have everything if you don\u2019t have at least one thing. That one thing could even be considered something too. Look more into it guys, everything eventually, one way or another, leads to another thing. Even something as small as an atom has a purpose. Eventually, that atom will combine with other atoms to make, well, something! Questions are basically asking for an answer. That itself can be considered a purpose. Even this question isn\u2019t pointless. The fact that there are answers make it not pointless. Everything has a point, and that doesn\u2019t exclude questions. ",
