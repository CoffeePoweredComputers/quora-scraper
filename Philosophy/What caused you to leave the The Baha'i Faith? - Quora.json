            "answer_text": "I hope this doesn\u2019t get to be too long, but I was a Bahai for more than 40 years before I withdrew from the Baha\u2019i faith in March 2019. I was a seeker of religion from the time I was 12 years old when upon taking communion for the first time at a Methodist church. While I was kneeling I gazed at a stained-glass figure of Christ. As I took the wafer and juice, I heard a voice that said \u201cI am not in the Church.\u201c Although after this incident I didn\u2019t search actively for an alternative to Christianity, I was aware that there were many issues within what I had witnessed within that small Southern church. I began to I visit different services and even wanted to attend a Jewish synagogue! Later, as a teenager within a household that had long been headed toward divorce, I retreated to the local library and read books on religion, witchcraft, astrology and metaphysical subjects. Then in the summer of 1973, I heard the soaringly beautiful music of Seals and Crofts. After buying a couple of albums, I discovered that their music included lyrics and concepts taken from the Baha\u2019i writings. I rushed back to the library to search for Baha\u2019i. It wasn\u2019t long before I found some old copies of Baha\u2019i books including This Earth One Country by JB Esslemont, and another one titled the Baha\u2019i World Faith, both of which helped to satisfy an 18-year-old\u2019s curiosity about the basis of Baha\u2019i teachings. Within a few months of my investigation, I called the local Baha\u2019i Center and attended my first meeting. I was very nervous because I thought perhaps it was a cult, and that I might see people smoking water pipes or other strange things. However, everything I heard and experienced that first time seemed to fit my every need at that time in my young life. Two weeks later, I signed a declaration card on August 26, 1973. Since my parents were in the middle of a divorce, they simply didn\u2019t have time or the emotional energy to try to talk to me about my decision, and I began hanging out almost exclusively with other young Baha\u2019is, teaching the Baha\u2019i faith, and spending almost my every waking moment either reading, studying, praying or listening to the music of Seals and Crofts. Not long after, I began to date a talented Baha\u2019i musician who was also the nephew of the producer of Seals and Crofts. We married two years later, almost immediately had a child, and moved to another town. In the ensuing years, although the local community where I started my life as a Baha\u2019i had been a warm cocoon to help me heal after my parents divorce, subsequent years with Baha\u2019is and the larger Baha\u2019i community became more and more disillusioning, My disappointment was especially strong when in 1982, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha\u2019is of the United States disbanded the local assembly where I had declared. I felt strongly that the individuals within that Assembly had been unjustly wronged and their families practically destroyed. This began a couple of decades of trying to right the wrongs that I had seen done to that previous community, as well as for me to become the \u201cbest Baha\u2019i\u201d I could be, serving on local assemblies, coordinating teaching efforts, co-sponsoring a performing arts youth workshop, and other activities. Yet in my heart I knew that something was rotten at the core of the Baha\u2019i faith. I saw it becoming more and more political, more emphasis being placed on wealth and power, as well as a vast difference in the approach of the national administration in the years leading up to 2000, as compared to the 1970s. I begin to withdraw from active life more and more and finally in 2011 was accosted by a couple of individuals who suddenly visited my home from the community where I had declared. I was in total shock at the revelation from these people from that Assembly. They had never asked to meet with me in over 20 years time, and yet declared that there had been \u201cproblems\u201d with me for years - that individual Baha\u2019is and even other institutions had asked that Assembly to place sanctions on my behaviors. There were so many parts of this final blow to my belief that were wrong on so many levels, but the biggest flaw was the fact that a Baha\u2019i governing body had decided to hold onto my many so-called wrongs for decades before ever contacting me either in writing, by a phone call or in person. There was no ability to discuss, to present the facts or even to know who my accusers were- just to be read a laundry list of restrictions to my personal and religious life! After that fateful weekend, it took almost a decade for me to decide to officially withdraw my belief in the Baha\u2019i faith, but I finally did, and I now feel so much better! I am now a student of metaphysical teachings and pagan beliefs, and host a monthly women\u2019s Moon Circle. I feel much more my true self, and do not miss any of the restrictions, the judgments and imperious behaviors of many within the Bahai Faith and _ especially_its tragically flawed so-called administration. I\u2019m very thankful for the opportunity to be able to share a portion of my experience on this forum. Thank you!! ",

            "answer_text": "Baha'i faith is the second name of the word 'Hypocrisy'. What they teach is absolutely something that their central figures never followed. It is a cult. Some Baha'is who left this cult had to undergo deprogramming therapy. Baha\u2019u\u2019llah was an opportunist Sufi Muslim who hijacked the Babi religion to create his own religion. Following are some points, that were discovered about him: 1. He doesn\u2019t compare well with Jesus a. He claimed to be a supreme manifestation of God but his life shows none of the qualities that made Jesus who He was: no miracles, no healings, no love, no gentle compassion, no life sacrifice. b. Biblical prophecies cited are either vague or inaccurately interpreted. 2. His family was a mess! a. He was a polygamist with four wives (don\u2019t forget Jamaliyya, the one he married in his old age) b. He had at least six children die in early childhood (WWJD? Heal them?) c. He abandoned his family in Baghdad and his son died because of no medical care (ie: neglect) d. His sons couldn\u2019t get along well enough to fulfill his covenant e. His descendants were thrown out of the main sect of the religion (excessive family disunity) 3. His writings are questionable a. There are many talented speakers and writers who could produce similar books (Joseph Smith, for example, with his \u201cBook of Mormon\u201d \u2013 or Mary Baker Eddy with her \u201cScience and Health with Key to the Scriptures\u201d and many other writings; the idea that only Baha\u2019u\u2019llah could do this is just ludicrous) b. He focused on his own problems calling himself \u201cwounded one\u201d over 170 times c. No gospel of salvation similar to what\u2019s found in the Bible d. Laws \u2013 the legalism of the Baha\u2019i Faith is outstanding. Christ came to set us free from legalism so why should we go back to it? The Bible says: \u201cStand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. . . . you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.\u201d Galatians 5:1,4 \u2026 Excessive legalism is a sign of a false religion. Cults are controlling. e. Hypocrisy \u2013 write one thing and do another; not a good sign f. World government is a bad idea g. Works more important than grace h. Prayerbooks interfere with directly talking to God (ie: prayer) i. Inequality of men and women despite saying otherwise j. He said God was unknowable and denied any relationship to God (first section of Gleanings) k. Some laws are irrational and some cause extreme emotional pain to those trying to follow them l. Threatening people who leave the religion (see the last page of the Kitab-i-Iqan) 4. The cultish religion a. Hypocrisy & members in denial about that b. Marketing strategies c. Exclusion methods are cultish d. Difficulty with withdrawal e. Overemphasis on administration f. Deceptive numbers \u2026 membership statistics g. Spy tactics h. Requests for money i. Attempts to make other religions fit the Baha\u2019i paradigm j. Information control (publishing) k. Information control (re: covenant breaking) l. Excessive paranoia about \u201cprotection of the Faith\u201d m. Treating members like they\u2019re not able to make up their own minds n. Little teaching about spiritual concepts (Baha\u2019i life is mostly admin work) o. Possibly fixed elections since admin people stay the same year after year p. Tracking people by number q. Keeping files on members r. The Archives building is a replica of the Parthenon, a temple to a mythological goddess s. No tolerance for dissenting opinions t. Tearing families apart in the name of the Almighty Protection obsession u. Shaming people who make mistakes v. Proselytizing while claiming they don\u2019t proselytize 5. Personal This section is about how the religion affected me. a. No love b. Judgement and accusations c. Caused feelings of inadequacy d. Caused depression e. Exclusion f. Guilt trips g. Failed promises h. Isolation i. Loneliness j. Cognitive dissonance k. I ask myself: \u201cWould a religion that treats me this way be from God?\u201d That\u2019s it for now, from my point of view. You\u2019re welcome to leave a comment here with other issues in case I didn\u2019t touch on what you believe about him. ",
