            "answer_text": "I urge you to not use this answer or approach to answering this question in a graded paper. But in all honesty, what is interesting and significant about old Edmund\u2019s work is not it\u2019s goal or the means with which he intends to achieve it (it bears so much resemblance to Kant\u2019s starting point that you would be forgiven for seeing literally no difference between the usual compacts of Husserl\u2019s phenomenology and Kant\u2019s fundamentals for scientific study. Less accommodating critics would also draw a parallel to Descartes, including his very forced propositions about a \u201chidden organ\u201d that would form the connection between thought and sensory body - Husserl\u2019s mysterious organ simply being more obscured as a device). No, what is interesting about Husserl is his actual writing, his systematic approach to it, and the specific way he achieves his scientific certainty - in terms of what then current science would happily label as either phenomena outside of human thought altogether, or in terms of an altogether internal and psychological approach. Both because it gives you a uniquely informed glimpse into what the scientific community was really struggling with in the 1920s (and, completely incidentally, of course, in the years leading up to the two world wars), as well as introducing you to the concepts that would develop into the hermeneutical method, transcendental logical philosophy and \u201clanguage-philosophy\u201d. \u201cFormation\u201d or \u201cgestalt\u201d psychology, manifestations of conscious thought and it\u2019s significance in shaping conceptions later is also practically speaking squeezed directly out of Husserl\u2019s work, down to the rather questionable implications when it comes to the mathematical invincibility of teaching and indoctrination. And, in light of when Husserl lived, the success of his analysis specifically, and how it came to be proven utterly correct in a more global context, is therefore as fascinating as it is gut-wrenchingly terrifying. Science-philosophers would therefore do well to read Husserl - that is, his actual writing - critically, as a letter to the future, about not just why your good ideas and sound thinking can be deterministically categorized. But also why your sound and truly genial thoughts that cannot be categorized as such can be safely ignored and forgotten; for they cannot be understood logically in proper, structured study. I have a friend who fondly loves Edmund Husserl, and calls him \u201cGood old Edmund!\u201d. Because Edmund chose a style to reason and argue that very much agrees with his mathematical mind, and it\u2019s power to champion reasonable thought in the chaos of the sea of unstructured thought that, by mass, dominate every brain. The parallel to formation of public conceptions is of course there and ever present - only logic and formation of conceptions can be significant, as we dismiss emotional outbursts and unreliable sensory insistence. But when I think of Edmund\u2019s work, I think of him as just \u201cOld Edmund\u201d, the demon on your shoulder, or the old devil \u2014 because of his terrifyingly accurate analysis of how most, if not all, of the human brain can very successfully be replaced with a thinking machine, as far as it\u2019s connection to the outer world and other minds are concerned: there is simply no room to quantify anything that is not already chosen to be formative in Husserl\u2019s analysis. And if you believe in his analysis, and so wonderfully easy it is to accept it, then you must also accept how all non-scientific thought - and thought that cannot be specifically categorised as such - simply is not significant; it can safely be disposed of, forcefully if necessary, and then forgotten.

            "answer_text": "Husserl and Phenomenology Edmund Husserl was the founder of phenomenology, a philosophical method seeking certainty. His most illustrious student was Martin Heidegger, who took Husserl\u2019s method into the realm of existentialism. Heidegger called his philosophy a \u201cfundamental ontology\u201d and began with an examination of \u201cDasein\u201d\u2014our Being-in-the-World. Unlike Husserl, however, he rejects \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cconsciousness.\u201d But Dasein has an identity crisis. It wants to know \u201cwho\u201d it is. So, too, Heidegger\u2019s own identity has proved to be very controversial. Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938) was the founder of phenomenology. Phenomenology was a new version of Cartesianism, carving out the special realm of consciousness or \u201csubjectivity.\u201d Phenomenology is the examination of consciousness. It might be defined as \u201cthe study of the essential (or \u2018intentional\u2019) structures of experience.\u201d Intentionality means that consciousness is about something. Husserl himself was a mathematician who was primarily interested in the nature of necessary truth rather than the problems of life. Philosophy, according to Husserl, seeks certainty, as Descartes did, not empirical facts, as in natural science. Husserl sought an \u201cArchimedean point\u201d from which to establish such a foundation for all knowledge. (Husserl\u2019s enduring interest is always focused on the \u201cnecessity\u201d of mathematical truths.) Husserl\u2019s \u201cArchimedean point,\u201d the foundation of all knowledge, was the transcendental Ego. But Husserl\u2019s phenomenology provided the method for the existentialist investigation of the self, first in the philosophy of Husserl\u2019s prize student, Martin Heidegger, then in the work of the French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre. Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976) was a student of Husserl\u2019s, but he was formerly a student of theology and more concerned with the deep questions of human existence than the more abstract questions that fascinated his teacher. (Heidegger later commented that the purpose of philosophy was to \u201cinvent a new God.\u201d) Heidegger\u2019s early work is often referred to as \u201cexistentialist,\u201d although he himself rejected that affiliation. Being and Time was his first work which contains existentialist themes. The central question of Heidegger\u2019s philosophy was the \u201cquestion of being.\u201d This must be distinguished from more particular \u201contic\u201d queries about the nature of beings, or entities. \u201cOntology\u201d (or \u201cfundamental ontology\u201d) was his effort to understand the nature of Being as such. Being is to be understood from a phenomenological point of view. Being has clear religious overtones\u2014that we are essentially ontological creatures, which means, in Heidegger\u2019s view, that we necessarily query the world about our own existence and identity. For the being that queries the world, the being that each of us is, is what Heidegger calls \u201cDasein\u201d or \u201cbeing there.\u201d The quest for Being first of all requires an understanding of \u201cthat being through whom the question of Being comes into being,\u201d in other word, Dasein. Now, looking at Dasein from a phenomenological point of view, it is first of all Being-in-the-World. Unlike Husserl and Descartes, Heidegger says our primordial experience is a unified experience of being in the world. But Heidegger would not describe us in the more naturalistic terms of \u201chuman being,\u201d because from the innocence of the first-person view, the question of what we are in nature remains to be determined. He does not talk about consciousness or subjectivity. Being and Tome is largely devoted to the phenomenological description of what it is to be a Dasein. Now, Although Heidegger believed that fundamental ontology was only possible as phenomenology, he rejects Husserl\u2019s emphasis on consciousness and the Transcendental Ego; Heidegger sketches out the essential \u201cexistential\u201d features of Dasein. Because Dasein is essentially \u201contological,\u201d it is, by its very nature, self-questioning: 1) On the one hand, the idea that we are essentially questioning creatures is common to almost all philosophers, culminating in Descartes. 2) On the other hand, Heidegger refuses to talk about this questioning in terms of consciousness and subjectivity, as Descartes and Husserl did. Consequently, Dasein has an identity crisis. It wants to know\u201dwho\u201d it is. What we think of as our identity is a false one. One of the most vitriolic recent controversies in philosophy involves the question, \u201cWho was Heidegger?\u201d Sure, Heidegger associated himself briefly with National Socialism (1933\u201334), when he served as Rector of Freiburg University under Adolf Hitler, and was responsible for the firing of Zionist-Jewish academicians, and gave some well-documented pro-National Socialism speeches. Heidegger never repudiated National Socialism but only he bemoaned its failure. Those naive academics who themselves bemoaned Heidegger for being unable to reconcile his life to his philosophy are rash in their value judgment when we consider Nietzsche\u2019s suggestion to understand a philosophy, we must understand the philosopher\u2014only then does a full picture emerge. Heidegger so rightly denies that he is doing \u201cethics\u201d in his \u201cfundamental ontology,\u201d as it is so obvious that his philosophical views are entirely separable from his personal and political commitments. Although still difficult, the best exposition of Husserl\u2019s phenomenological \u201cmethod\u201d is Edmund Husserl\u2019s Paris Lectures, in Solmon, Phenomenology and Existentialism. These were written as Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology, For the very courageous, try Heidegger, Being and Time, translated by Joan Stambaugh. ",
