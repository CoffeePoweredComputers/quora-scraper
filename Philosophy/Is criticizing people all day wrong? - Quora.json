            "answer_text": "Normally and it hurts to find out that WHEN YOU POINT YOUR FINGER on others\u2019 problems, issues, ways, how they do it - etc. that THOSE ARE YOUR PROBLEMS JUST THE SAME! :)      When i did tell a friend of mine to do this and that - she broke up with me. And she was right. It took me years to find out that EACH PERSON HAS HIS/HER OWN WAY TO LIVE HIS/HER LIFE. The name is PERCEPTION. Only you see things the way YOU SEE THEM - hear them - feel them - inner-over- and understand them\u2026 Nobody tastes the way or smells the way you do - just you. All these different ways of perception are enriching. Therefore why criticizing people? Why can\u2019t we exchange that knowledge? My dad used to say this:  If you have NO idea how it feels, when you speak ill of others: turn the situation around: HOW WOULD I FEEL IF the other person spoke/criticized etc. about me? There you go - that is humane - you do not need to do that - but never ask yourself then - why you are alone\u2026 When i had a poetry album - my dad wrote in it: He who speaks ill of others to you, believe me, he will speak ill of you to others, too. He was right. Therefore, live your life first; you have no idea what others face/d. Be gentle, kind, helpful and polite. Love is not a feeling - it is an energy and we should be in it - the other energy is used to split us - to divide us. The dark energy is not helpful AT ALL. Sure - the more you learn to know about these energies, you will know how they are used\u2026 And still - in the end it is yours - not ours - YOU ALONE decide upon your life. I have decided to go on - not to stand still. And, in my opinion, criticizing others is a stagnation\u2026 Not theirs - mine.         Now you have got an insight, how you might or won\u2019t develop further\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give out a compromise answer to this since i\u2019m too tired to think about it. Short answer: Yes. Well, Focusing on other people\u2019s mistakes is just too inefficient of thing to do due to the fact that people make tons of mistakes and criticizing them would just make them feel \u201cterrible\u201d, Pointing out that people WILL remember how you made them feel, So be sure to always make people feel comfortable around you if you don\u2019t want them staying away from you. Apart from driving people far from you, You\u2019ll waste too much time, and Mental capacity getting tired over nothing. not to mention, Forgetting analyzing your own problems& mistakes which will completely sabotage your progress in life which will just make you dead before actually dying, and slowly lead you to your misery in life.
