            "answer_text": "The world is unbalanced between known, and not known.This is unacceptable.It takes constant effort with balancing to bring them into balance.My earlier life was so based on trauma, family dysfunction, ethnic persecution, and loss caused by governments, that I was almost like a feral child. That created a lack of emotional connections, and inability to focus on self-interest. The outward confidence was all bravado. Eventually, decisions based on isolation, created abrasiveness, unhappiness, disaster. Complete disaster was averted in the nick of time by learning-using a few realities more fundamental than my personal perspectives. They are described in the Nichiren Buddhism, as taught by the Soka Gakkai Interntaional. -Life is better when you pay attention. -You are unique, as is every other being. -You are an aspect of everything, as is every other being. _Causes produce effects. -Lives change, yet Life persists. -Your path, no matter how similar it may seem on the surface, will never be exactly what anyone else\u2019s will be, is, or has been. Beyond that, you can shine with brilliance in your chosen environment. It's not as hard as it seems, if you are willing to learn what everybody already knows in bits, and pieces. You can use it, in a compact form to infuse your life with wisdom, and awareness. You become more effective, and make better use of your innate abilities. How? Base yourself on what is true for anyone, anywhere, anytime, under any circumstances. Then, your personal set of responses will be consistent with reality. There will be fewer collisions. The bedrock of reality is a set of simple to explain, yet difficult to accept realities. They are simple because that is the nature of fundamentals. They are hard to accept because they bypass, and challenge, so many assumptions to which we are habituated. This is a condensed description -Pay attention. Respect. Be equal to. Nam -You are an aspect of everything, and so is every other being. Myo -You are unique, and so is every other being. Ho -Causes produce effects, for all of us. You can wake up from mistaken views at any time. Renge -Lives change, Yet, Life goes on. Kyo Those who keep these simple realities in mind, simultaneously, will have fewer accidents, and be able to develop better lives. These consistently real truths are intuitively obvious, yet we often forget one, or more, when we react. Our emotional past, and the inherited tendencies from our ancestors get in the way of currently practical, rational thought. We can protect our good sense when we make efforts to infuse these fundamentals into our lives. The infusion is easier when the basic reality is packaged conveniently into six words. (Nam Myoho Renge Kyo). They are spoken in the language of the founder, Nichiren of thirteenth century Japan. They are repeated as much as necessary to remind the inner child.

            "answer_text": "There are two that have been salient in my life Life has meaning. To say that life is meaningless implies that you have a reason for saying that life is meaningless, thus it is contradictory to state that life is meaningless. When you live your life as if everything had a purpose (i.e teleologically) your life will be much better at every level of analysis than one with a nihilistic orientationTruth. If you claim that there is no objective truth you contradict yourself by propounding a claim that is expected to be recognized as objectively true. Thus objective truth exists and when you live your life according to what is true you keep from drifting into the domain of chaos and destroying yourself and everything around you",
