            "answer_text": "Locke believed in Natural Law, though he is sometimes confused with Hobbes, who taught natural rights. But Locke said that rights stem from law. Locke was a Liberal, who thought that people were naturally good, but time proved otherwise. Later he saw that human rights were under constant stress. I think that Locke demonstrates the conversion from liberalism to reality -because conservatism sees the world as it is. ",
