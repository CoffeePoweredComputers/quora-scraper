            "answer_text": "Kind of depends on how you think of the word \u201ccreated\u201d. The essential theory proposed by the Standard Model Of Physics is that there is a fixed amount of energy in the universe. No more energy is being created, and none is being lost. However, it is true that the energy we see in the universe in all it\u2019s forms is constantly changing, and that in certain areas entropy (which generally increases) is not increasing. Stars are being formed as we speak in the vast nebulae left over from the debris of massive previous stars that \u201cblew up\u201d\u2026.Went Nova or Supernova. We see this occurring in places like the \u201cEagle Nebula\u201d. These new stars will likely have associated planets, and the possibility that some of those planets will have the conditions necessary to support life. So\u2026 In that regard, you could think of a degree of \u201ccreation\u201d still going on. However, if the universe as a whole is looked at, the total amount of energy remains the same. The universe (according to current thinking) will continue to expand, will continue to become more and more diffuse, and stars, planets and other objects will gradually decay over a period of trillions of years.

            "answer_text": "Yes! Well not literally. It isn\u2019t so much being created but rather on constant transformation. Entire galaxies, stars and planets are still being born and others destroyed. Scientists have been able to observe protoplanetary disks recently which are the \u2018furnaces\u2019 in which solar systems like our own are created. ",
