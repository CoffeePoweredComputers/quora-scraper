            "answer_text": "Platos view of reality, or at least perception, is shown mainly through one of his most famous pieces of work - The Allegory of the Cave. It goes like this: The Cave Imagine a cave, in which there are prisoners. The prisoners are tied to some rocks, their arms and legs are bound and their head is tied so that they cannot look at anything but the cave wall in front of them.These prisoners have been here since birth and have never seen outside of the cave.Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between them is a raised walkway.People outside the cave walk along this walkway carrying things on their head.The Shadows So, imagine that you are one of the prisoners. You cannot look at anything behind or to the side of you \u2013 you must look at the wall in front of you.When people walk along the walkway, you can see shadows of the objects they are carrying cast on to the wall.If you had never seen the real objects ever before, you would believe that the shadows of objects were \u2018real.\u2019The Game Plato suggests that the prisoners would begin a \u2018game\u2019 of guessing which shadow would appear next.If one of the prisoners were to correctly guess, the others would praise him as clever and say that he were a master of nature.The Escape One of the prisoners then escapes from their bindings and leaves the cave.He is shocked at the world he discovers outside the cave and does not believe it can be real.As he becomes used to his new surroundings, he realizes that his former view of reality was wrong.He begins to understand his new world, and sees that the Sun is the source of life and goes on an intellectual journey where he discovers beauty and meaningHe see\u2019s that his former life, and the guessing game they played is useless.The Return The prisoner returns to the cave, to inform the other prisoners of his findings.They do not believe him and threaten to kill him if he tries to set them free.To go further with Plato\u2019s ideas of reality, you have to consider the Theory of the Forms. Luckily, the allegory of the cave already covers most of the points in the Theory of the Forms, so it shouldn\u2019t be too confusing. What we perceive is not reality; all it is, is a world of appearances. The real world is a place of ideas, which Plato names \u2018The Realm of the Forms\u2019. According to Plato, a form is a \u2018perfect idea of something\u2019 (I disagree with the use of the word perfect, as it implies subjectiveness) and every object has a perfect form in the realm of the forms. For example, there are many types of burgers: cheeseburger, veggie burger, chicken burger. All of the burgers we see have in our perception are just reflections of the \u2018perfect\u2019 form of a burger. We will never achieve or create an object to be it\u2019s own perfect form, as the forms are eternal. Plato even said the forms can apply to beauty, love truth and even justice. There are many critiques of Platos Theory of the Forms that I could go in to, but I\u2019ve made this answer long enough already :) ",

            "answer_text": "Plato regarded what we call in modern philosophy Universal (metaphysics) - Wikipedia to be the most real entities, whereas he regarded specific, determinate particular things (Particular - Wikipedia) to be merely objects (or shadows) which by their virtue of participating in universals got their characteristics. For Plato a cup is white because the object, in some weird way, participates in the idea of white which exists in a place which is neither spatial nor temporal \u2014 the realm of ideas. How we have an epistemic access to (that is how can we have knowledge of) this realm is unknown, but Plato thinks we are merely remembering (Anamnesis (philosophy) - Wikipedia) these properties, relations and types. From a modern perspective the whole theory is pretty bizarre, but certainly when Plato lived it made sense. ",
