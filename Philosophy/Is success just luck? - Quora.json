            "answer_text": " Of course it is. All of success is merely luck; being at the right place, at the right time, with the right motivation and the right outlook on life to see the opportunities right in front of you. It is all just a matter of chance. But if we say that is true then every moment can be such a chance. You could be at the right place, at the right time, with the right motivation, but miss all opportunities in front of you because you are not paying attention to the those particular possibilities. Or you could be at the right place and time, with the right motivation and the right outlook, but still miss the opportunity of a lifetime because you had to tie your shoe right when that talent scout would have seen your face. By that logic, every bit of success is chance, and whatever success you have gotten so far was also all through luck and chance. It was luck that got you here to ask this question, luck that made you into the person you are today and luck that you were even born into this world. Just because of chance you are here right now, and you have absolutely no control over any of it. Looking back at your life everything that happened happened exactly the way it should have and could not have happened any other way. The question is: How do you get lucky? If you always stay indoors, if you never go outside your comfort zone, if you never work hard, chances are unlikely you\u2019ll get lucky. If you never give yourself a chance at being lucky, if you do not do what you can, you will probably not get lucky. Of course it is all still luck, but you will be a lot luckier as an actor if you work in L.A. than if you try to make it big in some small town in Iowa. The same way you can absolutely win the lottery, but, if you never play, it becomes a lot harder. The truth is that it is all chance, and, at the same time, it isn\u2019t chance at all. If you go to 1,000 auditions in a year, attend over 10,000 hours worth of acting classes and go to all the possible events then when you make it as an actor, it will not seem like luck. You will probably still have gotten \u201clucky\u201d moments, but you\u2019ve willed more possible lucky situations into being. This is the paradox of success, wherein you have absolutely no control at all and all the control in the world. In the end, the truth is that it is always about only luck. But if you keep looking, if you keep getting into opportunistic situations, and if you keep trying, you will drastically increase your chances. You have faced countless life-changing opportunities that could have made your life a success in a flash, but you were not ready to see that opportunity, and you will miss countless more! But you only need to keep looking, keep going out there and keep working towards it because all it takes is one opportunity at the right place and at the right time to make you succeed. \u201cYou may fail a thousand times, but you only need to succeed once!\u201d - Unknown ",

            "answer_text": "When I first started my current career as a financial adviser I had a different vision of what I wanted to accomplish. Of course I function with a different vision of most things but that\u2019s another story. I wanted to make a good living and build wealth of course. But I also wanted to build a practice that eventually would allow me freedom to live my life strategically helping others. So I set out to build a fee based business in a time when that was new. Veteran brokers encouragingly told me, \u201cYou\u2019ll never survive. You won\u2019t make enough money initially to make it.\u201d And you know, they were almost right. I struggled the first 3 years. I worked long hours, making endless phone call, having innumerable meetings. And my glorious reward? Less than minimum wage. I was a child protegee. Yet, somehow we did survive. After 10 years I was the third highest producing adviser in our office. Shortly after I left to start my own business. One afternoon, one of the newer advisers drifted into my office. He evidently had little going on and figured I must be the same. He needed encouragement so I took the time. He sat down, which is never a good sign the conversation will be brief. He looked beat up and dejected. After discussing his situation he said, \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky. I wish I had your business.\u201d I laughed and replied, \u201cYep, I\u2019m lucky.\u201d Honestly, I couldn\u2019t think of how else to respond constructively. As Lee Trevino, the legendary golfer said, \u201cThe more I practice the luckier I get.\u201d Oh by the way, I\u2019ll take real luck anytime it wants to visit. But darn it, it seems to have lost my address. ",
