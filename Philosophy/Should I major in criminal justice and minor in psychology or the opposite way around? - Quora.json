            "answer_text": "Psychology is a really interesting field where a minor can carry extremely high value. Some really good schools, including Stanford (the #1 school of psychology in the country), will admit students into their PhD program that have a bachelors in a major that is not psychology. The emphasis will be on research, some prerequisite psychology material, experience, etc., but the actual major isn\u2019t a requirement. So what value does that major have? Well, some schools do require the major, some areas (e.g. chemical dependency professional) can be worked in with just the bachelors degree, etc. In general though, I think the combination won\u2019t matter as much either way because the minor in each field will get you most of the main classes in the subject, so there\u2019s definitely no \u201cwrong\u201d decision there. I\u2019d say just take more of whatever grabs your interest the most. ",

Before selecting a major field of study, may I suggest you contact the human resources of numerous police departments, especially in those areas you would like to be employed? Ask them what would be their opinion on a prospective candidate, most likely to be hired. I wish you all the luck in the world, my friend. I hope you have a pleasant Evening. ",
