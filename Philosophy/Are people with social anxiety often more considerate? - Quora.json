            "answer_text": "That's an interesting question that I think about a lot. In my opinion, it\u2019s not that their anxiety makes them more considerate, per se, it\u2019s just that their anxiety makes them overly cautious in social situations, lest they offend, annoy, or hurt someone, or make someone think less of them. This can make anxious people seem very kind and considerate, when in reality, they are simply too afraid to show any negative emotions or act in any disagreeable way. Interestingly enough, I've noticed that since I started on my anxiety medication, I've been speaking everything on my mind more than ever before, which makes it seem like I'm less considerate than before. However, I believe that it\u2019s more a matter of me not caring as much about what others think of me than becoming less kind. Regardless, this is only my opinion and experience. I am in no way a psychologist or an expert. All the best! ",

If you cut in front of me in a line, I'm not gonna say \u201coh you must be in a hurry go ahead\u201d. Im going to be angry and offended. I'm not going to say anything out loud at all about it but in my head I'm going \u201cwhy do you think that it's ok for you to do that?\u201d I won't say anything for fear of that person\u2019s and other people's reactions around me. I'm going to feel the same way a person without anxiety would feel in awkward or bad situations I'm just not going to be vocal about it for fear of others reactions. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, yes. But I've also noticed that it comes at a price. People with SA tend to be considerate because they're quite sensitive to other people's feelings. But sometimes they can be so sensitive that they're too afraid to express their own emotions for fear of offending some one. For some one with SA the experience of somebody's anger can be very overwhelming and downright terrifying. Everyone experiences SA differently, but this is the general stereotype I often see in others as well as myself. ",
