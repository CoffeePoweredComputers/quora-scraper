            "answer_text": "Speak for yourself. Nihilism and postmodern gibberish can cause us to feel no meaning to life. That powerful feeling is a lie. But it takes great effort to overcome it, because media and dumb clueless people who think they are awake, speak in these terms. A saint said environment is stronger than willpower. That suggests that the media we live in is poisonous with half truths and lies about Life. Media is anti religion and that is a big mistake, showing a lack of wisdom, Modern world speaks highly and constantly about smart, smart this smart that, smart decision, smart car.. etc\u2026 but seldom speaks of WISE. Wisdom is the thing not IQ. IQ has no clue about value of life, Listen to Jordan Peterson as very good man, not perfect, but far superior to most in the public eye. He will help you better understand the mess we are in and how to extricate ourselves from the miasma of media and social media. Be well ",

I just can\u2019t be properly happy. It makes me so frustrated. I feel so much pain and I have no clue where it\u2019s coming from and I just want it to go away. ",
