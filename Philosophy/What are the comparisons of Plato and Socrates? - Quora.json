            "answer_text": "Good question - and like a lot of good questions it doesn\u2019t have a good answer. First problem: Did Socrates actually exist? It looks like Socrates may of been just a character for Plato\u2019s mouthpiece. Second problem: We only really know of Socrates through Plato\u2019s writing and Plato didn\u2019t mark those dialogues where he was reporting Socrates and where he was doing his own philosophy. A simplified answer for you which ignores these to problems follows. Socrates used a methodology involving questions and answers - a technique which would leave his questioned person confused. Plato made large reference to a second world of which those things we know of \u201cPartake\u201d or \u201cReflect\u201d the properties of that world (e.g. Something is truthful if and only if is reflects the other world \u201ctruth\u201d). This other world is known as \u201cthe world of forms\u201d. ",
