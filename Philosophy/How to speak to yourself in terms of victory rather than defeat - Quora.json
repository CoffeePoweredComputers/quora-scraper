Many have good experiences. Some suggest that we need to make 3 positive thoughts for 1 negative. That is also a good tactic. If you need some help contact me. ",

            "answer_text": "The simpler answer is to get yourself into the habit of seeing things in a positive light. It\u2019s often not easy but once that habit has been established in your psyche, your whole reality will take on a far brighter appearance. Energy, be it positive or negative cannot be destroyed. It is possible however to transmute the negative energy into positive. For example, instead of experiencing something negative and thinking \u2018why is this happening to me\u2019 or is do or don\u2019t deserve this\u2019, see the experience as a test and think \u2018what is there to learn from this?\u2019 It all begins with self love. Love yourself and it becomes far easier to approach everything else from a place of love. You\u2019ll be surprised at how different everything turns out. ",
