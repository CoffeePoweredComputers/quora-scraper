            "answer_text": "The beginner should start reading Immanuel Kant from the writings of David Hume (ca. 1850). All of Kant\u2019s writing is intended as a response to the radical Skepticism of Hume. Kant said that David Hume \u201cawoke me from my dogmatic slumbers.\u201d With that in mind, all of Kant\u2019s theories fall into place more easily. If you believe you understand David Hume well, then you will have few problems understanding Kant. Kant wrote many books, but he is most famous in Philosophy for his great trilogy, the Critiques, as follows: The Critique of Pure Reason (1780, 675 pages)The Critique of Practical Reason (1785, 290 pages)The Critique of Judgment (1790, 685 pages)The beginner IMHO should not begin with those books. Instead, start with Kant\u2019s short book, Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1780). Very briefly, this book is a foretaste, or perhaps a summary of Kant\u2019s greatest work \u2014 his first Critique. All the new vocabulary and concepts are there. That\u2019s the best place to start. Also, before reading Kant\u2019s second Critique, IMHO should first read Kant\u2019s shorter work, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785). Again, it is a shorter version of the same ideas \u2014 in a way a summary of the longer book. ",
