            "answer_text": "Yes.. that is actually correct. In fact, rather than seeing the past, it'll be like living in the past. If there is an alien world, looking at us from far away, they might be seeing the Earth's civilization still in stone age.The information about every event in history, is carried by light. And light has a finite speed - it takes time to reach places. The light from current-events on the planet, has just left Earth. And it will reach such an alien world in about 5000 years (assuming the distances between the two worlds to be about 5000 light years) in future.If we happen to view such an alien world, we would also see them in their prehistoric ages. For a world even further off than them, they might be even seeing the formation of the Sun and Earth right now... ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in fact whatever we observe has already taken place. We do not see the events instantaneously as they occur. It takes time for the light to travel from the place of that event to our eyes. For example, when we look at the sun, we see it as it was 8 minutes ago, as it takes 8 minutes for light to travel from sun to earth. Similarly if we observe a galaxy, which is thousands of light years away from earth, we would actually be looking at that galaxy as it was a thousand years ago, as it took light a thousand years to reach us. We will have no information regarding what it looks like now, or whether an intelligent life form has evolved there or not, or if it even exists now or not. Similar would be the situation of any intelligent alien life observing us from a far away galaxy. ",

            "answer_text": "No need of looking to stellar proportions. it can be technically said that we can perceive past only. Whatever you see is the past and there is a gradient to it. Let me explain. You are standing in a street with streetlights lined up every 10 meters.You stand at at one end under a streetlight. Light takes 10/299,792,458 seconds to reach you from the next streetlight, so you are seeing it that much in the past. For convenience let us call this quantity 10x seconds where x=1/299,792,458 seconds. Light from the third light takes 20x seconds to reach you. from the fourth takes 30x seconds to reach you. So the farther you look out, more into the past you observe. Although these timescales may seem insignificant in everyday life, in basic physics natural units they considerable. for example the x we discussed above is 6.2X10^34 planck times (a natural unit of time). That is a 6.2x10 Billion Trillion Trillion Planks seconds :) !!!!! ",
