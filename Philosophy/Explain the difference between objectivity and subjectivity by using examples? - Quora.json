            "answer_text": "An object pronoun is used as the object of a sentence; a subject pronoun is used as the subject of a sentence. For instance, if we start with a sentence like: Wonder Woman is going to team up with Batman in the next movie. we would replace \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 with a subject pronoun \u2014 in this case \u2018she\u2019 \u2014 because it is the subject of the sentence, and we would replace \u2018Batman\u2019 with an object pronoun \u2014 in this case \u2018him\u2019 \u2014 because it is the object of the sentence. And so we get: She (WW) is going to team up with him (B) in the next movie. When we start working with complex clauses, figuring out whether we\u2019re looking at a subject or object can be confounding. I still get muddled with the \u2018who/whom\u2019 distinction at times\u2026 But that is the only distinction that we have to make. ",

            "answer_text": "Objective observations require that their scientific utility not be dependent on the observer. For example, \u201cJupiter is the most massive planet in the solar system\u201d is objective, since Jupiter\u2019s standing should not be dependent on any particular observer. In contrast, \u201cJupiter is really big\u201d is subjective, since it requires a size reference from the observer. \u201cI am wearing white socks\u201d could be objective, if all potential observers would likely agree. You could increase your confidence in the objectivity of such observations by: Making observations quantitative. Express attributes numerically instead of qualitatively. Can you quantify \u201cwhite\u201d?Collecting corroborating data. Ask others if your socks are white. Make multiple measurements on your socks and socks that you think are not white.Controlling measurement error. Work to reduce random and systematic errors.Rigorously defining \u201cwhite\u201d, \u201csock\u201d, and \u201cwear\u201d. If others need to ask you for clarification, you are failing to be objective.",

Subjective sentences assert: opinion, one perspective of many, assumptions, etc.Subjective sentences are easily argued against using opposing opinions or counter-examples.I think literature is boring. That is subjective.Objective sentences assert: Observations of measurable and/or verifiable factsNot easily arguable because of evidence to directly support the assertion.I will die if I was nude in sub-zero temperatures. That is objectively true.",

            "answer_text": "the answer to that is we dont know. as by definition , if you look at any object you are actually looking at its use and also ignoring all the other uses , as in i can use brick to make a wall or can be used to hit someone, so when we say what it means to be objective? we need an observer to answer that . hence , pure subjective experiences are what goes in your mind , as far as we know. and , pure objective , requires an organised structure capable of rationality to introduce such concepts as we are discussing , hence in itself imposing a limitation , by the act of doing so , so nothing such as pure-objectivity exists as far as we know. it is just what the evidence , in front of us can be agreed upon by a selective high rational individuals , and studied with more or less subjective variation is categorized as objectivity ",
