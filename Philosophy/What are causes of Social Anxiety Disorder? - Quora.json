            "answer_text": "Social Anxiety Disorder is a diagnosable psychiatric condition and causes significant emotional pain and discomfort due to the number of life areas (e.g., work, education, communication, relationships, finance and career) that it negatively impacts. Social Anxiety or SAD sufferers, often share a few common original factors which allowed the condition to develop and exacerbate. The first is a childhood or adolescent socially traumatic experience or multiple humiliating experiences. Being bullied, abuse at home, failing to adjust to a new environment, ridicule by parents or peers for any number of reasons, or academic failure, can contribute to the development of SAD by planting the seeds of low self-esteem in the fertile ground of shame and embarassment. After experiencing humiliation or shame, a child or adolescent who is healthy, typically reduces or contains the emotional damage, by communicating with supportive family or friends and also compensates for the temporary lack of confidence by engaging in confidence reinforcing activities such as sports or social engagements in order to recalibrate his/her sense of \u201cself-image.\u201d In an adult experiencing SAD, one would, by looking at their past, find that they as children did not have the support to voice out their embarassment or pain, and therefore integrate, or internalize their shame to become a more concrete part of their self-image, or the way the see themselves. This lack of opportunity to communicate with others about their pain not only solidifies the damaged self-image but also affects the very ability to communicate itself. After all, the hurt individual learns, on a subconscious level that their inability to recover or heal was not due to a poor support system, but due to poor communication skills. This now solidifies a few beliefs: 1) \u201cI am alone and prefer to be alone lest I be humiliated,\u201d 2) \u201cI cannot express myself well, so any attempt to do so may result in further humiliation,\u201d and 3) \u201cI am not worthy of attention or praise.\u201d It is crucial to understand that Social Anxiety sufferers also experience severe physiological disruptions which are essentially symptoms of high stress, but which also create greater shame and render them incapable or avoidant of social interactions: Profuse sweating (hyperhidrosis) over hands, face or whole bodydry mouth and stutteringdizziness and mental confusionrapid and heavy heart ratestomach pain, acidity and constipation/diarrhea.When SAD sufferers experience even a few of such symptoms of stress, they begin to develop a few core beliefs about themselves and their environment, such as: \u201cI cannot handle social situations due to the discomfort.\u201d\u201cothers are more confident and can analyze me and my odd behaviour\u201d\u201cI cannot afford to make even the smallest error\u201dThankfully, there is hope. Suggesting that one should develop a strong personality, as some answers suggested, is like suggesting the use of will power to stop a fever. SAD sufferers must first accept a few basic truths which will give them much comfort: EVERYONE experiences fear- mild or severe. Fear is a part of the human psyche.Human beings are too caught up in their own lives to sit and think about any communication mistakes made by a person suffering from SAD.The level at which an SAD sufferer criticizes and censures themselves would never be done by someone they are trying to communicate with.Most often, after a social interaction, the person suffering from SAD forgets that the person they\u2019ve just spoken with is introspecting their OWN words, demeanor and delivery during the conversation.SAD may be overcome with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a good Psychologist or counselor if medications such as Paroxetine (common antidepressant used to treat SAD) or anti-anxiety meds or Beta blockers (low grade blood pressure meds) are not effective. If they\u2019d like to do it on their own, bravo!! That decision to recover from SAD is the first step to healing. The steps they can take are: Start Small: Begin by asking small questions of strangers such as asking for the time at a reception desk or asking peers their names, or just a \u201chello,\u201d when passing them in the halls.Practice focusing on the breath. Take 5 deep breaths before any social encounter: breath in deeply through the nose, hold for a moment, and blow out through the mouth as if blowing out candles.Looking into others\u2019 eyes may be difficult, so look at the area between their eyebrows when speaking.Don\u2019t try to impress or interview. Have a few ready questions or answers ready that deal with your daily routine, your work, and even \u201chow you\u2019re doing,\u201d for social encounters. Ask basic and simple questions.Practice confident body language in the mirror. Remember, only YOU feel nervous. Others can\u2019t tell UNLESS you tell them!Watch Amy Cuddy\u2019s talk on YouTube or TED, \u201cYour Body Language Shapes Who You are.\u201d It is a brilliant talk which teaches that you can feel confident and brave just by posing or standing in a certain way.Be gentle with yourself. Practice self-care through exercise, healthy diet and reduced caffiene. AVOID ALCOHOL as a way of feeling less anxious when socializing. It can lead to dependence.Good luck with your new world. It\u2019s safe out here so, Welcome!!!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "What Is Social Anxiety Disorder? Social anxiety disorder,sometimes referred to as social phobia, is a type of anxiety disorder that causes extreme fear in social settings. People with this disorder have trouble talking to people, meeting new people, and attending social gatherings. They fear being judged or scrutinized by others. They may understand that their fears are irrational or unreasonable, but feel powerless to overcome them. Social anxiety is different from shyness. Shyness is usually short-term and doesn\u2019t disrupt one\u2019s life. Social anxiety is persistent and debilitating. It can affect one\u2019s ability to: workattend schooldevelop close relationships with people outside of their familyAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) approximately 15 million American adults have social anxiety disorder. Symptoms of this disorder may start around the age of13. Symptoms Social interaction may cause the following physical symptoms: blushingnauseaexcessive sweatingtrembling or shakingdifficulty speakingdizziness or light headednessrapid heart ratePsychological symptoms may include: worrying intensely about social situationsworrying for days or weeks before an eventavoiding social situations or trying to blend into the background if you must attendworrying about embarrassing yourself in a social situationworrying that other people will notice you are stressed or nervousneeding alcohol to face a social situationmissing school or work because of anxietyIt is normal to sometimes feel anxious. However, when you have social phobia, you have a constant fear of being judged by others or humiliated in front of them. You may avoid all social situations, including: asking a questionjob interviewsshoppingusing public restroomstalking on the phoneeating in publicSymptoms of social anxiety may not occur in all situations. Youcan have limited or selective anxiety. For example, symptoms may only occurwhen you\u2019re eating in front of people or talking to strangers. Symptoms canoccur in all social settings if you have an extreme case. What Causes Social Anxiety Disorder?  The exact cause of social phobia is unknown. However, current research supports the idea that it is caused by a combination of environmental factors and genetics. Negative experiences also may contribute to this disorder, including: bullyingfamily conflictsexual abusePhysical abnormalities such as a serotonin imbalance may contribute to this condition. Serotonin is a chemical in the brain that helps regulate mood. An overactive amygdala (a structure in the brain that controls fear response and feelings or thoughts of anxiety) may also cause these disorders. Anxiety disorders can run in families. However, researchers aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re actually linked to genetic factors. For example, a child might develop an anxiety disorder by learning the behavior of one of their parents who has an anxiety disorder. Children can also develop anxiety disorders as a result of being raised in controlling or overprotective environments. Source: Social Anxiety Disorder ",
