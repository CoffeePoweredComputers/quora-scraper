            "answer_text": "If the linkage isn't \u201cReal\u201d it sure seems to function that way. What you believe is real generates a circularity with how you know it. Applying this to the simplest worldview, Naturalism, the metaphysical commitment generates they method of knowing, sense experience. Ethics reduces to some sort of pleasure-pain principle and reason, whatever that is, takes the hindmost. On Theism, a rational God can be known by reason, sense experience (acts in history) and direct or mediated revelation -Scripture and God incarnate in Christ. Ethics is what God commands, such as love your neighbor. Ethics doesn't stand over God but is part of his nature, so the Euthyphro dilemma does not apply to a maximally great Being like it would to the Greek gods of Plato's world. In Theism, revelation is the epistemological big gun because, as atheist Jean Paul Sartre noted, \u201cMan is an insufficient integration point for himself\u201d. Pantheism is also open to this type of analysis with mystical intuition being the primary way of knowing and good and evil collapse into a oneness of being. ",

            "answer_text": "We call philosophers who strive to link all their views in a consistent manner on what\u2019s really Real, and what we can know of the really Real, and how the nature of the really Real would want us to treat our fellow humans, and what social arrangement best answers to the nature of people and the nature of the really Real \u201csystematic philosophers\u201d. Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel are pretty much the poster boys for this conception of philosophical inquiry. It hasn\u2019t been a fashionable option in the last century or so here in the West. In ancient thought metaphysics was First Philosophy, it was the trunk of the tree of philosophical knowledge and everything else (ethical claims, views on art, or truth, questions about sense perception) got its own big branch with names like \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d or \u201caesthetics\u201d. About four hundred years ago, in Europe, metaphysics ceded the role of First Philosophy to epistemology (theory of knowledge) for various reasons, probably the rise of natural science research was a major factor, and in many ways it still functions in that role now in the early 21st century (although in many countries philosophy of language has sort of replaced traditional epistemological concerns). There have always been influential thinkers who have considered constructing Grand Philosophical Systems to be in poor taste (both Nietzsche and Kierkegaard felt this way). There have been still others who were happy if they could make a minor contribution to the discipline in just a couple of areas, say to logic and philosophy of language, and they could next publish political essays or reflections on the nature of consciousness without anyone expecting it all to sync up in a systematic fashion (Bertrand Russell is an example). So, to answer your question: In the past there have been influential thinkers who saw their contributions to metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics as needing to all hang together pretty well. But there have also always been a large number of philosophers who didn\u2019t feel that this was necessary. One can still be counted among the Great Dead Philosophers without having any desire to be systematic. ",
