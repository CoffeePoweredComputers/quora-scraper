            "answer_text": "Great question asked. It prompted different responses/perspectives from which I'm learning a lot from . I particularly like the quote by one of the folks below Bernard Hoplock \u201c \u2026Sensation is the receiving of datum by the five senses which is then stored in the physical brain as memory\u201d. I would start my perspective from there. Awareness/knowledge/information/stimuli that comes via the 5 senses leads to sensation as we know it. The fact that knowledge comes through the senses (sensation) should be clear to every human who receives knowledge through the senses as this is how we interact with our world. The question however may be a little tricky to answer because of the fact that accepting there is knowledge outside of the senses is the \u201cline drawn in the sand\u201d and only those who are okay with crossing to find out would truly know. If knowledge is achievable beyond the 5 senses, one would need to go beyond the 5 senses or \u201cbeyond the physical\u201d( the literal translation of the word metaphysics). As some have commented there are all different types of knowledge one can receive, and a lot of people experience these- intuition, \u201cvibes\", knowledge from the genes as in siblings resemblance to parents etc. One can also not dismiss the documented records of major significant discoveries made by inventors coming to them through dreams- Niehls Bohr and the structure of the atom, Mendeelev and the Periodic Table, Einstein and the theory of relativity, James Watson and the helix structure of the DNA seen in his dream as a spiral staircase etc The answer to the question I believe is- It depends. It depends on the person receiving the iinformation. If they receive knowledge only through their senses or some other \u201cnon scientific\" way. On a philosophical note however, that is what makes the human experience dynamic and exciting and one of a kind. We can all coexist and have different \u201crealities\u201d in the same space -time construct. That possibility, of different experiences by different people, in my opinion,is a true genius creation by the Creator. But hey, how do we \u201cknow\u201d there is a Creator..or not one?  ",

            "answer_text": "Most, if not all knowledge that we humans have must have passed our senses in one way or another. It wouldn\u2019t reach your brain otherwise. But let\u2019s think about possible exceptions. Nutrition doesn\u2019t give knowledge (some substances might alter your brain activity, giving you certain hallucinations that may help you getting insights).But if you count food, drinks and smoke as \u2018passing senses\u2019\u2026 Genes: well, this actually encodes some knowledge that appeared through natural selection, which can thus be knowledge that didn\u2019t pass the senses. There is gene absorption from other creatures and viruses possible as well. Maybe pathogens and diseases can affect knowledge as well. Toxoplasmosis can make you more cat-loving and can increase likelihood of psychosis for example. Maybe there are some other ways that can bring information to your brain other than the senses. Then again, your consciousness is \u201csensation\u201d. This would imply that active knowledge is sensation during the recollection of it. Evidentialists do point out that all knowledge comes from evidence (through observation) eventually. To them, all abstractions are based on examples in some form or another (by the ones who came to the abstraction in the first place, like the early mathematicians for example). ",
