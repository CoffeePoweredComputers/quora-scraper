I can\u2019t verify if other people exist, in which case this world is incredibly lonely. If I cannot predict whether or not I will succeed in my major, why should I try at all? To quote Nietzsche: \u201cI saw two men. One the greatest of all men, the other the least of all men. They were both utterly naked.\u201d ",
