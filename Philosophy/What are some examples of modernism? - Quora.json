            "answer_text": "As far as literature and poetry goes, classic modernist are Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein and T. S. Eliot to name a few of my favorites. I personally Recommend Woolf\u2019s \u201cTo The Lighthouse\u201d as a modernist novel, Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cWinter Dreams\u201d as a modernist short story and Eliot\u2019s \u201cLovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock\u201d as modernist poetry. The modernist movement was largely influenced by existential philosophy (\u201cExistentialism is a Humanism\u201d by Jean Paul Sarte is an excellent read for getting a grasp of modernism) and modern psychology (largely the works of Freud and Jung on the expression of the subconscious). I\u2019d also recommend Alexander Blok, Hart Crane, Joseph Conrad E. E. Cummings, William Faulkner, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, Wallace Stevens, Dylan Thomas, William Carlos Williams, W. B. Yeats and Hermann Hesse The list, quite literally goes on, List of modernist writers ",
