            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are the harms of laissez-faire capitalism?\u201d Capitalism is an economic system designed to make the most efficient (that is, the most profitable) use of any and all resources, including the processing of those resources into good which in turn become resources themselves, and including human labor, which is also seen as another resource. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what it does. Note that \u201cmaximizing human well being\u201d or \u201cmaximizing human happiness\u201d or \u201cworking in the best interests of society\u201d appear nowhere in that definition. If a capitalist system existed with no regulation or oversight (aka laissez-faire capitalism), such a system would eagerly grind up the babies of the poor to make cat food if doing so generated a higher profit than did the alternatives. Such systems allow people / groups to accumulate wealth, pass that wealth on, and leverage that wealth into control over news outlets and public opinion. Imagine living in a \u201ccompany town\u201d where you\u2019re paid in \u201ccompany scrip\u201d, which is only able to be spent in the \u201ccompany store\u201d, and if you don\u2019t like this, the company has a private \u201cpolice force\u201d which will \u201ckeep order.\u201d Of course, we don\u2019t have to actually imagine this, as this was exactly what has happened in the past. Did you get sick eating the food you bought in the company store? Too bad\u2026 the local newspaper (also owned by the company) won\u2019t print a story, and neither will the local (company owned) radio station. You say you want to sue? LOL\u2026 the company\u2019s lawyers can litigate you into further poverty, assuming the company doesn\u2019t just fire you for \u201cperformance issues\u201d, or evict you from company-owned housing. Capitalism generates wealth, and funnels that wealth upwards. Without regulation and oversight - aka that dreaded Government - that wealth ends up concentrated in a few hands, with everyone else living the life of a virtual serf, except with cable TV. ",

            "answer_text": "The main problem with a laissez-faire is that it is not stable and will collapse without government intervention. But then if there is government intervention, it is no longer laissez-faire. Laissez-faire is an economic system in which transactions between private parties are free from government intervention. In such a system, how are contracts (transactions between private parties) enforced? When there is a dispute over the contract interpretation, or implementation, how is it settled? If the government is not involved, then the contract dispute will be settled by the party with the greater economic and political power. That could mean manufacturers selling defective products with consumers having no recourse. That could mean crime rings (e.g., mafias) setting up extortion rings. That could mean wealthy business men breaking contracts and stiffing contractors (e.g., Donald Trump). Eventually the system will be dominated by economically and politically powerful entities who set their own rules, rules that preferentially favor their interests, and rules that run contrary to the concept of laissez-faire. The ironic thing about free markets, and laissez-faire capitalism, is that it can only exist if the government intervenes heavily to create the conditions for it to thrive. ",
