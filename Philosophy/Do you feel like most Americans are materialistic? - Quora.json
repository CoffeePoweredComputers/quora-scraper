Luke 12:13\u201321 (NIV bible) \u201cThe Parable of the Rich Fool 13 Someone in the crowd said to him, \u201cTeacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.\u201d 14 Jesus replied, \u201cMan, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?\u201d 15 Then he said to them, \u201cWatch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.\u201d 16 And he told them this parable: \u201cThe ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 17 He thought to himself, \u2018What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.\u2019 18 \u201cThen he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 19 And I\u2019ll say to myself, \u201cYou have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.\u201d\u2019 20 \u201cBut God said to him, \u2018You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?\u2019 21 \u201cThis is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.\u201d  Image source\u2026 The Materialism editorial cartoons ",

We always have our budgets running in the back of our minds. Also, things don\u2019t cost a fortune here unless you buy Lamborghinis so you can get a lot of what you like. Materialistic? Maybe. I will be interested to see what other responses have to say about this. ",
