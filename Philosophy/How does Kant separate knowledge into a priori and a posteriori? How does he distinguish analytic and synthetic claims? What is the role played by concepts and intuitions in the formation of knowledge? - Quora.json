            "answer_text": "I will not elaborate on Kant's philosophy but shall share my understanding on how knowledge is developed in your mind for evaluation purposes. When human is born, it is not even like a Robot. Know nothing, no control of body and organs. Only knows to react the way he started this life by crying ( helped commencement of own breathing or starting the life). Then during his growth from baby to adult , he start responding to senses such as feel , sound, light ect ect. This is the first stage of knowledge. He sees images but not known whether it is his parents or any other, those means nothing to him. He hears sounds but doesn't have an idea of what or where . What he gets from feel, taste and smell are same. Then how he recognises these. For this first requirement is a medium or language. This is developed by his parents. Mother takes over and keep on telling the child that that her image what child sees called \u201c mother\u201d . This will go on and on and child now recognize the sound of mother. So secondary knowledge given by outsiders such as parents and teachers ect ect. This is why if something absorbed by your 5 sensory doors initially gives you type of sense then only you remember who and what. But unless the knowledge externally injected, human will never gain knowledge. This is why the saying \u201c Science will never reach beyond five sensory doors\u201d. The base for Everything thing they test and prove are what they could captured only. Once secondary knowledge developed then the concepts of like , dislikes and existence are created in your mind. Intuition is your skill or ability to retrieve stored knowledge accurately and efficiently. Don't go after jargon's created by so called philosophers but try to understand the basics of humanind. Which is \u201c The Nature\u201d ",
