            "answer_text": "As a religion scholar, I don't consider the information I've amassed on religion to be knowledge. I distinguish between knowledge and data, not to mention the interpretation of artifacts, which is different than a fact, or a piece of usable data. This is an issue of epistemology. The philosophy of history requires that we view ideas of the past in the context of the limits of the mind. We create fictions, but we aspire as scientists when studying history, to build increasingly stable fictions. With more stability, more usability and the more it complies with the edicts of reason. When you refer to religious knowledge such as the divinity of Jesus or the Buddha's virgin birth, we are again not discussing knowledge. There's hearsay, there's inventions, machinations, dogmas, beliefs, theological doctrines, apologies, etc.  The repetition of a religious motif across time and cultures and place speaks to religious scholars as a \"super truth,\" not a fact or truth but something that speaks to humans in a larger framework of their existence. This give us data, again, on human psychology or, at best, something ontological. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends which religion. Some, like Catholicism, seem to make a virtue from blind faith, ie. consciously irrational belief in dogma. Others, such as New Age-style belief systems, rely on experience as a basis of belief, which then shifts the issue of knowledge to the validity of religious experience, as either genuine or a psychological trick. Others, like Judaism or some strains of Protestant Christianity, claim to be entirely rational, thus putting their adherents on equal intellectual footing to scientific rationalists, atheists or whoever may be the non-religious observer condescendingly making this analysis.
