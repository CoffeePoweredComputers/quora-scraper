            "answer_text": "Post-modernism isn\u2019t a single theory or ideology. Rather it\u2019s a whole family of critiques of the various theories and ideologies that came before it. The main pro of post-modernism is that these critiques have validity. Some are merely sceptical \u2026 pointing out that things that the previous ideologies assert can\u2019t actually be justified or shown to be true. Some are based on historical research, where, for example, Foucault finds in various historical records that the same behaviour was, in one century, treated as crime, and in another, as madness, this strengthens the case that the line between the two is negotiable rather than absolute. Others are entirely new conceptual frameworks for thinking about how the world works. They may sound weird compared to what we were used to. But they are often capable of helping us see things that the old frameworks don\u2019t. And even if there\u2019s no compelling reason to adopt the new one, its very existence shows the old one to be more arbitrary than you previously thought. The main con of post-modernism is exactly that, because it\u2019s not a unified theory or ideology, and in fact a proliferation of different ideas, some of which are not compatible with each other, and many of which are odd, it doesn\u2019t necessarily give rise to a programme for action. It\u2019s not practical. Once you\u2019ve noted the slipperiness of words, and given some compelling evidence of it, what do you do? You can\u2019t STOP using words. Political discourse and argument and rhetoric goes on as before. Once you\u2019ve identified that oppression is diffused within the population in the form of biopower, and exerted horizontally \u2026 how do you combat oppression? It\u2019s everywhere, in the cracks and interstices of everyday life. You can try calling out every occurrence, but it becomes intractable. And leads to some of the problems we have today where racism and sexism and other prejudices within the population, are called out and treated as heinous so universally, that sooner or later the accusation loses its force, and the population builds up a kind of immunity.

            "answer_text": "Postmodernism is not something one has a choice over, like deciding to use Facebook rather than Instagram, or deciding to take a taxi rather than the train. Postmodernism is theory, or generic term for a number of theoretical perspectives all which have one thing in common; they suggest that humanity, broadly, has moved from adherence to modernity and modernist culture, politics, values, and into the postmodern age. An age when all is called into question, not least the \u2018grand narratives\u2019 of modernity. If this is the case, and it is up to the individual to decide the veracity of the various theoretical arguments and positions, then we are in the age of postmodernism whether we like it or not. Personally, I believe we are, though clearly there are sizeable pockets of modernism still left living and breathing around the world. Plus there are those who would be happy to revert to modernism, notably the religious, and those seeking what they see as utopian solutions to complex unfathomable human problems (e.g. the fascists, communists, and followers of the latest guru whoever that might be). Postmodern is not utopian. It is not offering solutions. It is not offering hope. But nor it is threatening to slaughter those who do not follow it. You cannot follow postmodernism simply because it is not an ideology to be followed. It has no party, no rhetorical standpoint, no political leader. It is not aiming to be persuasive. It either exists or it does not. No one can say for sure it does exist, any more than anyone can say it does not. You have to weigh up the evidence and decide for yourself. Postmodernism denies the possibility of political unity, universal belief, cultural homogenization, singularity of message, grounded truth, predictability, certainty, and global order. It also tells us that image is all, reality is multiple, as is the subjectivity of the audience. Seems to me to be self-evidently accurate at describing this point in human history. But you must make up your own mind. ",
