            "answer_text": "Most people don\u2019t bother; don\u2019t have the critical thinking skills to notice or the cognition to recognize a questionable fact. Finding fault with a favored politician is unsatisfying, so why\u201d, bother? How many people listen to politicians whose lies make them uncomfortable? I can\u2019t listen to most Republicans any more because their false facts and misrepresentation of mainstream Democratic positions is aggravating and so dangerous. If they are not outright lying, they are presenting a caricature of the opposition\u2019s position that pretends execution of a policy would require an absurdly extreme action. For example: No Democrat at this point in time wants open borders. But neither do they want forever split up families as a deterrent. They want a reasonable solution that would permit tightening border control without destroying families, ignoring human rights, and ensuring reasonable compassion toward immigrants whose lives are threatened with death, gang terror, or extra-judicial punishment. This is neither as simple as building a wall or allowing an open border, though Republican Presidents have favored both approaches. An effective, realistic solution that would work while consuming an appropriate amount of resources, is complex and impossible to communicate in a slogan or chant like \u201cBuild the Wall.\u201d Or a flat out lie, like \u201cMexico will pay for it.\u201d One won\u2019t solve the problem and the other is untrue but impossible to refute. That\u2019s why fact-checking by Democrats is unconvincing and impractical. Trump and a growing number of Republicans, use weasel words, The Big Lie stated with confidence, oversimplification and or flat out misrepresentation of the Democratic position, to influence voters. Never before do I remember this being practiced so blatantly or frequently as under the Trump Administration. Failure is described as success, the effectiveness of Covid testing is flip-flopped according to political not scientific outcomes, and the White House position on issues is demanded of our scientific institutions normally considered bedrock in making difficult or ambiguous decisions. Nowadays, heads of these agencies, appointed by Trump, are forced to comply or risk their livelihoods and careers. That\u2019s why calling out lies in real time isn\u2019t very effective against Trump\u2019s coup. These tactics also offers a piece of the explanation for how Trump got elected in the first place. The electorate, the press, and frankly the other two branches of government have never had to deal with this level of deceit, cheating, and lies from a Presidential candidate and a major political party.

It\u2019s interesting that the public at large is not educated, and certainly not by popular media, on a simple fact. Big Media, the 6 corporations that own 90% of the media The 6 Companies That Own (Almost) All Media [INFOGRAPHIC], has become a political tool whose existence depends on serving the political and other biases of their advertisers, stockholders, and other management concerns. There\u2019s nothing like working in this industry to see firsthand how truth in reporting is skewed to fit management\u2019s agenda and the corporation\u2019s public niche. Truth is down the list of concerns, whereby their reality of truth becomes distorted.

I\u2019ll say Obama didn\u2019t intentionally lie; things just turned out differently than he expected. I stand behind my apology and I think it\u2019s fair, but I use this anecdote about my own bias to explain how it works, how Obama said something that wasn\u2019t true and I discount it.
