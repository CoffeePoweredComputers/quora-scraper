            "answer_text": "Now that Quora has merged the troll\u2019s question with some people who asked more seriously, my answer needs revision. But I\u2019ll leave my \u2018troll-response\u2019 below!  My dad was quite intelligent, but in a small town sort of way. Many years ago, as my education was in process, it was inevitable that we had a variety of heated discussions. These became progressively more frustrating to me. He was fairly proud of his debating ability (he\u2019d won some state-wide contest when he was in high school) and of his mastery of \u2018Robert\u2019s Rules\u2019 (which came into play in an avocational area of his life). As a young person, I naively thought these things meant he\u2019d act and argue rationally. So I was frustrated and confused by what I actually encountered, and it took me years to find a way to describe it. Daddy could be quite logical and rational, but wasn\u2019t most of the time. For him, logic and reason were tools in his toolbox, to be taken out and used in discussions where other methods weren\u2019t working. But rational, reasoned, logical thought was NOT his natural mode of mental process. Now, nobody is rational all the time . . . because we don\u2019t have time for it. Daniel Kahneman\u2019s book, Thinking Fast and Slow, covers this extensively and persuasively. But that\u2019s not what I mean. My maternal grandfather was not as bright, in a school-ish sense, as my father but was the only man (or woman) I\u2019ve ever known who ALWAYS attempted to act in accord with reasoned thought. Most people are like Daddy was: if they lose a reasoned argument (and I mean, lose so that even THEY know they lost), they do NOT change their mind or behavior. Instead, they just go look for new arguments. But when Granddaddy lost an argument (and he lost a few to me), he check around to verify that I was right . . . and if I was, he\u2019d attempt to change both his thinking and his behavior. As far as I myself know, he\u2019s the only reasonable person that ever lived. I try, but I don\u2019t live like he did. Of course, my knowledge doesn\u2019t extend beyond a few thousand people. So there may well be others who are like he was. But I\u2019ve never met them. Right now, the only candidate I\u2019ve seen is Jordan Peterson . . . who SEEMS like he cares enough about truth to change his mind when he\u2019s shown to be wrong. But I\u2019ve been reading (or listening to) his material for less than a year, and I\u2019ve never met the man. So we\u2019ll see. But are people generally reasonable, like my Grandfather? Nope. Many people aren\u2019t even capable of reasoned thought. But even for those who are, \u201creason\u201d and \u201clogic\u201d and \u201crationality\u201d are usually just tools they use against others, and not the preferred mode of their own INTERNAL thought.  Original Troll Response (prior to Quora question-merging) follows: With respect to your question, \u201cAre humans reasonable?\u201d here\u2019s a relevant Q & A from Quora:  Q: \u201cHow does [ name of person who asked this question removed to avoid BNBR violation ] come up with such interesting questions?\u201d A: [ name of person who asked this question removed to avoid BNBR violation ] , Just an ordinary person with no extensive knowledge on anything. Answered Oct 21, 2016 \u201cI have no boundaries when it comes to questions, I ask anything that randomly occurs to me throughout the day, no matter how stupid, absurd or controversial it may be, and I do my best to ask questions that haven\u2019t been asked yet.\u201d  So . . . it would appear that at least some humans are not reasonable, but instead prefer cranial flatulence to reasonable thought. Perhaps they hope that like Zeus, they will have something wonderful spring fully formed from their minds, if only they allow whatever is there to dribble out. Unfortunately, what often seems to result brings to mind the old person\u2019s maxim, \u201cNever trust a fart!\u201d. I\u2019m afraid these random mind dribbles usually bear more resemblance to wet farts, than to a goddess of wisdom like Athena - Wiki. ",

            "answer_text": "Where to begin\u2026short answer is no, here\u2019s why. In the early ages there was this book that people followed to give them \u201cmorals\u201d, same book that said \u201cthou shall not kill\u201d and \u201cmankind should have dominion over animals\u201d, the ladder will be talked about a bit later but on to the whole killing part, humans are a self destructive bunch, even with the book of morals they wiped out other humans for not following it, take example the pagans, while not entirely wiped out there was a mass genocide of them, they\u2019re earth worshiping and they weren\u2019t hurting anyone, sure a few sacrifices here and there but they even without a proper book to guide them were more moral than the church which started killing them, either they converted like a coward to become as cowardly as the church, or they would be killed, another more recent yet related thing were the witch trials, not to mention their beef with islam which isn\u2019t peaceful in the slightest but they\u2019re killing each other over disagreeing, now for the next statement about the dominion over animals, \u201cgod\u201d didn\u2019t create the animals, we dragons did, more specifically the eldest ones. Yet humans like to kill, if they don\u2019t feel like killing each other they will find an excuse to kill animals, the only acceptable excuse is for food, yet that\u2019s not only the case, look at predators such as coyotes, and wolves, as well as bobcats. Humans kill and kill them for reasons like \u201cthey will kill my livestock\u201d or \u201cthey will ruin my hunt/they will kill my deer\u201d and my personal favorite \u201cthey are overpopulated and invasive\u201d as if humans aren\u2019t\u2026with their 7.6 billion in population all over the world\u2026not invasive my tail. They also kill for \u201cpest control\u201d although yes it may be annoying if raccoons got into your cans, or mice got into your house but those (humans) are the same species which kills snakes (which eat mice by the way) out because of them being \u201cscary\u201d\u2026No humans are the most illogical, immoral, pathetic species the earth holds ",

            "answer_text": "Most people probably believe we are. The ancient philosophers believed that we have a rational sense and Christianity extended on this when it created the Christian theology, in which rationality is given to us by God. Most religions seem to contain a belief that humans are capable of reaching perfect understanding. However, the belief in rationality has many challenges. One of them has always been: what about the stupid people. What about those who are mentally challenged, what about children, or what about those who seem very irrational. I don\u2019t know if it was David Hume who first started questioned the belief in pure reason: Hume strove to create a total naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Against philosophical rationalists, Hume held that passion rather than reason governs human behaviour. Hume argued against the existence of innate ideas, positing that all human knowledge is founded solely in experience. David Hume - Wikipedia The debate was not settled with Hume though. One might say that libertarianism and other ideas from economists at the Chicago school might be the strongest current force in the belief that humans are rational. The basis of libertarianism is that humans act rationally in their own self-interest. If this assumption is wrong, libertarianism will fail. That happens if a human has one choice that is good for him and one choice that is bad, and still chooses the bad one. But here we also see the challenge in the rational mind: what does it mean to be \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d for a person? Sometimes a person might make a choice that seems like a bad choice, such as start selling drugs, but it might give him money and status he might not otherwise have. Using drugs might also seem like a bad idea, but for a person without any hopes of a future, it might be their only source of joy \u2014 and it might even activate them and give them a reason to live, rather than them become passive, depressed and develop mental problems. Most intelligent people probably believe in the rational mind, since rationality is a common way to debate: we present arguments from different sides and chose the best one. But in real life, it doesn\u2019t always work like that, because we can\u2019t always compare the choices. I learned this while I looked into Scientology for a few months. I believed that through rationality and intelligence, it would be possible to realize the errors of Scientology and not get caught, but what I discovered is that humans are easy to make to believe things. The way to make people believe something is not to tell them what to believe, but in asking them the right questions, or giving them suggestions with a desired outcome. After leaving Scientology, I discovered that our whole society operates on the same principles, and indeed that religions do it very strongly. Many people chose to stay in a religion simply because they are terrified of hell. From a rational perspective, their choice actually makes sense: The religion tells me that if I become a heretic (or dissident, etc), I will go to hellThe religion tells me that any attempts to make me question my faith comes from evil forces (\u201cSatan\u201d, etc) that makes me want to go to hell.From this perspective, it makes perfectly sense for a believer to distance themselves aggressively from any criticism against their religion. It isn\u2019t that hard to make the next step in the thought process, and say What if I showed you a way of thinking that will remove all your negative/hateful feelings and make you a good person? -Okay that seems like it has no downsides. Then suppose we could help other people accomplish the same, and together we could eradicate evil from this world? -Wow, that sounds amazing. If I said this was Scientology, the person who believes himself to be rational would say that this way of thinking is nonsense. But suppose I said it is leftist thinking. Then many people believe it is the way to go. One can quickly draw a parallel to socialism. Based on this line of thinking, socialism is perfectly rational, but so is Scientology and any other religion. It is worth pointing out that the liberal tradition (which is the foundation of libertarianism) is based on the assumption that the individual should be free to make the decisions he wants in his life. In real life, the traditional liberal ideas never pan out. In Sweden, the liberal party (called Folkpartiet at the time), split in the 1923 over whether alcohol should be made illegal or not. Should people be free to ruin their own lives and the lives or others close to them? Liberalism, free-to-chose and individual freedom always sound good, but politicians mainly use the phrases to win votes. (imagine a politician running on saying he wants less freedom) I think rationality makes sense if we understand human nature though. For one thing, we want to belong to a group. Unlike what the media and movies tell us, we aren\u2019t \u201ccreated\u201d to tell the truth, but we want to say things in a way that wins approval. There isn\u2019t necessarily anything wrong with that. Just imagine a society where everyone is perfectly honest all the time, and I don\u2019t think that would be a functioning society. It is worth pointing out that humans are unable to hide most emotions, such as anger, disgust or sadness, but are excellent at lying. Xenophobia, and maybe even racism, is also rational from a human perspective. Leftists tell us that xenophobia is irrational, but experience from around the world show that we quickly divide people into different groups and treat them stereotypical based on our experiences. That\u2019s how our minds work. We create hierarchies where we want to see ourselves striving to be in the top, unlike others who we consider not being up to standard. This necessitates us to look for a boogeyman, as thus, as the sociologist Durkheim noted, crime is a necessary element in any society.[1] Footnotes[1] Durkheim: Crime Will Always Be In Existence",

            "answer_text": "When we look at all the creatures on the earth, many of them have potentially influenced how life on the planet has been. Through one means or the other. The planet is filled with unimaginable creatures. Many of them have lived in their habitats for ages and has evolved as well but the changes in their way of living have remained unchanged. Humans are the most influential creature on the planet. They have lived outside their earlier habitat and evolved immensely, they have developed various languages, cultures, changed where they lived, from the wild to mansions and cities well developed, they have invented writing and a way of transferring knowledge from one to the other. This indicates that humans have an amazing reasoning. Humans are reasonable beings, they have been able to extend their reasoning to other animals they bring around them, as pets, as games for hunting and for other purposes. It is only humans have been able to live together with other creatures that are not humans. This is what reasoning can do. The degree of human empathy is immeasurable. It goes beyond that of any creature on earth. Humans are reasonable beings, they have been able to transform the odds of the earth surface and influenced them. Other creatures have not invented boats for the aquatic habitats, not built bridges for crossovers, nor made way for fire for cooking. They have not been able to invent weapons for them to use them when they are hunted. All these humans have been able to have because of our immense brain endowments. Humans are the most reasonable beings on the planet. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer from the philosophy of GWF Hegel (ca. 1820). People are PARTLY rational and PARTLY irrational. We are a complex combination of the two, opposite features. That is, if Rationality is the thesis, then Irrationality is the antithesis, and then Humanity is the synthesis. The same applies in the realm of Ethics, morality and religion. Hegel says that human beings are basically EQUAL parts of Good and Evil. We have the potential for enormous Good. We also have the potential for enormous Evil. Hegel did not live to see the 20th century, which proved his theory in flying colors. Look at all the scientific and technological advances of the 20th century \u2014 we are clearly a rational species. Now look at all the war and genocide in the 20th century \u2014 we are clearly an irrational species. We are BOTH, said Hegel, BOTH in ONE. That is what makes Humanity so unique in the Cosmos \u2014 so complex \u2014 so interesting. This is precisely who we are. We are a part of all this. When we look inside ourselves, we can find our genuine love for the Good and for the Righteous \u2014 and we can also find the Underground Man in the byways of our minds. Nor was Hegel the first to say this. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle had already said this 2,300 years ago. The human soul, they agreed, is comprised of three basic parts \u2014 Reason, Passions and Appetites \u2014 i.e. the rational and the irrational. The well-ordered soul would organize the mind (like a city-state) so that Reason was in charge of the other forces. Yet Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were under no illusions that most people would be able to control their Passions and Appetites. Only those few who attained Excellence in Reason would be fit to govern the Republic, they declared. ",

The issue with this statement is the wrong implications that people can take: It is NOT correct that rational thoughts leads to more accurate assessments. It could be said, though, that they lead to more precise assessments, but that precision is not accuracy.It is NOT correct that those who engage in more rational thought are more consistent in their beliefs, despite that rationality could lead them toward consistency. In other words, there is a difference between consideration and actual belief revision. Meanwhile, intuitive thought has a tendency towards spreading out. It\u2019s necessary to get someone out of a rational local minimum that they have created through limited perspectives and invalid assumptions that intuitive thought rely on breaking.

I don\u2019t expect anything from other people just a way to relieve my frusteration here. look at the United Stated of America. It is built on greed. it is survival of the fittest and no one is gonna help their competition.

Human intelligence and cognition did not evolve to make us logical, it evolved to allow us to navigate social relationships and to convince and influence others in our social group. Basically humans are a bunch of cold, naked, overexcitable primates with poorly acknowledged biological drives and urges, filtered through wayyyy too much processing power for our own good. If you want to understand, *really* understand how humans operate, do some reading up on primate groups in the wild. The patterns are exactly the same, just presented in much simpler form. ",
