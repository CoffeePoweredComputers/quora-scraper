            "answer_text": "Religion introduces the divine truths. Science validates. Eventually, they will merge into the One Truth. From: Religion, Science and God\u2019s Divine Plan of Evolution \u201cReligion is simply a set of instructions, a guidebook or manual, that details a recommended path people can follow to find God in the most expeditious manner, without having to experience unnecessary hardships and difficulties.  Prophets and messengers from God precede the founding of all true religions. After the prophets\u2019 pioneering work and new revelations, the newly formed religions take up the role of clarifying and disseminating the new teachings, accepting converts and propagating the new faith, preserving and maintaining the gains of previous efforts, and ministering to the needs of their flock. Their focus and primary objective is more of a spiritual nature. While the pursuit of knowledge and scientific studies is important, as well, they are secondary to the objectives relating to righteous living and character formation. Defining science and religion   \u201cThe USA's National Academy of Science supports the view that science and religion are independent. \u201cScience and religion are based on different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation.   \u201cReligious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science.   \u201cIn this sense, science and religion are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.\u201d  Taking the NAS definition above, it is proposed that scientific investigations should be limited to those matters that are confined to the physical world. However, as we shall discuss later on, there have also been a good number of scientists that have conducted researches in many fields of study that somehow appear to extend the limits of science beyond these boundaries.  Science investigates and confirms  To science is given the work of proving and disproving all the alleged revelations and religious assertions. All propositions and allegations must be questioned, analyzed and tested. So science is tasked to conduct its own studies and investigations.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Science is a religion. It is the most modern one humans have created and most of the clerics of the faith like to deny that science is a religion in order to differentiate it from the faith systems that came before. Science has a god, and that god is Reason. Science proclaims a faith based statement, through the power of reason all real things can be explained, and thus known. That all of reality is bound by the laws of reason. The specific rituals used to verify the secret knowledge granted to them by reason are called the Scientific Method. Unlike all other religions, the belief in science and its practice has resulted in actual powers being gained by humanity. These powers are usually exercised through the use of technology. Artifacts imbued with the elemental forces of reality and harnessed to do the user\u2019s bidding. Unlike the gods of religions that came before. Reason desires no loyalty. It demands no obedience. Things must be as reason would have them be. And unlike the works of previous gods, the power of reason can be observed and manipulated to our benefit. Every religion has a promise. An end game so to speak. For all older religions the end game is subservience to a deity, and the chance to share in some of its glory. The final promise of science is that, through reason and strict adherence to the scientific method all things can be known. And by knowing all the things, you have also gained all the power. After many eons, through science, our descendants will not just serve gods, but become gods themselves. ",
