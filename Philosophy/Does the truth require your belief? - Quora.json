            "answer_text": "Truth is infallibleand unchanging. Belief has the possibility of being wrong. I am at a game show. There are three doors. There is a brand new car behind one of the doors.( This last statement is true). I have to choose which door it is behind to receive the car. I wholeheartedly believe it is behind door number three.( this is belief). They open door number three and it is not there. Though the truth is the car is behind one of the doors, I had to rely on my own judgement to pick the door with the car. I didn\u2019t know which door it was, so I had to choose. Belief gives way to doubt in this case, because I believed and was wrong. What if I choose wrong again next time? Now if I was told the car was behind door number two, I would know and not have to rely on my own judgement. So than the truth is there when I open the door and the car was there. I had to believe the information of truth was given. I didn\u2019t have to rely on myself, but will recognize truth when it is revealed to be correct. Truth requires belief only to reveal itself to the believer, but not to truth itself. This is the issue many have with God. They want God to reveal itself before they believe it to be true. Truth need not prove itself, but the believer will see it as truth when they believe it. Truth will leave no room for doubt. If falseness is within any claimant of truth, then it is not truth. Truth never fails itself. So truth itself requires no belief, only the believer. ",

            "answer_text": "Does the truth require your belief? Yes and no. The truth is the truth and it does not require proof, does not need to follow logic, does not require peer review or testing to be true. It simply is. For you to know it as true, however, requires that it meet your bar requirement for proof of case. This can only be accomplished through personal experience or self delusion regarding a data point being assessed. Even in this case the data point is really only \u201cpossibly true\u201d as personal experience is not totally reliable. Then there is the \u201cnearly true\u201d which are the nearly infinite number of \u201cnot truths\u201d which appear indistinguishable from the actual truth due to similar yet not on the mark characteristics. These are more likely to be what you will think are true than actual truth if just by statistical probability due to sheer volume contrasted by the singular nature of the truth. Your belief, however, is required for you to build on data that is either \u201clikely true\u201d or \u201cclose enough to functionally use as true\u201d the process of which may lead to higher truths despite faulty foundations. An example I use quite a lot is: if you have not tested the speed of light and you think that it is 186,000 m/s then you \u201cbelieve\u201d it is true. You do not \u201cknow\u201d it is true. There is very very very little that any of is \u201cknow\u201d is true beyond a shadow of a doubt despite that we are contained within the body of absolute truth which is existence. To take the data sets of others and the statistical analysis of people you never met does not prove anything except one\u2019s willingness to trust blindly in others as being forthright and without conspiratorial agenda (which, while likely the case, should be enough to change \u201cknow\u201d into \u201cbelieve\u201d for the self aware). To recap: no, it does not. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no. Why? Well, belief is only the acceptance by the mind of an impression, a proposition, an idea, an as yet unevidenced claim that something either does or does not exist in a particular state. The word is full of truths, some of which we are familiar with. We call the latter group of things knowledge, which is familiarity with or awareness of the facts of a thing. Some truths are pleasant and others not. My mental impression of their existence, or even my complete ignorance of them, makes no difference to their existence. What exists, exists within the body of truth; that which is real and not merely imagined. The correct perception of something requires understanding, realisation, an appreciation of the thing or idea within a particular context. Truth is fact, not supposition, which is what belief is. While it\u2019s common practice for belief to be conflated with knowledge or fact, this is a misleading notion. For example, consider the common saying, \u201cI wish that I knew then what I know now\u201d, most often said when one has realised that they made an error of judgement because of a past lack of information. It expresses regret about a past state, one that has since changed due to something realised or learned in the interim. A lightbulb moment has occurred. If belief and knowledge are to be considered synonymous, then we should or would be able to say something like, \u201cI wish that I believed then what I believe now\u201d. However, we never say this. Why not? If we think about it, it\u2019s because we inherently realise that it was a past state of mind, driven by belief and ignorance, that gave rise to the deficiency that caused eventual regret upon realisation that knowledge was historically absent. That knowledge would have, or could possibly have, prevented the negative outcome or loss that resulted from our initial belief or mental impression. A clear thinker does not confuse belief with knowledge, or wisdom, though it may well allow us to backslide into the mire of subjective and self-seeking modes of thoughts where we deem it convenient to do so. Another example? Let\u2019s propose that the moon exists. I also exist. Therefore, the moon exists because I exist. This assumes that the moon only exists on my sole account of awareness of it. Really? So, what happens when I am no longer conscious of the moon, say when I\u2019m asleep? Does it cease to exist on my account? Surely not, but the lure of belief and egotistical thinking that it might do so, can be a comforting notion to think that we are somehow the centre of the Universe, rather than being a part of it. Belief grants power to unbridled imagination. All extreme ideas are based on belief of one sort or another. Beliefs are opposed to facts, and facts often come into conflict with reality, as they are egocentric and self-gratifying ideas. In brief, beliefs are notional and are merely conceptions about something, without reference to evidence, logic or knowledge. When you consider them closely, belief and knowledge are like oil and water. They may be mixed and shaken together for a time, but they eventually separate and become clearly distinct and visible. Beliefs, in the absence of a human mind to conjure them up, would cease to exist, while all that does exist and has ever existed would still continue manifest itself with reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, yes and no. That\u2019s a complicated question. What does truth mean? Truth is not the same as objective facts \u2014 although people often conflate the two things. Truth can sometimes refer to objective facts. Facts never require our belief. It\u2019s not a matter of belief that Paris is the capital city of France. It\u2019s not a matter of belief that the sun rises in the East and sets in the West each day. Those are matters of facts, and when I speak them, I\u2019m telling the truth in a certain kind of sense. But these facts remain facts whether or not I believe in them. And certainly my own beliefs can be out of line with the objective facts. If I told you the capital of city France was London, I can believe it with all my heart, but that doesn\u2019t make it true. I\u2019d still be wrong. But the word \u201cTruth\u201d can also refer to things other than objective facts. It can refer to philosophical or \u201chuman\u201d truth \u2014 like the idea of The Golden Rule, also known as Reciprocal Altruism. So you could say that it\u2019s a truth of human existence that most people would prefer to be treated with respect, have their needs and desires respected, and treated equally to others. We can codify that as some kind of spiritual stricture, or encode that in mythology and storytelling\u2014both religious and secular. But it\u2019s not exactly an objective fact \u2014 because not everybody follows this rule exactly, or even believes in it. These \u201chuman\u201d truths are often somewhat subjective, or at least relative to our own values \u2014 which may or may not line up with the values of our own or other communities, or all other humans. Then there is also the idea of personal honesty \u2014 so a person can be telling the truth when they\u2019re talking about anything to do with their own personal experience. Like, are they angry or sad or happy? Are they hungry or full, in pain, or feeling good? No one can tell them they\u2019re not feeling those things \u2014 only they can say for sure, and they can tell the truth or they can choose to lie about it, and no one outside of themselves can really be certain about the difference. The same applies when they\u2019re talking about their personal experience \u2014 about things that have been done to them, about things they\u2019ve done, about goals and aspirations they may have, hopes, fears, etc. A person\u2019s personal \u201ctruth\u201d \u2014 including also their values, spirituality, and all of that \u2014 these are all impenetrable to others, except where we individually choose to share. This kind of truth sort of does require your belief \u2014 or rather doesn\u2019t require it but is based on it. Because obviously your personal truth is based on what you believe is true for you and true about your life and experience, and no one can really judge that (not accurately) except you. And it\u2019s the overlap between these two later forms of truth where morality really resides. To respect other people fully \u2014 i.e. to carry out the semi-universal truth that we all wish to be respected and treated fairly (i.e. the Golden Rule), it means we all have to respect the inner life (personal truth) of other people. And that doesn\u2019t require \u201cbelief\u201d so much as simply understanding the value of listening and respecting and being compassionate toward other people. That\u2019s a moral truth that is about as close to an objective moral fact as morality ever gets. I certainly think it\u2019s a truth that doesn\u2019t exactly require our own belief to remain such a truth, but people certainly have to \u201cbelieve in it\u201d enough to act upon it. So given these three kinds of truth \u2014 the \u201ctruth\u201d doesn\u2019t require your belief to remain truth, but quite often your belief in the truth (your your beliefs about what the truth might be) are certainly going to determine how you act in the world, and that\u2019s really what matters. It\u2019s also important to remember the nature of belief in all of this. If we believe something, and then act upon that belief, it\u2019s the nature of our human minds to focus mainly on the experiences that verify those beliefs to us. So, if you believe the world is coming to an end \u2014 whether by some kind of religious end times, or by climate change \u2014 that belief will effect your mindset. You\u2019ll act in ways that reflect how you feel about this end of the world scenario. Your mind will focus on all the ways your belief is true, and that will reinforce your mindset \u2014 it\u2019s a feedback loop. And so if you think the world is about to end, you may act in ways that actually make that prophecy come true. It\u2019s the cliche of an alcoholic strugging to stay sober, but afraid they can\u2019t \u2014 you fall off the wagon once and have a drink, and so you think you failed so bad that your\u2019e already damned, so why not just keep drinking? I find so much of the dialogue around climate change, social injustice, poverty, etc. is like this \u2014 apocalyptic, and \u201cfuck it\u201d we might as well just move to thailand and get high and watch the world end. But then nobody so jaded and apathetic is going to be able to fix the problems that would prevent these crises.  Think about it in smaller terms \u2014 our fears often become self-fulfilling too. A socially anxious party thinks they\u2019ll embarass themselves at a party. So they go to the party with this fear in mind, and then they start focusing on every little mistake they make, and before long they\u2019re so wound-up and anxious that they can\u2019t focus on the conversations they\u2019re having with people, they\u2019re sweating and nervous and making other people uncomfortable, and so they have a really awkward time, and really do end up embarassing themselves at the party, and leaving feeling like \u201cI knew this would happen, why do I even try?\u201d \u2014 But if they had let that fear go, or found ways to focus on other things, they\u2019d have been calmer the whole time and the thing they were afraid of would not have happened \u2014 or if it had, it wouldn\u2019t have felt so bad. It works the other way too \u2014 in mental health recovery, and even in sports and other success coaching, there\u2019s the phrase \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d \u2014 which is verified by experimental psychology. If you act \u201cas if\u201d a certain belief is true, then you\u2019ll begin to model the patterns and habits of behaviour that will make that belief a true reality in your life. It might feel weird at first, because it feels untrue, but eventually it works \u2014 and because you\u2019re acting out this behaviour, it actually works backwards and serves to re-write your beliefs about yourself of the situation. So your \u201cfake\u201d action becomes your truth, if you work at it. And so, if you have social anxiety because deep down you think you\u2019re a worthless loser, then suspending that idea and still putting yourself in social situations and acting as if people respect you and you feel you have value yourself, then you\u2019ll begin to develop confidence, and actually manifest circumstances where people do treat you with respect, and where you feel respected and worthwhile \u2014 and genuinely confident. So it works. We even know that if you smile when you feel awful, it will help you feel a bit better. And this is true if you make yourself smile with your muscles \u2014 but it\u2019s also true that simply holding a pencil in your teeth, which forces your mouth into a shape similar to a smile \u2014 has the same effect. So belief, action, and \u201ctruth\u201d are all connected. It\u2019s just a question of what you\u2019re trying to accomplish, and where you want to get in life. What does the truth, or your own truth, perhaps, serve? And how do your beliefs and actions other align or not align with that? ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Lawson thanks for the O2A. By the way, I offered a discussion just to demonstrate, however, I just simply assumed that you are a Christian and pardon me if I assumed wrong. Does the truth require your belief? TRUTH doesn\u2019t submit to any human authority just to cause TRUTH to be TRUE, on the other hand, it is the humans who are suppose to submit to the authority of TRUTH. Unfortunately, no one seem to recognize the truth because the present humanity authored their its own truth. What do I mean by authority? To better demonstrate, I just wish to make the Word CHRIST as example. The Word CHRIST according to the Holy Scripture, is defined, the power of God and the wisdom of God This definition given should always be held accordingly and every time a person decides to use or speak of the Word CHRIST, the thought that goes along the speech should speak the same for the Word Christ stands for the TRUTH and the LAW that is God. While it is true that the word Christ was first introduced to us in the Bible, if so, then it is only right that we likewise, uphold the same definition and intention if we wanted to use the word \u201cCHRIST\u201d in expressing our thoughts lest, we end up making false statements which seeks to promote confusion and misunderstanding. Unfortunately, when Christianity indoctrinated the world relative to the Words of God, Christianity denied to use the same definition and meaning and decided to institute what clearly is a PERVERTED VERSION of the Word CHRIST. And according to records, Christianity led people to believe the word CHRIST to mean \u201ca title\u201d given to Jesus for being the annointed one and the messiah. Is CHRISTIANITY guilty of misleading and decieving the world after Christianity indoctrinated the world with a different definition of the word CHRIST? If the changing of definition has caused the information found in the Bible to express a different idea or thought as compared to the original, then, this only means one thing. Christianity has been lying to the world all along. If so, try to determine whether, the same was or is the practice of Christianity, if so, is this the same reason why people are confused because people are actually being misled? When Christianity instituted and indoctrinated the world with the perverted version of the Word Christ, the very intention was not to serve and advocate the one true Christ Jesus but to promote their own version of Jesus whom they fallaciously presented to the world as a human being when in truth, Jesus was in a SPIRITUAL REALM. If people continue to disregard this GOSPEL TRUTH, its because they did not understand the TRUTH revealed for by the Words of God and quite frankly, people embraced the perverted version labeled as biblical interpretation and authored by Christianity which caused people not to realize the TRUTH. It would be so unfortunate, If people simply ignore this fact. If so, then it is quite clear who are against God. If you ask why, the answer is simple, if CHRIST is the power and thoughts of God but then, you were made to believe a perverted version, doesn\u2019t this mean that Christianity violated and lied about Christ? If so, wouldn\u2019t that mean that there is an intention to deny CHRIST? If so, wouldnt that mean that Christianity is the same as the ANTI-CHRIST or ANTI-TRUTH or against the power and wisdom of God. The reason why people are required to know, believe and hold on to TRUTH so no one will be led to LIE and ensure that no one is deceived or will be deceived. Either a believer or not, what I have discussed should already cause people to feel alarmed and conscious because I already spoke of the truth about the true situation of the people today and to speak out bluntly, it means we are being made slaves by Christianity. We are living in the kind of world according to how they made us believe what this world is and what its all about. Whether we like it or not but then, this present day, both believer and non believer are actually are slaves of Christianity and we are serving the god of this world. To them we are all slaves because we live in their world, the CHRISTENDOM or CHRISTIAN KINGDOM. Do you know what the present empire is presently called? Prior to the VATICAN, the ROMAN EMPIRE was called, SPQR  At this present age, the ROMAN EMPIRE is now called,  The god and Jesus of Christianity is called;  On the left, meet SATAN the Son and the Jesus of Christianity, On the right, meet LUCIFER the god of Christianity. Going back to your question, Does the truth require your belief? Blind faith requires truth accorded with human authority. However, it is with genuine faith where your truth is revealed. TRUTH is not for people to decide because TRUTH already existed even before we were even born. It was only unfortunate that we live in a time when an evil entity came and lorded over the world and imposed its own version of truth which they labeled Bible interpretation, it is just simply surprising, why people dont seem to realize the very meaning of the word. INTERPRET is not synonymous with TRUTH but rather it is a clear admission on the part of Christianity that they authored a PERVERTED VERSION of the Bible when they said they INTERPRETED the Bible.

Truth and Reality are absolutes that point beyond themselves to the reality of God who is both a logical and metaphysical necessity. You cannot even reason without presupposing that there is Reason within the universe itself. Every act of reasoning is clearly presupposing a Mind behind the universe itself albeit most people are doing this unwittingly. We call this Mind behind the universe God. All truth and all reality must have an absolute source for its existence. And the only thing that can ground and anchor truth and all reality is the reality of God. You would do well to contemplate the arguments from reason to grasp this better. God is a simple brute fact of reality. To argue against this is but a metaphysical tap dance with no basis in reality. Atheism cannot even form an argument against the reality of God. They tried with the argument from evil but that has clearly backfired on them for obvious reasons. ",

However, if we want to dig deeper into the definition of truth, couldn't we say that truth is only validated through a general consensus of human belief? What we know to be \"truth\" only holds up to our human standard of the concept. So maybe to some degree, truth does require our belief. That's something to think about, I guess. ",

No, the fact here is that you are dependent in every way to whatever else is going on in the universe. Prove that wrong. Spiritually, as you go into higher realms this is the case as well. If you were to move beyond time and space, you would discover your true self to be simply pure awareness.

No, pure awareness is the true you. the thing that sits behind all the activities you\u2019ve come to love and hate. This true you can never be destroyed, damaged, changed, or altered in any way. It is this way because it is what God is and the physical you and all your spirit bodies are molded around this pure awareness in order to live in time and space, to learn this truth.
