            "answer_text": "Your sentence: It begins with the words \u201cAs I understand it\u2026\u201d The implication is someone else can or will understand it in another way, and so is the next person, and so on. Without a universal definition of post-modernism, everybody will claim something about it without limitation on whims, manipulation, or desire for gratification. Where there is no common ground to do something together, brute force is the arbiter of the human affairs. Some guy will invoke some \u201cauthority\u201d, who happens to be one by popularity or official badge, but without proof of what he says. You will realize all you need is authority to be right. You will learn might makes it right. That is how destroying property in the name of \u201cprotest\u201d can be called \u201cpeaceful.\u201d As you understand it, \u201cpeace\u201d means something. As the next person understands it, \u201cpeace\u201d means something else. Eventually it comes down to the question who can destroy property and get away with it. That person is right. In a post-modern world, might makes it right. And that is the point of post-modernism. It is a confession of inability to produce, to look after oneself. Putsch or power grab are to compensate for their problem. A universal meaning of a word is what is common through all things that word is about. A universal meaning requires mental effort. It is not hidden in your thoughts or in the thing you talk about. You make it, but in a way that is true and provable by understanding the nature of the thing. Too much work? Well, apparently it is to the post-moderns. ",

            "answer_text": "A good example is Rachel Dolezal, who has been disavowed by the black community for pretending to have black ancestry to rise amongst to the top of the NAACP.  This is an example of rejection of values: being truthful and forthcoming. She would have been welcomed to help advance the NAACP cause as herself, so why conceal her real roots? After being forced to step down from her job, she still maintains that she didn\u2019t do anything wrong and justifies it by \u201cI identify as black\u201d. In a similar note, there was a 2007 movie that made quite a sension. Based on a true story, Surviving With The Wolves followed a Jewish girl who survived with a pack of wolves during WWII and crossed 3,000 Km (1,860 miles) to be reunited with her family. The movie was based on the 1997 autobiography of Misha Defonseca.  A lot of people thought the story was too good to be true, so after some digging it was uncovered that the author was actually catholic and her father had helped to round up some Jews during the occupation and had been executed as a traitor. Somehow she made up this story to cope with the shame and the loss and started to mix up reality with fantasy. This should explain why the NAACP might be a little bit peeved: the world doesn\u2019t have to bend around one person\u2019s distorted perception of reality. ",

Their work leads up to the World Wars, and is largely a sigh of pathos after the World Wars. ",
