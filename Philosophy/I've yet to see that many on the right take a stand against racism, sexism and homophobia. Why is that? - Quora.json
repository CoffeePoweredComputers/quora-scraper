            "answer_text": "Appreciation for Form of QuestionFirst I want to acknowledge the OP for how he asked his question \u2014 taking ownership for his own perception and allowing that the answer may be something outside of his current understanding. So many questions in Quora presume a conclusion and thus are not really seeking a different perspective that might help move our communities forward.  \u201cThe Right\u201d and \u201cThe Left\u201dIt\u2019s hard for me to answer this question because voluntaryist libertarians [2] don't think of ourselves as being \u201con the right\u201d [1], but I think our persepective is different enough that it could help some people \u201con the left\u201d realize that there are significantly different perspectives out here in the world. I wholeheartedly agree with the OP\u2019s implicit point that there are many different perceptions on this issue, even within left, right, libertarian, and authoritarian. Mine is just one, so I offer it to expand the set of solutions folks might consider.  Leaving Behind My Own ArroganceHaving come from the left, my principal concern has been the upliftment of the black underclass [3], so I understand the OP\u2019s concern. There are some severe problems. As a socialist, I thought that I also had The Solution. But I was not as generous as our OP. I concluded that if someone disagreed with my The Solution, they must want to perpetuate the problem, or at best, they didn\u2019t care \u2014 they were just callous bastards. It took me a long time to get to the point of the OP\u2019s understanding that there are an infinite number of possible solutions. My \u201cThe Solution\u201d was just one of those. And, it took even longer for me to realize that my youthful arrogance was not synonymous with prescience \u2014 as smart as I was, I couldn\u2019t possibly know what \u201cthe\u201d real solution would be for hundreds of millions of people interacting in billions of different way in every second out into the future. [4] (In fact it would take me a score or so of, mostly failed, new product launches to realize just how difficult predicting the future is. :) )  Why Might a Leftist Not Recognize My Concern About _____So, yes, some people may in fact want to perpetuate sexism, racism, homoism. But the vast majority of us just have a Different Solution. Which of the infinite possible solutions is better is certainly subject to debate, because the future is inherently unknowable. But, different does not mean none, nor does it mean that I don\u2019t care.  Do I have Solutions?I offer a few of my Different Solutions, not to debate their correctness by arguing that my crystal ball is better than your crystal ball at predicting these solutions\u2019 impacts of an infinite number of interactions across hundreds of millions of people out into every second of the future. Those discussions are better handled in other topics (alongside other unresolvable debates such as whether Batman could defeat Spiderman). I offer my Different Solutions simply to demonstrate that I do care. Now, after considerable, careful, compassionate thought, I think that my solutions have a higher likelihood of success. But, like I said, I can\u2019t predict the future, so I can certainly understand that others will disagree. (Heck, I at 20 years old would also have disagreed with me today.)  What Are (some of) My Solutions?So, here are a few principles that I think would have major impact on the issues you\u2019re concerned about, but which would lead to solutions different from those you think must be The Solution: Stop practicing being a victim.Stop creating ready excuses to stop trying.Focus on and copy success, rather than failure.If you don\u2019t want divisions, stop dividing people into groups.If you think it\u2019s wrong to attack someone for membership in group X, stop attacking people for membership in group Y.If you want equality, stop insisting on unequal treatment.Accept that people will have different outcomes depending on their different priorities [9] [5]Allow people to be free to do whatever they truly want [6]Stop trying to force people to live like you think they ought to live.Hold people accountable for their actions.Focus on creating ever greater wealth and freedom.Enable more people to engage in more win-win interactions.End the divisive win-lose interactions of government.Accept that the way different cultures interact with the world must logically produce different results in the world.Accept that the collective actions of group X will always impact group Y\u2019s opinion of group XAccept that group X can control their collective actions more readily than they can control group Y\u2019s collective reactionsAccept that ultimately one cannot control another person\u2019s biases [8]Allow more freedom of association \u2026 and of disassociation.Have fewer \u201ccommon areas\u201d where people are forced to associate.Use your own dis/association (e.g., market power) to punish/reward behavior you prefer [7]If you think someone is doing something incorrectly, compete with them by doing it \u201ccorrectly\u201d; if you think someone is doing something correctly, support them. But That Won\u2019t Work!Now, I have reasons why I think that these directions will have a much higher probability of solving the problems that we both see. And I understand if you disagree. This is why volutnaryism is so marvelous. We accept that people are different. That we see the world differently. And we have different preferences for how we want to try to solve problems in the world. Voluntaryists don\u2019t use violence to force anyone else to support our solutions. We ask that you allow each person the freedom to follow his unique path, as he allows you to follow your unique path. Given the freedom to test alternative solutions, we might, over time, be able to better guess whose solutions seems to work better. But at the very least, we can end the incessant bullying of trying to impose my solution rather than your solution on one another! :)  See related: Are Left and Right good ways to categorise political views?What is voluntaryist libertarian?How did you become a libertarian?What mistakes do politicians repeatedly make?Is income inequality acceptable?Why does regulation hurt the poor?What is the libertarian solution to the transgender bathroom issue?Do libertarians support affirmative action?Is there a gender pay gap? \u2192 Essays on <Prejudice: Racism, Agency, IQ> by Dennis \u2192 Return to the <Table of Contents> for Dennis\u2019 Libertarian Essays ",

            "answer_text": "Here's Why Rand Paul's Criminal Justice Comments Matter In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons \u2014 three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform. Rand Paul: GOP should be part of criminal justice reform \u201cI think the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted our African-American community,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need to do is make sure the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don\u2019t unfairly incarcerate another generation of African-American males.\u201d Paul\u2019s remarks come as lawmakers have introduced legislation in both the House and Senate to reduce certain mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders. The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassely (R-Iowa), has yet to make it to the floor for a vote and some critics have blammed conservatives for stalling efforts to get it there. Senator Compares War On Drugs To Jim Crow \u201cIf I told you that one out of three African-American males is forbidden by law from voting, you might think I was talking about Jim Crow 50 years ago,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYet today, a third of African-American males are still prevented from voting because of the war on drugs.\u201d Great discussion this morning on criminal justice reform with @prisonfellowshp interns. Keep fighting for liberty! pic.twitter.com/ZijicJzCVM\u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 14, 2016\n The Last Honest Man in Congress Criminal justice reform is a critically important issue, and it cuts across party lines. It's been my sense that this is one area where Republicans have been moving more and more in the right direction. Are they where I think they need to be? No. But I do think things are getting better, and I've found that there are more and more Republicans co-sponsoring legislation, taking votes on issues like marijuana that might not have happened 10 years ago. So I feel good about the direction things are taking. And I've seen reforms happen at the state level, too. It should be important to Republicans. If Republicans make it a priority, as I think they should, they'll start to win over more and more Democrats. Certainly there are a lot of black Americans who think these issues are critically important and who have felt left behind by both parties. It gives Republicans an opportunity to reach out. Mandatory minimums are not a conservative approach to criminal justice Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) is among the members of Congress who are seeking to reform the criminal justice system and reduce taxpayer costs through various targeted legislative avenues. Last week, he was part of a bicameral, bipartisan group of lawmakers who rolled out the Justice Safety Value Act -- H.R. 706 and S. 353 -- legislation that would give judges discretion to issue sentences for nonviolent offenders that are lower than mandatory minimums on a case-by-case basis.  Kushner Emerges as Powerful Criminal Justice Reform Advocate in White House - The Liberty Conservative According to a New York Times report, Kushner is pushing for criminal justice reform on issues such as ending mandatory minimums. However, he is faced with resistance from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a long-time drug warrior who favors harsh sentencing. Kushner\u2019s agenda is possibly being undermined by Trump staffers who question his credentials, the report claims. Conservatives Are Leading the Way as States Enact Criminal Justice Reform But criminal justice reform is still marching forward\u2014and the momentum is largely coming from conservatives, working in their state governments. The conservative case for reform is obvious: Spending billions of dollars on prison expansion and lengthy sentences is outdated and ineffective. And the state level is where reform will be the most effective\u2014the majority of people are incarcerated in state systems. Reducing that number helps states balance their budgets, said Lenore Anderson, president of Alliance for Safety and Justice, a criminal justice reform organization that centers on crime victims. \u201cContinued budget problems mean that regardless of who\u2019s in the White House, [criminal justice] is going to continue to be a ripe issue for reform.\u201d GOP Governors Push for Criminal Justice Reform | RealClearPolitics Conservatives must continue to lead the charge on justice reform by partnering with groups such as U.S. Justice Action Network to bring this issue to activists and leaders around the country. Currently, three governors are moving mountains in their home states to reform their criminal justice systems: Nathan Deal of Georgia and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, along with Bevin of Kentucky. (Tuesday morning in Cleveland, they will participate in a forum spotlighting the issue as Republcians gather for the party convention.) Why Do So Many Republicans Support Criminal Justice Reform? Senator Cornyn introduced the CORRECTIONS Act, which credits prisoners with time taken off their sentences for good behavior and for entering anti-recidivism programs. Cornyn's moderate bill is being combined with some of the mandatory minimum sentencing reforms from the Tea Party-backed SAFE Justice ACT. GOP contenders embrace criminal justice reform \u201cIt resonates with different conservatives for different reasons,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe fiscal argument is obvious \u2014 the U.S. spends billions on courts, police and correctional facilities. But you also have social conservatives concerned about what we\u2019re doing to our communities, and libertarians suspect of government overreach.\u201d The GOP Can Lead On Criminal Justice Reform \"There is absolutely nothing more frustrating, more damaging to your soul, than when you know you are following the rules\u2014and being treated like you are not,\" Scott said. 5 states where Republicans are getting serious about criminal justice reform Republican state Representative Eric Hutchings is sponsoring legislation that aims to reduce Utah's prison population and decrease recidivism. The bill, which has yet to be publicly released, would decrease the charge for drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor. Governor Gary Herbert, also a Republican, has put aside$10.5 million for recidivism reform. Governor Bruce Rauner's agenda includes a plan to keep nonviolent offenders out of prison by instead sending them to community programs. Earlier this week, he created a commission of lawmakers, cops, and activists to recommend reforms to the state's criminal justice system. More details about his plan will come out when he releases his 2016 budget recommendations next week. Platform Priorities: Criminal Justice Reform Unites Democrats and Republicans What some Republicans are saying about race and criminal justice reform \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that there are better ways to dealing with these problems than locking up someone for 20 or 30 years. You end up ruining their lives, ruining their families, hurting communities. And then when they try to reenter into society, they\u2019re destitute,\u201d Representative Ryan (R) of Wisconsin told NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep. ",
