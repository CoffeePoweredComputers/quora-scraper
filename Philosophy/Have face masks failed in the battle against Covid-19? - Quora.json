            "answer_text": "Thank you, my friend, for asking me to reply to your question. The failure to prevent the widespread contagion of the coronavirus isn\u2019t nearly as much due to the failure of the masks to prevent the dissemination of the virus, as it is a failure of people to wear the masks. A Gallup poll, released July 6th, 2020 reported 11% of Americans steadfastly refuse to wear a mask. Short of herd immunity, accomplished naturally, or by inoculation with a vaccine, about the only things we can do to slow the spread of a virus, is to social distance, wear masks, wash our hands frequently, use hand sanitizer when we are unable to wash, and self-quarantine if we become ill. A study performed by the Clark County Board of Health revealed if an infected person weren\u2019t wearing a mask, and a healthy person was wearing a mask, the healthy person stood a 70% chance of becoming infected. Yet, if both people were wearing a mask, the healthy person stood only a 2% chance of contracting the viral contagion. While observing every health precaution issued by the CDC and the NIH is not 100% effective\u2026observing the health precautions does slow the spread of the virus, and it does save lives. Included in those health precautions was the advise to wear the N 95 or the KN 95 masks. Anything less effective would be unsuccessful I hope you remain healthy, my friend, and enjoy a wonderful Morning. ",

            "answer_text": "No, face masks succeeded in many countries. The purpose of the mask was to slow the spread of Corona virus. Many countries were able to flatten the curve on their first wave. Canada was one of those countries. Unfortunately, we relaxed too much over the summer and now we are in a deadly second wave that is threatening to overwhelm our hospitals in some parts of the country. Even the Maritimes, which had done extremely well at keeping the virus out are now having increasing cases. BC, Manitoba and other provinces had very low case rates and now we are having spreader events. Yesterday BC had over 200 new cases in a 24 hour period, the highest so far. I am very concerned that people are not reverting to good health practices fast enough. Please for everyone\u2019s sake, wear your mask, social distance, wash your hands frequently and restrict your activities with others to small groups. Good luck to us all ",

Why are Trump and Pompeo lying about Canada wanting the border open? (including elaborating in the comments), C19 has \u2018caused\u2019 a mass hysteria. Or as the doctor in the following explains, C19 has caused mass psychosis\u2026 https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2020/10/delusional_psychosis_drives_americans_to_enforce_fearbased_covid_restrictions.html. The only thing I disagree with though, is what the doctor describes is not limited to the US. It most definitely afflicts masses of people throughout the world; Face masks have become symbolic, the badges, the markers, the shibboleths. Oh, and just to be clear, I called it last April: BIll Hemstock's answer to Did Trump \"promise\" to open up the country by Easter? ",
