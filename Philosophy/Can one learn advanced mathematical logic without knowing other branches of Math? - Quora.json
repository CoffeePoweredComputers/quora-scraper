            "answer_text": "I did a Master in Mathematical Logic at Paris VII Denis Diderot. We were a little less than twenty studying it this year and four or five of them have no prior exposition to mathematics (at least since high school). They mostly came from Philosophy. Based on that experience, I can tell that it is possible to study Logic without knowing other branches of Mathematics but it will probably be difficult (or at least more difficult than for a student having some strong mathematical background) and it may forces you to learn some Maths. And it really depends on which branch of Mathematical Logic you want to study. Proof Theory is probably the best way to start for someone with no mathematical knowledge. Natural Deduction, Sequent Calculus, Lambda-Calculus, Type Theory and a lot of other subjects in Proof Theory does not assume any Mathematics. You may want to get a little Linear Algebra, Order Theory, basic Algebra if you want to understand Denotational Semantics or Linear Logic for example. But you can pick those along the line.Theoretically Set Theory, being a foundation of Maths, does not rely on any other mathematical theory. In practice, you will need some good intuition about properties of sets and functions. High school mathematics should be enough for most of it, but if you want to really understand the axiom of choice, ordinals or cardinals, you may want to be used to manipulating infinite sets.For Computability Theory (a.k.a Recursion Theory) you may want to have some familiarity with some basic properties of functions. There Computer Science may be more interesting than Maths. In particular, notions in Algorithmics may be needed.Finally, Model Theory is virtually impossible without undergraduate Mathematics. Most of the examples of models will come from Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, Linear Algebra, Order Theory\u2026 Some basic theories that Model Theory is interested about are (theory of) dcpos (direct-complete partial orders) or acf (algebraically closed fields). Some notions may (and probably should) be considered as generalization of notions from Algebraic Geometry. If you go a little further than the standard theorems then General Topology will become handy. Furthermore, it is not really useful to study Model Theory without mathematical background since Model Theory is interested about models of mathematical theories.In short, apart from Model Theory, mathematical background is not a prerequisite for mathematical logic. It is definitely a plus though. And when you begin to look at more advanced subjects in these fields you will have to look in more depth in other mathematical branches. Sorry for my english, feel free to correct any mistake. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it possible to learn and study foundations of math without any knowledge in real analysys, topology, and linear algebra? Absolutely. True, RA is almost of no use in logic and will hardly help you. However, if you don't know topology, a substantial part of representations of intuitionistic and modal logics will be missed. If you don't know LA, it would be hardly possible for you to study quantum logic. And so on. Sure, these subjects aren't really a part of math foundatons (only classical and maybe intuitionist or constructive logics are by now foundations of different mathematical approaches), they are only formally so. They are, however, important and lively parts of logic in general and hence could be worth studying. ",
