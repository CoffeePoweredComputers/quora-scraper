            "answer_text": "To be clear, high self esteem isn't high confidence, isn't egotistical, isn't self centered. Obviously were playing semantics games at this point but it's valuable to recognize that you can be proud of your accomplishments, love and trust yourself, think you're the best thing since sliced bread, or act and choose as if you are all that matters\u2026. And any combination of those. So high self esteem? That's confidence in your self and abilities. Respect for your own being. There are few if any cons. The benefit of respecting yourself unconditionally is paramount to evolving your person. Respect for yourself both removes susceptibility to external insult and pressure, and improves your ability to act honestly and with integrity. If you respect yourself, you honor the most integrated tool you've been given in this life. And when that occurs, the potential for you to make a positive impact on the world and community around you grows. The perceived cons of self esteem are actually elements of egotistical and self centeredness. ",
