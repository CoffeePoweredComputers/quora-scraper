            "answer_text": "If we have arbitrary definitions of words, we can prove what we want using language. \u201cEmpirical\u201d is a very interesting and much misused word. It is derived from \u201cempirikos\u201d, which translates as \u201cexperience\u201d. It is, then, an empirical truth that we experience the world. However, that's all that can be said without logical induction or deduction. Here's why:  Word definitions are always ironic. One can see from this set of words that \u201cexperience\u201d of the word \u201cempirical\u201d definitely does not allow logical associations to be formed between it and other words which are not itself. What empirical method would allow that? Clearly, no method for assembling ontology can be empirical. How is \u201cabstract connectivity of meaning\u201d observed? It's not. Verification is a logical procedure. It is necessarily so. Observations produce no necessities. See how the definition uses sleight of hand? \u201cPure\u201d logic? What logic is \u201cnot quite logic but a fusion of logic and something else\u201d? Also, how do the synonyms of factual and real follow? They are not verifiable by observation without recourse to logic. It's really quite funny. See, etymology is everything. If we forget where words come from, what we say can make sense by invention. This is what empiricism attempts to avoid, rightly. However, it cannot reveal truth by itself. From their word-origins, the components of the famous phrase \u201cverified by empirical evidence\u201d translate to \u201cit is true because I clearly experienced it\u201d. If our perceptions define truth then this is true. If we are fallible at all, it is ironic. ",
