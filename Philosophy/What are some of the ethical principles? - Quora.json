            "answer_text": "Three basic principles, among those generally accepted in our cultural tradition, are particularly relevant to the ethics of research involving human subjects: the principles of respect of persons, beneficence and justice. These are based on the Belmont Report. 1. Respect for Persons. -- Respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions: first, that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection. The principle of respect for persons thus divides into two separate moral requirements: the requirement to acknowledge autonomy and the requirement to protect those with diminished autonomy. In most cases of research involving human subjects, respect for persons demands that subjects enter into the research voluntarily and with adequate information. To respect autonomy is to give weight to autonomous persons' considered opinions and choices while refraining from obstructing their actions unless they are clearly detrimental to others. Respect for the immature and the incapacitated may require protecting them as they mature or while they are incapacitated. Some persons are in need of extensive protection. The extent of protection afforded should depend upon the risk of harm and the likelihood of benefit. The judgment that any individual lacks autonomy should be periodically reevaluated and will vary in different situations. 2. Beneficence. -- Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by making efforts to secure their well-being. Such treatment falls under the principle of beneficence. Two general rules have been formulated as complementary expressions of beneficent actions in this sense: (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. As with all hard cases, the different claims covered by the principle of beneficence may come into conflict and force difficult choices. 3. Justice. -- Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens? This is a question of justice, in the sense of \u201cfairness in distribution\u201d or \u201cwhat is deserved.\u201d An injustice occurs when some benefit to which a person is entitled is denied without good reason or when some burden is imposed unduly. Another way of conceiving the principle of justice is that equals ought to be treated equally. ",

            "answer_text": "Basic principle of ethics is simple-CLEAR YOUR CONSCIENCE FIRST THEN JUDGE. It easier said than done. One has to delve into critical issues of a matter first, resolve dilemmas and then justify the acts to ensue. 'An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth' can be a principle of historical times, but it does not serve any good in present times, because we have established laws that bind our behaviour. A few examples of ethical considerations can help us to make this more clear:1. LEGAL PROFESSIONAL ETHICS : A lawyer is appointed to defend an accused found guilty as evidences are against him. Somehow the lawyer is convinced that the accused man is not guilty; professional ethics demands that the innocent should not be punished even if evidences go against him. The lawyer chooses to fight the case, because it is a search of self-identity which will ultimately become synonymous with the society's identity ,which needs a society based on true justice.2. BUSINESS ETHICS : Should a drug be sold by a company which has been found to contain compounds causing health hazards ? The drug was continued because earlier researches were in favour of it, should it be continued still in the light of new research ? Business ethics demand that a business can not run risking peoples' lives.3. SCIENTIFIC ETHICS : Should unabated genetics research be continued for producing hybrid species( monkeys) to be later used as source of cheap labour ? Scientific ethics demand that unknown risks associated with genetic manipulation should not be continued as outcome of such an act could be disastrous. Genetic research should be continued within known limits of risks. This is because any reversal of the experiment may be ruled out for ever, and scientific community can not save the world from imminent dangers.So a clear and objective evaluation of the situation should be made first, so that we can act with conscience. That is the best principle of ethics. ",
