            "answer_text": "One good way is to volunteer or against for ballot measures. Legalizing marijuana, marriage equality, local construction projects, etc. all generate ballot measures that are put before the voters and none are tied to any one party.  Another good way is to support individual candidates in nonpartisan primary and general elections. Here in Portland, for example, although the statewide elected officials and state legislature in Oregon are elected under party labels, the primary and general elections for Mayor, city council, and county commissioners are all non-partisan, and there is plenty of opportunity to get involved as much or as little as you like. Many local elections (school board, water board, etc.) in most locations are nonpartisan. ",
