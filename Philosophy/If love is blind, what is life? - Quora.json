            "answer_text": "Life and love are indeed two different things.. To exist is to live, and it is rarely possible to live without love in our lives.. One feels so empty without love in one form or the other.. Love is blind, is an understatement.. love implies that we give the people in our lives a lot more significance over ourselves.. It is a good thing.. Better to live selfless rather than lead a selfish life, without caring for anyone.. Too much of anything is dangerous, and that is true for love also.. That is the case when people usually say that love is blind.. !! Well it depends from person to person.. ",

Whatever you get in life, you get because you deserve. You have to work hard and you have prove yourself worthy of the things you need. Life sees and feels, alright. It doesn't listen. It never will. So show Life that you're worth it. And see how it works for you. :) ",
