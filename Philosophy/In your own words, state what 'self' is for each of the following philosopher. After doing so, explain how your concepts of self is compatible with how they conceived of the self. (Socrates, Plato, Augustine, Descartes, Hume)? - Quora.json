            "answer_text": "In my own words, this is what \u201cSelf\u201d meant to each of these philosophers: Socrates believed in God, angels, an afterlife and an eternal soul. For Socrates, the Self is an \u201ceternal soul\u201d temporarily visiting this Temporal Realm, in which all things are temporary. Socrates often said he was called to his Dialogue avocation by a daimon (angel). He raised the possibility that death was simply \u201cnothing,\u201d but his actions extolled an eternal soul above his temporal appetites and emotions.Plato echoed Socrates in literally everything. Since Socrates wrote nothing, and Plato wrote virtually all we know about Socrates, we see Plato extolling the \u201cRealm of Eternal Forms,\u201d of which our temporal, material world of things is a clumsy imitation. The Eternal Realm is the Divine Realm \u2014 the realm of the eternal soul.Bishop Augustine, a famous Christian, interpreted Religion through Greek philosophy so that heaven was the Eternal Realm and even Rome herself could not truly be the City of God, because it was temporal. Some see a direct line between Augustine and Plato \u2014 the idea of Self as an eternal soul, traveling through history inside a temporary body of temptations.Rene Descartes, another Christian, gave us the method of Doubt. For Descartes, to find Certainty, we must Doubt everything. Doubt that heaven exists. Doubt that God exists. Doubt that the Cosmos exists (i.e. it\u2019s only a dream). Yet no matter how hard we try, we can never Doubt one fact: \u201cI think therefore I am.\u201d This is because Doubting is a form of thinking. So, for Descartes, the \u201cSelf\u201d is Transcendental and Absolute Certainty. This was his unique version of the eternal soul.David Hume, a non-Christian, gave us the method of Skepticism. For Hume, we can only be certain of our sense impressions \u2014 but these are weak and puny compared to the gargantuan, infinite Cosmos. In fact, the human mind is too puny to ever know the Truth, he argued. So, we are justified in always being Skeptical about any claims of Truth. For Hume, Reason is merely the \u201cSlave of the Passions,\u201d like a mapmaker telling the Passions the best route to satisfaction and safety. Even the Self, for Hume, was a mere \u201cbundle of sensations,\u201d for which we seek any pattern, and call it, \u201cSelf.\u201dIn my personal view, The first four thinkers were correct. While David Hume was an imp who deliberately enjoyed mocking his students and readers. He didn\u2019t mean the half of it. (This is a common scholastic view of Hume.) ",

            "answer_text": "I can give a general overview: Socrates and Plato both viewed the self as the immaterial part of a human being \u2014 the part that is, in theory, fully separate from the material part. In this, they echoed Asian philosophers, and The Republic seems to speak of reincarnation as well as the afterlife. Augustine accepted the same position, but felt it was \u201cthe soul\u201d (a similar concept), and it was created directly by God, at the time a person is born, and placed in a physical body. But he spoke of a single Judgment rather than a cycle of reincarnation. Descartes had a similar concept of \u201csoul\u201d as Augustine. However, Descartes was a scientist, and he tended to emphasize the soul operating in parallel to the physical world. This created \u201cdualism,\u201d and the obvious problem everyone had with it for centuries was: How did the immaterial part of the self (the soul) interact with the material body, if they were so separate? Various solutions were proposed, such as the \u201cparallel clocks\u201d theory. This was less of an issue for Plato, as he simply thought the material world was much less real than the immaterial world. Finally, we come to Hume, who is the only really strong departure. Hume asked, what had Descartes really proved with \u201cI think therefore I am.\u201d Descartes felt he had proved the existence not just of the self (which is trivial) but rather the existence of the self as a Thinking Being\u2026 because the entire physical universe could be an illusion \u2014 as in \u201cThe Matrix\u201d \u2014 but your mind MUST exit. Hume countered, as follows: What Descartes proved was the existence of an ongoing, indestructible soul or self, but rather just the existence of thought. So, you may not be a \u201cself\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d\u2026 but it is true that there may be the thoughts \u201cI think therefore I am.\u201d But what does that prove? There are mental events, Hume conceded (namely thinking going on) but not necessarily souls having those thoughts. That\u2019s just an assumption. But Kant, alarmed by this doctrine, responded with a philosophy of his own, which made the Mind itself fundamental in organizing the universe. My concepts? A long story. But I tend to find the existence for non-material events (the Chinese Room, the Mary Problem) to be extremely convincing. So I would tend to say, with ALL of these philosophers, that there is something about mental events not fully reducible to physical, material events. That POV had been out of fashion in Philosophy departments for a long time, thanks in part to Gilbert Ryle\u2019s \u201cThe Ghost in the Machine,\u201d but the pendulum is starting to swing back the other way.
