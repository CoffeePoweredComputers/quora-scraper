            "answer_text": "It's a good question. If you assume we don't have souls jumping around from body to body, then our consciousness has to be a product of a novel dynamic of cells. If we're  just stuff then we aren't any different than an extremely elaborate Rube Goldberg machine or a rock tumbling down a mountain. So yes I believe there's a universal consciousness. That's the easy part.  The hard question - I believe - is how can any individuation happen? Why did I become me and why did coral become coral?  I guess one could invoke some form of the anthropic principal and say that the reason that Lucille Ball was Lucille Ball and Dezi Arnes was Dezi Arnes is that it would be impossible for it to be anything other than that. Obviously they can't cohabitate the same body. And obviously they aren't  consciousless automatons either. So  circumstances demand that a mind be a self. Another twist, seemingly we were in the same state prior to birth as we will be after death: a state of nothing. So, that makes me believe that we will probably live again but we will have no conception of the infinite lives we once lived. Which brings me back to the paradoxical question: how does individuation occur? ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. A single universal consciousness implies information could travel effortlessly from one individual to another. Perhaps even if they were separated by miles (or light years). But not the slightest evidence of such information movement has ever been observed. Consciousness is a fragile property which is attained only when a great many things are working properly together, the slightest impact, chemical imbalance, or the gentle stirring with a spoon, will disrupt consciousness (or break it altogether). So each individual consciousness lives in its own little silo, utterly alone, and only able to guess the existence of other consciousness by inference, language and clues of purposeful agency. The only way there is just one consciousness, is if I am real, and the rest of you are simply pretending. (Myself being the only consciousness I have actual evidence for. ) ",
