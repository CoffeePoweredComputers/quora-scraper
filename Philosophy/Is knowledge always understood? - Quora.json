That's what understanding is. It is a deep question. A good question. And goes hand in hand. You need to know to understand and you need to understand to know. So knowlege without understanding would make you a really stupid person. And understanding without knowing a really smart person. But there are stuff you need to know to understand. But theres also stuff you need to understand to know. And how much and fast is how intelligent you are. That's what the brain calculate, imagine, comes up with, weights up and produce as product for knowing or understanding. So knowing is the product and understanding is the result. Like evil twins those to. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Knowing the names of many things doesn\u2019t equate knowing them in details comprehensively. For example, we can see stars in the sky at night but we know very little about each star. Having some information isn\u2019t knowing everything and understand what the information is about. One can understand if sufficient information is available. If observation is needed, it must be done. If analysis is needed, it must be done. A student of medicine cannot understand the level of a medical professor. That certainly means reading and having knowledge don\u2019t even mean understanding about the subject literally. ",
