            "answer_text": "TL; DR: The universe is incredibly vast and old. We know a little bit about the fundamental laws that govern it. From both these things, it\u2019s quite obvious that humans, and our pain and pleasure thereof, are irrelevant to the grand scheme of things. Since we are absolutely irrelevant, the \u201ccreators of the simulation\u201d, would have been indifferent to what we go through. It\u2019d be incredibly arrogant to assume that we are somehow important in a universe this mindbogglingly vast.  If the end goal of this simulation was in any way related to humans, this simulation would be a huge waste of resources. Think about it. The size and age of the universe, compared to the space and time that we inhabit, are colossal. If this was a simulation, it makes more sense that we are just an inconsequential by-product than the primary subjects. Let\u2019s run with that. The aim of the simulation has nothing to do with humans. Why would the pain or pleasure of humans, or any other species on earth, matter? That would be like worrying that poles are getting knocked down in any of the GTA games. Duh! The poles and other objects were never a consideration, it\u2019s the cars zooming around that matters. In our universe, life on earth is totally insignificant to the simulator. The things that matter should be on the scale of galaxies. From what we know about the universe, the rules of the simulation apply at a far lower level than human conscience. The basic laws apply to the tiny sub-sub-atomic particles and in the form of a handful of forces. Human emotion pops out as a result of incredibly complex interactions between these fundamental phenomena. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine if you could create a simulation of any universe you wanted. What would you use this for? You could use it for entertainment, but you could also use it to solve real problems. Say, for example, you needed a lifeform that could survive at 200 degrees F. You could work really hard to figure out how to make one, but that\u2019s a lot of work. Alternatively, you could just simulate millions of copies of this universe and gradually increase the temperature of the Earth over billions of simulated years. Perhaps one of those simulations would produce a lifeform that could survive when the temperature hit 200 degrees F. However, for this to be useful to you, the simulation has to be a lot like the universe you live in. If the simulation has, for example, different laws of physics, then the lifeform you now know how to create couldn\u2019t live in your universe anyway. So if simulations are for practical purposes, the simulated universe needs to be a lot like the one the simulator operator lives in. If there universe is one where suffering is likely, and they want answers that apply to their universe, they\u2019d have to simulate one where suffering is likely. ",

More often than not it was more fun to make stupid design choices, like build a ten-bedroom house, but have exactly one toilet located in an outhouse that was difficult to get to. No, it's not a reasonable assumption that the creators would create a paradise. Ultimately it would depend on what the purpose of the simulation was. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Suffering is essential to a simulated universe, lest it\u2019s inhabitants become too educated and resourceful they rise up and forcefully remove themselves from the simulation. Suffering and death also occupy a significant portion of our concerns. Humans spend a fair amount of time each day simply not trying to die. Now think about how much time goes into humanity collectively feeding, clothing, and caring for itself. Now you\u2019ll get the picture. ",
