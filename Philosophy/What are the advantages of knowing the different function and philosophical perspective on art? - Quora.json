            "answer_text": "The more we know, the more we see, that\u2019s as philosophy - love for wisdom - may be, life as good enough to death. Without birth\u2026 nobody can die. So there\u2019s that rule. Art\u2026 apart\u2026 we see from the shadows\u2026 light. From silence\u2026 peace\u2026 or fear. From balance, niece, and here. Taught freedom, children fly, teach them prisons, and they will die. So\u2026 life, art itself, is not a \u2018passing by\u2019, entertaining waiting for the \u2018Royal\u2019 Flight, but directing our minds and souls to there\u2026 the beginning, not the cannon, we\u2019re not bullets, but the one holding the lighter. We know birds fly, we know eggs make as frogs as chickens, and we, humans, eat both, and also the fishes. God is not a cook, and we are not food. Art \u2026 spreads that, visions to all perspectives around, as a match can blow up a bomb. Art frees our minds, but not only, so vegetables, and molecules, as snow and atoms, grow better with music, harmonically produced, reproduced by and among us, human. As a match can explode a bomb, art is the poison of the arrow, as if expanding the snake's mouth to take a single bite ... on the human being who feels it. Art is a feeling, expressed only among and from humans\u2026 perhaps to say \u2018no\u2019, to contest, Nature, as perfection. ",

            "answer_text": "Enjoyment and understanding. Knowing why artists all over one country made art one way and why artists in another time and place made very different art is fascinating and enriches the experience of looking at art. People who love sports know the functions and purposes of the different aspects of the sport. People who love science know how and why and when of thousands of details of biology or physics or entomology etc. Arts are the unique expressions of entire civilizations across all of the known areas and times that people created symbols of what they knew and felt. Art is the way people express and understand meaning of symbolic objectification of all aspects of reality and imagination. ",
