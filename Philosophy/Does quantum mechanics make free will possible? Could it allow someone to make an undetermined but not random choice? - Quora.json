            "answer_text": "First note that the point of free will, and the only reason anyone bothers to talk about it, is that it\u2019s whatever it happens to be that makes it moral to blame and/or punish someone for doing something bad. Unfortunately, people have had different and incompatible intuitions about what exactly that is. One tradition has been to see free will in contrast with determinism, and since quantum mechanics is non-deterministic ex hypothesis, that would seem to allow free will. However Daniel Dennett points out, I think convincingly, that what we want free will to be is much more directly opposed to reductionism. We want the person to be a moral-scenario-processing black box, with no inputs other than the moral scenario that they\u2019re supposed to do the right thing in. We especially don\u2019t want there to be inputs from divine intervention, or evil scientists, or duress more generally. But to fulfill the point (as outlined above), we also don\u2019t want there to be internal workings (such as neurons or the like) that are not full moral agents. If the firing or not of some neuron is on the causal chain to pulling the lever in the Trolley problem, and it\u2019s fated to, say, fire, because of a deterministic chain of dependencies on other neurons including those for sight/hearing/touch etc, the problem is not so much that it\u2019s determined as that it\u2019s taking input that is not in and of itself moral data. (The fact that a particular cone cell in the retina fired at a particular time has no moral salience in and of itself, even if it was part of a view of a runaway trolley.) So if you then allow that the neuron can also/instead take as input some irreducible randomness from quantum mechanics, you haven\u2019t actually fixed anything, because it wasn\u2019t moral input.

            "answer_text": "No, this is both a misunderstanding of free will, a misunderstanding of quantum mechanics and a misunderstanding of randomness. There is a very widespread error, particularly among beginner philosophers, that free will is a metaphysical question about how we make decisions, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s the simple observation that we do make choices among a range of possible alternatives. Nothing else is actually required. It\u2019s seen as more than that because it\u2019s seen as related to questions of ethics and morality. Any undetermined decision necessarily has an element of randomness, even if it\u2019s constrained by deterministic considerations, and it can easily be seen that reducing the randomness is equivalent to increasing the determination of the decision making process. Ultimately this line of reliance on \u201cindeterministic\u201d decision making means disregarding all prior considerations, including our objectives and our knowledge of the world, including things like morality. It\u2019s a claim that we can only make moral decisions if we have no knowledge or concept of morality. Which is absurd. ",

Quantum physics has interpretations some deterministic and some indeterministic where events are random in nature. The first interpretation means that our choices are determined for us the second means our choices are randomly made in both cases we are not the one's determining them and the world falls into the second category also.

            "answer_text": "I would say no. Free-will needs some amount of determinism, if only to make sense of some planning and anticipating. Then, the more you add indeterminacy, the more you threatened that free will. Quantum Mechanics does not add any free-will, but it does not demolish it either, as the probability distribution remains predictable, and we can prepare the states so that we can use them according tp our possible goal. Fee-will is just the ability to make choice in context where only partial information is available. It does not matter that a god or a super-machine can predict the choice I will make. ",

Nobody knows what implications this has for free will, but the prospect that humans and other animals have free will does seem significantly enhanced by quantum physics. Pre-quantum \u201cclassical physics,\u201d by contrast, was rigidly deterministic: The present was thought to be entirely determined by past events. Thus classical physics seemed to have no room for free will. Today, this question seems much more open. ",
