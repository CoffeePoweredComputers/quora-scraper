            "answer_text": "There are many people in this world who do not want to face the realities of life and of everyday existence. Reality ,however harsh it is ,does not bother the man or woman who have faced hardships and struggle. They continue to live a normal life and remain unfazed by the hardships they face.The realist and the pragmatist know that they cant lose what they never had and would not be able to hold on to something which does not want to stay with them . Rousseau had said that the struggling people had nothing to lose except their chains. Encountering harsh realities strengthens the mind and liberates it from the bondage of the past.The late A P J kalam had once said that \u201cthe past is a waste paper,present is News paper and the future is question paper\u201d.Those who have led a sheltered existence aloof from the harsh realities become mentally unstable and destabilised when by a change in circumstances they experience the horrible reality.We all know the history of Queen Marie Antoinette ,wife of Louis xvI of France during the French revolution.She was the daughter of Maria Theresa, empress of Austria,and became the queen of the Bourbon dynasty of France and never faced the harsh realities of life. Rousseau once attributed a quote to her, that when the starving peasants could not afford to eat bread,Marie Antoinette had commented that \u201cif they could not eat bread they could eat cake \u201c.She could not have possibly said it but the quote reflects the mindset of prevelaged people who are far removed from the harsh realities of life. The French revolution changed the fortunes of the French monarchy. Marie Antoinette was imprisoned in the Bastille and in one day her beautiful hair turned white.She and her husband were guillotined. Before her death she is reported to have said \u201d I was a queen and you took away my crown,A wife and you killed my husband, a mother and you deprived me of my children ,my blood alone remains:take it but do not make me suffer long\".She had realised before her death that the powerful monarchies of the Hapsburg empires of Austria and Prussia and other European countries could not save her from the terrible fate she met.Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. There are however examples of people who are quick to adopt. A bed ridden girl who was much pampered by her mother was unable to get out of her bed though she had become well and as time passed she got used to stay in bed and food was provided by her mother. Her neighbours were made to understand that she was unwell. Suddenly her mother died one day and the poor girl remained bed ridden for a few days and then she rose and started doing the household chores much to the surprise of her neighbours. The circumstances forced her to change. The moral of the story is that the parents however well placed should never let their children away from the realities of life and let them be exposed to the horrific existence led by many people. The father of Emperor Frederick the great of Prussia found out that his son Frederick led an aimless life and wrote poetry and was not suitable to be the future Emperor. He was put through rigourous tests in practical life which changed his views on life and made him a great monarch of the Hohenzollern dynasty. In daily life frequently we have seen the sons of businessmen learning the ropes of the trade from their fathers. Therefore as one wit commented that harsh reality is always better than false hope .We become weak in our resolve if we are brought up in luxury and tend to take every thing for granted. Success and failures are a part of our lives and we need to be practical and change our perceptions. ",
