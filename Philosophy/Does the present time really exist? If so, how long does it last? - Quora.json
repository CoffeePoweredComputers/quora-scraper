            "answer_text": "Time is an abstraction, but corresponds to some things we can measure, as well as some things we can feel or experience. As such there\u2019s a tension between the physical concept of time, and time as experienced, even though I happen to believe that they are fundamentally connected together. That means that if I try to answer the question with just the physicist\u2019s time, or the psychologist\u2019s time only, my answer will probably be thought inadequate. There are several land mines here. It will take a little mine sweeping, but it will all be worth it. Zeno\u2019s paradoxes are all founded on treating times as discrete times of zero extent, and asking whether duration, motion or time, exists at all. Zeno declared that they don\u2019t. Whereas if you treat times as a continuum of infinitesimal times, an innovation of Liebnitz and Newton, you have a model for describing the passing of time and of motion. This model was originally rather sloppy, but has been made rigorous enough to pretty adequately refute Zeno. So I think we can safely navigate around this one, and conclude that change and motion are real things and times do really succeed one another. This pretty much allows the physicist\u2019s time to behave in the way we have come to expect from our psychological intuitions about it. The other land mine is the usage of the word exists. Something can exist at a certain time, for a certain duration, or for all times. So certain usages of the word are temporally dependent. So the assertion, the present time exists, is ambiguous. To clear that up, consider a physical object, X. It may only exist for a given duration. So we can ask if X exists, and we can say it does at any time in the duration. Outside the duration of the object it does not. Now, imagine if we say that X exists in the duration. In that case we can say that it does, even when we say this outside the duration, since we are describing the existence in relation to the duration. However we are asking about the time dependent existence of a temporal concept. So we have to be even more careful! So here\u2019smy solution. Any moment in time is in the present when it is happening. That particular time exists, by which I mean it is the present moment, only at that particular time. That particular moment is the present only at that time and no other. So that particular present exists only at that particular time and no other. So it exists instantaneously and has no duration.After it exists instantaneously it ceases to exist. This is in turn true of each successive moment. if we are referring to a particular moment in time which is the present moment\u2014then what we refer to then as \u201cthe present\u201d exists, but only at that moment.If we are referring to all moments of time\u2014at the moment they occur\u2014then \u201cthe present\u201d exists for all time.",

Each of us has our own individual cognition of time, and science has shown that time in deed is not absolute, but is dependent upon another's relative perspectives (frame of reference). Additionally, appx a third of the human population is at any given \"time\" asleep and thus are in principle unconscious and are completely unaware of any concept of \"present time\". And time, in actual fact, does not exist at all. Time has absolutely no physical properties. No smell, no weight, no nothing. Time does not exist in the physical world. Time is an entirely intellectual concept. An idea. Since time as such does not exist in physical world, it makes no sense asking for its longevity. You could as well ask for the weight of one meter. Or the color of short. Or the age of blue. You're in effect asking for a physical quantification of a non-physical entity. I.e. asking for the length of an idea. ",

            "answer_text": "The present exists, of course. It\u2019s the only thing which does exist. Everything else is either a memory or a speculation. However, it can\u2019t be called \u201ctime\u201d because time is a metric, not a moment. The present moment lasts forever, of course. What you didn\u2019t ask explicitly seems to be implicit, unless I am reading into your question more meaning than it has. I infer from your question you want to know how to focus your attention on the Now so you can feel it for yourself, probably after hearing and reading about that from others. It is possible. The problem is not that it is impossible or even difficult; it\u2019s just so brief that it is hard to remember it even happened. People unwittingly come back into the present moment naturally, not often but it happens. It has to do with a feature of attention which allows it to be free from thought on occasion. For a brief flicker of a moment, we are there. Or, rather, here, in the Now. The Now moves on and so do we, back into the thoughts. So the question becomes, how to will ourselves into the present moment. Even willed, it is tantalizingly brief. Anyone who claims to live in the present moment is either lying or they are just saying words to make themselves feel good; it isn\u2019t real. But enough returns to that brief moment and we begin to have a second life within this one. Part of the problem is that the \u201creality\u201d of the present moment is uncharacteristically intense. We aren\u2019t used to that intensity and that\u2019s part of the reason why the moments of being present are so very brief. But we can come back as often as we can remember to will ourselves back into the present moment. If this was inside your question, then you can start your attempts by paying attention to your attention. It sounds strange and it takes years of work to get the hang of, but it\u2019s worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "Information is flying at us in the form of a storm of mixed photons coming from innumerable directions and innumerable objects. We must find patterns in that storm. Since it never stops, is always changing, and never repeats, we must stop it long enough to distinguish possible patterns and choose those that are most likely to tell us what is happening in the outside world. After we choose the patterns we must find meanings that fit them best. Once those meanings are selected, the brain forms an image of what it thinks we should have seen. That image is sent to our conscious mind and we see a picture of the outside world. We do this at the rate of about 60 frames per second. The outside world keeps on changing which is good because we only understand information about change. So, while the outside world does not have a present, we do. Interestingly, our present consists of all of the past up to the moment that a new frame begins to be formed. Those photons come from physically very close to us to distances traveled by photons that come from all the way back to near the beginning of the Universe. Whether or not there was a Big Bang Beginning would change this somewhat, but whatever the case, we are seeing the past of the Universe as our present. Our present lasts for about 1/60th of a second.

On the other hand, it might vary with consviousness or authenticity as well. In the life I thought I was Rip Van Winkl, it took 'a lot of thinking\u2019 to slow things down. Also, in medieval times I think it was more about composition and what people said than it was about realtime. Boredom may have been the only way to have slow time, but there tended to be enough time back then. Also, in a dream state time passes very differently, often much slower for a few seconds, much faster for most of the time one is asleep. Then when one wakes up one is compensated by forgetting how long the dream took. ",
