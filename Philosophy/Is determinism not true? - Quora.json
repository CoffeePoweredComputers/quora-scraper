            "answer_text": "Determinism is true, although most people will argue against it for emotional reasons. There are various types of determinism, but for our purposes, let's definite it as follows: \u201cThe idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature\u201d. The scientific worldview is based on this premise. People who don\u2019t believe that this is true, essentially believe in magic. Magic is the belief that the laws of nature, and the normal laws of cause and effect, can be overridden. Belief in souls, and in free will are thus beliefs in magic. However, I have learned that just as rational argument often does not convince a religious person that souls don\u2019t exist, so rational argument wont convince most people that they don\u2019t have free will. In my experience, women in particular tend to object vociferously to the idea of determinism. Usually people resort to silly arguments like; \u2018If determinism is true then what you are saying now is determined\u2019, or; \u2018I can feel that I have free will\u2019. !!! Even in the academic literature, you will find stupid arguments against determinism. For example, people argue that that fact that physicists have so far been unable to discern all the laws of nature within extremely tiny particles that this somehow means that determinism is not true and that everything is random. This is arguably no less ignorant than the ancient beliefs in magic just because the natural laws were not known at the time. For example, people used to dance and sing in order to induce rain to fall. Nowadays we realise what causes rain and therefore we don\u2019t dance and sing to induce it.Even if there is causal indeterminacy at a minuscule level, then this is actually evidence against free will not for it! Random events and chaos is not freedom or causal agency of the will.The belief in free will (and souls) is deeply ingrained in most people, and they would be psychologically troubled by the fact that they have no choice. You did not have a choice to be born, the ability to choose your school, or the country in which you were born, your gender, height, etc. In fact, you don\u2019t have a choice whether or not to read this. Each action in your life history stretches back to your birth and far, far beyond it. Even your every thought is caused by a myriad of factors such as sense data, previous thoughts, brain chemicals, etc. Just as you don\u2019t have a choice whether it rains tomorrow, so you don\u2019t control your actions or your life. There are interesting arguments for compatibilism, or the belief that free will is possible despite the fact that determinism is true. If I had time, I would argue that some form of compatibilism is true. It simply requires of us that we redefine what we ordinarily consider free will to be. Nevertheless, determinism is true. It will piss most people off. But that is predictable. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, determinism is not true. The logical argument given is more an indication that, IF determination was true, we could not actually know it (rationally affirm it). I don\u2019t think that we can prove or disprove determinism through logic alone. Aside from the arguments against determinism from quantum mechanics, there realistically is no question that free will is factual. Either we completely abandon empirical science or we consider free will to be fact. We directly experience it literally every waking moment of our lives. I\u2019ve learned to be highly skeptical of anyone saying that evidence is an illusion and that I should trust their beliefs rather than evidence. I also don\u2019t believe in extreme coincidences or ongoing constant extreme luck. To deny free will is to say that standard chemistry is not just somehow causing the \u201cillusion\u201d of making a choice then the coincidence of actually doing it, but it would also need to luckily be a functional action. So it would require a three-way major coincidence of extreme luck on a constant basis for free will to be false. So what is the argument against free will and FOR determinism? Apparently it just fits some people\u2019s arbitrary personal beliefs. Sorry, that\u2019s not good enough to overcome any evidence, let alone this much. Since free will exists, determinism is not true. ",
