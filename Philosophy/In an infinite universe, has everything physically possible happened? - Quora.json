            "answer_text": "The universe isn\u2019t infinite. According to known evidence, it has existed for a finite amount of time and contains a finite amount of mass-energy. Each of those numbers is staggeringly large compared to humans, but compared to infinity they may as well be zero. Update with hypotheticals: If the universe were truly infinite in size, then yes, in theory every physically possible finite combination of matter and energy should probably happen somewhere (unless it\u2019s all a repeating tessellation). But only a minuscule piece of that universe, effectively zero, is reachable from where we are. If a tree falls in a wood that no human (or post-human descendant) will ever share a light cone with\u2026 If the universe were infinite in age, then all the stars would be dead already, having consumed the available hydrogen at some point in the infinite past, then helium, then all heavier elements up to iron, which does not produce energy during fusion. Likewise, every radioactive element would have broken down until it reached a stable isotope, and every gradient would have equilibrated to maximum entropy. So we can be pretty sure this isn\u2019t the case. ",

            "answer_text": "Debunk: Idk why everyone is answering that the universe is not infinite and t neither is it's age or whatever. NONE of that is proven. There are many skeptics, and don't quote me but I think Stephen Hawking once mentioned this, that think the universe had a great change of some sort around the big bang and could have existed much longer if not forever. The size of the universe is also an enigma, we have absolutely no idea how big it is even if it is likely finite so anyone saying otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. All these things you ask are theoretical and have not solid, proven answer. ANSWER: Now that I've said that, idk (which is the best answer you can get). Part of you would think so since infinite, randomness means any possibility is a certainty, no matter how small. BUT, an infinite universe is not necessarily random. Let's say it is infinite, then all of the universe will still have interacted with each other at some point. Imagine I look as far as I can into the observable universe, that far off reach has affected me now, and definitely in the far past around the big bang. You can continue to do this forever. Saying an alien in that far off point looks away from me at the other end of their observable universe, they can see another point which affects them. So it affected them, which then affected me. This means that the universe isn't random, necessarily, because everything has an effect on everything. So me being here, may prevent me from existing 26quadrillion light years away. Another thing is this, exactly who I am depends highly on my environment. Exact human replicas who exist in a far off point of space may not have the same sky as me as in planets around them, stars, galaxies, irregularities in the microwave background (which is the farthest they can see). So they would not be exactly me. Everything around them would have to be exactly(EXACTLY) the same for that person to be exactly like me and for him to then choose to not comment on your post, which I have done. I hope you see what I mean, I'll gladly clarify for you if you'd like. Edit: what the one guy said about 0.33333\u2026 is sort of true. But I think that's a bad example since by definition 1/3 is 0.3333333\u2026 Take the number pi (3.14) for instance, it goes on forever, infinitely. But the numbers are far from random, they have a meaning and are 100% repeatable. You may never find the number 8889999999999988888 within the number pi. That's because it isn't random and every number before and after plays a part in the whole number. Infinity and random infinity are not the same, although I can see how you could think that. And anything which is dependent on something, is not random. That doesn't mean the answer is no. It's just impossible to know. Love the question though, I've wondered this too but the final answer is we don\u2019t know/ its possible. EDIT2: Another way to demonstrate my point is people often say \u201cwe can calculate how big the universe must be to create another exact copy of the Earth through randomness.\u201d They go on to calculate all the ways Earth\u2019s atoms could be arranged with only 1 of the possibilities being the exact Earth. But this is a FALSE notion. First, you cannot just calculate the Earth. You\u2019d need to include the Sun, moon, all the planets, everything in our solar system AT LEAST. However, even this isn\u2019t enough! We know interstellar objects pass through our solar system occasionally. So we must calculate every arrangement of every atom in our GALAXY! \u2026 wait a second.. our galaxy has interacted with many other galaxies and is the combination of earlier, smaller galaxies. So we must calculate the ENTIRE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE! But even that isn\u2019t enough! This continues however because of the expansion of the universe. So while yes, even these large numbers are dwarfed by infinity, it gives you a scale of how large the universe would actually need to be so that another perfect copy of Earth could be made (and this only takes into account position! what about velocity? Energy state of the electrons?). ",
