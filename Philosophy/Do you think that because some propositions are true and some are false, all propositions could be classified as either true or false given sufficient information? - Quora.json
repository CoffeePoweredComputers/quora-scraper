            "answer_text": "This is not a very precise question, but I will elaborate.  The difference between \"false\" and \"lie\" is the source of confusion for a lot of people driven by the common sense of the language of English. If you wish to be technically correct, the only true statement is that \"true or false is the result of analyzing a logical statement\", of which this statement is no exception. There is no true or false outside statements expressed through language, except for what can be inferred by these statements, but since what is inferred still rests on statements, we can conveniently assume words to represent truth. And hence, our realities are driven by language. Language determines what we think, what we see, and what is real. And when we speak, we assume we are being real. Now, a \"lie\" is something intentionally spoken despite a truth. All talk about true or false is logical, and does not involve people. But lies involve people. Lies only involve people. And lies work because when we speak, we assume we are being real. If we doubted everything we said, no one would fall victim to lies, but of course, no communication would ever be made either. This is the nature of trust, and it is vital to any communication. You are right in saying most things are not true or false. For a statement to be true or false, it must be a logical one. And not all statements are logical. This is where the notion of \"falsifiable\" comes in. Not only must a statement be logical, both true and false must be possible. Only such statements can be classified as scientific and evidential. All of science rests on this fundamental mechanism. So, to correctly answer your question: \"Some things\" are not lies. Only statements uttered by people lying are lies. All statements that are logical can be classified as true or false, pending proof, or rather, evaluation and discovery of what makes each statement true or false. But if we are to be scientific, then only evidence can make a statement true or false. What we think, what we say, what we heard, what we expect, what we value, and what we believe, all hold zero scientific weight. Only after we know the science can we begin to measure the accuracy of any of these things. All the while, we are free to say whatever the hell we want. So clearly, most of what we say is not logical nor scientific. It cannot be. That would be too much work. Most of what we say is us spreading words. It's us being expressive. It's us saying whatever the hell we want. Either way, hopefully somebody found something in there useful. (And that is not a logical statement. It's a hopeful one.) ",
