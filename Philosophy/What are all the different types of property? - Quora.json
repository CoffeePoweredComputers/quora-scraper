            "answer_text": "Property generally includes \"real\" such as land, \"public\" such as your local park, \"collective\" such as the beach owned by your homeowners association, \"personal\" sometimes futher divided between \"tangible\" such as your household goods and \"intangible\" such as your stocks and bonds, and \"intellectual\" such as the novel you wrote. [Interestingly, law recognizes no \"property rights\" in your own organs while in your body (for example your liver) theoretically defended as preventing a market in body parts; but does admit rights to body parts outside your body, such as eggs or sperm harvested for storage and possible later use!] ",
