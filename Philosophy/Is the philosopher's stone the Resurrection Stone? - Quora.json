            "answer_text": "No, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone was created by Nicolas Flamel, a famous alchemist. The stone is based on legend, though Nicolas Flamel was a real historical figure and it was rumoured he did, in fact, create the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. The stone cannot bring people back from the dead, but the elixir made from it can give one immortal life, as long as they continue drinking it. That\u2019s why Flamel was 665 in the book. The Resurrection stone was a stone created by a group of three wizarding brothers (Antioch, Cadmus and Ingotus Peverell), one of three Deathly Hallows. The story of Beedle the Bard depicts the creator of the Hallows as Death. It had the power to bring back the dead, but did not give one eternal life. ",
