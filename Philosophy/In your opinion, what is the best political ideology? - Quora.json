            "answer_text": "If history has taught us anything it is that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. With few exceptions, most governments have eventually grown larger, more corrupt, more warlike, more imperialistic, more tyrannical and have eventually moved towards subverting the rights of the people or aggressively asserting influence in the world. Rather unfortunately, this is exactly what is happening in America right now. Therefore, the best political ideology is the one that keeps the government just small enough to maintain a peaceful, stable and free society for individuals. A political ideology that favors: Small government governance over large government governance wherever possible. Less spending, not more is better.A decentralized government where regions or states have greater autonomy than the central government where possible. (this is the Anti-Federalism vs Federalism argument)Non-interventionism and peace versus interventionism and war in the worldIndividualism over collectivism. Collectivism will lead to individual suppression and this leads to societal instability. All groups and tribes are inherently bias and corrupt, so its important to champion equality through individualism. Yes individuals can also be corrupt and bias too. However, which is easier to overthrow or reform, an individual idiot or a group of idiots controlling a government?Stronger preservation of individual rights like the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th amendments should not be regulated except in extreme and dire circumstances. This means no unnecessary regulation of speech, no warrantless wiretaps, no mass surveillance, no torture, no eminent domain, no home invasions by police and no suspension of due process, especially for civilians who are considered prisoners of war. No superficial regulation of arms without truly extraordinary reasons.These factors alone mean you can rule out the modern liberals and conservatives in America today. Based on the above, outside the anarchists there is only one real philosophy and political force that promotes most if not all of these things: The Libertarian Party ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, I think the most apt political ideologies (in dealing with criticism and the most logically sound) are: Modern LiberalismClassical LiberalismMutualismModern liberalism is probably the most feasible and as close to an \u2018ideological utopia\u2019 as society is going to get. Modern liberalism endorses various societal \u2018tools\u2019, like universal healthcare, universal education, equality of opportunity, moral autonomy and so on. This is an individualistic form of leftism (in fact, it is the only form of individualistic leftism). A lot of features of modern liberalism are implemented in societies (particularly in the Western World), and is the most feasible. John Rawls\u2019 commentary on Modern Liberalism (notably his Veil of Ignorance argument, Original Position philosophy and Defence of Inequality points) are all incredibly powerful and have not (yet) been successfully rebuttled. Classical liberalism - my personal favourite - is essentially centre-right economically, very individualistic, and socially liberal. It rejects any form of discrimination and views all humans as equally rational and capable. However, it distinguishes itself from Modern Liberalism by opposing state intervention and saying that society should comprise of individualistic behaviour, rather than state-intervention. It therefore supports a small state, which (I believe) would make the state more accountable and responsive to public opinion, which are both key features of any proper democratic system. Mutualism - by far the least well known of the three aforementioned ideologies - is quite an interesting one, and is certainly possible and achievable. It is an economic theory which endorses extreme individualism, but rejects over-production and waste (a byproduct of capitalism), and argues that everything made should be used and reused without waste. It utterly rejects the existence of a state entirely, thus making it anarchistic. It\u2019s quite obvious that my political understanding is very individualistic (all three of these ideologies are individual-based) and I support the notion that humans are intrinsically rational beings, and thus do not need a state to moderate their social or economic behaviour; but that is just my opinion\u2026 ",
