            "answer_text": "I am pretty sure the you must have read this Beautiful Poem by the great litterateur William Shakespeare, The Seven Ages. According to him, the seven stages a person goes through since the time he is born till his death. Stage 1- Infancy Stage 2- Schoolboy Stage 3- Teenager Stage 4- Young man Stage 5- Middle aged Stage 6- Old man Stage 7- Dotage and death So, according to me the main stage of our life is Teenage. When a person becomes a teenager, many changes occur in him, be it physically or mentally. This stage has its own joy. The person as a teenager or adolescent , becomes conscious of his looks, starts to think rationally. Due to hormonal changes, he starts getting attracted to opposite gender. He starts to worry about his Self-Esteem. He starts to demand freedom. And in this world of Internet and Computers, he is likely to get addicted to Internet. He is prone to peer-pressure and competition. He starts to demand privacy. Some teenagers get irritated on little things. Some become sensitive to the things told to them, which can even affect them mentally, can lead to depression. They may get addicted to Drugs and Alcohol. Some are also likely to commit juvenile crimes. So, for this, parents need to be cautious about their children who have turned up to teenagers. Parents should try to befriend with their children and understand their minds and needs. They can plan family outings, train them in some or the other activities, build their interest in things which can be beneficial for them, such as volunteering for events, etc. So, this is an age, where a person can be moulded into a better human being, by his parents, when he grows up. Thank You ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been already listed in many answers the three basic stages of life as Childhood, adulthood and Old age. But I\u2019d like to suggest the three stages of life is a different way, and of course it would be related to the former ones. So here are the three stages of life : Stage of Innocence - You don\u2019t know anything about life, you have time but not the capability.Stage of Ignorance -You know almost everything about life, if you don\u2019t then you have the capability and time to know everything about life, but still you ignore to understand it or search for it\u2019s meaning. because you are busy in the rat race.Stage of Realization - You start to understand the facts, rules, meaning and importance of life, but your senses start losing their power to grasp things easily. You are left with less capabilities and less time. Still you try to understand as much as you can. then comes regret on not knowing and understanding things when you should have.let\u2019s take an example:- About family Innocence - You don\u2019t know what family is and what is its importance. You just know that everyone has a mom, dad and siblings, so I also have. They give me food, clothes and care. Ignorance - You misuse the resources you have been under the influence of others ignoring the hardships your parents or family has to go through in order to make them available to you, then when you become independent you ignore your family and their needs as they are now dependent on you because of old age, your respect for them reduces as they irritate you, because cannot do their own chores properly. You are busy enjoying your new life and career. You get married after some time, start your own family far away from your parents, then you totally forget them. They hardly get to see you or talk to you. But you ignore everything. Realization - Now when you become parents and do everything that your parents did for you. and when your children becomes adults and when they repeat the same things that once you used to do. Then they realize what their parents used to feel all that time. But now you cannot rectify or undo your mistakes because they are not alive now. Now you regret doing whatever you did or not doing much for your parents and family. This was just a simple example to elaborate my opinion about life. There are various other aspects of life where you can relate this. Thank you for reading. ",
