            "answer_text": "Spirituality is not necessarily subjective. Science is not necessarily objective. For example, in the non-dual Trantra philosophies, you have: Object (the known)Process (knowing)Subject (knower)Transcendental Subject (the indescribable ground on which 1 - 3 arises from and dissolves back into).Such a View is not necessarily exclusively objective or subjective and is inclusive of both. Objectivity is not privileged over subjectivity, and subjectivity is not privileged over objectivity.  For example, looking at the cloud in the sky: it appears to be an object outside of you, regardless of your own perceptions of the cloud; however, from a non-dual perspective, \"the cloud\" is as much as an aggregation of everyone who views and experiences that cloud. As for the objectivity of science, there is a recent article in Quanta magazine that discusses this very point: The Evolutionary Argument Against Reality |  Quanta Magazine So while neuroscientists struggle to understand how there can be such a thing as a first-person reality, quantum physicists have to grapple with the mystery of how there can be anything but a first-person reality. In short, all roads lead back to the observer.  Something to think on. And just for fun: The strange fate of a person falling into a black hole ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say that every subjective experience finds it's underpinnings in some mathematical truth. I don't know how this works from the perspective of biology and/or cognition, but we do know that: When you place your hands in a body of cold water. The neurons from your hands are sending the signal to the neurons in your neocortex. Your neocortex is making rational sense of it all. Same with all your other senses: sight (there are many specialized neurons in your eyes that perform specific function), taste, smell e.t.cThe interesting thing is that the neocortex processes all of the signals and it doesn't matter where the signals may be coming from. Here, neuroscientists have done experiments where they criss-crossed the neurons processing smell with the neurons processing auditory signals. And even after such a procedure, the neocortex was able to process the signals without any problems.  Next, Kurzweil is of the opinion that consciousness is powered by a combination of 300 million pattern recognizers. This theory is contested. How to Create a Mind But, if true, how it all works is (so far) but a mystery. What is probably happening is that your conscious state is getting hit with tons of stimuli on a daily basis. You take in a percentage of this stimuli. Out of that percentage, some of it registers with you and you discard the rest of it. The information that is discarded is recycled by the brain.  \"It is from memories that we associate the patterns from which consciousness arises.\" That spiritual experience and how it is making someone feel, has it's origins in a phenomenon that is quantifiable.  In short, every subjective experiences can be measured objectively.  Whether or not consciousness is a distinct phenomenon, meaning that consciousness only exists within the brain. Or whether consciousness pervades through the various dimensions. That, is a conversation up for debate.  ",
