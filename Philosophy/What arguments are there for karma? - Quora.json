            "answer_text": "Karma is not some outside force. Karma is the sum total of all the imprints we make within ourselves, by our actions, words, thoughts and feelings. In turn, others constantly subconsciously reading OUR subconscious signals, so who we attract and who we repel is determined by the imprints we have created within ourselves. And that has a huge impact on the things that happen in our life. Any neuroscientist would agree that we ARE the total of the imprints we have consciously planted into our subconscious. Karma. And any psychologist would agree that who are are determined who we do and do not attract. Karma. Just a foreign word. ",

            "answer_text": "What arguments are there for karma? The idea of karma is often misunderstood. Karma is not some force that rewards or punishes us as individuals for our actions and it is not a force over which we have any control. It is the law of cause and consequence that exists in nature. We influence the system of nature by our actions and the response is experienced within the system, by all of us.   ",
