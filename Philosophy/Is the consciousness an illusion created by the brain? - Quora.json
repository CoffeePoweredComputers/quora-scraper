            "answer_text": "I do not get the question: consciousness cannot be an illusion by itself. It exists, or it does not exist. The word \u201cillusion\u201d means that we perceive something which does not exist. But applying that word to the perception itself does not make sense. Even if we perceive an hallucination, the fact that we perceive it is real. Current science theory of consciousness is that it arises from the functioning of the brain. Fact is, all ordinary consciousness experiences happen when there is a given neural activity in the brain. However in physics we cannot say what is for instance a sensation. What is the sensation of \u201cred\u201d? You will say that a \u201cred\u201d photon has a given wavelength. But all the photons differ only with their wavelength, and \u201cred\u201d photons have no other properties which would make them different from green photons, or infrared photons. If a \u201cred\u201d photon had a special property making it red, when Doppler shifted it would still be red, which is not what we see. That sensations, emotions, ideas, and consciousness itself do not make sense in physics, lead to a different theory: consciousness, and its content, would exist independently of physics (while still being related). And it happens that we have scientific evidences of this, with the study of NDE: it showed that consciousness can also exist independently of its neuronal support. That consciousness can exist by itself removes any dougbt about it being an \"illusion\". My take on consciousness here. ",

            "answer_text": "Apparently not. According to scientists at UVA and other places (post materialist science) the brain appears to function as a receiver of information. Like a receiver it has limiters and filters to allow certain information to come forth. If you want a detailed explanation of how the brain is not the only source of consciousness, I recommend watching Dr. Bruce Greyson\u2019s youtube talk \u201cIs Consciousness Produced by the Brain?\u201d From what I\u2019ve been researching (filming people under hypnosis talking about the afterlife for the past decade) consciousness is created outside of our physical realm, and comes into being at any time. That once we are prepared to incarnate, we\u2019re given a \u201cguide\u201d who looks over all of our lifetimes. That we choose each life with the help of our guides and friends, and do so to teach or learn lessons while here. That we only bring about a third of our conscious energy to a lifetime, roughly, and about two thirds is always \u201cback home.\u201d When we have near death events, are in coma, other altered consciousness states like deep hypnosis, we can reaccess the other two thirds of our consciousness and remember previous lives, meet members of our soul group, talk to our \u201ccouncil\u201d and other fantastical sounding items - which I\u2019ve been recording for over a decade. I\u2019ve found that people don\u2019t need to be under hypnosis to access these \u201cplaces\u201d \u201cpeople\u201d or events - apparently just asking the questions to a person directly can yield the same results. (I\u2019ve done so a number of times, search \u201cdr. Drew\u201d and my name for a 20 minute journey to visit his council - something he\u2019d never heard of, was not aware that he had, and yet had the same experience the thousands of others have had doing the same.) This is not my theory, belief or philosophy that these events occur. I\u2019ve been filming people under deep hypnosis for a decade (45) and compared the results with NDE cases, or the thousands of deep hypnosis cases from Michael Newton or Dr. Helen Wambach. ",
