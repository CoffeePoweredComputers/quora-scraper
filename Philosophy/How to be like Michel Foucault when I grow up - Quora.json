            "answer_text": "Why would you want to be like Michel Foucault? This is not a worthy goal, aim or objective. It is a destructive one, as far as genuine knowledge is concerned. For more see also: Joe Velikovsky's answer to What is the best reason to read Michel Foucault? This may come as a horrific shock to people who don\u2019t know it yet: If we search for appropriate metaphors, we land on this: (I am not the first to say it, so please don\u2019t harm the messenger. It is not me proposing this, I am just supporting the truth of it.) Michel Foucault was (quite probably) `the Adolf Hitler of academia'. ie - And, probably, if history is true, was a real-life serial killer as well. I am quite serious. He actually destroyed the progress of knowledge... For details, please read Distinguished Professor Joe Carroll's excellent work, Evolution and Literary Theory (1995). Here is a link to it:Amazon.com: Evolution and Literary Theory (9780826209795): Joseph Carroll: Books Towards the end of that (excellent and amazing) book, Prof Carroll does pretty much a complete (and, well-deserved) character-assassination of the academic known as Michel Foucault. Read it. Seriously. Here is an excerpt: From Carroll (1995), Evolution and Literary Theory `The recent biographical revelations about Foucault's sado-masochistic amusements and his bath-house promiscuity - activities that apparently continued after he knew about the danger of AIDS and even had reason to suspect that he himself had already contracted AIDS - are wholly commensurate with the quality of the temperament displayed in his writings. Foucault's temper is malignant, and his philosophy is primarily destructive in intent. By totalizing discontinuity, difference, and contradiction, he makes negation his central theme, his constant purpose, and his only conclusion. As a result, his rhetoric often loses itself in obscure complications, dissolving into a tangle of opaque words that is enveloped in a fog of vague animosity sporadically illuminated by flashes of malice, paranoia, and narcissism. Given the general tone and temper of Foucault's work, one could draw a parallel between the dissemination of his writings and his apparently knowing participation in practices that contribute to the spread of an infectious, fatal disease.' (Carroll 1995, pp. 445-8) ie Michel Foucault, and his so-called philosophy, is an intellectual cancer. i.e. That excellent work by Carroll (1995) is rightly listed, here: StoryAlity #71 - On Consilience and Creativity... Carroll (1995) devotes a very large section to utterly demolishing Foucault and what he published. It is rather odd that some people see any value in it at all. You clearly need to know all of the facts about Foucault. As indeed does: everyone. The truth has been hidden far too long. Call us `whistleblower heroes\u2019 if you like. See also: Heroism Science! for more details on all of that. So - Science - Facts - The Truth - You don\u2019t have to like it - it just has to be true. And - `Continental Philosophy' (e.g. Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Boudrillard, Barthes, and all that `postmodernist' nonsense) is the bane of the advance of: true knowledge. (It is not me saying this for the first time - read all the books below) Read all of these books, instead of PoMo: StoryAlity #71 - On Consilience and Creativity... ie Read also Literature, Science and a New Humanities (Gottschall 2008) for another total assassination of Foucault and his so-called `work'. In fact - most of those books on that Consilience link above totally (and rightly) assassinate Foucault. And - Whatever you do, please - DO NOT become the next Michel Foucault. Nobody needs that.Genuine useful knowledge, in the Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences is still recovering from the damage that he - and his anti-realist, deliberately-contrarian, deliberately-perverse cohorts did. It's quite horrific.Seriously. For a start, read in full, that (amazing - and - great) book by Joe Carroll (Evolution and Literary Theory, 1995). I am not kidding. Read it. Hope this helps. Best,JTV PS - Unless of course you meant the scientific, L\u00e9on Foucault, in which case, knock yourself out - that guy was a genius!ie - this guy, is great: L\u00e9on Foucault And is a role model for anyone. ie: Jean Bernard L\u00e9on Foucault (18 September 1819 \u2013 11 February 1868) was a French physicist best known for his demonstration of the Foucault pendulum, a device demonstrating the effect of the Earth's rotation. He also made an early measurement of the speed of light, discovered eddy currents, and is credited with naming thegyroscope (although he did not invent it). Source: L\u00e9on Foucault - Wikipedia This guy on the other hand, was, from several accounts, apparently, a psychopath. Michel Foucault (*shudder*) - ie creeeeepy ! An intellectual cancer. If the accounts are correct, he (apparently) did to people, what he also did, to the advance of genuine knowledge... (ie - killed them)? Ergo: in the light of academic history, Michel Foucault was The Adolf Hitler of academia, probably. I can't think of anyone who has done more damage in academia.Except maybe The Church, in The Dark Ages? At any rate, do read all these books, they will be refreshing and positive: StoryAlity #71 \u2013 On Consilience and Creativity\u2026 Hope this helps! ",
