They literally have a world view that encourages suicide because nothing really matters, anyone can see, nothing really matters. That's a song though. But wait! Don't go wandering off into damnation because no one told you to about Christ. You should adopt a worldview that gives direction. Purpose! Life! Cool stuff when you die! That's right! Christianity! The cost? What cost!! Christ done paid the cost!WHAT! Free! That's right it is free to all who draw breath! Got a pulse! You're half way there! But sirs sirs what must I do to be saved!! Why just what did Acts say!!\"Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\" (Acts 16)Saved houses! Sure! Why not! That's it your in! You did use all your heart and soul, right! Now you can tell your friends! You want to get Heaven and not know anyone? I don't think so! Beware though now the atheists, who have no concept of right and wrong, will come out and tell you that you - somehow - are wrong for believing that Jesus Christ, a man who was God 2000 years ago in Judea, is not God after he said he was and then came back. Lie down, have a nap - they'll say. Nothing to fear here. Soul? You don't have one. Liars they are - reprobates all of them. The internets is rife with them. They are playing roulette with YOUR soul. So no you do not cease to exist. Your soul is released from this mortal coil and you go up or down depending on your opinion of Christ. That is the bare knuckles truth. Why even risk it - believing that Christ is the Son of God is no great cost. No one is asking you to be a missionary to Rwanda. You can. But you do not have to. You can even be like probably half of Christians and only admit to it if asked directly. The atheists might mock you and deride you, but they hate God and Christ with him. Find new friends, they can be found in buildings called churches a few times a week. Or not! It is not a requirement. If you want to do MORE for Christ you can and if you need direction then you probably should. Especially if you are thinking of harming yourself - it would be quite embarrassing to stand in front of God before your time when so many people are taken when they pray for more time. Very unthankful. Much sad. That would be my answer to your question. ",

If it was not there, then a strong stop sign would be not leaving behind my family. If even they weren\u2019t there so if I had nothing to live for then I may just kill myself. I was in a mood when I realized how there is no mean that I thought of committing suicide. But fortunately I did not so now I can work really hard on my dreams. This makes me feel alive and this way I forget about not being there any meaning. If I think about the time what comes after 100thousands of years later, what difference does it make in that time if I just killed myself or died a natural way? I think that nothing. EDIT: I had a hard time even when I lost all my passions and no matter how hard I was trying to get them back, I lost them. Had no joy in them anymore. I thought about committing suicide again. But I thought that whatever I do, at least I should try something else, anything, anything crazy like trying to go to an other continent with a boat but just do something what has the potential that it can make me feel alive, feel some happiness again. And if I do not find anything after trying a lot of things then I do not regret committing suicide. Committing suicide is so much better then dying really slow with deep depression. ",

            "answer_text": "I will try to change this thought of taking life because of suffering, but firstly let's pay attention to other aspects also of this question. We will die one day everybody knows this but nobody knows that day! I mean to say you just can't take those days away which are waiting for you which have something for you, which will create another memory. Parents never brought up their children to see them dying one day, they nurture us to see us happy and to be a successful person one day (again this day also we don't know but fact is success has no relation with age, one can be a very successful person at the age of teen-age or in 20s or in 30s\u2026and also in old age). You said why not now to end life, so there you go, do you know what will be happening with you next moment? Obviously No From this moment to the moment of death, you will be creating so many memories, meeting so many people, tasting different different foods, meeting someone special, a trip with friends/family\u2026etc Also if these things are not written in your life to experience to enjoy then automatically you will die the next moment. Best is to leave that decision with god and start doing something productive something that makes you feel happy something that add a reason to live for it! Now Suffer factor, At first, I want to say that, \u201cYou have no right to take your life because you don't own it, your parents own it\u201d Everybody has problems in their life but that doesn't mean that you should run away, don't be tortoise who hides in his shell when problem or danger come and thinks that everything will get fine automatically but no, You should learn to face each and every problem and also to overcome your fears! If you are still reading this answer which means you have lived the next moment and still alive! I hope I was able to make my point clear ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know if you're asking this because you are currently in a state of suffering or if this is a hypothetical type question. I'm going to answer this from a more hypothetical stand point. Each day we wake up we have an opportunity to make the world a better place. I have many times personally found myself beating myself up about the fact that I am not out there volunteering more or doing things to make some massive change in the world. But I have also come to realize that it can be the smallest things that can make the biggest difference and individual people's lives. On more than one occasion I have performed some small act of kindness that I didn't even necessarily do consciously, and yet have been told later by the person this small act made all the difference. Everyday is a possibility. I'm well aware of how clich\u00e9d and trite that may sound. But it is also the truth. I have been lucky enough to find an amazing husband, and a wonderful group of friends. We love and support one another, and I don't know what I'd do without them. They also tell me regularly that they don't know what they would do without my support as well. You'll never know the kind of effect you could have on the world unless you continue to live your life. I personally have no strong Notions or convictions about what may come after this life. But it is very important to me personally, to know that when I am gone, I have I left some kind of an impact. If you are currently suffering from some physical, emotional, or mental issue, please seek out help. ",

Learn from it, like Bill Murray did in \u201c\"Groundhog Day\u201d. Life is also a game, The Game. Death is just a stopping/ending point so you can start all over from scratch again\u2014but hopefully, at the next higher level. For example, think of a video game with many levels to achieve. My son and I used to play the PS game \u201cCRASH\u201d (I believe that was the name? Some hairy dog/wolf/bandicoot looking dude name Crash lol). Anyway, I'm not into video games at all BUT DID get so caught up playing CRASH, as my son Troy (around age 11 then; really miss him!) and I slowly but surely advanced all the way up to level 24 I believe! Again, it was the Journey not the destination. After death in this Life, you'll simply hit \u201creset\u201d and be given different \u201c\"game pieces\u201d and challenges next round or level, according to YOUR choosing and what lessons and so forth you wish to experience and possibly accomplish.
