            "answer_text": "There are two \u201ccompeting\u201d standards, the European and the one from the Americas.

Attached is a sample and most every one is easily understood. There is a link to The British listing of these with explanations which is very good. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/519129/know-your-traffic-signs.pdf Should you plan a visit to a foreign country, I advise to memorize as many as possible if you plan to drive upon arrival.
