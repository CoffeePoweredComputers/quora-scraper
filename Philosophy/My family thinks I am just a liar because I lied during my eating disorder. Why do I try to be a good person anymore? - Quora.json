            "answer_text": "First of all, avoid jumping to conclusions about this. Is what you are assuming about their views of you really true? If you are still in the bans of an eating disorder, persecution complexes can form a part of it and even if you are broadly healed, there may be some of this still lurking in your head. So be wary of this - you could be doing your family and yourself an injustice here. If, on the other hand, you have strong evidence or direct accusations of lying when you weren't, you need to realise that while you may have been treated for your eating disorder, your family probably hasn't been.  They need to heal too. If you did not have family therapy, then they may still be in the zone of seeing you as someone with an eating disorder and acting accordingly to you, rather than having moved on. You need to sit them down and explain to them that you have moved on and that you need them to aswell. They need to recognise that things have changed and that they can start to let go of old ideas, expectations and so on. Avoid thinking you have to prove yourself to them. You have had a hard enough job healing yourself. It is not your job to heal them and they should not expect it. So take this out of your thinking. But they will need to change their thinking about you and the family dynamic if you are to heal fully, and you do need them to do that, otherwise these old entrenched behaviours will persist and make it impossible for you to be happy as a family.  Make them aware that you are happy to work on any remaining issues in yourself, but lying isn't one of them any more. They need to open their eyes to that.  In an ironic way, your eating disorder made you needy, and this feeds into their sense of power, so they may be perpetuating this, rather than accepting that you have finally grown up. They are not doing this maliciously. Families do this because they feel powerless to help - and they need to feel better.  You need to direct this meeting, so that they can see how mature you now are. If you do this, with kindness and love, but being really firm with them, and avoiding any need to carry them all emotionally, they will see you very differently, positively.  If it helps you, go to your eating disorders practitioner to plan the meeting. Go into both meetings strong! ",

            "answer_text": "Because you have to earn back the trust! It's hard and obviously there are very serious problems in your family that you would have to feel these things and go through this, but I think the best advice I could give is to get some counseling! Alone and WITH your parents. Remember, our parents do the best they know how. If they are shotty parents (and most of out parents were) it's because they didn't know any better. But they can learn! I've seen miracles happen in my family. It just takes repetition. I said I love you to my son all day at random times screaming across the house and he would say he loves me too. And after a while of this my parents said it to him, almost as if it was so normal and natural like they always did. I noticed it was the first time, I doubt they even noticed they said it. The reason is, they heard it constantly and it was only a matter of time. This then led to so much more love and trust between all of my family members. So you can start by loving yourself and telling yourself \"I love you\". Then say it to your parents. Even if they don't say it back! Keep saying it! Often! Act the way you want them to act. Say the things you want them to say. Watch things around them this can teach them a thing or too... Just don't make it obvious that that is your intention. Talk about things you've learned and fined interesting that might educate them as well, but again without leading on what yuh are doing. Act like there is no method to your madness. And if questioned, be honest and tell them you are tired of being sad am depressed or angry, or feeling whatever negative feelings you've been stuck in and you want to ne happy! Then maybe you can open up these discussions slowly with them and find out what makes them happy. Then try and make them happy once in a while. If you have younger siblings, you can help them a lot right now too. Find a cause! Or have a goal! Don't let anyone get in your way. Make sure the acheivment of this goal feels good when you envision it. You WILL have many blocks that get in the hay and hurdles you'll have to jump! Know you are on the right path when this happens and don't let it discourage you! Just keep on going and figure out, with patience, how to jump or get around these hurdles. This world is SO big and it's easy to get stuck in your little bubble! We need courageous smart intelligent people to helps keep this world better and change its course and its with people like you that can effect this change the most!!! Do research on being an empath as well. And maybe try yoga. I like Yoga Classes combining Tai Chi, Meditation | Body & Brain if there is one by you. It changed my life!!! Good luck! Tomorrow can always be different! It's also one step at a time!  ",
