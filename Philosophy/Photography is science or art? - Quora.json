            "answer_text": "Photography consists of two separate elements: art and science. It is through the successful combination of these two elements that the creation of world-class photographs can be accomplished. Yet art and science differ greatly in their aim and their practice. In fact, they are so far apart as to present serious difficulties if their respective qualities are not known to the photographer. The science part of photography includes technique and equipment. The artistic part of photography includes the photographer\u2019s artistic goals, his vision, inspiration and the use of art-related concepts. These two parts need to merge seamlessly for the creation of a successful world-class photograph to take place. If one or these two parts dominates the other the result is either a technically excellent photograph without much artistic interest, or a very artistic photograph lacking technical excellence.  ",

            "answer_text": "Photography is both science and art simultaneously. One cannot classify it as either of them. The discovery of photographs was a scientific accident(but a beautiful one, one must say). Slowly photography evolved into an artform within itself, but so did the technology which supported this particular artform in order to keep up with it's evolution. These days we know photography as an independent art which captures the beauty of anything and everything but the very lifeline of the art the camera can be operated scientifically. In order to make use of the tool of the art we need to understand the underlying science on which the tool works. And it is not uncommon to come across photographs which are possible because of science behind the art. ",
