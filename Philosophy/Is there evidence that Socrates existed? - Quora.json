            "answer_text": "He's sort of in the same boat as Jesus.  Serious historians acknowledge that it's a waste of time to try to dispute his existence because any conspiratorial theory pointing to his invention would add many levels of unnecessary complexity to the established narrative.  Also like Jesus, his words were recorded posthumously by his followers and the duty for historians is to sort out how much of the accounts of his life are accurate or plausible. One thing that always struck me as interesting was that Plato often makes seemingly superfluous \"shout outs\" to other public figures, seemingly as a way to solidify his credibility.  For example, in the Apologia Socrates points out members of the trial's audience in a way that seems rather stilted, making it seem like those inclusions were more for the sake of convincing Plato's readers rather than Socrates' jurors.  In the same way, the evangelists would name-drop public figures that their audience had likely heard of before, as a way to galvanize the audience's ability to believe what they were hearing.  (Caiaphas, Pontius Pilate, John the Baptist, etc.) Similarly, who exactly was taking notes in the private conversation between Jesus and Pontius Pilate so that it could be recorded for posterity?  Perhaps it was the same guy that dictated the private conversation between Socrates and Euthyphro.  That is to say, Plato and the Evangelists quite obviously wanted to inject their historical heroes into a situation where they could serve as a mouthpiece.  The mouthpiece would deliver some point that sounds like something they should have said, whether or not it can be known if it was an actual lesson intended by the historical person behind the historiography. All that being said, being able to poke holes in agenda-laden tracts is not the same thing as disproving someone's existence.  We can say with almost perfect certainty that Socrates existed, just as we can with Jesus.  How much the cultural legacy left by their biographers is consistent with historical reality--that's a more difficult and meaningful debate. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing gives me more pleasure than recalling the Socrates I knew, whether I speak of him myself or listen to someone else who knew him.  Plato, Phaedo Of course, no reasonable man ought to insist that the facts are exactly as I have described them... Plato, Phaedo There are three contemporary sources: 1) Plato's works, which are written as if reports of the conversations held by a real person.  There are about 25 of these in existence, and is the primary source we have for Socrates' life and thought.  Most would agree that in places Plato put his own opinions into Socrates mouth. 2) Xenophon's works, principally the Memorabilia -- a set of dialogues, also written as if the reports of a real person, with a slightly but noticeably different character to Plato's Socrates.  Xenophon later became a famous Greek general, and known to history as the first leader of a Greek expedition to Persia, which he later wrote separate works about. 3) Two of Aristophane's plays, which have a satirical character with the name of Socrates.  His characterisation in The Clouds was then referred back to in Plato's Apology as being one of the reasons for Socrate's' execution.  He also appears in The Birds. Since Aristophanes was known for including prominent Athenians in his plays and Xenophon is a known figure from history who reports other historical facts faithfully, it seems reasonable to conclude that Plato's character of Socrates was a real person who lived and taught in Athens before being executed, in much the same way that the three sources report.  Other interpretations require a conspiracy of sorts, and there is no particular reason to look for one. ",
