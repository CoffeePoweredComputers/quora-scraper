            "answer_text": "This philosophy of the universe being completely generated out of the imagination of the collective consciousness is complete nonsense. It was first articulated in an extensive way by Adi Shankara (Adi Shankara - Wikipedia) in the 700s. This \u201cMayavada\u201d philosophy is very elaborate and confusing and makes use of sleight-of-hand word jugglery and shifting between two different incompatible frames of reference that have no relation to each other. Your question strikes right at the heart of the matter: \u201cHow and why does it all exist?\u201d And their answer would be \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called an illusion.\u201d So the next question is Why does the all-in-one undifferentiated conscious energy create or put itself in illusion? Well, you\u2019re not really in illusion; it\u2019s just an illusion that you\u2019re in illusion. Or alternatively, this is all just pastimes for enjoyment. But then why do we suffer? Oh that\u2019s just an illusion too. etc. Sometimes they will say you just can\u2019t ask that question because it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Or it\u2019s all just words and you just have to realise the Truth. Another angle - the undifferentiated oneness of conscious energy is described as being desireless. So then what would be the impetus for it to create an illusion? It doesn\u2019t make sense and these ideas have been resoundingly defeated time and time again throughout history by sages and scholars. But the idea persists for a few reasons. It was widely promoted around the world as a unifying philosophy of religion and spirituality after Swami Vivekananda addressed the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, 1893. Also, it\u2019s a very simple opposition to what we normally consider material, so people can feel very spiritual, understand that they are God, and not have to adhere to any rules or morals (because all this worldly stuff is a bunch of baloney anyway). There is a proper understanding of oneness that goes like this: There is an underlying oneness behind everything in existence but within that, there is also variety and differentiation. Furthermore, the material world is real in that it exists (it\u2019s really here) but it is illusory in the sense that it\u2019s impermanent (unlike your spiritual self) and makes you feel like you are separated from the supreme source of everything and that fulfillment can be derived from controlling and enjoying the material energy. I hope this helps. Good luck in your quest for Truth. ",

So we \u2018decide\u2019 what we want the universe to be. everything works this way - including us. When you think about advances in medicine, nutrition, societal norms, and so forth, our view the human body has changed over time. I\u2019ll answer the question about \u2018why\u2019 it exists by noting your question. You are asking for a meaning about existence. That question is the reason why existence \u2018exists\u2019. Humans have an inborn belief in material being separable, which has become the foundation of us defining an \u2018existence\u2019 apart from the nature which supports us. So our inborn belief is the reason we \u2018exist\u2019 and everything we \u2018discover\u2019 has its own name. hope this helps. ",

The folks who make a big deal over consciousness apparently do not know what it is; the idea that consciousness is some fundamental aspect of existence - just because we animals have (because we need to have) consciousness - is absurd, unfounded, and with no evidence to support that absurd notion. It is New Age nonsense and you don\u2019t have to believe it. Consciousness is the act of paying attention to signals for possible relevance to survival. All animals with intact brains have this cognitive feature or function, without which we would soon perish. Consciousness / paying attention is the navigational and guidance system of the animal\u2019s body, helping to steer the body as it moves around in search of food, mates, safety and comfort. How consciousness took on such an aura of mystery, heavily seasoned with grandiose and imaginary ideas, must have something to do with someone eating the wrong kind of mushroom and surviving the experience, then telling everyone that the whole universe is a conscious being, etc. It\u2019s absurd. Consciousness is a vital function; it helps the body stay alive and intact for as long as possible. Only animals have consciousness because only animals need to be conscious to survive; plants don\u2019t need it, they don\u2019t have to move around searching for food, etc. It\u2019s just an evolved response to being mobile consumers.

            "answer_text": "My best guess is that the Absolute Consciousness, Brahman, that which is beyond concepts, bore a concept, something that thinks itself separate, Atman. Atman gets stuck in its separateness, perhaps reveling in its creativity and seeming supremeness. Atman can create infinite universes and dimensions - the Infinite Creator! But, in fact, is getting further away from Brahman as it \u201cinvolves\" infinitely until it realizes it must evolve as it exhausts the involution process. Our universe is but one of those and is premised with duality, positive and negative, and the struggles therein. We have a sense of \u201creaching\u201d embedded in us beyond simple survival. This is the Atman impulse, to become that from whence it came. The paradox is that at every point in Atman's existence, it is Brahman, but chooses to stay separate yet yearns for something more. Humans are Atman, also are Brahman every second of our existence, but choose to be separate, our \u201cselves\". And we yearn for something more. The trick is that \u201cmore\" is actually \u201cless\" - less \u201cyou\". YOU suffer; less YOU, less suffering. No YOU, no suffering.

Figments of imagination are somehow beyond us still, as imaginations, and nothing more. How and why does it all exist is a great question you should firstly ask yourself. My belief is this: eternity is a loving principal, it means no harm and comes in peace. Yet it comes like a thief in the night for those unprepared for death. And when the soul is awoken to the light of eternity, it is shocked nearly to death. This predicament of the soul is what we must attend to like a great wound, so that we may heal from it and rightly live forever. Whoso defeats death will live forever, and whoso dies will awaken once more in a familiar afterlife and reincarnation, until the thing has happened, and eternity has been seen and transmuted into golden light. It is the difference between samsara and nirvana. It is the difference between sailing a ship without a sail or having a sail and navigation. These are facts of the soul confirmed by direct experience. ",

            "answer_text": "Matter is what exists and constitutes real and objective bodies that generate immeasurable space (Figure 1).  Figure 1: Objective reality. Matter exists in the form of atoms (elementary particles, minimum particles, particles without division, quarks) not yet well known, which are the primitive particles that carry all the fundamental properties of matter. This proposition is a working hypothesis that should receive subsequent experimental confirmation (1). The question of the properties of matter is addressed with the analysis of its manifestations to find those that have a general character, in the sense that they are present in all matter. What is observed is that everything is in motion (dynamic), but that in most of the matter that is perceived, there is the tendency to rest (static). This is the starting point of this analysis. This observation suggests the existence of matter with one of the two properties mentioned. The dynamics or the static. This is a critical issue since it determines a drastic change in the concept of what exists. According to this notion, matter is not only mass, what weighs, but also is, what generates movement and is dynamic in all its manifestations. It is proposed, then, that what generates the movement, is something that can legitimately be called matter, one of whose properties is energy, which is now measured with the work done. Once it acts. That matter with energy will be called DYNAMIC MATTER, hereinafter. It is conceived as what generates the dynamic and vital forces of nature and as responsible or cause of all the energetic and vital phenomena, and of the constitution and behavior of dynamic and non-living living beings and the evolutionary phenomenon. If this to which it is proposed to be matter with energy must be matter, then it must also possess, at least, the property of being extensive. In the same way, the mass is recognized with matter with inertia, so it opposes the change of movement and the movement itself. This matter with inertia will be called STATIC MATTER, hereinafter. It is conceived as what generates the static forces and opposed to life in nature and as responsible or cause of all the inert and contrary to life phenomena, and of the construction and behavior of beings antagonistic to life, and to the evolutionary phenomenon. It also has the property of being extensive. The observation of the behavior of the matter that surrounds us, which is recognized in this work, as the mixture of the two classes of matter that have been proposed, leads to propose as property of these, the following: Space generation (Extension ), Generation of movement (energy), Generation of rest (Inertia), Interaction between atoms and Integral association between atoms. This proposition has multiple powerful consequences, which modify in its essence the concept of the universe, if it is seen from the present point of view. Consider, for example, the situation in relation to the principles of conservation of energy and mass. For physicists and chemists, what matters, from the point of view of their scientific interests, is that these principles are fulfilled, regardless of their implications for the same energy and mass. Therefore, it is convenient to examine these implications closely. Of course, an idea already contained in the principles of conservation is that energy is transformed, and takes different forms from each other, in terms of its observable manifestation. However, this transformation process is always obscure, they are considered to be matters of philosophy, rather than physics or chemistry; but in reality they turn out to be the same type of problem as that of the origin of the universe. On the other hand, it is necessary to note that the relationship between matter and its properties, insofar as energy and mass are considered as such, is not the same in both cases, in the thinking scheme that develops, since the Energy is considered a property of dynamic matter, and mass is static matter in a given evolutionary state, one of whose properties is inertia, which turns out to be the corresponding property of static matter, as opposed to energy. It is seen then that the concept of dynamic matter does not exist in contemporary scientific knowledge. Mention should be made of the situation, to introduce the necessary order regarding the use of the feared issues. The principles of conservation imply the properties of non-creation and non-destruction of the physical entity to which they apply. These properties are mentioned in another way, stating that energy and mass are of an incredible nature and are indestructible, which implies that they had no beginning and will have no end. What these qualities have, by calling them somehow, is called the adjective \"eternal.\" But it is now known, and it is mentioned in this way because reasoning requires it, that the mass participates in the constitution of matter whose characteristics we can measure or weigh, with our senses or with instruments in finite, well-defined and small portions, that They are called elementary particles and some of which manifest themselves during extremely short times. In the same way, the dynamic substance participates in the constitution of the matter that we can measure or weigh, also in finite, well-defined and small portions, so that it has not been recognized as a constituent of that weighted matter. A conspicuous manifestation of dynamic matter is the photon, of which the property that we know best, is the energy it possesses, whose quantized character suggests that the dynamic substance is constituted of discrete elementary components, to which at the time they will be assigned the name of dynamic atoms. Of course, the photon is not an elementary entity, without components. This suggests its interaction with the particles with mass (Compton effect), in which part of itself is exchanged. It has been affirmed then, that both energy and inertia are properties of the respective kinds of matter, the one that moves by itself and the one that tends to rest by itself. Therefore, in relation to the conservation principles mentioned and since they are applied, that of energy to a property of dynamic matter, and that of mass to static matter itself, which makes an important difference, should be recognized that dynamic matter has the same uncreated and indestructible character of energy and that therefore, the conservation principle must be applied to it, in the same way as it is to static matter, which is recognized by the name of mass. The conservation principles considered, for the matter with energy and the one that has inertia, must now be formulated as follows: Dynamic matter and static matter are not created or destroyed. These two kinds of matter interact with each other and combine temporarily. In their combinations both are preserved and change their way of manifestation, which generated the idea that they are transformed. On the other hand, both classes of matter constitute, respectively, pure material units, of the respective nature, in which they are also preserved. The idea of \u200b\u200btransformation of energy and mass during the processes in which they are conserved, must now refer to the fact that in the processes of interaction and association between the components of the two classes of matter, they retain their individuality in terms of their indestructible character and the manifestations they give are governed by the respective properties of the participating components. The substance that has mass (static matter) and energy (dynamic matter), from which our body is made, and that hurts our senses, is called here, weighted matter and is a mixture of the two classes of matter defined, in determined evolutionary state. It can be in any of the states known as solid, liquid, gaseous and ionized. Electromagnetic radiation is considered to be preponderantly dynamic matter. On the other hand, all the atoms that exist, and that are infinite number, have the property of generating space. The property of movement generation is exclusive to dynamic matter. This generates the movement, moving itself and dragging with it what surrounds it and can move. The property of rest generation is exclusive of static matter. This generates rest, resting itself and preventing the movement of what surrounds it and can retain. These last two properties are contradictory to each other and constitute the root cause of universal contradiction. They do not coexist in the same atom. Each atom has as attribute or property one or the other of these two properties. All the atoms that exist, possess the properties of interaction and association between them. The property of interaction occurs between all atoms and the property of integral interaction occurs only between atoms of the same essence, dynamic or static. This formulation of the properties of matter emerges from the principles of conservation, since the matter is being created, it has always been as it is today. That is to say, that their fundamental properties must have the quality of immutable, or as mentioned in the language of Physics, they are invariant against time and with respect to transformations of all kinds, in case they were described with respect to a framework reference. On the other hand, in its temporal temporal evolution, its manifestation changes according to the environment, the concrete circumstance in which the atoms are, and the level of evolutionary integration that it has reached. The atoms spoken of have not yet been conceived by physicists and therefore have not been discovered, since at least, dynamic matter is not conceived as such. It is necessary, therefore, to seek the experimental verification of its existence, and the theoretical description of its behavior. The spatial property of matter is that what is known as space is its extension. It is recognized as part of the subject, and is proposed as its property. Thus matter has two fundamental properties, spatial property and general movement property, dynamic matter or the property of generating static matter rest. The minimum component of matter, the atom, not the atom of the chemical element, turns out to be an impenetrable entity at very short distances and penetrable over great distances, is capable of exerting forces out of itself, and of associating with other atoms under certain conditions. The dynamic and static properties of generating movement or rest respectively, are the root cause of the essence or nature of the corresponding atoms or of the corresponding matter. The property of associating consists in the fact that atoms of the same nature can gather together, by virtue of attractive forces that allow them to form atomic groups that can grow by association of new atoms, which in an orderly manner correspond according to their properties , with those already in the group.

            "answer_text": "The answer really depends on consciousness. And, if I may say so, many of you are passing judgments on a subject without understanding it. When we do not see something well, or know about it in some way, we imagine conclusions about it to fill our ignorance with something. We are not satisfied with ignorance. We see a rope in dim light and imagine that it is a snake. But the reality is, it is not a snake, we just imagine it to be a snake. Snake is an illusion. You are saying, yes that may be so, but snakes do exist. They are very real. After all, millions of people die of snakebite every year. That one may be a rope, but the existence of snakes cannot be denied. You are absolutely right. Snakes are a reality. But what kind of reality is the creation? Physics teaches us that matter exists in four states: solid (that means frozen), liquid, gaseous and plasma. Einstein said matter and energy are inter-convertible, which means matter can also exist entirely as energy. However, Hindu sages have found that there matter and energy are not the ultimate truth of creation. That ultimate reality of matter/energy is the Supreme Divine. Hindu scriptures say, \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0916\u0932\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0902 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e All these are in reality, Brahman. Suppose we have a few items of gold jewelry, a gold bar, and a pot of molten gold. If we are to describe the fundamental truth of all these items, will we not say that the reality of these things is gold? What else can we describe as the truth about those items? Hindu sages saw the creation at a more fundamental level, they described that as the foundational level of creation, which they called the ultimate reality or Brahman. Why should not they say, the ultimate reality of the creation is not what we see around us, but all these are Brahman, and the creation is only a dependent reality, depending on Brahman for their material and energetic existence. We cannot have gold jewelry without gold. We may not have the spiritual vision and spiritual consciousness to see this ultimate reality of the creation, but honestly, can that be an excuse to dismiss the sages? ",

            "answer_text": "2020 is a good year to question what is real and to get to know who we are as individual human beings rather than being part of a family of human beings. I have been around the sun 70 times in this body that I experience humanity with. I am very grateful of being a human being on this planet that I now call Gaia. I love her. She is beautiful and very, very strong. She was a planet called earth, and the human beings that are made out of her have been very naughty little boys, for century after century, as she developed her consciousness as best, she could. These little boys called themselves \u201cmankind\u201d and proceeded to do pathetic things to each other under the laws of different Gods. All that they ever accomplished was to cause great suffering to fellow human beings and planet earth. In 1990 planet earth finally began her shift into becoming a fourth density consciousness planet that is based on love and light. The naughty little boys are now being seen by everyone on the planet because of Gaia\u2019s increasing light intensity, and they are wriggling in uncomfortable ways, as their corruption becomes exposed. In 1901, the naughty boys were able to easily sideline a very good boy, Nikola Tesla, who wanted to help humanity to learn about the power that is within light. His love was focused on his journey to discover some basic principles of reality that \u201cmankind\u201d could use to prepare all humanity for the times we are now experiencing. The naughty boys were the usual 1% that ruled the 99% of people. They used their wealth to create a system of honors that would guide scientifically minded boys and some girls towards the negative electrical energy of electrons and atoms. Negative electricity needs to be propagated into waves as it is a pushing energy and far weaker than positive electricity, which is an attracting energy that can be felt when two magnets attract to each other to become \u201cOne\u201d. Synergy is defined as:\u201d the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects\u201d. The reason things exist for us is our state of consciousness development. The reason that we do not know this is because of the naughty little boys who want to own everything for themselves and they kill or debunk anyone that is a threat to their negative ways of being. They do not know any other way because they have been on the negative path for 1000\u2019s of years, generation after generation. There are people around Gaia who are now awakening to their own unique potential and want to use their power and their gifts to be of service to humanity and Gaia. Like minds attract and their combined power grows by the rule of squares and the energy of synergy. This is now happening in 2020 and humanity will very soon begin to have access to the wonders of Nikola Teslas inventions. Our universe is the solar system and it exists because of the enhanced intelligent energy that the sub-logos designed. Our universe is one of 200 Billion Light universes within the greater universe that we call the Milky Way galaxy that works towards by the intelligent energy of the Logos. There are an uncountable number of galaxies that each work towards the intelligent energy of their Logos. The great mystery lies beyond the Logos and the universes that we cannot know at our density of consciousness. ",
