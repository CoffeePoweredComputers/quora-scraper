            "answer_text": "There aren\u2019t really any \u2018solutions\u2019 to the liar, since a liar paradox can be constructed in any language which can make unrestricted validity claims - and that includes any language in which it\u2019s possible to do philosophy, or ask questions about the liar paradox \u2026 There is a serious question about why the liar isn\u2019t catastrophic for meaning in general. It looks kind of like a validly constructed contradiction, after all. The answer to this question is, I think, something like this: The intelligibility of language in general must be protected from the liar, but it can\u2019t be protected by any explicit (rule-based) method, because we can only construct these methods by making unrestricted validity claims, and so generating more paradoxes. Instead, it seems that liar statements (and some other related paradoxes) don\u2019t arise in \u2018normal\u2019 language use. They are kind of \u2018artificial\u2019 - only of interest to philosophers, if you like. As I say, we are barred from giving a general account of why this is the case, but we can show that it must be the case because we are, after all, intelligible to one another. (If we weren\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t be able to say so). A related observation, which may be relevant, is that the liar is only meaningful if we think of meaning as being a consequence of appropriate grammatical construction, correct referential relationships, and whatever other sets of rules might allow us to make meaningful sentences out of smaller linguistic elements. While we do frequently \u2018work out\u2019 meanings using methods of this kind, it\u2019s clear that no constructive account can be complete. It cannot adjudicate on the complete meanings of the construction rules that it adheres to, for instance. We do have tests of meaning and meaningfulness, however, that do not rely on constructive accounts . A statement which has no consequences, no implications, may appear to have a constructive meaning, but it cannot have any use in a language. There would be no way of telling whether it was true or false, because we test for truth and falsehood by examining implications. Paradoxes cannot be meaningful in the sense of having some definite implications for exactly the reason that they are logically catastrophic - they either have no implications, or they imply the truth of every constructable statement. While they might appear to have constructive meanings they can have no use meanings. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is far simpler than you think as are all logical solutions that I have come to find before. Examples: Simple Solutions to Unsolved Problems Solution to the Liar\u2019s Paradox: For any intuitive paradox there is either an invalid statement or a false premise that intuitively seems to be valid. Quite often, it\u2019s due to some kind of hidden assumption you\u2019re not even consciously aware of. Those intuitive errors will continue to go unnoticed because we have never had to consider such a possibility before therefore we kind of subconsciously bypass such a consideration because it\u2019s never been required before. Assume that Bob makes the statement: \u201cI am lying\u201d The intuitive paradox: If we assume that Bob is telling the truth, then when he says \u201cI am lying\u201d he must be lying so how can he be telling the truth? If we assume that Bob is lying, then when he says \u201cI am lying\u201d he\u2019s telling the truth but if he is telling the truth how can he be lying? The solution: First of all, I think we can all agree that a meaningless statement is not a logically valid statement. The falacy behind the liars paradox is that there is a hidden assumption that the statement \u201cI am lying\u201d is a valid statement when its just a meaningless or nonsensical statement that sounds like it has meaning. Whenever we give the statement \u201cI am lying\u201d or \u201cI am telling the truth\u201d they are always in reference to some other statement given in a past or future sentance. Because we are just so used to giving them in that kind of shorthand way with a hidden reference to something else it comes off as sounding natural. Since it sounds natural to us we subconsciously assume it\u2019s a meaningful statement so we never bother to consider it as being otherwise. To prove that it\u2019s true go up to anyone and say to them: \u201cI am lying\u201d They will always respond \u201cabout what?\u201d or just \u201cwhat?\u201d meaning you just said something that didn\u2019t logically register. Until you answer their question, the statement is meaningless or invalid and no valid inference can be made from it. Seems obvious right? Because it seems obvious in hind-sight you may naturally think that there is nothing to learn from this solution but you\u2019d be wrong. ",
