            "answer_text": "The answer to \u201cIs liberalism finished?\u201d , based on history, is a resounding \u201cNO\u201d(unfortunately). As the Founders repeatedly pointed out, the inherent danger of democracy is \u201cfor people to vote themselves stuff\u201d and for some individuals to strive to attain power for power\u2019s sake. Both essential elements of liberalism. Despite a century of progressive programs, there is virtually the same levels of poor, ignorant, criminal, and such that have clearly not been solved(or even improved) from the massive loads of money, regulation, and gum-beating about how it would. Except the starvin\u2019 childrens are now dealing with obesity, but I digress. So looking at the looming debt crisis in all the EU countries, but yet EU citizens post here on Quora about how \u201cwhy can\u2019t the US be happily democratic socialist like we are in Europe?\u201d\u2026.it seems the euros are still happily traipsing down the path to the next banrupcy/restructuring. (But given 500yrs being under this or that ruler\u2019s crown, so many seem content with the nanny-state as their surrogate ruler. Not my taste, but also not my problem). With that said, I\u2019ve never heard so much talk by US liberals advocating that we go down the same path. Sadly, quite a few \u201ctell\u201d me why we \u201cmust\u201d adopt democratic socialism - - - and most of these don\u2019t even know that is what it is called, and give blank looks when I express concern those countries average more than 90% GDP as govt expenditures(hence the looming debt crisis of course). OP here suggests that China is the liberal-killer, the next big thing. Couldn\u2019t be more wrong, if history is to judge. The communists in China kind of fell into producing cheap priced and cheaply made products for export to the evil capitalist countries out of necessity half a century ago. Sam Walton created Walmart, now the formerly stout communists are having a hard time finding room in their pockets to stuff more money into. They are no longer communists, more sort of a worst-of-breed democratic socialist crossed with dictatorship. A socialist country run without true voting. Which doesn\u2019t sound like a replacement to all liberalism. But what it does sound like is the inevitable result of concentration of power in the hands of national government in the long term must be the virtual loss of real democracy. At that point your vote can\u2019t change who is in charge. Which is exactly what the Founders warned of (which is something else that liberals give blanks looks about). ",

            "answer_text": "First, as usual, lets make sure that we have a similar understanding of what a \u201cliberal democracy\u201d is, and how that relates to liberalism. What is called \u201cliberalism\u201d in American politics, which is generally opposed to \u201cconservatism,\u201d is a moderate left capitalist tendency: capitalism with a safety net, plus a progressive social view. Classical liberalism is broader, and mostly ignores social issues \u2014 it basically covers the political philosophy universally adopted in the west after WWII \u2014 a market economy with inalienable rights, importantly including the economic rights. All major US political parties are classically liberal, even those that are today called \u201cconservative.\u201d The term \u201cliberal\u201d in \u201cliberal democracy\u201d actually refers to classic liberalism. The US, France, Germany, Japan, etc. all are liberal democracies, or perhaps more properly liberal republics. (The UK is technically a monarchy, but operates like a liberal democracy.) There are three dominant economic entities in the world: the US, the European Union, and China. The world GDP is about 71 trillion dollars (in 2016); of that the US produces $18.5 trillion, the EU $17 trillion, and China $11.4 trillion. China in reality is a poor country with an overly centralized economy, demographic problems, water shortages, many restive minorities, and a growing economy that is approaching the size of Europe and the US, but still is more than a third smaller. It is certainly important (it has almost half the people in the world) and it seems likely that within the next couple of decades it will have the largest economy in the world, but to say it has \u201cwon\u201d over liberal democracy seems like a gross exaggeration as well as a misunderstanding of how China has achieved its economic growth. List of countries by GDP (nominal) - Wikipedia China has five times as many people as the US, leaving it with the 84th highest per capita GDP, hardly a showing a better result than liberal democracy. The US is sixth, and all of the higher ranking countries except Qatar would qualify as liberal democracies. China has grown its economy by partially embracing liberal economics, but its economy is now hitting blocks caused by the ways it is not a liberal economy, such as the lack of rule by law, lack of regulation, and cronyism. As for racial issues, those, too, are far less of a problem than in China, where minorities face a great deal of alienation and repression. We have a far more integrated society and far more open dialogue about this issue in the west, particularly in the US, which perhaps gives the impression that it is a greater problem here. Frankly, in China and much of the world, the racial problems are just buried more deeply. (I don\u2019t want to minimize the racial problems in the west. However, the west is addressing these problems, which is quite different from China or other illiberal places such as Russia, which generally deny the problems exist and repress their minorities.) ",
