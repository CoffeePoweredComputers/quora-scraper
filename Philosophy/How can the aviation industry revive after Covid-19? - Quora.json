            "answer_text": "Short answer- there will be a world post this pandemic, and that world will need planes to travel. Long answer- aviation industry has been one of the most volatile ones, facing a big fall every 10 years or so( 911, recession and then recession again). This time it's different as it's not just aviation that's been hit, it's everything else as well. But we as humans are not at the top of the food chain just because we walk on two legs. We learn, we adapt and we overcome. There's been major behavioural and policy shifts to keep the show going. If aviation is to be looked at specifically, it's starting to heal already, there's new check-in and boarding SOPs in works, most of which are already being implemented worldwide. You can check out videos by various industry leaders as to how they are innovating and preparing to resume operations with social distancing, face masks extra sanitization as the new normal. A conservative estimate is almost a year before the industry gets back to pre covid times though. Will end this with, I am sure the skies miss us too. ",

            "answer_text": "How will COVID-19 affect the aviation industry long-term? I\u2019m taking \u201clong-term\u201d to mean 5\u201310 years. Near term (1\u20132 years) things will likely be very bad. Probably flying at 30\u201340% of previous numbers would be a good recovery. An effective treatment is found that reduces mortality rates. I think 10\u201320% of travelers will no longer be able to afford to fly as the average load rate of planes will fall well below 80% - which was what allowed airlines to charge extremely low fares. 50\u201370% of planes are in storage. Mid-term (3\u20134 years), assuming a treatment and a vaccine are now available, perhaps 50\u201360% of previous volume. 30\u201340% of planes are still on the ground in storage. Long-term (5\u201310 years), maybe 70\u201380%. I think the world economy will still be working its way back to pre-virus numbers. A lot of wealth was destroyed because of the virus. I think many countries will continue to de-globalize their country\u2019s economies, preferring to subsidize domestic production of \u201ckey industries\u201d. 10\u201320% of planes are effectively written off with no plans to ever fly them again.
