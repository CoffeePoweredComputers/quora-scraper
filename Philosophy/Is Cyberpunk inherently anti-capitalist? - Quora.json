            "answer_text": "It certainly critiques capitalism unchecked and shows how it could run amok without restraint. So, the question becomes, do you think criticism of capitalism is the same thing as being \u201canti-capitalism\u201d? [For instance, I might be critical of my child if he or she does something wrong\u2014but the fact that I am pointing out flaws doesn\u2019t mean I am \u201canti-child\u201d or that I hate my child.] Generally, some examples of Cyberpunk being critical of capitalism appear in the writings of William Gibson. At one hotel, a protagonist has to be careful not to let shower-water run in his eyes, because the image on the shower indicates the local water is safe for skin-contact but not for drinking or contact with eyes. The implication is that this sort of ubiquitous pollution is legal, and par for the course. That sort of a world without environmental regulation seems a bit dystopian. Generally, the villains in Cyberpunk (and the anti-heroes who serve as protagonists) are both working for competing corporate interests, and they are quite willing to kill, maim, and destroy the \u201clittle guys\u201d around them. For instance, in Neuromancer, when Case and Mollie hire a bunch of anarchists to spray Blue-9 on a crowd to distract security guards while they do a heist for their lackeys. We are told the Blue-9 spray permanently triggers schizophrenia and homicidal tendencies in those who inhale it. We have no idea from the story how many people they dose in the streets outside, but it must be dozens if not hundreds. These are just passers-by who are in the way of the \u201cscore.\u201d That\u2019s an awful lot of collateral damage\u2014but the characters never blink an eye. Again, it seems to be par for the course. Gibson is evoking something that goes beyond the greedy and violent excesses of 19th century America, such as when mining or logging or companies in the isolated western states would use mercenary forces to put down strikes and walkouts violently. Gibson depicts a world in which one\u2019s loyalties are to one\u2019s back account, rather than one\u2019s community. I consider that fairly critical of the motives that generate the worst excesses of capitalism. That\u2019s not to say that Gibson opposes capitalism, and wants us to embrace some alternative. That\u2019s just to say Gibson warns us to keep our eyes open. ",

            "answer_text": "The world of cyberpunk isn\u2019t capitalist - it\u2019s fascist. There\u2019s no sense of markets or competition or contracts - it\u2019s pure monopoly power. They oppress because they have the guns to do it. They have expert mercenaries like Molly who can simply murder any opposition, whether it\u2019s political or corporate. So there isn\u2019t a sense in Gibson\u2019s novels of alternate political or economic models. The characters are just rats trying to survive in the walls of official society. All that Case has to keep him going is his doomed love for Molly. It appeals to romance as the secret salve to their awful lives. Real capitalism is different in that it relies on trust and competition. Trust is needed so that deals can be made without armies of police and lawyers, and competition so that it doesn\u2019t harden into stifling oligarchy, as it has in Russia and is happening in China. Authoritarians always claim that their power is needed to keep you safe, but it never works out. However, Bruce Sterling\u2019s version of cyberpunk is something else again. His novels are way beyond the old struggles between the merchant and political classes. Those are 20th century conflicts. He takes the SF position - future struggles will be among new forms of humanity. The Shaper / Mechanist conflict isn\u2019t about how much state regulation there should be of corporate behavior; it\u2019s about whether humans should enhance themselves or their cyborg components. That\u2019s a lot more interesting, and is way beyond being pro or anti-capitalist. ",
