            "answer_text": "Existential nihilism is the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. Thus, existential nihilism suggests that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. The wonderful reality of humanity is having Free Will. Humans have the innate ability to weigh evidence, analyze and take measurements to answer, \u201cWhat should I believe?\u201d However, this question has taken people off into the bushes. The right question is, \u201cWhat do I want to believe? And when you decide what you want to believe that is what you will experience. Therefore, deciding that existential nihilism is real for you that is what you will experience. Conversely, if you believe that humans have intrinsic meaning or value that is what you will experience. Reality consists of the experiences you believe are real. What is real to you may or may not be the same for everyone.Fantasies are the experiences you believe are not real.Pretending is resisting what you decided to believe.Doubt is a conflict between new decisions and old decisions. What you believe and how you believe determines your reality. To make something real you need to believe in it. For it to be real to others, they need to believe in it. To the degree that you fail to manage your beliefs, reality will remain beyond your control. Thus, \u201cWhat do I want to believe?\u201d is the operative question. Once you decide that is what you will experience. Discovering and transforming/healing the cause of all distress symptoms and labels is the most efficient and effective protocol to regain your life. When someone begins the holistic healing process, no matter how dire their predicament seems to be, I KNOW if she/he is WILLING to do the mental/emotional discovery work; releasing and transforming beliefs, thoughts and feelings, anything can be healed. The word \u2018incurable\u2019 or \u2018impossible\u2019 only means that the particular condition, symptom or diagnosis cannot be \u2018cured\u2019 by \u2018outer\u2019 methods and that she/he needs to GO WITHIN to effect the healing. The condition, symptom or diagnosis came from mental/emotional distress and will go back to nothing. When beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and behavior are accessed and addressed at the unconscious level, the 'cause' of any and all symptoms and behavior become crystal clear--it is mental/emotional, physical, and spiritual trauma/distress manifesting in the behavior and symptoms you experience.
