            "answer_text": "Norms can be simply defined as behaviors, thoughts or values that a majority of people share within the same society. They differ from rules or laws in the sense that they are not compulsory. They rather define a direction or guidelines that have the social function of making a society work peacefully. Due to them, every one can anticipate how others will behave and think, which makes things easier than chaos or anarchy. I like to think of norms as the current of a river and individuals as boughs on that river. Most individuals follow the current because it\u2019s easy to, but some of them don\u2019t. No one can say they are forbidden to do so but, by deviating, they may disturb other individuals\u2019 course and are constantly driven back to normality by the current and the other boughs. Simple and rather naive exemple of norms : when you encounter people, people are expected to say hello (rather than punch you)when you apply for an important job, you\u2019re expected to suit up a little bitwhen you\u2019re at a restaurant, you\u2019re expected not to eat with your fingersExemples of norms that are more controversial when you\u2019re a boy, you\u2019re supposed to prefer football to balletwhen you\u2019re a girl, you\u2019re supposed to endeavor to be prettywhen you are in love with someone and have a relation with that person, you\u2019re expected not to have other sexual relations in the meantimeFor all of these norms, you can see that there is no law or obligation (except for the latter if you are married) that would prevent you from doing otherwise. But most people abide by those norms, and if you don\u2019t, you may be bullied, pointed at, and usually people around you (the current, remember ?) will do their best to put you back on the right track. When you mess up with norms, you\u2019re actually messing up a little bit other\u2019s view on those norms, and norms being messed up is very uncomfortable when you don\u2019t want to. ",

            "answer_text": "Given that this question is under the Society topic, I'm going to assume you mean Social Norms. Social Norms are the values of manners, civility, and customary tradition expressed through actions of society. These are both collective as a whole, and individual to each person. The base establishment of these social norms derive from people with normal behavior. Normal behavior is established through repetition of intuitively searching for normal actions in every situation and applying the action in similar situations. Normal actions become normal behavior when the actions or search for actions become intuitive collectively as a whole, and, or individually to a person. A society can have normal behavior, and an individual person can have normal behavior. Examples of social norms would be any normal situation where two or more people engage in a social interaction with normal actions. A specific example can be given by determining every circumstance of the situation and each condition\u2019s value to a social norm. Deviance is anything that deviates from normal actions and behavior. Negative reactions can occur when folkways are violated. Deviant actions can become formally penalized when a deviant action becomes a law. These laws can be implicit and explicit. Implicit laws are general laws that are used to enforce general rules that themselves aren't codified, but are in manuals and rule books for standards of social interactions. This could be anything from going through a metal detector at an event to simple driving rules. These laws can be enforce just like explicit laws, but are less severe than explicit laws, and are usually a misdemeanor for failing to obey a law enforcement officers request to maintain peace. Social Norms are important. I hope this helps give you a better idea of what they are and how they are considered. Best wishes! ",
