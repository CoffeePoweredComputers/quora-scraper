            "answer_text": "Can Kalam cosmological argument really be debunked?  Above is a portion of the large scale structure of the universe. It is actually quite easy to refute the Kalam Cosmological Argument, and here is how it is done: P1. Everything that begins to exist has a cause. (This is no more than an intuition based on common experience with creation ex materia, and we have no experience with creation ex nihilo, which is what the Kalam is actually about. There is no actual evidence or proof to show that everything that begins to exist (ex nihilo) has a cause, so the first premise is not trustworthy.) P2. The universe began to exist. (The fact is, scientists don\u2019t actually know yet if the universe began to exist in the Big Bang, and the Big Bang theory begins with the universe already in existence without discussing the creation of the universe. As it is, it is possible that the universe never began to exist, even though the dimension of time does not go back forever behind us. Below is an explanation as to how the universe might not have begun to exist.) \u201cHartle and Hawking suggest that if we could travel backward in time toward the beginning of the universe, we would note that quite near what might have otherwise been the beginning, time gives way to space such that at first there is only space and no time. Beginnings are entities that have to do with time; because time did not exist before the Big Bang, the concept of a beginning of the universe is meaningless. According to the Hartle\u2013Hawking proposal, the universe has no origin as we would understand it: the universe was a singularity in both space and time, pre-Big Bang. Thus, the Hartle\u2013Hawking state universe has no beginning, but it is not the steady state universe of Hoyle; it simply has no initial boundaries in time nor space.\u201d Hawking talks about no clear Big Bang and no boundary to space-time C. Therefore, the universe has a cause, and that cause is God. (Since both premises of the argument are questionable, we cannot trust the conclusion, and the argument only gets us to a cause for the universe, if the premises are correct. It does not get us to a First Cause, or to God. That the cause is a First Cause, or God, is not supported by any of the argument, and that makes it a non sequitur. It could easily be that a cause for the universe is a multiverse, or some other thing, and not a personal God. Note that we could also insert Universe-creating Magical Pixies as part of the conclusion, and would have just as much justification as theists do when inserting God.) The Kalam was refuted a while ago, but theist apologists tend to continue using arguments that have already been refuted as if nobody ever refuted them. If theists won\u2019t accept my version of the argument below, they should understand how the argument doesn\u2019t show that God exists: P1. Everything that begins to exist has a cause. P2. The universe began to exist. C. Therefore, the universe has a cause, and that cause is the eternal multiverse. The problem that theists don\u2019t seem to realize is that you need direct evidence or proof supporting the conclusion, evidence for the existence of God, or a First Cause, and they have none whatsoever. Arguments are not evidence, they are arguments, and, if you reject the existence of an eternal multiverse after seeing my argument, you should reject the existence of God, or a First Cause, and for the same reason.

            "answer_text": "I think we can show that the Kalam Cosmological Argument is not a good argument, that it probably is not sound, and that it can therefore safely be dismissed. Here is the argument, in its barest form, for reference: 1.) Everything that begins to exist has a cause. 2.) The universe began to exist. 3.) Therefore, the universe has a cause. The argument is valid, but in order to say that it is probably sound, one must be able to show that the conjunction of its premises is more likely than its negation, or that P(1 ^ 2) > P(~1 v ~2). In this post, I will show that this really cannot be reasonably affirmed. The first thing that leaps out when we look at premise 1 is the obvious confounding example of virtual particles. See, we can observe particles popping into and out of existence all the time, without any causes that we can discern. Now, sure, maybe they do have some cause that we haven't yet identified, but (at this point) it's just as likely that they don't. You could dogmatically declare that they must have causes, but that's not reasoning at all. If we are to take a reasoned position, following the evidence, we must admit that it's about as likely that these particles don't have causes as it is that they do. The jury just isn't in on that point, the scientific community certainly doesn't have anything close to a consensus, and it would basically be an irrational presumption for either of us to insist that they either do or don't on the basis of some a priori navel-gazing. So, let's call the probability that 1 is true about 50%. Maybe a tad more, if we're being generous, but only a tad. Certainly we wouldn't be warranted in saying that it's twice as likely as its negation, much less expressing more confidence in that. What about 2, then? Well, again, we just can't say with any confidence whether this is true or not. Purely a priori reasoning gets us nowhere, here, and science is pretty split on this issue--to the very, very minimal extent that it speaks to this issue at all. See, when the Kalam is talking about \u201cthe universe,\u201d it's talking about \u201call of contingent reality.\u201d But, of course, when physicists talk about \u201cthe universe,\u201d they're not talking about \u201call of contingent reality\" at all--you can tell, because they pretty much universally leave open the possibility that the universe was preceded by another universe. In physics, the term \u201cuniverse\" refers to only part of what contingent reality could possibly be. So, when a paper like \u201cinflationary space ties are not past complete\" by Borde, Guth, and Vilenkin say that \u201cwe have shown under reasonable assumptions that almost all causal geodesics, when extended to the past of an arbitrary point, reach the boundary of the inflating region of spacetime in a finite proper time,\u201d (1) \u2014which is not, by the way, the same as saying \u201cthe universe had a beginning,\u201d even for physicists, they're not even trying to talk about \u201call of contingent reality.\u201d (Indeed, Borde et. al. make this inescapably clear when they write, \u201cWhat can lie beyond this boundary? Several possibilities have been discussed\u2026\u201d) So, where does the physics community stand on this question? Well, again, there's no consensus. It's a question that physics doesn't try to deal with much at all, but even where it does, the jury remains hung. The fact is that we just can\u2019t tell, from the evidence, because the evidence doesn\u2019t speak to a broad enough scope. With no worthwhile a priori reasoning and no way to speak to the issue decisively with evidence, again, we are left without any justification for affirming 2 with any confidence. A reasonable person ought to put the probability that 2 is true somewhere around 50%, and (again) certainly no higher than twice as likely as its negation. So, where does that leave us? Well, the argument contained in 1\u20133 is deductively valid, but the probability that it is sound is equal to the product of the probability that 1 is true and the probability that 2 is true. (You can formulate the KCA such that the premises are probabilistically dependent on one another, but in this formulation, they are independent.) And, again, it would simply be unreasonable to assert that either premise is more than twice as likely as its negation (indeed, it would be unreasonable to even come close to that mark, but that\u2019s a relatively intuitive and inarguable upper bound). Unfortunately, this means that a reasonable person must conclude that the argument probably isn\u2019t sound. It is more likely that at least one of the premises is false than that they are both true, and that is enough to convince any reasonable person to dismiss it as a good argument. So, there\u2019s the basic Kalaam argument dealt with. The premises aren\u2019t ridiculous or obviously false, but they also just aren\u2019t the sort of propositions that one can reasonably affirm with any significant degree of confidence, and this is ultimately fatal to the argument.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the request to answer this question. The Kalam Cosmological Argument (KCA) is a philosophical argument that our universe has a cause. It is often used as a starting point for a series of arguments that God exists. Christian philosopher William Lane Craig has popularized the argument in recent years. If the KCA can be debunked, I do not believe that the fellow in the link provided with the question did so, nor have I ever encountered anyone who has successfully debunked it. The KCA is a simple syllogism, which is an argument consisting of a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion based on those premises.(A premise is a statement presumed to be true, which serves as the basis for an argument. ) If the two premises are true, and the conclusion logically flows from the premises, then the argument is true. It\u2019s as simple as that. Here\u2019s how the Kalam Cosmological Argument goes: Whatever begins to exist has a cause.Our universe began to exist.Therefore, our universe has a cause.So, let\u2019s examine the premises of the KCA to see if they are true. Major Premise: Whatever begins to exist has a cause. Some, such as the commenters below, argue that the only kind of creation we observe is creatio ex materia (creation from pre-existing materials), so creatio ex nihilo (creation from nothing) is not something we have observed. But even creation from absolutely nothing would require a cause, for how can absolutely nothing do anything? For something to begin to exist without an external cause, it would have to be the cause of it\u2019s own existence. But how can something that does not yet exist cause itself? The very idea of something that doesn\u2019t exist yet bringing itself into existence is nonsensical. That recognition is very powerful evidence that this premise is true. This premise has also consistently been true in our observational experience of creation from pre-existing materials. If you are aware of an exception, please let us all know!Virtual particles are not an exception to this rule. As theoretical physicist Matt Strassler explains:\"The best way to approach this concept, I believe, is to forget you ever saw the word \u201cparticle\u201d in the term. A virtual particle is not a particle at all. It refers precisely to a disturbance in a field that is not a particle. A particle is a nice, regular ripple in a field, one that can travel smoothly and effortlessly through space, like a clear tone of a bell moving through the air. A 'virtual particle', generally, is a disturbance in a field that will never be found on its own, but instead is something that is caused by the presence of other particles, often of other fields\u2026. in quantum field theory, quantum fluctuations are sometimes called, or attributed to, the 'appearance and disappearance of two (or more) virtual particles\u2019. This technical bit of jargon is unfortunate, as these things (whatever we choose to call them) are certainly not particles \u2014 for instance, they don\u2019t have a definite mass \u2014 and also, more technically, because the notion of 'a virtual particle' is only precisely defined in the presence of relatively weak forces.\"Minor Premise: Our universe began to exist. Observations that our universe is expanding are in accord with this premise. The standard model of big bang cosmology is also in accord with these observations.Some argue against this premise by claiming that nothing in our experience really begins to exist; it is just a re-arrangement of fundamental particles, and therefore really only begins to exist in our mind. This idea is called mereological nihilism. But this is a really radical view, because according to it, composite objects do not actually exist. That would mean that you do not really exist, except as a concept within your own mind and that of others. This view would even undermine the philosophical dictum \u201cI think, therefore I am!\u201d Under this view, nothing except fundamental particles really exist. This is really going to extremes to dodge the second premise of the KCA! But even this radical view still does not manage to avoid the idea that the most fundamental particles began to exist at the inception of our universe. If true, it would just relegate the beginning of fundamental particles to a group of events that happen outside of our observational experience. As I pointed out above when discussing the first premise, the the philosophical concept of ex nihil, nihil fit (out of nothing, nothing comes) demands that our universe must have had a cause other than itself.Conclusion: Therefore, our universe has a cause. This conclusion logically flows from the premises.Fervent atheists and those who hold to minority opinions concerning the origin of the universe can question or challenge the premises of the KCA if they want to, but most of us accept them because evidence, observation and logic support them. If the premises are true, then the argument is correct because the conclusion logically flows from them. Pointing out the limitations of the argument, as the fellow in the link provided with this question did, in no way debunks it. The argument does not explicitly say who or what the cause of our universe is, as this fellow suggests\u2014different arguments (that are just as strong) lead us to the conclusion that the cause is God. True, that\u2019s a limitation to the usefulness of the argument when it stands alone, but it is usually combined with other arguments. Furthermore, there is no equivocation (switching the definition of a word in the middle of an argument) at all in the KCA, as this guy in the video contends, since the word \u201cuniverse\u201d is not actually used any differently in the minor premise than it is the conclusion. Why should we think that the definition of \u201cour universe\u201d has been switched to mean \u201call that there is\u201d in the conclusion, when the cause of our universe clearly must be something or someone other than it?

            "answer_text": "\"However successful our scientific explanations may be, they always have certain starting assumptions built in. For example, an explanation of some phenomenon in terms of physics presupposes the validity of the laws of physics, which are taken as given. But one can ask where these laws come from in the first place. One could even question the origin of the logic upon which all scientific reasoning is founded. Sooner or later we all have to accept something as given whether it is God or logic, or a set of laws or some other foundation for existence. Thus, \"ultimate\" questions will always as it is usually defined.\" \u2014\u2014 p. 15, Preface of \"The MIND of GOD: The Scientific Basis for a Rational World\" by Paul Davies (1992) Orion Productions edition ISBN 13:978-0-671-68787-8  The arguments in the video and elsewhere are almost \u201cfunny\u201d in their inadequacy. For example, the argument identified as The Kalaam Cosmological Argument was attributed to an actual scholar with 2 Ph.D. degrees. I observed that when Quora member Rusty Entrekin wrote his analysis of the video presentation, he had no alternative but to refer to \u201c\u2026 the fellow in the link\u201d because the person speaking in the video lacks an objective identification. I agreed with the Rusty Entrekin analysis. I noticed this exception also. The person doing the speaking in the video is not identified. So he is anonymous as a source. Anonymous sources are never ceded credibility. Also, at about the 2:00 minute mark of the video, the anonymous speaker posts on the screen the words \u201cTHAT IS ONE HELL OF A LEAP\u201d. This is in reference to the usual logical inference that God as creator satisfies the question of a First Cause. Thus, for the anonymous person to claim to have debunked, or to have even cited some other persons \u201cdebunking\u201d of the premises and conclusions associated with the identified statements associated with Kalaam Cosmological Argument, it must be concluded that all logical inferences should be dismissed outright. Claims like \u201cTHAT IS ONE HELL OF A LEAP\u201d is merely a rhetorical, and rhetoric is not probative in logic. Thus, the claim of \u201cdebunking\u201d in its initial efforts are dismissible as amateurish. I mean, that is entirely inadequate as a \u201cdebunking\u201d. Also, the fellow speaking in the video does not understand that to actually \u201cdebunk\u201d an argument, 2 distinct accomplishments are necessary. The first is to show actual logical errors in the argument, and logical inferences are not all \u201clogical errors\u201d. The second is that it is necessary to show an actual explanation which has greater explanatory power than the argument set forth by the counterpart. [I can also propose that if the person speaking in the video, this anonymous person offers conclusions about the subject, the conclusions will be (you guessed it) logical inferences. It is a common tactic in amateurish arguments to make extravagant claims like proposing that logical inferences are all dismissible as being a \u201cLEAP\u201d or some equivalent. Furthermore, no objective metric for a \u201cLEAP\u201d is identified in the conclusion.] I watched that much and find no meaningful purpose to commit time and effort to claims that are anonymous and exaggerated in the first 2:00 minutes. The fellow has no explanation for a cause of the universe, whereas Dr. Craig does. ",

            "answer_text": "Much modern cosmological theory distinguishes between a universe and a multiverse, and does so in ways that may impact this old argument. For example, consider the possibility, discussed extensively by Lee Smolin, one of the most distinguished physicists of our time, that a Big Bang from one point of view is the final collapse of a star from another point of view. In other words, a singularity IS a singularity. The idea is that in Universe A, a star collapses in on itself, all the way into a single point of infinite mass, a singularity. From the point of view of astronomers elsewhere in Universe A, a new black hole has been born, But there is another point of view. This same event is the creation of another universe, with its own space and time and a new set of natural laws. From the point of view of the astronomers who may eventually exist within the new universe, this is the birth of Universe B. It is their Big Bang. Now: to what is Kalam supposed to apply? The universe or the multiverse. It seems plausible that the multiverse so conceived may have always existed. Smolin\u2019s view has much in common with the old Steady State theory of Hoyle, except that it posits that Hoyle was a bit parochial. With regard to this universe, (Universe B), the beginning does have a cause. The collapse of a star in Universe A. With regard to universe A, we could say much the same. With regard to the multiverse, we have no compelling reason to believe that the premise applies. ",

            "answer_text": "It has been on many occasions. It spring from a faulty premise. Everything that exists requires a creator or cause. Can you demonstrate that this is true? In order to make this claim, I think you need to be able to demonstrate the pointers that make you think that the universe was created. The best way to do this would be to work out what differences you would expect between a created and a non-created universe - and why you would think that. What are the hallmarks of a created and a non-created universe that you can look for? Start with a pebble if you like and work your way up. There\u2019s no known way to demonstrate this, especially as we don\u2019t have two universes (one created, one not) to compare side by side. After this it tries to claim that our universe began. The best cosmologists are working to look at the beginnings of the universe and all know is that everything used to be super hot and super dense. We don\u2019t know what was before. It\u2019s not demonstrable that this hasn\u2019t existed for all time, and there are arguments that there was no time before this as it wasn\u2019t relevant. Beyond this, it basically defines a god into existence. Most faiths say, \u201cMy god\u2019s exists and this is their list of attributes.\u201d The best the Kalam could get to if you ignore the failures inherent is that there is some cause. It doesn\u2019t define it, and the adherents of this claim say, \u201cThis cause is my god!\u201d, which is a leap of logic without demonstrating which god, or what attributes. If it\u2019s an argument for a specific deity, it could be used for a different one or a group of deities. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a being - just a cause. It\u2019s flawed beyond use, but still trotted out time and again. Also, the video you link debunks it as well. Just saying. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, very easily! In fact, the Kalam cosmological argument is self-defeating, and a very good example of a very bad logical argument. It goes something like this. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.The universe began to exist.Therefore, the universe has a cause.Firstly, premise 1 is a problem. It is an absolute assertion on a subject we have far too little knowledge of. In fact, through quantum mechanics we already know that this chain of \u2019cause and effect\u2019 doesn\u2019t work at all for sub-atomic particles. So given that premise 1 is an absolute statement, and we are aware of real-world situations where it is incorrect, the premise is false! Premise 2 is another absolute assertion. The truth is, our universe \u201cas we know it,\u201d began 13.7 billion years ago. We do not know what existed before that and we have no way of finding out. It is just as reasonable to assume that existence is eternal and our universe, as we experience it, is just the latest incarnation. The concluding statement is not much of a problem. It is not a necessary conclusion, given the failure of the two premises, but I have no problem personally with the concept that the universe is an effect of a prior cause. In fact one of the competing interpretations of quantum theory, \u2018the many worlds hypothesis,\u2019 makes this very claim. What\u2019s even more alarming is the huge, baffling leap of logic that is taken by Kalam proponents after making this argument. 4. Therefore God! ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of Quantum fluxuation: Some have argued that the entire universe could have been created as a fantastically gargantuan quantum fluctuation. There are a couple problems with this. First of all, in what would this fluctuation occur? Perhaps a universe could be created within a greater universe, but quantum fluctuations must be fluctuations of something. There is no basis, either in experiment or even in any reasonable description of reality as we know it, which allows for a quantum fluctuation to occur that is not occurring in something. What would this fluctuation be a fluctuation of? This simply makes no sense. In any case, there is obviously no scientific evidence for such a thing. But beyond that, there is not even a rational basis for belief in such a thing. There is a fairly small subset of cosmologists who are philosophically committed to naturalism/atheism. Such people are required by their philosophy (not by scientific evidence) to devise such ad-hoc unscientific arguments such as the multiverse theory or the quantum fluctuation theory. We should beware of such philosophically-induced unscientific arguments dressed up as science.

It depends on two assumptions Whatever begins to exist has a cause.The universe began to exist.Neither are demonstrably true, they are metaphysical assumptions. What we can say is that in a worldview that assumes them you probably need to assume a Prime Cause, but you don\u2019t need to assume them to have a worldview, and indeed quantum physics is already challenging them both, in that there is a good argument for saying that ultimately time itself is an illusion - just a way of looking at things, and without time, there can be no causality. It is an example of taking a view that works well on human scales and extrapolating it to be an absolute statement of faith. And of course there is that old demon, recursion - if God created the Universe, who created God? ",

You can debunk it with either of these, in isolation or combined when possible: a) Affirm the sequence of causes and effects is infinitely long; b) Affirm the sequence is finite, as in the Kalam argument, but that there are more multiple first causes; c) Affirm there\u2019s one single first cause, but that it isn\u2019t personal; d) Affirm the concepts used are limited to human cognition and cannot be extrapolated in this way; e) Affirm time is finite but forms a cycle, the end joining the beginning and forming its couse.

Consider in simple terms it lays out:1.
