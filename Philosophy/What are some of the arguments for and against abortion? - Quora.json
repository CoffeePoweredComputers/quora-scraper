            "answer_text": "I wrote this somewhere else. Excuse the repetition. It comes down to this question: Is the embryo a human being or not? If the answer to the question is no, then we can do practically whatever we want with the embryo. If the answer is yes, the embryo has human rights, of which the first one is the right to life. All other considerations (the circumstances of the mother, if the embryo comes with malformation, financial implications, etc) might be important and worthy of finding good solutions, but irrelevant when it comes to analyse abortion from the point of view of morals. I have never heard a good pro-Abortion argument -ever-. All of them come down to pieces after scratching the surface of their approach. These are the facts: The embryo is alive (grows, feeds, respond to stimulous, etc).The embryo is human. It has human DNA. It belong to the human specie.The embryo is different to the mother. It has a DNA different to the mother\u2019s DNA -any school child knows this.The embryo is a person. This is less evident than the previous points and it depends on the definition of \u2018person\u2019 you might have. The best definition was stated by Boecio \u2018individua substantia rationalis naturae\u2019 - Individual substance of rational nature. Which raises the question: Even if the embryo is human-alive, can be considered as an individual? Can it be rather a tissue o bunch of cells? The answer is no (unless you are willing to admit that you and me are also \u2018a bunch of cells\u2019). A bunch of cells, a tissue or an organ will never develop into anything different. The embryo evidently will develop naturally into a human adult if nothing goes wrong with it. On the other hand: if the embryo is just a bunch of cells, to whom do they belong? - It doesn't exist such a thing as cells belonging to nobody. There's always a \u2018someone\u2019: the \u2018subject\u2019 of those cells. The only possible answer to this question is that the \u2018someone\u2019 is precisely there, where those bunch of cells are. Therefore, the embryo is a person. The only moment in which this argument might not be valid is the case of twins, before the split of cells occurs. But even in this case we never have a no-person. On the contrary we have \u2018at least one\u2019.It can be argued that the zygote/embryo becomes a person at some stage of the pregnancy, but not at conception. This idea is not silly but ultimately does not stand logic. The human DNA is formed at conception - this is a biological reality. The successive changes in the embryo - all of them - come from \u2018within\u2019 the embryo, not from outside. This is a major consideration, because if any development came from outside the embryo, pro-abortion people would be right in saying that the embryo becomes a person \u2018at some stage\u2019 during the pregnancy. But if all development come from within, this means that the substance never changes. The embryo before certain development is the same thing as the embryo after the development. It is like the caterpillar and the butterfly: the change/development came from within, therefore both are the very same being.There is zero evidence that the human embryo is not a human being. This is particularly clear after a couple of weeks when the heartbeat appear. And in doubt the moral principle state that the action should be avoided. In other words, if I could be killing somebody -not sure- with my action, then I should avoid performing that action - even at a great cost, because we are talking about the life of a different person.Once the right nature of the human embryo is acknowledged, there is nothing that can justify abortion, except the risk of the life of the mother, due to ethical considerations. Typical pro abortion arguments are: a1. Women have the right to decide over their own bodies. Correct, but not over the body of their son/daughter. They cannot do anything that will end up with their intentionally sought-after death of the baby. a2. Women cannot touch the embryo, but they can get rid of the placenta, because it is hers - killing the baby in the process. This is morally acceptable ONLY if the placenta itself is a threat for the mother\u2019s life, but it is not acceptable if the aim of the procedure is actually to kill the baby. b. The embryo is part of the mother. This is ridiculous. c. The embryo is not part of the mother, but it is inside the mother, therefore the mother has rights over the embryo\u2019s existance. Unacceptable. The fact that the embryo is inside the mother is not something the embryo chose. The embryo did nothing to be in those circumstances. We cannot kill the baby for that. d. We cannot oblige women to carry on with an undesired pregnancy. It would be like to oblige her to save somebody\u2019s life against her will. Nobody can be obliged to be heroic. This argument is not intellectually honest. The example given is incorrect. It is true that nobody can be obliged to save somebody\u2019s life, buf in the case of pregnancy, the baby is there due the woman's choices, not the baby's choices. She must carry on and accept the natural consequences of her actions. The only exception to this argument might be rape. This case requires more time and space, but it represents less than 1% of all abortions in the US. e. The baby is a person, but he/she has less rights than the mother. Unacceptable. Either one has human rights because one is human or not. There are no half-solutions. If so, this would be like stating that there are humans category 1 and humans category 2 (different according to their rights), like what the Nazis did with the Jews. This approach is really dangerous. And if this distinction can be made based on \u2018age\u2019 or \u2018stage of development\u2019, there is no way to stop it from being applied to other distinctions based on other aspects (race, population, gender, social utility\u2026) Scary. Some defend this idea based on the degree of dependence of the baby, whose survival totally depends on the mother, therefore this justifies her higher rights over the baby. This is evil. If it happens to you that you depend \u2018a lot\u2019 on the good will of somebody else, you wouldn't want that person to think this way. And where you draw the line? Can a doctor kill a patient saying \u2018his life was depending completely on me, therefore I have the right to terminate his life\u2026\u2019. No. Maybe more dependence means more responsibility, rather. f. The baby is not a person because he/she does not have consciousness (self awareness). This is not a stupid argument. Normally the person that mentions this argument does not understand well the concept of \u2018consciousness\u2019. Self awareness is not something we \u2018have\u2019, it is something we \u2018do\u2019. It is an action done by the intellect. But an action cannot define what something is. It would be like defining a dog as the animal that barks. It is a bad definition, because to bark is an action. True that we would expect a dog to bark, but there are dogs that do not or cannot bark, and this does not mean that they are not dogs. Even humans are not doing an act of self-awareness when sleeping, this does not mean that they are not human when they sleep. There are other actions usually performed by humans that some people don't do, like producing sperm, for example. Small boys do not produce sperm but they will. It doesn\u2019t mean they will be human only when they do produce sperm. Same thing happen with self awareness. It is a matter of development. On the other hand, there is no evidence that the very act of \u2018being born\u2019 triggers the development of self awareness. g. The baby becomes a person only at birth because he/she can self-sustain, because he/she breathes by himself/herself. Same idea than before. This statements implies that the definition of being human lies on the ability to perform an action: to breath. The purpose of breathing is to take oxygen to the blood. The embryo does this in a different way before birth, but this is done anyway. The mechanism used cannot determine if he/she is a person. Otherwise a person connected to artificial breathing machine wouldn't be a person. h. If you could save either 1000 embryos or one already born person from a fire, for example, you would save the already born person over the 1000 embryos. Hence we all understand that, somehow, the embryo is not really a person yet. This argument is based on \u2018what you would do if\u2026\u2019 this is always a fallacious question. Our emotions can make us do things that are not necessarily right. Our intellect feeds from our senses. It is perfectly normal to feel more compassion and be more compelled to save and protect a nice and beautiful child rather than an invisible \u2018something\u2019 especially if we don't know well that that \u2018something\u2019 is actually a bunch of human beings. One could also prefer saving his own daughter instead of 1000 human adults, because we love her more; but this does not mean that the 1000 adults are not human beings. i. Spontaneous (natural) abortion occur all the time, therefore provoked abortions cannot be bad or immoral, because Nature itself does it! Nature produces earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, death\u2026 Nature kills people. That is the way of Nature, yes, but this doesn't mean that it is okay for humans to produce earthquakes or to kill people. Not a logical argument. j. Abortion is a human right (women right/choice). This is absurd. No one has the right to do evil, to intentionally terminate the life of another innocent human being. k. The embryo is not a baby, because we call it embryo or blastocyst, not baby. This is just semantics. We use different words to speak about the same being at different stages of development: zygote, embryo, fetus, baby, child, adolescent, adult, oldman\u2026 all are different words for the same thing. l. If abortion is evil, we should punish those women. But this idea feels just bad and unfair. It feels bad and unfair because of the culture in which we live. The law does not just forbids and allows, the law also teaches. If abortion is legal, people in doubt will think it is okay because it is legal. Most women who undergo abortion do not think they are killing a baby - or at least they trust the legislator if not sure. This ignorance, plus the usual and sometimes colossal social and financial pressure associated to unwanted pregnancy build up a massive mitigant factor on women - not so on the \u2018service provider\u2019 though. m. Abortion will happen whether it is legal or illegal. If it is illegal, it is dangerous for women, therefore, because it will happen anyways, it should be legal. This argument is not logical. It is like saying \u201cpeople rob banks. It happens even if it is illegal. Some of those people actually die trying to rob banks. Therefore to rob banks should be legal\u201d. It is an insane argument. We cannot legalise and condone evil because it happens anyway. The very position called pro-choice is absurd. Imagine if somebody asks me \u2018do you think that people should be able to rob banks?\u2019 and I reply \u2018I personally wouldn't do it, but I'm pro-choice. If someone feels like doing it, it is her affair\u2019 - It is crazy. Nobody is asking you \u2018if you would do it or not\u2019. The relevant question is \u2018Do you think abortion is okay (morally acceptable) or not\u2019. And the logical positions are: pro-life (no) or pro-Abortion (yes). Not pro-choice. Government must provide serious and effective assistance to women going through unwanted pregnancies. Foster adoption as well. But never compromise when the life of innocents are at the stake. ",

            "answer_text": "I will list a few cogent arguments that I am aware of in terms of the abortion debate: For abortion: Being able to have the right to choose an abortion would prevent women from an financial economic disadvantage: the most common reasons for having an abortion are all financial and convenience related issues.Women should be able to have reproductive control over their body: it is immoral to prevent another person the right to control medical decisions in regards to their own body.The life of the women compared to the life of a foetus is of higher value: one can feel pain in the fullest potential while the other is speculated to feel pain in certain stages of their development.If abortion is banned, rates of unsafe abortion will rise, which is said to be about forty-eight percent or fifty eight percent confirming from observations of other countries\u2014mainly developing countries\u2014 compared to three percent in places where abortion is legalised\u2014mainly in Western countries. Another study found that in places where abortion was illegal in most or all cases the rates of it increased: 37 women in every 1,000 have one. Compared to 34 women in every 1,000 in places where it was legalised.Abortions are more safer than child birth: A study found that women were about fourteen times more likely to die during, or after giving birth to a live baby than to die from complications of abortion. A legal secure abortion is more safer than delivering a child.Reduces welfare cost to taxpayers: the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency, evaluated a proposed anti-abortion bill that would ban all abortions nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and found that the resulting additional births would increase the federal deficit by $225 million over nine years, due to the increased need for Medicaid coverage. Another contribution to this would be that fact that those considering having an abortion from the 20 week mark, or after, are generally women who have plenty of disadvantages, either lack the amount of money to have an abortion, or have serious fetal health issues.Against abortion: A circumstance\u2014whether unfair or difficult\u2014should not justify the killing of an innocent being. If one is able to face the consequence of killing an innocent human, then the killing of an innocent child should not be justified.The right to live should be a fundamental right, especially in regards to those who have not had the possibility to live and are innocent.In regards to the argument of the child being unwanted, the child will be wanted by someone, describing the child as unwanted displays the attitude of those presenting such implications. And it is based in your perception of how the child is considered to be but not on the actual state of the child.Abortion is highly linked to medical and psychological issues plenty of studies show the results reveal a moderate to highly increased risk of mental health problems after abortion. Problems such as: miscarriages, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ectopic pregnancies have a higher chance of occurring when a women has had an abortion.It is usually assumed that rape victims who become pregnant would naturally want an abortion. But one major study of pregnant rape victims that has been done found that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion, the same applies to victims of incest; studies display that incest victims rarely ever voluntarily agree to an abortion.Childbirth is not more harmful than aborting a child, less than one in ten thousand pregnancies results in death of the mother, as for abortion it is said to be less than that, but only because, most cases of death from abortion are not accurately reported compared to that of childbirth. Also, the rates of maternal death in abortion increases in later pregnancies which means that some maternal deaths in full-terms pregnancies are actually caused by earlier abortions.",
