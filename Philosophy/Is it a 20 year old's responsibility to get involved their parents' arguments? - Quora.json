            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. Any parent who tries to involve their children in the parent's arguments is toxic. Parental arguments should be between the actual parents. To involve a child, regardless of the age, is to try and put them against the other parent. This is unfair, immature and irresponsible parenting in my opinion. No child should be made to take sides with parents. That is not their job. If a parent wants a mediator then they can hire a family therapist. ",
