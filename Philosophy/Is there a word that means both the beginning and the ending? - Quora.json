            "answer_text": "It's hard to find an English word that has a universal meaning of 'beginning and end' but there are many words, when used in context, that have this meaning.  For instance: For the student - graduated means both the end of study and the beginning of a career.For the traveller - milestone means both the end of one part of the journey and the beginning of the next.For the consultant/farmer - certified means both the end of a process and the beginning of accredited services/good supplyFor the astronomer - solstice means both the end one season and the beginning of  another.For the startup - pivot means both the end of one business model and the beginning of a new approach.For the child - adulthood means both the chronological moment when the legal control and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardian ends and their assumed control over their persons, actions, and decisions begins.But if I were to suggest a word that should universally mean both an end and a beginning for the human condition, I would chose success. See while everyone identifies with success as an end, the smart people know that it is also ... just the beginning.  When Bill Gate achieved success in his business life it marked the start of his philanthropic one. When Nelson Mandela achieved success in getting out of prison it marked the start of his rise to the presidency. When Steve Jobs succeeded with the Apple I and iPod it marked the start of the Macintosh and the iPhone invention respectively. Success for people like these is never just an end in itself, it is also an opportunity for a new beginning, which they grab with both hands. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, \u2018end\u2019. The beginning of a hotdog is at one end and the end of a hotdog is at the other. I prefer not the call the colloquial \u201cending\u201d, or final part the end. I would rather it be referred to as the terminal end as concurrent the beginning end. People seem to assume end only means the finish and not congruently the start. For this reason, many people think the week goes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, then the weekend (why are there two days at the terminal end?) Saturday and Sunday. Now many people consider Monday the start of the week depending on the calendar they use and their work schedule; this is also the international standard. But I consider Sunday the start of the week (along with the United States of America, Canada, and Japan). Saturday and Sunday are irrefutably the week ends (space intended), but I claim that Sunday is the beginning end of the week and Saturday is the terminal end. Weeks are cyclic much like a loop and you can imagine adjoining the two ends of the aforementioned* hot dog to make the loop. One of those two ends did not contain both of the ends. Each end only contains one which is why it makes little sense to me that Saturday and Sunday are considered the weekend (no space intended), both being at the terminal end. Long story short. The word end has multiple definitions and can be used to describe both the beginning and terminal ends. *Side note: Words are really cool. Aforementioned contains the prefix afore- and afore means the same thing as before. Unfortunately after has no counterpart in befter. Aft is also the rear end of something (like the stern) whilst fore is the front end of a thing (like a bow [bough not boe]). ",
