            "answer_text": "The Universe is not infinite, it is just inconceivably large. Let me explain\u2026 Let us postulate that there are an infinite number of stars - this cannot be true, otherwise we, and everything in the Universe, would be inside a continuous star, a blending of these infinite stars. OK, so no \u2018infinite Stars\u2019\u2026 Now postulate an Infinite Universe - as there are not Infinite Stars, and assume a moderate spread of non-infinite stars throughout it, the space between stars would tend towards infinity\u2026 this is the thing with Infinity, it goes on for ever. As we can see trillions of stars and galaxies, we can come to the conclusion that space is NOT infinite, just very large - so large, in fact, that, due to expansion of space from dark matter/energy, most of the Universe is so far away that we will never see it due to causality. As to your question; in an infinite Universe, theoretically anything is possible (with the right conditions/energy states), but, as we have observed, there are limits for certain bodies/Stars, and due to gravitation vs internal radiation pressure there cannot be solid bodies over a certain size/mass. So\u2026 No! ",

            "answer_text": "The observable (known) universe isn\u2019t infinite. It\u2019s certainly huge, but it\u2019s size can be captured in a number (billions of light years across). After about 46.5 billion light years in any direction, we reach a \u201chorizon\u201d beyond which we can\u2019t observe anything anymore. Objects beyond that point are moving away faster than light can return to us. That\u2019s the end of the known universe. The entire universe (not restricted to what we observe) has a curvature, curving either in on itself our outward or, if neither, perfectly flat. If it\u2019s perfectly flat, it is infinite. As you\u2019d imagine, these are very difficult things to measure. Especially for an object as immense as a universe. Without getting you (and maybe me) lost in complexity, let\u2019s just note that current measurements show the larger universe to be very, very close to flat. Hence (probably) infinite. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The actual universe isn\u2019t infinite, but regardless of that, there are limits to the mass of any body, and they preclude any mass in the universe being much bigger than the largest stars. The limits are called the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit for cold bodies like neutron stars, and the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars. For any masses greater than these limits, gravity will overcome the nuclear forces at work and they would become black holes. ",
