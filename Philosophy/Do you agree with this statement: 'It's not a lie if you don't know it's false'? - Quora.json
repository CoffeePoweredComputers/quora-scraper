            "answer_text": "Do you agree with this statement: \"It's not a lie if you don't know it's false\"? I can rephrase this question to \u201cdoes \u2018lie\u2019 mean that the untruth is deliberate?\u201d And when I have a question about what a word means, I consult a dictionary. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m not suggesting that dictionaries always capture all nuances involved with everything. But I am suggesting that if your reaction to what someone else says is \u201cThat\u2019s not what that means!\u201d and you consult the dictionary and find that it is, you\u2019re wrong. So let\u2019s check. the definition of lie: a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood. So yes, it seems that this is a common definition. When someone uses a common definition, it\u2019s not a cop-out. It\u2019s how the word is normally used. \u2026claiming something to be true when you don\u2019t actually know it to be true is just as bad as lying. What do you think? I think you\u2019re mistaken. I think that telling lies is immoral. Saying something that you believe is true is not. ",

Also, if you don\u2019t know the intent of the person who stated it, you also cannot call it a lie. The bar is quite high for calling something a lie, and that is why you do not hear this language often in public discourse. This is why it was so shocking when a Congressman shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d during one of Obama\u2019s State of the Union speeches (also, the rude interruption). ",

            "answer_text": "It is more accurate to say that \"It is not a lie if you believe that it is true\". So, in an unrigged casino, if I say before the roulette wheel is spun \"the ball will certainly fall on the number 12\", then I am lying, even if the ball does happen to land the number 12. It is a lie because (mental illness aside) I did not believe that the ball would certainly fall on the number 12. Now, believing something to be true is not the same as knowing that something is true, or being free of any doubt that something is true. If I look out the window and at the weather forecast and tell my wife that it won't rain today, then I am not lying if I believe it, even if I know that sometimes forecasts are wrong. ",

In a case where the person is not absolutely certain that what he or she is saying is true, a qualifier like \u201cI think\u201d or \u201cI believe\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not absolutely certain\u201d can be used to indicate that there is still some room for doubt.
