            "answer_text": "This question is a non sequitur, the conclusion that Love cannot exist unless there is evil doesn't follow. The opposite of evil isnt Love. Evil is a purely subjective premise, until One takes action that which can be judged as evil acts. A person cannot be considered evil if they never act upon the thoughts and ideas that we might judge as immoral evil acts. People cannot be punished or judged for their private thoughts, who are we to enforce thought crimes? I would argue that punishing people for their thoughts, is evil. Love is both a subjective and objective phenomenon. We have thoughts that reflect our love for others, our pets, and other objective things. We display the  objective nature of our love through actions that reflect our love. One cannot claim to love their wife, and then subsequently beat her to the point of hospitalization. Actions like that which I have used as an example, serve as a contradiction that makes the emotion incompatible with the action. Many, many, even most people never commit or even have thoughts we could identify as evil. Evil is not a necessary nor opposite quantifier for love. Ask yourself, if there were no evil acts, ideas, or concepts that humans could or would manifest, would there also be no love? I don't think they are related, hence this is a non sequitur. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely.  There's no logical conflict between the existence of love and the absence of evil.  Therefore, there are possible worlds in which the existence of love and the absence of evil coexist.    An omniscient god would have known about these possible worlds.  An omnipotent god would have been able to create one of these goodworlds (worlds that have love and free will but that don't have evil) rather than this badworld (world that has evil).  A good god (who was also omniscient and omnipotent) would have chosen to create a goodworld rather than a badworld.    Therefore, the existence of evil in this, the actual world, proves that no omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent gods exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Love can and must exist alongside the idea of the lack of love but the notion of evil is a wrong in this context. It is too easy to assume that love and evil exist in all situations. I was without a relationship and love for decades but that does not mean I rode alongside of evil. \"Love and evil\" is a religious coupling and has nothing to do with everyday normal behaviour. They exist in the rarefied realm of religious teachings and do actually have  credence in that context. Where there is a lack of love there is not a void filled by evil. It is an empty space non the less. Hollywood has exploited the notion of evil verses love for decades and in this way it has become a created reality. What is evil in any case? If you believe in a god then you may believe in the scriptures as they are taught but it has to be argued that evil can exist but it is alone and seperate from love. Can you ever be a little bit evil or is evil just a frightening word overused in many situations. There are those who are deemed evil but who do love their family or pets. Are they not therefore just a bit 'evil'? ",

Even the thought of loveLove is not an experience  Love is state of being.Listen to the following conversation: Clip from Swami Chinmayananda's interview.mp4 Interviewer: Swamiji, Anything else you would like to tell me? Swami Chinmayananda: I think I have nothing to tell..., Keep quiet. The only spiritual truth is \"SHUT UP AND GET OUT\".... I am not insulting you.. SHUT UP in your mind-not in mouth-Next thought need not come, and GET OUT of this misconception that You are this body...You are not Your body,, You are something more than your body...You are not the body...You are the all-pervading internal essence, the self, the consciousness, the life in you.. The life in You is the life everywhere...Discover Your identity with God, the One life everywhere and that cannot be done until You shut up ( laughs) so all I can tell you is \"SHUT UP AND GET OUT\"... Thank you! ",

But evil is entirely a different concept which exists after the death of the each living organism. Even there can be a love between the evils but all evils may not have love with each other. Love here means different types. I can also say that evil is an illusive way of representing the once own beliefs. ",
