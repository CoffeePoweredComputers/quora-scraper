            "answer_text": "I would suggest anyone who already understands the fundamentals of anarchism (that it is pure democracy wherein power is distributed equally, rather than chaos wherein power has vacuums) to take a good, long look... at Steam Greenlight. That's right--the video game distribution platform. The Greenlight process has almost no oversight from Valve, except in the cases of the most severe copyright violations (which isn't even necessary). Instead, the mass of gamers vote on the games and vote against the games. Someone uploaded Minecraft recently, and it almost immediately got shot down by the gaming community, because the uploader wasn't the creator of Minecraft; this was substantiating evidence of considerable value to us anarchists who have argued against the need for Intellectual Property laws.  Yet, people still clamor to have Valve step in and prevent games like Yohjo Simulator (Little Girl Simulator) from even reaching Greenlight to be voted on. Seriously. Despite Greenlight having shown consistently for the past few years that anarchism works at policing itself, people are crying for Valve to step in, in a very undemocratic and totalitarian way, to restrict their own ability to vote. It's rather bizarre, and at the heart of it lies that idea that is absolutely ripping America part at the seams: \"If I don't like something, some authority should make that something not exist/not happen, even though it has no effect on me at all.\" So the primary consequence of anarchism would be that people would have to learn to tolerate things that they don't like and that don't affect them. Strange, wacky idea that, I know. The idea of \"live and let live\" and \"not forcing people to abide by one's own standards\" is abhorrent in the United States particularly, but it's a fundamental tenet of liberty, and therefore anarchy. I'm actually writing a book on the subject--what Steam Greenlight has to teach us about how anarchy works beautifully, and how it demonstrates that no law or authority figure is necessary to make people behave. Minecraft was pulled down without Valve doing anything, because the community refused to support someone trying to sell Minecraft when they didn't make it. \"Kill the Faggot\" or whatever it was called was pulled down in almost record time by a community that was thoroughly disgusted. And with Valve letting things like Professor Teaches Outlook 2016 on Steam onto Steam, it serves as unequivocal evidence that authorities do no better at \"protecting\" the masses than the masses do at protecting themselves.  While I'm not trying to make the case for anarchism here (look for my upcoming book to do that :D, or the past V2: The Voluntary Voice--no money goes to me, it may be worth mentioning, for V2), the fact is that Steam Greenlight will show you everything you need to know about Anarchy and how it works. It's rather elegant, and beautifully democratic. The only issue is that people seem unwilling to live and let live, even regarding things that have no impact on them whatsoever. People, for example, demand Valve take down Yohjo Simulator as though its very existence is an offense to them, when its continued existence is actually evidence that many people support and enjoy the game--even if only for \"ironic\" reasons. The people demanding intervention from Valve are effectively saying, \"I don't care if you like it--Valve should make it stop existing because I don't like it.\"  A wake-up call, then, that people have no right to inhibit the existence or occurrence of things and behaviors that do not affect them in any way, would be the primary consequence. As to the others, Steve Day sums it up rather nicely. ",

            "answer_text": "Anarchism means that there is no state. The state is defined as the organization with a monopoly of violence. \u201cMonopoly of Violence\u201d sounds like a bad leftist punk-funk band, with a thirty-something guy screaming about how much he hates his high school teacher in the song \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do!, but\u2026 It actually means that there is an organization that decides who, how and when violence can be used, and if you break those rules, you may be punished. So, in anarchism, if there is no state to decide the laws, and no monopoly of violence to say who can use violence or not, what is the disadvantage of that? Well, it means you can go around beat people up and steal things if you want. Anarchy means there is no law. So it\u2019s not illegal to do that. But will not other people stop you? Sure, it\u2019s their right to try to stop you from doing that. But you can then just gather a larger gang with more people, and you can beat up the guys trying to stop you. So in the end they will have to gather people in the whole city to stop you, but nothing prevents you from going to a next, bigger city and say \u201cHey, lets attack that city and steal all their stuff!\u201d Yeah, you see where this is going: You just get larger and larger groups, trying to protect themselves from each other. And within those groups? Well, obviously, the point of the group is to stop you from getting beat up, so within the group, violence would be illegal. And there is some organization making sure the people in one group beat each other up. Which means the group has a monopoly of violence. Which means the group is a state. So, as you see, anarchism is simply a temporary state of lawlessness when the people with the most weapons and highest willingness to use it can do whatever they want. I\u2019m sure you can see the disadvantage with that. ",
