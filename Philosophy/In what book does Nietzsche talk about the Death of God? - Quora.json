            "answer_text": "He talks about the idea mainly in two books; both from the middle period of his career. First is in Book III of The Gay Science or, as it\u2019s sometimes called; The Joyful Wisdom/Science. Two of it\u2019s sections mention or discuss the idea, but the most famous is Section 125. This features the oft-quoted, if also oft-misused quote of: \u201cGod is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?\u201d This part is the most famous individual statement to which relates on it. But the idea has been commonly associated with Nietzsche\u2019s following; and most famous text, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The section in particular whence it is directly mentioned, is at the end of the 2nd section of \u201cZarathustra\u2019s Prologue\u201d. In it, he meets a wandering ascetic in a forest who loves God, and after the two depart; this is said: \u201cBut when Zarathustra was alone, he spoke thus to his heart: \"Could it be possible! This old saint has not heard in his forest that God is dead!\"\u201d To my knowledge, he mentions the idea in none of his other texts thereafter, perhaps excluding a mention or reference in one of his last works; The Anti-Christ.
