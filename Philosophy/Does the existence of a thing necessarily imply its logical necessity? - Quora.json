            "answer_text": "No. Something is logically necessary if it could not have not existed. A fairly plausible example of logically necessary entities are numbers. I can understand why some people think that, since it is a necessary truth that \u201c1+1=2\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d and other numbers are logically necessary objects. But the screwdriver that I am looking at right now is clearly not a necessary object. It could very easily not have existed. It is a contingent object. I cannot think of any good reason for saying that the screwdriver is logically necessary. I can see how this might seem to be true based on confused thinking about modal logic. From Necessarily (If p then q) We cannot infer (If p then Necessarily q). It does seem correct to say that Necessarily (If p then p). So Necessarily (If the screwdriver exists then the screwdriver exists). But to infer from this that (If the screwdriver exists then necessarily the screwdriver exists) is fallacious. ",

            "answer_text": "Mm, a \u201cthing\" must be necessary for something in a relative sense, but is that something necessary in itself. Is a gun necessary? Well its necessary to attack or provide defense, but those reasons are only necessary because of social disorder, war or crime-we don't need them now to hunt. So are war,crime and social unrest necessary? Well those who adhere to evolutionary theory might say yes as the tension and conflict sift the strong from the weak and provide a mechanism for change,development and diversity. Then does evolution have a necessity?. Does it matter whether life exists or not and what form it takes? This argument can ofcourse infinitely regress. Is there an ultimate purpose? And are things then necessary to that purpose or disadvantageous to it,or neutral? And if something is disadvantageous to that purpose is that necessary as a counterbalance or required to give validity to its antithesis. I think the logical necessity of something that exists can only be validated in relative terms. But like all philosophical questions a better answer could be given if there was an absolute reference frame of truth and reason. But thats another question. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Manchester City won the English Premier League after scoring twice in stoppage time on 13 May 2012. The inscription engraved on the trophy for that season accordingly reads \u201cCity\u201d instead of \u201cUnited\u201d. Any assertion that this inscription is logically necessary implies that we cannot imagine a world in which City failed to score those two late goals, or otherwise slipped up during the preceding season. Outside of some Leibnizian fantasy, that really is complete nonsense. ",

That something was not necessarily there would mean that nothing was there to express it. It\u2019s a wonderful state of mind to play in, and i did when i was 20. i learned \u2018logical necessity\u2019 back then, and that was kind of a beautiful and perfect intellectual time for me. so, read everything, since everything written kind of talks about this.
