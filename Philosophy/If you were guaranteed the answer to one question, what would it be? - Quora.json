            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not very interesting as a hypothetical; but our human birth and nature entitle us to far more than abstract thought experiments. Many persons throughout history and the present have had such opportunities. In a sense, a human birth and mind comprise a metaposition on this question. My point is simply that the pursuit of such a question is rather different than having an answer delivered; we seem to be, in general, extremely and lethally confused about this matter. Thankfully, such situations as those actually on offer neither particularly require or reward the necessary verbal formation of a question; like dreaming, there are many other ways of asking, learning and seeing. But if I were to ask a specific verbal question, why should I presume that one I would form prior to the experience of having an answer offered, and the context and beings in which that was happening... would be useful, intelligent, or in any way desireable? In other words, why do we pose questions as if future versions of ourselves, in absolute abstract language and decontexted... \u2018have\u2019 things... qualities, identities, goals... anything. I think we have a habit of disappearing into language. How and where I acquired such a guarantee, and the purposes and relationships involved would matter deeply. However, if I was to hazard an abstract question from an abstract version of me, with no context whatsoever... I might, like another person who answered here, select a question would go directly to matters of eminent local concern. Something like one of the questions I ... maintain relations with (and have asked): \u201cHow can we establish something resembling relation intelligence in our species?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the story of our minds and potentials as human beings on Earth?\u201d The latter, we might imagine, would contain the antidote without being necessarily limited to it.

A snarky and sarcastic answer e.g. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand even if I told you\u201d?

It is *MY* question \u2026 therefore *I* get to JUDGE the answer. \u2026 Okay \u2026 \u2026 Then my question is: \u201cHow do I build a system that will allow me to transfer the wealth of humanity\u2019s collective knowledge including our history, language, mathematics, and science into each-and-every human mind reasonably effectively and efficiently via direct electrical connection to neurons enabling both us and our descendants to transcend the current 21st century method of schooling that requires years of reading, memorizing, and studying?\u201d ",
