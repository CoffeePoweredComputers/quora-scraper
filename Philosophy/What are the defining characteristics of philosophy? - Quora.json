            "answer_text": "By philosophers I mean original and creative thinking philosopher living FOR philosophy (the lover of wisdom) and not scholarly, pedantic, academic professionals studying the ideas and work of other thinkers to obtain a living OF the subject. (Meta-Philosophy) Why read Philosophy? (of original- and creative-thinking rather than derivative, academic professionals) THE INSTITUTIONAL and PERSONAL NEED for PHILOSOPHY A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside either theology or science. The term \"philosopher\" comes from the Ancient Greek \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 meaning \"lover of wisdom\". Wikipedia You can stuyd it combined with other subjects such as mathematics, sociology, psychology etc. Those other subjects might provide you with better job opportunities than philosophy and if you no longer wish to continue your studies of philosophy you could concentrate on the other subject/s. A traditional combination of subjects at Oxbridge is PPE. If you still feel interested after the general Wikipedia introduction, here I wrote about branches of philosophy Death of Philosophy 8 Branches or its subject matter (Meta) Philosophy: searching for its subject-matter .docx and its methods Philosophy : methods, methodology The philosophy you encounter will probably be the usual academic teaching of it as the History of Western Ideas and at Oxbridge more small group questioning/discussion/thinking explorations. (Meta-Philosophy) Why read Philosophy? (of original- and creative-thinking rather than derivative, academic professionals) I am interested in original and creative thinking philosophy and philosophers and deals with that here PHILOSOPHY \u2013 Aims, Methods, Rationale. My interest is meta-philosophy, or meta- or second-order thinking and talking about philosophy itself, its methods, aims, etc. See this In this meta-philosophical study I commence with an investigation of Wisdom. I then continue with an exploration of the institutionalization of the subject and the professionalization of those involved in it. This I contrast with original and creative philosophizing. In then sows that philosophizing resembles and attempts to do theorizing. The 9 questions, etc of the Socratic Method and details of the Philosophical Toolkit occur throughout different stages of theorizing as one level and one dimension of it.

Most people think of philosophy as living OFF it as just another job after they obtained PhD. I do not know how the few individuals who share my passion for philosophy realize that it is their passion. The majority of individuals involved in or having qualifications in philosophy merely live OF the subject and if they never became involved in the subject it would not have made any difference to the discourse of philosophy or the manner of executing this socio-cultural practice. It depends what do you mean by philosopher? Someone who has under-graduate and post-graduate qualifications in the subject? And advance to become a serious scholar of some aspects of the history of the Western tradition of philosophy, or of particular branches or domains or sub-domains of the discipline, or of a particular problem for example concerned with \u2018Mind\u2019, \u2018Free Will\u2019, etc? Or, who explore philosophical tools, methods, such as logic, reasoning and argumentation? Well all the above are still mere scholarly academics - so you might move onto pedantic, derivative teachers of philosophy or professional, academic philosophers. My interpretation of the word philosopher refers to the original and creative thinking person , those whose names populate the history of philosophy. Sadly to become part of this highly selective tribe no nurture will guarantee you a place in it as at least some elements such as genes, personality-type, etc are required as well. Of course you can and would have to develop and perfect certain skills such as critical thinking, reasoning and argumentation but those things are merely taken for granted basics. Given the above - ask questions and identify problems that are unique to yourself and deal with them by means of existing philosophical tools, methods, skills and techniques. In the process or during the execution of your philosophizing, which is part of the processes of theorizing you are bound to develop your own variations on existing techniques and tools and create some of your own. (Meta-Philosophy) Why read Philosophy? (of original- and creative-thinking rather than derivative, academic professionals) Et voila! There you are a creative and original thinking philosopher and not a mere, pedantic, derivative, academic scholar or paid professional living off the discipline, but someone passionate about it and living for it.

            "answer_text": "On a face level is answering a series of \u201cWhys?\u201d until you are talking about the nature of the universe itself. But mostly it used in two aspects: Why things happen and how you should live life. Understand that many questions in life do not have singular answers. Rather that have a whole array of answers all of which can be correct. It doesn\u2019t deal obviously with pure logic like 2 plus 2 equals 4 but more like how should you treat people? What laws should we have? What should we teach others? Philosophy determines these things by breaking down problems, re-examining each of the parts and figuring what is needed to be figured out by it. To further extent, in the west philosophy is defined by a series of Greek intellectuals and then a series of Renaissance age to modern intellectuals. There are some in between but you get my point. I don\u2019t know much about eastern philosophy to trace it routes but religious figures, academics, generals and sometime royalty define philosophy there. That is to keep in mind much of western religion has seeped in philosophy and vice versa. However later western philosophers reject god, or at least the christian concept of god. But overall philosophy sounds wise, mostly because its very generic and obvious advice. And the good advice is cherry picked and the bad advice (women are inferior, some races are inferior, slavery is good, etc) is sort of pushed to side, lets forget about that. But do keep in mind its obvious now, but wasn\u2019t so obvious back then. Thousands of years of trail and error sort of lead to the best philosophy and some immutable truths. ",
