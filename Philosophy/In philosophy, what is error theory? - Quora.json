            "answer_text": "Take the sentence, \u201cPolygamy is wrong.\u201d It is a moral statement; it deems polygamy as morally wrong. When a meta-ethics expert hears this, she thinks of the following two questions: Is this statement truth-apt? That is, can it be true or false (like the sentence \u201c2 plus 2 equals 4\u201d [analytical truth], or \u201cIt\u2019s raining outside\u201d [empirical truth])If yes, then what makes it true or false? Is it the cultural context that makes a moral statement right or wrong, or is it some natural phenomenon? Maybe some set of fundamental moral principles that makes it right or wrong??According to Error Theory, moral statements are truth-apt. They are not mere utterances of personal like or dislike, approval or disapproval (see: meta-ethical non-cognitivism). So when somebody says \u201cPolygamy is wrong\u201d, he is not meaning \u201cI do not like Polygamy.\u201d He means there is a fact of the matter that makes Polygamy wrong. Then, what is that thing? The Error Theory claims that there is nothing that can make the statement \u201cPolygamy is wrong\u201d true. In other words, no moral statement can be true. They are meant to be true or false, but they are ultimately false. That\u2019s why whenever we make a moral statement, we are in error. Because we are making a statement that cannot be validated. Mackie has two arguments to support that. In a nutshell, the first one, the Argument from Moral Relativism, goes like this: There are way too many moral norms and judgements. It is almost impossible to think that there is an underlying moral fundamental that holds them together. Therefore, morality must be an illusion. The second argument, the Argument from Queerness, goes like this: If moral statements are meant to be true or false, and if some of them are indeed true; then there must be something, some sort of fact that makes them true. But if there is such a fact, how do we know it? Does it smell like anything? Can we see or hear it? If it is something you get by magical intuitions, then what faculty of your brain (or heart) that enables you to get morality right, whereas makes me get it wrong? Should we conclude that my brain lacks something that you are equipped with? What kind of a fact is that? Whatever it is, it must be a way too queer thing to sense. Important: Error Theory is a really smart and elegant theory and has a lot of appeal. It is a great place to start studying morality. But it shoots at primarily religious doctrines and naturalistic moral theories. It doesn\u2019t really work against secular moral doctrines that rely on analytical truth (like Math). Secondly, our everyday moral practice (e.g., moral talk, moral judgement, moral thought, moral motivations etc.) is real! We do it everyday and we feel its weight on us (except psychopaths, maybe). If Error Theory is true, then we all got it wrong from the beginning. That would make morality the biggest lie on earth. So, the Error Theory is a bit like a conspiracy theory. ",

            "answer_text": "An error theory always has the same form: A subject S believes in a discourse X (which is a set of propositions) because S also believes in a premise Y, which guarantees the truth of the propositions in X. However, the premise Y is false, and therefore the discourse X is systematically false. Sometimes the error theorist doesn\u2019t want to say that the discourse X is systematically false; he (or she) prefers to say something like \u201cUntil we substitute premise Y for some true premise Y*, it is impossible to declare the discourse X as being systematically true.\u201d Still, this continues to be an error theory. Mackie\u2019s moral error theory is the most famous error theory of them all, and therefore many think that \u201cerror theory\u201d = \u201cMackie\u2019s moral error theory\u201d. However, there are dozens of error theories in philosophy. It\u2019s interesting to note that often the presupposition Y postulates the existence of something which, according to the error theorist, doesn\u2019t exist. Ontology is an important business! ",
