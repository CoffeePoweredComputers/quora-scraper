Earthly Desires: The Root of Unhappiness Earthly Desires: The Root of UnhappinessLectures on Basic Study Materialsfrom Dai-Byakuho, issue no. 366 I. What is the Cause of Suffering?In Buddhism, while it is taught that there are Four Sufferings fromwhich no one can escape \u2013 birth, old age, sickness, and death \u2013 thereare many other hardships and worries, in addition to the abovementioned four, with which we are constantly beset in our dailylives. The question is: \u201cHow do these endless troubles come about,and where do they come from?\u201d If we can penetrate the origin ofsuffering, and transform its root function, then we should be able toeliminate unhappiness and suffering from our lives.In accordance with the Gosho\u2019s statement about the \u201cThree Paths ofEarthly Desire, Karma (Action) and Suffering,\u201d Buddhism explainsthat suffering arises from negative (evil) action, which is in turn bornfrom earthly desires. II. What are Earthly Desires?\u201cKlesa\u201d, the Sanskrit word for \u201cearthly desires\u201d, is translated asmeaning: \u201cthat which possesses a polluted heart\u201d, or, \u201cthat whichcauses distress\u201d. The classical Chinese characters for \u201cearthly desires\u201dtranslate as some of the following: \u201ctemptation/losing oneself\u201d;\u201cdriven by evil paths\u201d and; \u201cunclean, polluted\u201d. Hinayana Buddhismuses another word for earthly desires \u2013 zuimin, (literally, toaccompany, sleeping). This word is used because earthly desires donot appear on the surface, but lay dormant deep within the recessesof the heart. Quite disconnected from an individual\u2019s conscious, thesedesires will come into function in accordance with the outside stimulibeing encountered.As can be understood from these interpretations, earthly desiresfunction both to cause anguish in the human mind and body, and toobstruct the correct path to the attainment of Buddhahood. III. Kinds of Earthly DesireIt is taught in the \u201cTheory on the Attainment of the OneConsciousness\u201d (\u201cJoyui Yuishiki ron\u201d), that earthly desires are dividedbetween the basic \u201cFundamental Earthly Desires\u201d, and theirderivatives, the \u201cAccompanying Earthly Desires\u201d. The \u201cFundamentalEarthly Desires\u201d are:1) Ton: Attachment2) Jin: Anger3) Chi: Stupidity (blind to reason)4) Man: Arrogance5) Gi: Doubt (with disbelief in the Law, hesitation)6) Ken: Views (clinging to heretical views)The first five desires are known as the Five Delusive Passions, and 3),stupidity, is sometimes also called \u201cignorance\u201d or \u201cspiritual darkness\u201d.We next present the twenty kinds of \u201cAccompanying EarthlyDesires\u201d: (1) anger, (2) bearing of grudges, (3) deceit, (4) worry, (5)jealousy, (6) stinginess, (7) lying, (8) flattery, (9) pride, (10) to causeinjury, (11) cruelty, (12) shamelessness, (13) brooding, (14)ostentation, (15) disbelief, (16) sloth, neglect, laziness, (17) self-indulgence, (18) mindlessness, (19) creation of disturbance and, (20)adherence to incorrect information. IV. What are the Three Illusions?In his Maka Shikan, the great Buddhist master T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai explainedthat all earthly desires (illusions) are divided into three kinds. Theyare called the Three Illusions and consist of: (a) illusions of thoughtand desires; (b) illusions innumerable as particles of dust and sand,and; (c) illusions about the true nature of life. (1) illusions of thought and desire (Japan: kenji-waku)The Japanese word \u201ckenji-waku\u201d refers to illusions of thought(kenwaku) and illusions of desire (shiwaku), and because they arethe cause of suffering in the threefold world and the six paths, theyare known as \u201cWorldly Illusions\u201d (within the threefold world and thesix paths). Further, because they are illusions which people of thethree vehicles of Learning, Realization and Bodhisattva share incommon, and should suppress, another term for these illusions is\u201cShared Illusions\u201d.Illusions of thought are learned illusions, referring to confusion aboutthe reason of worldly matters, and are called mistaken ideas.Kenwaku are further divided into two groups of five, respectivelycalled the \u201cFive Rishi [Reasoning Devices]\u201d and the \u201cFive Donshi[Subtle Devices]\u201d1 The Five Rishi are:(a) Shinken: the self-centered view that we exist as independentindividuals.Another aspect is Gashoken, or the view that we own or possessthings.(b) Henken: Within Henken, there are two one-sided views, Dankenbeing the view that our being ceases at death, whileJoken is the view that after death we exist as eternal, individualsouls.(c) Jaken: denies the law of cause and effect.(d) Kenjuken: attachment to the above three distorted views, aswell as belief in the superiority of things which are actually inferior.(e) Kaigonshuken: includes a distorted view of cause and effect andbelief in heretical religious\u2019 assertions that theirs are correct paths toenlightenment. Kaishuken is adherence to the prohibitiveHinayana/heretical precepts against evil conduct. Gonshuken isattachment to the austerities of these heretical religions.Because the above are based on ideology and are incisive earthlydesires that can immediately be eliminated through understanding ofcorrect reasoning, these illusions are called \u201cReasoning Devices\u201d.Contrary to these, the Five Donshi refer to the first five of the abovementioned fundamental earthly desires \u2013 attachment, anger,stupidity, arrogance, and doubt. Even when we are careful to avoidthese errors, because these illusions possess characteristics that wecannot instantly eradicate, they are referred to as \u201cSubtle Devices\u201d..Subsequently, illusions of desire (shiwaku), also known as \u201cIllusionsPervading All Life\u201d, are emotional illusions which arise instinctively,and include four of the Five Subtle Devices \u2013 attachment, anger,stupidity and arrogance.According to Hinayana training, the level of one who has severedhimself from kenwaku (illusions of thought) is called kendo (to seethe path), while the level of one who has severed himself fromshiwaku (illusions of desire) is called shudo (to master the path).Further, the level of one who has severed himself from bothkenwaku and shiwaku can either be called mugakudo (not study thepath) or arakan (arhat).However, in terms of the numbers of illusions, there are eighty-eightillusions of thought and eighty-one illusions of desire. In Japanesesociety, earthly desires are numbered according to the one hundredand eight times temple bells are struck to ring out the old year andbring in the new. But the number (108) actually comes from anassortment of illusions of thought and desire. (2) Illusions Innumerable as Particles of Dust and Sand (Japan: Jinja-waku)These illusions, together with the third group \u2013 illusions about thetrue nature of life (Japan: Mumyo-waku), can only be eradicated bybodhisattvas, and are therefore Betsu-waku (distinct illusions).Because these illusions do not belong to the sphere of the six paths,they are also referred to as \u201cOuter-world Illusions\u201d.The Japanese word Jinja means \u201cdust\u201d and \u201csand\u201d. Just as these wordsimply minuteness, so the word Jinja indicates the infinite and thecountless. When a Mahayana bodhisattva tries to lead mankindtoward emancipation, all kinds of obstacles arise. In order to copewith these obstacles, such a bodhisattva needs to communicatecountless teachings. The countless illusions which arise from thestudy of such teachings are called Jinja-waku, or illusionsinnumerable as particles of dust and sand. (3) Illusions about the True Nature of Life (Japan: Mumyo-waku)These illusions are the foundation of all earthly desires whichobstruct one from attaining enlightenment to the truth of the middlepath (Buddhahood). Until Shakyamuni\u2019s Perfect Teaching \u2013 thecombined Lotus and Nirvana Sutras, it was stipulated that there wereforty-two stages one must pass before achieving the highest stage ofBuddhahood. Each stage along the way has its own illusions about thetrue nature of life, from which a bodhisattva must extricate him orherself. The final illusion to be overcome before attaining the forty-second stage is known as \u201cfundamental darkness\u201d or \u201cprimalignorance\u201d. The Daishonin states in The Treatment of Illness:The fundamental nature of enlightenment manifests itself as Bontenand Taishaku, whereas the fundamental darkness manifests itself asthe Devil of the Sixth Heaven. (M.W., Vol. 3, p. 279)This passage explains that just before a person reachesenlightenment, the fundamental darkness changes into the form ofthe Devil of the Sixth Heaven, who tries in every way possible toprevent that person from attaining Buddhahood. V. What are the Causes of Earthly Desires?Because our suffering arises from earthly desire, what then is theorigin of earthly desire? A passage from the Yugashiji Ron (Treatiseon the Stages of Yoga Practice) states:It is said that there are six kinds of causes for earthly desire. Thefirst kind is due to outer appearance, the second is due to religion,the third is due to close intimacy, the fourth is due to hereticalteachings, the fifth is due to instruction and the sixth is due to theintention to act.The reason that we refute heretical teachings and warn against closeintimacy with slander is that heretical teachings and slander arecauses for earthly desire and become causes for unhappiness. VI. Earthly Desires Contradict But Are Endowed With EnlightenmentHinayana Buddhism explains that a person cannot attainenlightenment unless he extinguishes earthly desire. In the extreme,Hinayana teachings use a term which means to burn the physicalbody to ashes and extinguish wisdom of the heart to say thatreaching the highest life condition of enlightenment is impossibleunless a person goes as far as to destroy the body. But the LotusSutra explains:Without eradicating earthly desire or ridding oneself from desiresarising from the five senses, one will purify the various senses anderadicate various offenses. (Kanfugen Sutra)This passage teaches that without eradicating earthly desire, we canconvert them into enlightenment just as we are. In the Teaching ofthe True Body, the Daishonin states:A person who honestly discards the provisional teachings andwholeheartedly believing in the Lotus Sutra chants only Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo will transform the three paths of worldly desire,evil karma and suffering into the three virtuous fortunes ofenlightened life, Buddha wisdom and illusion-free mind.The Daishonin teaches us that when we chant to the Dai-Gohonzon ofthe Three Great Secret Laws with pure faith, our earthly desiresbecome the cause for enlightenment and our mortal bodies, just aswe are, can attain the life condition of the Buddha. Footnotes:1 Five Rishi and Five Donshi: \u201creasoning\u201d refers to ideologicalmatters, while \u201csubtle\u201d refers to emotional matters. We use bothideological and emotional devices to accomplish desired ends. Whenthese devices are employed without practice to the Gohonzon, wetend to be overtaken or enslaved by those very devices. Therefore,in a negative context, the word \u201cdevice\u201d could be replaced by theword \u201cslavery\u201d, (e.g., \u201cslavery to alcohol/drugs\u201d or \u201cslavery to love\u201d.) \u00a91995 Nichiren Shoshu Monthly ",
