            "answer_text": "Hi, Thank you for your request to answer. A powerful question, that I will \u2018take a crack\u2019 at. For me? anyhow . . . I don\u2019t understand that to actually be \u2018heart value\u2019 issue, but rather a \u2018brain value\u2019 experience of training, and education values. Basically the difference between \u2018Subjective thinking\u2019 and and \u2018Objective Understanding\u2019. That comes down to which \u2018base\u2019, \u2018realm\u2019, \u2018dimension\u2019 one judges it in/by. example 2 +3 = 5? What if I said \u201cno, it actually equals 12! the vid below will show you the \u2018whats up with that\u2019?  O.K. notwlet me \u2018stretch that\u2019 into an Objective Understanding dimension. Your kids are playing in the Park . . . a naked married couple strolls right thru the middle of em, you 911 / the cops and all is fixed? Nope The Guy and his Wife are Adam and Eve . . . They don\u2019t see an issue with that, until a legal salesman with a badge says \u201cyou need to understand the \u2018laws of the knowledge of good and bad (evil) rules / and that you aren\u2019t in the realm of \u2018innocense now? you used to be in it. But NOW! -You are under arrest. Why is \u2018naked truth so hard? I understand it to be? That the (snake) legal salesman doesn\u2019t make many $$$ unless he can convince mortals? that \u2018The Law\u201d, is rather to be respected instead of the Spirit of the Law . . . BOOM. Compelled and unnatural rules, of paradigm B are not the same as the rules in paradigm A . . . and right on down the line. Now? it even gets a bit deeper than that. Your Big Screen, your Computer, and your cell phone? They don\u2019t work from either paradigm A or B . . . but the set of rules that makes them do their thing? \u201cBinary Code\u201d . . . \u2018the big guy\u2019 I would \u2018Objectively Understand\u2019? Most can\u2019t begin to grasp \u2018Objective Understanding\u2019 / also known as WISDOM Herself/Himself? Whom is rather a \u2018being\u2019, not a book of leaves of law. \u2018the broken mirror reflection of Mortality itself. That is something? I would bet $$$ on. Hey, thanks again for the request, I did enjoy sharing with you / my Understanding.You go and have a great day. from that lion CUB scout from the land of Judah (no! not the \u2018religion\u2019) - just the land) - easy to find - it\u2019s boundaries are \u2018drawn in the sand\u2019.

The naked truth feels harsh only when our ego feels it as bitter, when it makes us feel badly emotionally. There are certain discernments we must make when evaluating truth\u2014bitter/sweet and truth/falsehood. Truth resides in the laws of nature\u2014inter-dependence, altruism, harmony, interconnection, balance, unity. Any actions not in alignment with these laws can be considered false. The ultimate goal is that we are able to express the sweet truth. Choosing The Sweet Bitterness Of Truth | Laitman.com ",
