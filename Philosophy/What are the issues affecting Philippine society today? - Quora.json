Many Filipinos depend on what the government gives for them and we blame the government too if there is something that went wrong. We also say \u201cbahala na\u201d which means \u201cwhatever happens, will happen.\u201d We are not doing something to keep the course of our economy well, we just let time do its work. We also have corrupt politicians. Budgets for government projects will be stolen by politicians and use them for their own benefit. Poverty. Many Filipinos do not have a high standard of living and do not have good job to help them earn. Our current inflation rate. The Philippine Peso starts to drop and the prices in our markets become high\u2014 making Filipino citizens put themselves on a budget. Rice crisis. Philippines is blessed to have fertile land. Making agriculture our primary export. Especially rice, knowing that rice is a staple in a Filipino diet. A meal is not a meal without rice and many areas in our country are the largest producers of rice like Nueva Ecija which is entitled \u201c The Rice Grannary of the Philippines.\u201d ",
