            "answer_text": "What are examples of immoral beliefs?  Blackism. Blackism is an example of immoral belief. I\u2019ll attempt demonstrate this position. Blackism is the belief that black men are superior to non-black men (especially white men) because (a) they are larger penises than non-black men (especially white men) and (b) women (especially white women) favor them (black men) over non-black men (especially white men). The point is to make black men feel superior to non-black men (especially white men) and to make non-black men feel inferior to black men (especially white men). Blackism is rampant in both the public media and pornographic media. For example, in South Park (Comedy Central) we are shown white women picking the white \u201clittle\u201d hand exerciser (really a dildo) over the \u201clarger\u201d black hand exerciser. For example, in Chappelle\u2019s Show (Comedy Central) we see a group of black men steal away the white girlfriend of a white man, have sex with her (group of black men) as her now former white boyfriend watches it, cries and masturbates to it. The point here is also to emasculate and humiliate white men (make them feel inferior to black men). To you use white women as sex tools and to make black men feel superior to white men. For example, in any pornographic category you have the BBC (Big Black Cock) videos having sex with white women. The idea that black men have the largest penises is a major gospel in the pornographic world and that white women favor them (or women in general) over all other men (especially white men). In porn most black men have overly large penises and for the most part are with non-black women (mostly white). There are more examples but I\u2019ll just leave you with these three examples. This is Blackism. Black men have been made to feel inferior to non-black men (especially white men) over much of their history for being black. So it\u2019s not a shock to see such a reaction. In psychology this is known as superiority complex. That is, hiding your inferiority and pretending to be superior. The truth is that black men do not have large penises. Their penis is not larger than non-black men or white men. Women do not favor black men over non-black men or white men. White women do not prefer black men over non-black men or white men. As I understand the largest penis on record belongs to a white man and most white women favor white men (e.g., most white women in USA are married to white men). White women date Asian men too. Some white women don\u2019t even date men. Some white women don\u2019t even like penis. I just hate Blackism for what it does to women. As if women are good for only being sex tools in the war of men. The mechanical root of Blackism is the male ego. That is, if I have a larger penis and if women favor me, then I am a real man. I have a value as a man. Disgusting. Blackism is not only harmful to non-black men but also to black men. This belief should be rejected by all rational men. Black men are not inferior and nor are white men or non-black men. Your penis size or the favoritism of women says nothing about your value or lack of value. This is the point we have to focus on. What do you think happens when a black man comes to realize that Blackism is a lie? What about black women? What do black women think of being second to white women? It\u2019s a cycle of hate and destruction. There is so much more to say but I hope this give you a basic sense of what a immoral belief is. Fin. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ethical theories and schools of thought which all go about morality and immorality differently. One thing may be believed moral by one person, while the exact opposite may be believed by someone else. Of course, beliefs don't necessarily reflect objective reality. It could be that there is no morality, and so each person or culture basically gets to decide what they think is immoral (and so it is), or else it could be that most people (if not all) are simply mistaken about the truth of morality (and in that case, we do not, and possibly cannot, know for sure what true immorality is). That said, nearly all (other than maybe the occasional radical ethical nihilist/relativist/egoist theory) would assert the belief that harming innocents (when it cannot be reasonably expected to help an even greater number of other innocent people, as with Utilitarianism and other forms of consequentialism) is absolutely forbibben by morality/natural law. This seems to match most people\u2019s gut feeling about the act of murder. It is thus believed, if approached from a place of reason and a belief in the inherent value and worth of other human minds, that to murder someone without either a benevolent intent (as in expected/subjective consequentialism) or effect (as in actual/objective consequentialism), is always immoral, or morally wrong.
