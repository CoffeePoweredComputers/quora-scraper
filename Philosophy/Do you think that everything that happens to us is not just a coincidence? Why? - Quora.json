            "answer_text": "Not at all. \u201cOur very brains revolt at the idea of randomness We have evolves as a species to become pattern-finders; long before the advent of science. Our minds automatically try to place a data in a framework that allows us to make sense of our observations and use them to understand and predict events.\u201d This Will Make You Smarter When I was a kid, I watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. And this is the scene that really carve a print somewhere in my heart: Sometimes we\u2019re on a collision course, and we just don\u2019t know it. Whether it\u2019s by accident or by design, there\u2019s not a thing we can do about it. A woman in Paris was on her way to go shopping, but she had forgotten her coat, went back to get it. When she had gotten her coat, the phone had rung, so she\u2019d stopped to answer it, talked for a couple of minutes. While the woman was on the phone, Daisy was rehearsing for a performance at the Paris Opera House. And while she was rehearsing, the woman, off the phone now, had gone outside to get a taxi. Now, a taxi driver had dropped off a fare earlier and had stopped to get a cup of coffee. And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing. And this cab driver, who dropped off the earlier fare, who\u2019d stopped to get the cup of coffee, had picked up the lady who was going to shopping, and had missed getting an earlier cab. The taxi had to stop for a man crossing the street, who had left for work five minutes later than he normally did, because he forgot to set off his alarm. While that man, late for work, was crossing the street, Daisy had finished rehearsing, and was taking a shower. And while Daisy was showering, the taxi was waiting outside a boutique for the woman to pick up a package, which hadn\u2019t been wrapped yet, because the girl who was supposed to wrap it had broken up with her boyfriend the night before, and forgot. When the package was wrapped, the woman, who was back in the cab, was blocked by a delivery truck; all the while Daisy was getting dressed. The delivery truck pulled away and the taxi was able to move, while Daisy, the last to be dressed, waited for one of her friends, who had broken a shoelace. While the taxi was stopped, waiting for a traffic light, Daisy and her friend came out the back of the theater. And if only one thing had happened differently, if that shoelace hadn\u2019t broken, or that delivery truck had moved moments earlier, or that package had been wrapped and ready, because the girl hadn\u2019t broken up with her boyfriend, or that man had set his alarm and got up five minutes earlier, or that taxi driver hadn\u2019t stopped for a cup of coffee, or that woman had remembered her coat, and got into an earlier cab, Daisy and her friend would\u2019ve crossed the street, and the taxi would\u2019ve driven by; but life being what it is - a series of intersecting lives and incidents, out of anyone\u2019s control - that taxi did not go by, and that driver was momentarily distracted, and that taxi hit Daisy, and her leg was crushed. So I think believing that everything happens for a reason, or betting on our lives being woven or written retrospectively is more of a question of believing a higher absolute deity, or something we say ourselves in order to move on and make do.

            "answer_text": "I personally think that everything happens for a reason. I've had some personal experiences which made me believe that there are no coincidences. I prepared for IIT-JEE in 2010 as a fresher and didn't qualify, I did qualify AIEEE and got good enough rank to get MANIT Bhopal but I opt to drop out one year for the preparation of JEE again , got qualified just by a margin and again got selected in AIEEE. Rank in IIT was not good enough to get anything and at last I choose MANIT Bhopal through AIEEE . So basically I got same college in consecutive years and settled in 2nd time so my one year was waste. Now in final year my immediate senior's placement was very bad and final year of my batch had good placement. So maybe this was the reason for which I didn't took MANIT the first time. I wanted to get selected in Tata motors vary badly. I took test and was preparing for the interview and then the other day I got to know that I didn't qualify in test.I was devastated then on the next day Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. visited for campus recruitment and I got selected in that . Maybe this was the reason I wasn't able to qualify Tata motors test. I got production department in Mahindra. I was told to work under some person in some department but at last moment one of my friends and mine's boss got exchanged. Now I got this boss who was very rude , didn't know how to talk to people , always scolded me and on the contrary my friend got this boss who was not the best but still he was not having behavioural issues. So finally after 6 months of torcher I quit the job , went to prepare for GATE, got 322 rank and currently working in ISRO. If I would have got different boss I might not have left the job and still would have been working there but life had different plans for me. Different people have different thoughts regarding coincidences. You might think that I'm connecting the dots backward but I have found reasons in things that have happened. ",

Well scientifically, telepathy and stuff has been disregarded as they couldn't find the sub-atomic particle that makes it happen. But in real sense, it is something! So whenever a telepath moves something he loses some of his weight (proven). That's why it's advised to think beautiful things. Because your thinking effects other people lives. So maybe an attack at a hotel is the result of someone discussing with Friends \u201chow will the staff manage if someone attacked here\u201d. This is philosophical yet scientifical. ",

Though , I\u2019ve got lot of such examples from my personal experience but I\u2019ll like to share here the most significant one: @ I got my leg fractured just before two days of placement drive in our college (for the job of IT professionals), due to which i could not appear for it. . It was not just a coincidence which I figured out later on. If I would've appeared for the placement drive, I might have got placed in some IT company , without any considerable recognition in the society. But due to my fracture, i was on bed rest for more than a month, and during that time, I got an oppotunity to align my thoughts and focus on my actual goals. Owing to this, i started preparing for govt exams in the last semester of my graduation, and due to focused preperations, cleared various exams in the same year. Now I'm working as a SWO in Canara Bank and will soon be joining SBI as a PO both of which are considered far more reputable jobs than that of a IT professional in a private firm. ",

A state in which all other outcomes are impossible. When two things occur successively we call them cause and effect if we believe one event made the other one happen. If we think one event is the response to the other, we call it a reaction. If we feel that the two incidents are not related, we call it a mere coincidence. If we think someone deserved what happened, we call it retribution or reward, depending on whether the event was negative or positive for the recipient. If we cannot find a reason for the two events' occurring simultaneously or in close proximity, we call it an accident. Therefore, how we explain coincidences depends on how we see the world. Is everything connected, so that events create resonances like ripples across a net? Or do things merely co-occur and we give meaning to these co-occurrences based on our belief system?

So we could say that coincidences are things happening, because we don't expected them. But should the absence of information justify a life controlled not by ourselves? Live after fate, one would say? Definitely a philosophy I can support. I am a man of my personal freedom to do EVERYTHING that I want. To believe that something does happen, because some sort of probabilistic, decided event is partly controlling my life, would never be acceptable for me. I\u2019m fully aware of the daily coincidences that happen to us, those we can't control, but if you look at your life, you should never hope that a coincidence will turn everything better. To conclude: No there is no coincidenceIf there was coincidence, we wouldn't be there, were we are no. We would be sheep controlled by randomness.You want to be sheep? I don't think so",
