            "answer_text": "Your phrasing is odd: what is there to \u201covercome\u201d? The Space-Time Continuum is primarily a phrase that comes from Star Trek and relates to the reality in which the Q reside. Space-Time, as a genuine science term, is simply what we now call space because of the work in quantum physics over the last century or so. With Albert Einstein\u2019s work along with Stephen Hawking and many other great minds, we have determined that space is not really an entity unto itself because the warping of space also affects our observations of time. This can be proved with Einstein\u2019s Theories of Relativity wherein manipulation of space is also able to produce a measurable manipulation of relative time. So, if you\u2019re asking, \u201cCan we, at some point, manipulate space and time towards a goal?\u201d then yes. Technically we already do this with airplane travel. When you take an international flight, your pilot is not flying a direct line between New York, New York and London, England. In order to maximize efficiency and reduce flight time, he will actually take a northward turn and make what looks more like an \u201carc\u201d towards the arctic circle before turning southward again to England. We do this because given the curvature of the Earth and the high speed at which the plane flies, as well as the inherent \u201cfighting with the rotation of Earth\u201d there is a measurable \u201cshortening\u201d of the flight by actually taking this geographically longer path. It has been theorized also that if one was to fly a starship (this borders on science fiction now) very near to the Event Horizon of a Singularity (without actually crossing it) one would experience a time dilation so extreme that in mere seconds relative to the passengers aboard the starship, eons may pass for the rest of the universe and in this way, one could potentially \u201ctravel to the future\u201d but it would be a one-way trip. No one has ever reasonably determined that it\u2019s even possible to \u201creverse time\u201d. In fact, mathematically, it is flatly IMpossible. What may be interesting for you to research is known as the \u201cAlcubierre Warp Drive\u201d. It\u2019s a theoretical starship and engine design that could possibly allow for \u201cWarp Drive\u201d much like what Roddenberry envisioned in Star Trek. However, there are severe limitations to it, major hurdles to overcome, and there is a very hot debate as to whether or not the math and physics behind it are actually reasonable in the first place. However, we have observed that extremely powerful plasma with a polaric charge can produce high concentration electro-magnetism and that this can have the effect of \u201cWarping Space-Time\u201d. It\u2019s a very minor effect given what we can produce as of yet, but it does promise that Roddenberry may actually not have been so wrong. He GREATLY underestimated the power-cost of flying a starship this way and highly exaggerated the capabilities of such a system. But, the math does suggest that it\u2019s possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. However the last time I answered this question, in full detail of how, when you asked it, things didn\u2019t turn out well. Shortly after hitting the submit button, a follower of this question went about implementing the details on how to overcome the space-time continuum. It wasn\u2019t long before they had achieved their goal. Although no time is really long for me anymore. In fact it is neither short nor long, it just is, anyway I digress. This certain someone, I\u2019ll call Traveler X, had insidious plans for what to do with their new found power. Traveler X\u2019s first order of business was to eradicate all others who viewed my answer to your question so none could oppose their new found power. Those poor souls, not yet achieving power over the space-time continuum, were completely defenseless against Traveler X. They were dispatched of mercilessly. Next Traveler X set out to find me, the originator of the power over the space-time continuum. Needless to say I\u2019ve been here for a long time (or maybe it\u2019s been a short time, it is just so hard to tell anymore) and have notably more experience traversing the space-time continuum than Traveler X. So far I have been able to evade them, however I\u2019m not sure I can forever (even though I technically live in the forever now). As Traveler X\u2019s search for me continued, they began to then mold the space-time continuum to their desire. Warping all of history. In some cases even back to the Big Bang itself. The fate of human kind was in the balance. Not just its future, but the likelihood of ever even evolving. As Traveler X pushed their awful plan further and further with complete disregard even for themselves, my being began to fade. I would rapidly flash in and out of existence (however I don\u2019t think rapidly explains it as I may have existed eternally then never then eternally again). At that point the battle between Traveler X and myself begun. I realized what my detailed Quora answer had unleashed upon the universe and I became determined to stop it. I\u2019ve written this answer an infinite number of times and the alternate answer an equally infinite number of times. I am now trapped in a space-time paradox experiencing alternating eternities over and over. I can only hope that this time this answer sticks and my life, and yours, are safe and released from this infinite doom. But if this answer remains, then why would I\u2026 ",
