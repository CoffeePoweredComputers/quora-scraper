            "answer_text": "No, I\u2019m speaking from the vantage point that life equals existence and/therefor it\u2019s not something material, measurable, divisible or comparable, therefor it cannot be anything with objective qualities like a thing or an idea. This kind of reasoning derives from an obvious timeless experience and it cannot be understood by reasoning alone\u2026 like how do you explain the direct experience of understanding or existence for that matter? It\u2019s something obvious yet at the same time it\u2019s on the limit of reasoning, we\u2019re in existence, life, our minds are made of it, therefor they cannot ever jump out of it, see it and explain it (yet most of us behave as if we\u2019re superior to it and can analyse it\u2026 which is hilarious at the end).

            "answer_text": "I would say an idea, more than a thing. Where do you draw the line between what is alive and what isn't? It's a made up line that doesn't physically exist. All of what we call \u201clife\" comes from dust. Life grows out of non-life. So when we call it \u201clife\" we're just putting an imaginary line at a certain point in which we deem the thing to now be living. It's all one thing, we could say it's all alive. There is no real seperation between anything. All of what we call \u201cseperate\u201d or \u201cparts\" are just ideas because if you get with reality you'll realise that there is zero seperation anywhere, except in the mind. ",
