            "answer_text": "No; in fact, very little has a mathematical explanation. If you wake up and feel happy, then you would presumably not reach out for a pen and paper to mathematically work out why you were happy. In other words, maths is not very useful for explaining most things in our experience; nor is physics, chemistry or even biology for that matter. Shifting your focus away from your personal experience, mathematics becomes more useful. For instance, if we look at more than just ourselves, at a group of people, or if we look at our general behaviour, not just isolated experiences and actions, then patterns emerge that we can describe mathematically and statistically, sometimes even very simply - we are very often simple and predictable creatures. The explanations that maths gives us here are fuzzy though: uncertain averages and probabilities. Instead of looking at broader pictures, we could also look closer at things and, there, maths again begins to give useful explanations. Biology, chemistry, physics: as we look closer and closer at the small details of things, they begin to behave in very mathematically explainable ways. How useful those explanations might be is debatable though: they are good enough for us to use for creating the technology that we have today but it is still very clunky: our computer chips are literally stone age creations, silicon rock etched into tools. Mother Nature kicks our ass when it comes to tech. And when we look very closely at things, at quantum level, then uncertainty suddenly rears up again, and we can only describe a scattering of general patterns that we think that we have found and therefore call \u201cLaws\u201d but do not have any great predictive power; indeed, as far as we know, our putative reality is intrinsically unknowable, and certainly not mathematically deterministic. We can talk about probabilities but those do not generally provide any great sort of explanation. At a more philosophical level, we don\u2019t know whether our realities and experiences have anything to do with mathematics, or whether mathematics is just one mental framework through which we see the world. There is sometimes fierce debate about this question. Many science-loving people point out that maths has let us perform many magics via science and technology and that maths has not yet let us down through contradictions or erratic predictive powers; therefore, maths must be universally true, everywhere and everywhen - indeed the world might be built from maths itself. Others disagree and point out the logical error here: it is too excitedly optimistic to claim that all of existence is maths-related just because we seem to have had success in understanding a tiny speck of the world through maths. That said, maths is nevertheless surprisingly useful for describing the world, ourselves and even our everyday experiences. Most people would not imagine it but if you have a little interest or training in mathematical thinking, then you can suddenly see a lot of patterns and explanations in everything around you that can allow you to see clearer and further. Maths is definitely very useful for explaining many things, just not great for explaining most things. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but most things are mathematically interpretative. The reality as it is, is very complex and difficult for us humans to understand, hence, we make abstractions which resonate with reality and simplify it. This is the goal of mathematics. Statistics is mathematical knowledge. So, basically everything is statistical in the universe as we study it \u201cscientifically\u201d, even morality itself, we don\u2019t yet know how to mathematicalize it yet. Mathematics is the simplest yet the most reliable and effective tool for us to investigate and understand reality objectively (i.e. understandable for all). We don\u2019t know this cause of effective of mathematics but it just works most of the time. Eugene Wigner a famous mathematician termed it as the \u201cunreasonable effectiveness\u201d of mathematics. If, we try to \u201creason\u201d the effectiveness of mathematics, then that itself would be within mathematical premise, as logic ultimate lays it\u2019s back to mathematical/statistical interpretation. Hence, the question of the everything being mathematical stems from being \u201cwhy is math so effective\u201d to begin with. Cheers! ",
