            "answer_text": "I understand your apprehension as there are multiple authors in an anthology. But I have been a part of India\u2019s first horror anthology along with 11 other authors and believe me, I loved every bit of it. Not even once did I feel that the name or fame was diluted because of the other authors. In fact, more authors mean more reach and visibility for the book. Anthologies are becoming popular now because more and more people want their work published but do not have a full novel to publish. For publishers also, anthologies are a good deal. ",
