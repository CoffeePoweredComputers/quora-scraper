            "answer_text": "You know - this might hurt: Desire is not love - it is only desire. What happens when you have quenched your thirst - you have HAD the object of YOUR desire and then what? Throw that being to the garbage? Or do you need to HAVE that being, again? What is possession? You possess something. Can you take it along wherever you go - but when you pass away - is that object then still with you? Think well - desire is an emotion which asks and asks and asks - and when you have HAD it - then you might be not enlivened but feel empty. I have no idea - i am NOT in YOUR body - ONLY you are - but - if - then ask yourself: Will i die if i did not have that person?Will i survive if i did not have that person?Is it an obsession oris it a wish of possessionor - is it FREE WILL OF BOTH of us?BTW: THERE is your answer - FREE WILL - if that being you desire - is also in love with you and both of you are loving each other unconditionally - and with ALL OF YOUR HEART - then it is neither a possession - nor an obsession - but a free will choice in unconditional HEARTFELT Love. Just know - LOVE NEVER asks for anything - NEVER wants anything - NEVER will order - etc. - LOVE = only and simply DIVINE ENERGY - that is why - desire and/or any other emotion which demands for something in return - IS NOT AND NEVER LOVE energy.

The social stigma isn't worth you not enjoying yourself and once you do, you'll lose the need for it since you can do it whenever. If you need a person as in some other way, you\u2019re not an interesting person yourself, otherwise you wouldn't need no one. There's so much crazy shit to do, it's impossible to encompass everything in one life, go explore your dreams and chase them all, you will find it exhilarating 24/7 to the point where having a person would only annoy you. Go get everything you ever wanted, use your highest imagination, and just go get it. Go step by step. Start today. Everything is done right now, there is no tomorrow and the first step that you can think of, do it. ",

This connection allows me to see it is only my past state of being I create within myself that I desire. Not my faulty thought of believing that the state I desire is or has been realized in the past because of any person place or thing other then myself. This is the only thing one needs to have decided upon as the decision puts the full control of ones happiness within their own control intern opening them up to notice all those millions of opportunities that surround each of us every day just waiting for us to awaken consciously to them and take up as our own by manifesting them into our joyful reality.
