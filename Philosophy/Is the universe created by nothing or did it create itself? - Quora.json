            "answer_text": "The Universe was created by Heisenberg..:) more specifically it was created because it has Life\u2026 in a broad sense. The same could be said as The Universe was created because it is uncertain\u2026 There is inherent uncertainty in Quantum Systems and Space and Dimensionality are Quantum Systems that precede the Universe. So, you will have a simple answer to this question\u2026:) The Universe does not have hands and you will never see it creating itself, nor will you see someone drawing plans for the Universe and executing them. The answer is the same as this. Pick up a cubic centimeter of space, surround it with a box\u2026:) I would then ask you if that space is perfectly empty and flat or not. The details of the question are less relevant than the answer. The answer is that whatever is inside that box is space and it fluctuates. How do we know that space fluctuates? We don\u2019t. Pick up two points and measure the distance between them. If between the two points a fluctuation arises such that the left side stretches and the right side compresses, the distance will not change and thus you cannot tell what is going on. One of these fluctuations was the seed for this Universe. The difference is that its 4D radius was 147 light-seconds and the shape was hyperspherical. This means that the Surface had three dimensions\u2026:) Marco Pereira's post in Hypergeometrical Universe and here is how the Universe started moving at the speed of light: Marco Pereira's post in Hypergeometrical Universe ",

            "answer_text": "The question poses a false dilemma: there is a third option. The universe was created by God, the one and only Creator. Nothing comes from nothing. Only God is self-existing. According to Thomas Aquinas, God is Being itself. The name of God revealed to Moses was \u201cI Am\u201d or \u201cI Am Who I Am\u201d (Exodus 3:14). ",
