            "answer_text": "One: I\u2019m male, 6 foot, above average build, good looking, in my early 20\u2019s, I managed a 7\u201311 in Salt Lake City, UT. One of my regular customers a gorgeous early 20\u2019s sandy haired female, maybe 5 foot tall, very petite. I\u2019ll call her Sandy, we flirted, laughed a lot, she began stopping in 2\u20133 times a day, then 4\u20135 times a day. Sandy was a professional clown and made good money. She comes in one day, cracking me and the customers up, well with a toot of her breast (yes breast) she asked me out, of course I accepted. Sandy and I were a huge hit together, very close, inseparable, excellent love and sexual partners. Remember I commented Sandy is very petite, much of her clothing she purchased in the children\u2019\u2019s section of stores. I won\u2019t brag but I am well endowed, 8+ inches, more when super horny. The first times I entered Sandy it was very tight for her, somewhat painful, so we had to be very careful. The preferred position for her was ontop, she could control what was taken in. She would orgasm immediately and continue to experience orgasms, I think one time we counted 8 or 9. After a few times she was able to take the full size in, words cannot describe how much sexual and orgasmic pleasure I received from our sex. Have I mentioned Sandy is VERY vocal while having sex? Let me also describe one of our favorite sexual turn-on\u2019s, Sandy had a 2 seater MG with removable top. She would have me drive, Sandy enjoyed being without some or all her clothing, sometimes giving me a hj, bj or masturbate herself . Remember I said she was petite, she could face me and ride on top while I drove, yes I could maintain control until my orgasm time approached. OMG what a turn-on. I was in the Army National Guard, I was at my two week annual training in a very rural part of Wyoming. I get notified I had an emergency at home and my sister was here to take me home. Surprise it was Sandy and horny as usual, she planned this whole thing and booked us a motel in a resort town. Yes it was erotic and pleasurable, however I was very concerned how much risk she put me in with the Army Guard prank. If the military had required proof, I would have been screwed. Sandy and I were united at the waist (literally lol) and always together, we reached the stage where we were inseparable at our family\u2019s events. I cannot remember how many times per day we made out or had sex, wherever, whenever, we had become quite the voyeur and risky exhibition pair. At restaurants, driving, at work, quickies in bathrooms and stalls. In movie theaters it was so exciting and dangerous, you haven\u2019t lived on the wild side until you share an orgasm with our own audience. Sandy, wanted to get married, I was all for it at first, then she became obsessed with marriage, then the jealousy kicked in, she became rude, insulting and mean with some of my female friends, coworkers and strangers. It was embarrassing, I didn\u2019t like her possessive demeanor, I had many conversations with her, I communicated in every way I knew. I loved her, but she became worse, fanatical was a mild word to describe her, the beginning of the end was when she told our friends and family that she was pregnant. I broke it off, but it wasn\u2019t over, being the professional clown she showed up at work, my apartment door (many times naked). She wouldn\u2019t take NO for the answer, she became a violent stalker, even keyed my Firebird. She followed me on a date and violently attacked my date, where I pulled her away and told her I was calling the police. I moved, changed my phone number and always watched my back. Think \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d is scary, ha! Sandy married an old boyfriend in her last attempt to return to her. I miss and think of her often, however NEVER again. Two: Several years later, I was driving ride sharing with LYFT. One night I pickup this couple from a local club, she, I will call her Taylor was drunk on her ass, he was extremely verbal abusive and had her in total tears. The crying where she couldn\u2019t breathe properly, I stopped and ordered him out of the car, I told him I was getting her home safely. Problem, Taylor was so drunk she had no clue what her address was, her phone was dead, she couldn\u2019t remember any friendly phone numbers. I drove up to a convenience store and bought her coffee, Taylor remembered she lived by a blue building, she guided me, soon she had me pull over on a dark street so she could pee. Getting back in the car she turned off my car, took my keys and place them under her skirt. Let me describe Taylor, tall, stunning (even with makeup that had ran from the crying), she was a reddish blonde, hair to the middle of her back. Taylor started talking sex, sexual positions, freedom of sex with whom she desired, while she was leaning towards me, one hand on my inner thigh, we were so close our noses touched, her lips very lightly touching mine, fixed eye contact. She moved her hand on my hard-on while taking my door side hand and placing it on her breast, no bra, 38\u2019s maybe, not firm and not too soft, wow hard nipples. We were heavily engaging our tongues, swirling, lightly biting and sucking one another\u2019s. She has my member out of my jeans, my hand exploring and sensually massaging one breast then the other. I have a SUV at her suggestion we drop the rear seats, strip and lay down. I commented what a sexy and gorgeous body she had, I\u2019ll call a 9.5 out of 10. She complimented on my physique, size and firmness of my hard-on. We are heavily engaged exploring, kissing, exploring with tongues and kisses, some masturbation and erotic massaging. I\u2019ve had sex with many a woman, when it comes to wetness, Taylor was probably #1. She was ontop gliding her wetness up and down on big me occasionally rising up to let me kiss and taste her, in exchange she turned and we serviced each other. When we engaged in sexual contact, she felt warm, soft, snug and had muscles like hands, whew I felt at times I would shout or pass out. Her movements coordinated in perfect sync with my thrusts, I think we were both in awe when we reached orgasm, the shivers, jerking and the length of our orgasm. I\u2019m not sure if I ever experienced one that lasted that long? We lay nest to each other, heavy breathing, huge smiles, kissing, she had sobered up a lot. We explored some more, exchange oral, before long she had had mister BIG back for round two. Whew as good as the first, this time a little (actually a lot) doggy. I think she wanted anal from her movements, I have never experienced that and did not engage. I m quite sure from her reactions she enjoyed all the sexual positions. I think Taylor played me, it turns out her apartment was a couple of blocks away. I have forgiven her many more times since that night, our favorite is to park in that same spot, oh yeah searching her everywhere with my hands I did locate my keys. to be continued\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an experience I will never forget. My friends and I decided that we would go on a mini holiday for three days to a sea based town. It was roughly a six hour bus ride down there from where I was currently staying. However we had to get another bus to get to the station for where it would it depart which would take about an hour. We booked a hotel and had to catch a bus at around 6:30 am, meaning we had to wake up around 5:00 am. The night before my friend and I had some grilled chicken that wasn\u2019t so fresh but was edible. I woke up in the morning getting ready to leave my stomach felt a little strange but I thought nothing of it and proceed to get ready to catch this bus that would take us to to other bus we had to catch. we were already running late and didn\u2019t want to miss the bus we needed to take. At this point my stomach was feeling really bad like I need to use the bathroom for a number two. But I didn\u2019t have time because my friends and I were rushing and we had no time for bathroom breaks. So we finally get onto this bus and we\u2019re about 15 minutes into the journey. My stomach is cramping like crazy and I really needed the bathroom and I was clenching my butt cheeks like there was no tomorrow for if even a second i stopped clenching I would worry I\u2019d let the gates of hell out of my arse. So I turned to my friend and said, \u2018 bro I need to go to the toilet now! Otherwise I\u2019m going to shit myself\u2019 he laughed and looked at me and said, \u2018 seriously\u2019 I said \u2018yes seriously. I asked him if he could ask the bus driver to stop at the nearest petrol station so I could use the bathroom. I couldn\u2019t do it myself because I feared I would crap myself if I even stood up for a minute. So my friend went up I could see him having a conversation with the driver and he promptly came back and said, \u2018 the guy agreed to stop at the next available petrol station\u2019. I was relieved. Sure enough about 10 minutes later we came to a stop and I couldn\u2019t get out of that bus fast enough I charge into the shop and practically yell at the cashier, \u2018where\u2019s the bathroom?\u2019 He points me in the right direction and I\u2019m met with three different bathrooms, women, men and disabled. I decide to use the disabled because it would be more comfortable and roomy. So I run in there and the pure relief I felt and letting all my insides just fall out of me. At this point my friend is calling my phone like crazy telling me the driver is getting pissed off because I\u2019m taking so long even though it had only been five minutes. So as I\u2019m done I look for toilet paper and the nightmare continues there is no toilet paper. Now you can imagine after a monumentous shit the toilet paper is essential. I didn\u2019t know what to do. So I slightly opened the door to the toilet to see if anyone was there because I was gonna run into the male toilets. No one was and I promptly left, with my trousers barely covering my bare arse. At this point a women comes out of nowhere and I\u2019m like \u2018oh shit\u2019 I quickly bolt into the male toilets scaring her half to death, clean myself up and run back to the coach half pulling up my trousers. As I get back onto the bus all the travellers are laughing and I\u2019m sure everyone here can guess why. Anyway I get back to my seat and we start moving again. My friends are all making fun of me at this point, laughing and making jokes. I just brush it off and try to listen to music. About an hour into the journey my friend, who is sitting next to me, taps me on the shoulder and says, \u2018I need to go\u2019 I was like karma is a bitch isn\u2019t it. He tells me he needs to go now otherwise he will shit himself as well. ( he was also the friend who ate the dodgy food with me last night) He goes up to the bus driver asks him to make a stop. He comes back and says, \u2018the bus driver won\u2019t stop until we get to the next allotted break\u2019. I asked \u2018 how long until the break?\u2019 He replied \u2018 one hour\u2019. My friend at this point is in hysterics he\u2019s bouncing up and down on his seat desperately trying to not crap himself, he keeps getting up and pleading with the driver, the driver keeps telling him only 15 more minutes. At this point my stomach is feeling weird again but nothing to the extreme it was before. My friend is up there next to the driver and this woman is telling him to breathe in and out and try to relax . Now this might be good advice but in a situation where you are about to shit yourself this is the worst possible advice ever. We finally come to a stop and my friend and I bolt out the bus and find the toilet. We are in adjacent cubicles. He texts me saying \u2018 bro I shit myself on the bus after that women told me to breath in and out\u2019 I have never laughed harder in my life, he continued to say he\u2019s going to leave his boxers there and go commando. We finish up in the bathroom and continue to our destination relatively okay. This is an experience I will never forget due to the absolute ridicoulesness of the situation. It was a really shitty situation. (Pardon the pun). ",
