            "answer_text": "First, start with a clear understanding of what the two words subjective and objective mean. A dictionary will give you definitions like these: subjective, adjective based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions. synonyms: personal, individual, emotional, instinctive, intuitiveobjective, adjective (of a person or their judgment) not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts. synonyms: impartial, unbiased, unprejudiced, nonpartisan, disinterested, neutral, uninvolved, even-handed, equitable, fair, fair-minded, just, open-minded, dispassionate, detached, neutralSo, a belief is subjective if is primarily based on your feelings or intuition, such that you cannot easily communicate to someone else why they should have they same belief when they don\u2019t have access to your feelings and intuition. To succeed in this, you must be able imagine what others think about the particular issue given what they know about the world. If you can make an argument based on their knowledge and experiences, you\u2019re most of the way to turning your subjective feelings into an objective belief. For full objectivity, you need to be able to generalize to the knowledge and experiences/experiments that everyone can have access to, and will support the belief. By everyone, I mean you must consider people whose subjective beliefs oppose your subjective beliefs. How would you convince them that their subjective beliefs are invalid given objective evidence that everyone has access to? But this means you should be prepared for the possibility that in constructing this argument, that you may discover flaws in your feelings and intuitions. This is the essence of critical thinking: Being able to consider in your own mind many possible arguments and how well they can be supported by objective evidence, with the goal of coming as close as possible to the truth, whether or not that truth will fit comfortably with your current feelings and intuitions.

            "answer_text": "Sure you can turn subjective opinions into objective arguments. It is simple: by providing evidence. Specifically external evidence, that is evidence from outside the specific issue. That is what reason is, that is what we mean by being rational. This was not always so, before the European Enlightenment (1600s) faith alone could sway debate. But now, except for American politics, we have reason. That is why Trump and America cannot flourish in the long-term, faith alone (and that of course means ideological bullshit) cannot progress modernity without objective reason. You now hold the key to life that Billionaires like Trump, and stupidity like the Republican Party cannot understand. Good luck with it. ",
