            "answer_text": "Not at all. It depends on how good of a job we do with the mitigation policies, compliance and enforcement. With strong restrictions on travel, keeping schools closed, staying home and social distancing over at least a month but preferably two, combined with protective gear and distancing for essential workers we can greatly decrease the number of people exposed to the coronavirus. The virus can't travel on it's own or live without hosts. If everyone stays home we can starve the virus and many people will never be exposed. In fact the mitigation effort is already beginning to show results in the US. The virus is still increasing, but not quite as fast. But we need to continue the restrictions for at least another month and resist the pressure (in the US) to \u201cre-open\" things prematurely. In my state and many others we just started the official \u201clockdown\" about 2 weeks ago and some states even later. The virus has an incubation time of at least 2 weeks and then several more weeks if people get sick, and we still have some exposure to each other from essential work and activities. And unfortunately people are still traveling and spreading it that way. Comprehensive testing and tracking with targeted quarantine can also decrease the number of people exposed, and eliminate the need to restrict entire populations. ",

            "answer_text": "Flattening the curve means that THIS season of CV will pass without complete devastation. What\u2019s not clear is what happens next. If the virus follows the typical path for coronaviruses, we\u2019ll get a break over the summer with minimal infections while the medical community catches their breath and companies ramp up production of PPE and testing supplies. Then in October or November it\u2019ll come crashing back. IF we\u2019re ready we\u2019ll quarantine those affected, test everyone and prevent a widespread infection. Then we\u2019ll just \u201chold on\u201d until the vaccine or an effective treatment becomes available in early 2021. If the virus remains common and virulent during the summer, then it\u2019ll be social distance until we can get it down to low levels, then testing and PPE and pockets of severe disease until 2021. It\u2019s possible it\u2019ll fade on its own, but I wouldn\u2019t bank on that. If the vaccine works then everyone won\u2019t have to be exposed, in fact it\u2019ll be a bit like small pox, it might be possible to completely stamp it out (might have to immunize our pets, too, since it apparently can infect dogs and big cats).

            "answer_text": "Yes, pretty much. The idea behind \u201cflattening the curve\u201d is trying to prevent the medical system being overwhelmed due to being swamped by more cases than it can handle. By feeding them through at a more ordered rate (a) fewer people will die of Covid-19, and (b) fewer people will die of other things (because our hospitals are not overwhelmed). But it is not a cure and it is not a vaccine. It is basically a play for time. Time to get a vaccine. Time to maybe get a cure. And time to build up at least some segment of the population with a degree immunity. Someone I respect greatly once said to me: sometimes the only viable short term plan is to just try and stay standing long enough that the medium term matters. ",

Yes, we would starve if not for the kindness of friends bringing home shopping, and very kind they have been risking their own lives for ours. We are not proud of our actions.

It certainly seems that unless you live in isolation and never come into contact with someone that is shedding virus particles, that infection is pretty unavoidable. When a large percentage of the population has become infected, there is a phenomenon called herd immunity and no more infections occur. It is doubtful that everyone will become infected. Even if large numbers are infected, most are likely to experience mild disease with little or no symptoms. We worry about the severe infections, overwhelming the health care system and death. There is still much unknown about this virus and the behavior. Certainly, we can limit exposure with aggressive testing and protecting the most vulnerable segments of the population. If someone is immune, they can return to work and move our country back to a new \u201cnormal\u201d. ",
