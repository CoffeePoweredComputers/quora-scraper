            "answer_text": "The LDS church. Now, I grew up Mormon but left years and years ago so I get to say this shit haha. Did you know Ted Bundy joined the Mormon church when he moved to Utah so he\u2019d blend in better? Did you know his ward picketed and \u201cswore he\u2019d never do that\u201d once his accusations came about? That\u2019s how they are. Tons and tons of corruption and sexual abuse is retaliated with only \u201cNo, they would never do that!\u201d Mormons will fight you to the death on that. You could have even shoved a picture of Ted Bundy dragging a dead body in their face and they\u2019d still swear he was innocent. That\u2019s how religions work (especially this cult). These sheeple are so blindly ignorant, they\u2019ll listen to anything and everything this \u201cprophet\u201d says. You have no idea how many people (especially women) I know who have been sexually assaulted by someone in the church. Not only do these people take advantage of becoming the boy scout\u2019s leader (being alone with a bunch of 12 year olds), but they don\u2019t get in trouble. Someone rapes a 5 year old girl, but doesn\u2019t get excommunicated (or incarcerated) because he\u2019s \u201cimportant to the church\u201d and has these blind ignoramuses to fight for him. But someone questions the church and writes about it, instant excommunication\u2026. See a pattern, here? ",

            "answer_text": "Having expectations and negative attachments in some basic things Seeing divisions is another big one .If you see another person or creature and you feel you are superior than him her it, that you are very different and you create a wall then thats ignorance. Illuminated people see that we are all One and nothing really separates us. Apply this in our world where we are all separated in classes , genders, races, colours , religions , sport teams, nations , countries etc and you will see how evil comes from ignorance. Without such divisions there would be no wars , no fights , no hate, no anger , no feeling of superiority or inferiority , no sexism . ",
