            "answer_text": "The only way of knowing that something is an illusion is to have something that you know is real to compare it against. So if you found out that \u201creality was an illusion\u201d you wouldn\u2019t have the option of deciding that you wanted to find out the reality behind this reality, because you already would have. What you wouldn\u2019t have is the certainty that \u201cthe reality behind this reality\u201d was real and not an \u201cillusion\u201d. This is why all questions about reality being an illusion, including all questions about simulations, are fundamentally meaningless. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read we live primarily in Beta reality which is a poor reality in comparison with Theta reality and if we could shift over to this one as our main one than we would be able to commune with E.T.s. more or less directly. So far then I say our reality is not an illusion but a poor representation of our true selves and of Reality with a capital R! I personally think that given that this is the truth I do not know how to change this to better suit myself and for all of Terran Humanity. It is also blatantly clear to me\u2014I might even say aggravatingly clear\u2014that Terran Humans have more than 5 senses and that in any case our senses are filtered by our minds and if our minds are immersed into beta reality than there is so much other reality that we are going to be unaware of which means that largely OUR Beta reality is an illusion in the final analysis! So in conclusion our collective as well as individual purpose should be to expand our consciousness so that we all live more complete and true lives! I once was a pupil of the now long extinct STUDY CENTER OF COSMIC FRATERNITY which was a study of the different dimensions of the Cosmos as well as E.T.s and where we fit into the ladder of life in the Cosmos! The center was in Sicily but I visited the founder there only briefly but continued to be amidst one of its disciples for a time in Geneva, Switzerland for a time in the 1970s. ",
