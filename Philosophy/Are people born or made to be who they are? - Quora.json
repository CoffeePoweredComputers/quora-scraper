            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an interesting question, \u201care people born, or made to be who they are?\u201d As far as genetics they are born with a certain blueprint, only some of which is malleable unless science can definitively tell us otherwise. As far as their environment, it can have a significant influence on their overall development and may be a largely determinant factor in how far they go in life. As far as themselves. That is up to them. That is up to how much they want to hold on to this collective experience. That is up to how they choose to define themselves EVERY DAY. People can change themselves and their outlook in profound ways. It\u2019s not necessarily easy to do, but it is entirely possible thanks to the plasticity of the human brain. We are capable of so much. We just need to WANT whatever we want and reinforce the drive and the patience needed to achieve whatever goals we might have. ",

            "answer_text": "Every person has a story behind them. When you\u2019re a baby, you don\u2019t know anything. In fact, you\u2019re learning, and as you grow up you start to learn about the people you live with, your house, your room, the kinds of food you\u2019re into and not into. You start to learn social cues and etiquette from other people surrounding you. When you\u2019re a kid, it's crucial that you become socialized, talk to people, engage in conversation, ask questions and get the answers you need to live life. What you learn is what you show. If you put your socks on left to right, the way you eat, the language and how you talk, how you dress and carry yourself. It\u2019s all learned behavior through trial and error. It\u2019s the best way we can learn. We are born blank, then we are taught things by adults who\u2019ve been here longer than us, then we are shown the world and asked what are we going to do next. What you choose is predetermined from how you learned as a kid. ",

It is easy to tell that someone was born talented or smart or intelligent but you don\u2019t know what a person go through to build oneself. You might be born in a poor community but you could reach some place else if you gave the right courage and energy getting put into the right direction. ",

People are also greatly shaped by their environments, experiences, and the things in life which draw their attention over other things due to that collection of nature and nurture factors. It would be silly to say that people are anything but both. But we are what we decide to do with our collective genes and experiences. ",
