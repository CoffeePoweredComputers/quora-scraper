            "answer_text": "There are many arguments against encouraging people to study the humanities, and these mainly centre on three things: power, populism and conservatism. If you want people to accept the status quo unquestioningly, if you want them to accept propaganda and \u2018alternative facts\u2019 without question and generally be obedient servants of those in power, then it is important to steer people away from studying the humanities. You see, the problem with the humanities is that it encourages people to question assumptions, to analyse arguments, and not just accept assertions blindly and without question. There are those who want to say that studying the humanities does not lead to well-paying jobs. That may have been the case in the past, though I question that assertion too. Sure, engineers and other scientists are able to command good salaries outside of academe, but even tech companies these days are hiring more humanities graduates because they recognise the need to develop interfaces based on human beings actual use rather than what is technically achievable. I know of humanities graduates working for Apple and other tech firms, and they make just as good money as their technical counterparts. Also, higher education has long been failing those who want to train for a technical occupation. These days, most people are training for jobs that won\u2019t exist in 10\u201315 years time, and will be expected to operate within jobs that haven\u2019t been invented yet. It turns out that if you train people to think and to solve problems creatively, you can easily teach them on the job for the agile new thing that has just been developed. If you don\u2019t want an agile, adaptable, problem-solving and innovative workforce then steer people well clear of the humanities. Oh, and humanities graduates might just question authority based on \u2018this is how we\u2019ve always done it\u2019. Oh and yes, I have done quite well out of the humanities (but don\u2019t tell anyone!). ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no longer active in academia, but I expect the primary question I used to get is still being asked: \u201cWhat can you do with it?\u201d The underlying question, of course, is \u201cHow much money can you make with a degree in humanities?\u201d The argument opposing such study, then, is that it\u2019s neither practical nor profitable. Guilty on both counts\u2014the ability rationally to think through thorny problems as practical,unless you count the accumulation of knowledge and profit and I take a very simplistic view of the study of humanities. It is the study of ourselves, of the things that make us human: how we think and reason, how and why we create art, music and literature, which are all essentially without practical use; why we hold religious beliefs, why we seek adventure, why we challenge frontiers, why we aim for perfection, why we ask \u201cWhat if?\u201d There are those who believe that the purpose of education is to acquire skills that will make us marketable. Others preach that we need to focus on STEM education to enhance our national education standing. These may be worthy goals, but in point of fact the only quantifiable increase American higher education has achieved in the last 20 years is in the huge number of graduates beggared by student loan debt. Such an outcome may be profitable, but certainly not to those saddled with the debt. In \u201cAn Essay on Man,\u201d Alexander Pope wrote, \u201cKnow then thyself, presume not God to scan; The proper study of mankind is man.\u201d We learn to know ourselves through the humanities. If we don\u2019t know ourselves and fail to understand our own qualities and limitations and place in the universe, how can we begin to understand anything else? ",
