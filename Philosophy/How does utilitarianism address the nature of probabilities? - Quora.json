            "answer_text": "I don't know what you mean by \u201cthe nature of\u201d probabilities. E.g. if you're referring to debates about whether there are objective or only subjective probabilities, I don't think utilitarianism addresses or should address that debate. Anyway, probabilities appear in the calculation of expected utility. The expected utility of a decision is the probability-weighted average utility of its possible outcomes. In a world of risk, rational utilitarians maximize expected probability. ",
