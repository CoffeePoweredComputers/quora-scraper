            "answer_text": "Wikipedia is the best. The Online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is more detailed, but way too verbose and influenced by individual guest writers as it is not open source. Wikipedia is a surprisingly sound source for philosophy. Start out by reading an article and making a list of every term or philosopher with which you\u2019re unfamiliar (unable to speak on the matter for more than one-minute). Repeat the process for each of the pages on your list. Do this for months, and soon, you will no longer be a beginner. Be sure to begin reading the primary texts themselves at some point. ",
