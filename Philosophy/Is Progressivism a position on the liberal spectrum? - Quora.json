            "answer_text": "Generally its is viewed as liberal. However, a Conservative or a Republican can be progressive as well. Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican but was also progressive and started Progressivism on a national scale; Ike was Republican and also progressive with several liberal initiatives; JFK was a progressive democrat but was also conservative with his tax cuts and expanded military ( both conservative policies). Terms are loosely used, and many times used inaccurately and ignorantly. The reality is that a Democrat and a Republican can be progressive without denying their general political leaning toward liberal or conservative\u2014which ever the case may be. Progressive is a negative connotation by many conservatives and analogous to liberal in their view. Progressivism was actually started by the Republican Party. It does not have to be a negative connotation. The problem with progressivism is that it is a slippery slope that leads to Big Govt. and socialism. Balance is key as history so clearly teaches. People do not learn from their history and dogmatic ideology clouds objectivism. It is all or nothing for many people in our society; hence, the great dichotomy of liberal vs conservative battlefield we find ourselves in 2019. Of course, the PC Nazis brought much of this about too. It is a real mess and the end result will be very interesting. The swamp has become a raging tempest tossed sea; better get a really big boat!

            "answer_text": "Progressivism , The 1st progressives were republicans . Progressive Party (United States, 1912) - Wikipedia Theodore Roosevelt Theodore Roosevelt - Wikipedia Progressivism was more of a reform policy. Anti-Monopoly laws . Limiting the power of corporations. Government oversight on natural resources and conservation. Also Human rights . Women's Suffrage and Women's Issues. - Which scares the hell out of Wall Street NeoLiberal Democrats and Conservative Republicans. . What will elected officials do when they run out of their milk money from insider Trading? Progressive policies would decrease the corruption in DC, But Nobody wants that??????????????? The Meaning and the way it's being used today is absolutely wrong. Progressivism has nothing to do with socialism. The Only True Progressive in the Democratic race is Elizabeth Warren. Sanders is confusing the meaning as so many others.Sanders using Progressive policies to completely change the economics of the USA to socialist. Warren is NOT a socialist. She is for laissez-faire capitalism. Which also scars the party Elites. Most Elites in The Democratic party are NeoLiberal Crony capitalist. Crony Capitalism keeps the 1 percent and wall street in the back pockets of politicians. Republicans do the same Thing . Elizabeth Warren would enforce Antitrust laws. Breaking up Tech Giants and the Corporate Media. Also more investigations in to Insider trading . ",
