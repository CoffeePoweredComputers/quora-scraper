            "answer_text": "Is this a change THEY want, or your own insecurity? If the suggested change is a demand or even a strong suggesting, probably not. But ask yourself this: is the quality that the person of interest doesn't like in me something I also don't like in myself? If that is the case they may care about you very much and they're unhappy with you because you're unhappy with yourself. That being said that sort of unselfishness on the part of others is fairly rare. We generally want people to change, especially early on in a relationship,based on our own needs and expectations. But if the answer to the question is yes the things they don't like about me are indeed things I would like to change. Then your answer is yes-- sort of. you should consider making those changes but make them for yourself. This person may be a great mirror to reflect back to you things that you would like to change about yourself. Use that as a tool. That being said if they do not accept you or like you the way you are at present I would make the changes, but only and I can't stress this enough only if it's something you would want to do to make yourself a better person. It sounds like you are a bit insecure or at the very least a people-pleaser. I won't say it's unhealthy, but it is difficult to become an independent self-actualized person who people find attractive and want to be in a relationship with when you're constantly tap dancing, by that I mean always changing your steps to see if they like your new dance. I sincerely hope you take this advice and the much shorter answer I read which just simply read: yes you should change if the person you're changing for is YOU! ",

            "answer_text": "Noooo\u2026 You should always remain yourself : Because you want your partner to love you for who you really are, and not for a fake version of yourself.Because if you want your partner to love you, first you have to love yourself, and that comes from being who you truly are.Because changing your appearance is the first step towards changing your whole personality, your tastes etc. and you\u2019ll end up denying who you truly are, you won\u2019t love yourself, and you\u2019ll resent your partner for that.Because true love comes from authenticity. And changing for the likes of someone else is a bit like manipulating them.Because if you do this, you show them you don\u2019t have confidence in who you truly are\u2026 And \u201cthere is nothing sexier than confidence\u201d ! Plus, that shows that you are easily influenced by other people\u2019s opinion.Because real love is not (only) about appearances !",
