            "answer_text": "There are others, but the main advantage of a homogeneous culture that I can think of is this: Simply, people trust one another implicitly and easily due to a basic day-to-day understanding of each other\u2019s humanity. When a group has all grown up with the same media, and in roughly the same conditions, and with roughly the same manners and understanding of the way the culture\u2019s systems work, it is easy for them to empathize with each other. People tend to be kinder to those whom they understand well, and in a homogeneous culture, you understand most people pretty well. When a slight is committed, others tend to be more charitable to the perpetrator. In these cultures, there is a general belief that people are largely \u201cgood\u201d with only a few \u201cbad apples\u201d to blame for most of society\u2019s problems. The disadvantage to this is that since most people are brought up similarly, they think similarly. There is little room for innovation or free thought, and in some cases those who don\u2019t toe the line will find themselves ostracized. This leads to a general stagnation of the society and possibly an amplification of humanity\u2019s natural xenophobia and racism. These conclusions are all drawn from my experiences here in Japan, and may not translate to other homogeneous cultures. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if there were multiple examples of the exact opposite of this. That\u2019s the problem with this sort of question - it requires generalization beyond the point of usefulness. It\u2019s a bit like asking \u201cWhat does soup taste like?\u201d There is no one answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Advantages Easier and likely better quality communication (although arguably difference forces one to examine one\u2019s own culture more carefully , and may actually enhance how well you communicate its values ).More global cooperation due to shared understanding of the world, shared goals, shared methodologies of achieving these. Arguably global cooperation requires a degree of similarity, values are shared in similar cultures.Larger market for content (music, television etc) which is appealing to common interests and fads. Economies of scale achieved. More choice for consumers.More predictability of other\u2019s actions.Disadvantages Less diversity of ideas. Different cultures are powerful experiments in seeing how else a society could work and provide examples to challenge existing norms and status quo. They provide inspiration for changes within any given culture.Less ability to escape one\u2019s own culture if you don't like it.Blandness in uniformity. Most of us are fascinated to understand how a totally different system works.There may be some aspect of \u201cspecialisation\u201d that comes out of having different cultures. So there could be a net economic loss from this factor (in isolation)",
