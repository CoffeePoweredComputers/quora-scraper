            "answer_text": "In this context, consciousness is normally used to refer to the overall cognitive functions of the brain. Sensory input, emotional input, analysis and correlation, imagination and creativity, etc, etc. Intelligence is less rigidly defined and would refer to the ability to perform the higher \u201cexecutive\u201d functions of the brain. The ability to correlate and analyze and draw conclusions and so forth. Additionally, there is the idea of \u201cmultiple\u201d intelligences\u2026 That we can sub-categorize skills or abilities along a number of lines like mathematical, spatial-temporal, interpersonal, intrapersonal\u2026. Etc. Empathy is merely a quality the normally functioning brain and is a normal component of human nature. The ability to experience a similar emotional reaction to the emotional reactions of others. This varies greatly; some people have very strong reactions\u2026 Some almost none. (psychopaths) ",
