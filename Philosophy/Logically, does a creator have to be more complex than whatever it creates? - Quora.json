            "answer_text": "The act of creation requires intent followed by a consequent act to manifest that intent. To create something requires imagining something that doesn't exist and then actively bringing about its existence. As far as we know humans and to very limited degree some animals are the only beings capable of forming the intent to create something. Whether we are able to create something more complex than ourselves remains to be seen. Taken as a whole civilization may be more complex than humanity without civilization but I don't know what metrics could be used to determine this nor whether such a determination would be useful or meaningful. This question appears to be an attempt to counter the argument that if God created the universe then what created God and the absurdity of the infinite regress that results from this premise. But all this chatter about God creating the universe is just us looking at the cosmos and seeing our own reflection. There is no reason to infer creation in the case of anything that has occurred naturally. It just adds unnecessary complications and barriers to understanding. Edit: since I didn't copy the original question I have no idea what happened here but my answer as it stands is not an answer to this question. Oh well. So it goes. ",

            "answer_text": "My short answer is no, it doesn't have to be! Now the longer version: Complex is a vague word by itself. Complex in what sense? A measure needs to be defined to say a certain feature of a creature is more complex than it's creator or not. There are many measures out there that humans have already created tools that is more powerful and complex than themselves. Such as: 1) Muscle power and ability to lift heavy weights: try to fist fight a compressing machine! 2) Arithmetic  operations speed: try to outdo supercomputers! 3) complex games such as chess and Go: None of the designers of the algorithm where  master Go or Chess player even though their creature beat the human champion. There are still aspects that we have not been able to make creatures that would out-complex us. We have no machine that won pulitzer, fields or nobel award.  So, definitely less complex creatures can make more complex creatures. There are many examples of it made by us humans. ",
