            "answer_text": "We really do not perceive the passage of time for time is merely a concept that is dependent on thought and memory. What we do perceive is a flow of events in the HERE and NOW. It is always NOW. You can never ever BE in the last moment or the next. Man made clocks measure movements and not time per se. Time is intuited to be \u201cwhat is\u201d between 2 events in memory. Since it is impossible to BE in the last moment it is impossible to measure \u201cwhat is\u201d between the last moment, a phantom, and NOW a reality. A person who is cross eyed would see 2 moons in the sky and if he were to ask you as to \u201chow do I measure the distance between the 2 moons?\u201d, what would you say to him? The spin of the earth gives us the illusion of days and nights alternating and thereby reinforcing the idea of chronological time. If the earth did not spin our idea of time would be unimaginable. Aging of the human body is again an ingenious idea created by Mother Nature which also reinforces the idea of chronological time. Science today knows that all the cells are constantly being replaced by new ones manufactured from the food that we eat. What then is aging? The body really does not \u201cknow\u201d any aging, for the cells are always new or fairly new! Aging is an idea! The growth of the body from the fetus to adulthood is again another ingenious idea created by Mother Nature that also reinforce the idea of chronological time. Evolution is another idea that also reinforces in us the idea of chronological time. Hypothetically if there is no growth, aging or evolution and no days and nights, then would anyone perceive time? Having said all that, it is still impossible to take away time and space from the human mind! It is great mystery! ",

            "answer_text": "What we are doing is interpreting entropy, which *is* real. If you ask someone why they believe in time, everything they cite is actually entropy, not time. Many physicists will actually admit they can\u2019t tell you what time is but simply that entropy is a manifestation of time, but only in one direction, and why the universe is like that is unknown. However, we do know that the interpretation of time passing can be altered, by velocity (and of course it\u2019s slowing down by the warping of spacetime which we call gravity). If someone looks at you hanging around the event horizon of a black hole they think you\u2019re frozen in time. But that isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s an illusion about time based on their perception being different to yours. From your perspective, a second still lasts exactly a second and your personal time ticks at the same rate for you as it always has. Your entropy continues and you will grow old at the same rate, but the perception of that rate is different to other observers. You can\u2019t actually freeze your own \u2018time\u2019, you can only change your velocity relative to everything else in the universe - you can change the perception of others by altering your velocity (suddenly you realise in this picture there is no \u2018time\u2019 at all, there is just movement through space). So the question isn\u2019t really about time, it\u2019s about why is there entropy at all? Well, without it life couldn\u2019t exist at all so we couldn\u2019t even ask the question. The factors driving entropy may have a more profound explanation bound up in a unified theory. ",
