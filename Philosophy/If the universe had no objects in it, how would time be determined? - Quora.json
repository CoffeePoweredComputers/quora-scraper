            "answer_text": "I understand and don\u2019t discount the notion that time is subjective - perceived by humans and probably other sentient species. But, this isn\u2019t something to be certain about at t his point, I believe. There are some objective examples of the passage of time. It is true that most of these involve matter. Most of what we think of as \u201cevents\u201d involve matter. Some, however, area a function of energy. It is conceivable that there is a universe configured in such a way that energy is present whereas matter as we know it is not. It is conceivable that scalar fields (just one example) might interact with some aspect of duration (repetition, cyclicality, periodicity, etc.) and that that could be a measure of time. I would, then, also discount the notion that a universe without matter is no universe. There are in fact many conceivable combinations of phenomena that could govern the \u201cspace\u201d comprising alternative universes in ways that are very different than our own, even if they do not support (life as we know it).

I call them cosmic time and atomic time. Cosmic time is measured by the motion of celestial bodies. The rotation of the earth on it's axis. It's orbit around the sun. Etc. Atomic time is determined by the rate of atomic decay. This second type is variable. It's affected by gravity and velocity. As you can tell though, without objects there would be no time. ",

Theorists in Physic like to write about immutable time, but if nothing is changing, there are no durations. The simplest equation: Delta X divided by by Delta time- the terms are for acceleration Same problem with Black Holes. At center of the BH, Time=0. Singularity. At least, that is the popular material. ",

It generates sound waves but there is no receiver there to register them, so no\u2026.and yes. In space, time as we measure it on Earth passes at a defined rate.
