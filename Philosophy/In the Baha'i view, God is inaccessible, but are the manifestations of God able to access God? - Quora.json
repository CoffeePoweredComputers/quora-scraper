            "answer_text": "They have more direct access to the Message of God, but even the Manifestations of God attest to Their nothingness relative to God and dependence on God. They are intermediaries, like a Mirror or Lens the filters the Message of God to humanity. My understanding is that even the Manifestations are limited by God. They are not like us in that each Manifestation has the capacity to receive directly and infallibly guidance from God and sublimated His Will to God to such an extent that sometimes He spoke with God\u2019s voice directly as though God and were as though united with God. But whether that Revelation was direct or still though intermediaries in the Spiritual Realm I cannot say with certainty. [The angel Gabriel conversed with Muhammad in Islamic belief.] [Jesus reportedly spoke of the \u201cmany things\u201d He could tell people but they were not ready to hear them and that even He, Jesus, did not know the hour of His Return. ] Baha\u2019u\u2019llah explains at times that He is also human. This is explained in part in Baha\u2019u\u2019llah and the New Era: \u201cI was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade Me lift up My voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow. The learning current amongst men I studied not; their schools I entered not. Ask of the city wherein I dwelt, that thou mayest be well assured that I am not of them who speak falsely.\u201d quoted in Baha\u2019u\u2019llah and the New Era pp. 25\u201326 Like the Manifestations of God gone before Him, He is both the Voice of God and its human channel: \u201cWhen I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that bindeth me to Thee, I am moved to proclaim to all created things \u2018verily I am God!\u2019; and when I consider my own self, lo, I find it coarser than clay!\u201d 5 \u201cCertain ones among you,\u201d He declared, \u201chave said: \u2018He it is Who hath laid claim to be God.\u2019 By God! This is a gross calumny. I am but a servant of God Who hath believed in Him and in His signs\u2026 My tongue, and My heart, and My inner and My outer being testify that there is no God but Him, that all others have been created by His behest, and been fashioned through the operation of His Will\u2026. I am He that telleth abroad the favors with which God hath, through His bounty, favored Me. If this be My transgression, then I am truly the first of the transgressors\u2026.\u201d 6 Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Reference Library - Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, Pages 25-26 The most direct explanation is provided by Baha\u2019u\u2019llah in the Kitab-i-Iqan, pages 97 to 105 at The Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n. \u201cTo every discerning and illumined heart it is evident that God, the unknowable Essence, the divine Being, is immensely exalted beyond every human attribute, such as corporeal existence, ascent and descent, egress and regress. Far be it from His glory that human tongue should adequately recount His praise, or that human heart comprehend His fathomless mystery. He is and hath ever been veiled in the ancient eternity of His Essence, and will remain in His Reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men. \u201cNo vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all vision; He is the Subtile, the All-Perceiving.\u201d 1 No tie of direct intercourse can possibly bind Him to His creatures. He standeth exalted beyond and above all separation and union, all proximity and remoteness. No sign can indicate His presence or His absence; inasmuch as by a word of His command all that are in heaven and on earth have come to exist, and by His wish, which is the Primal Will itself, all have stepped out of utter nothingness into the realm of being, the world of the visible.\u201d p. 98 \u201cThe door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days being thus closed in the face of all beings, the Source of infinite grace, according to His saying: \u201cHis grace hath transcended all things; My grace hath encompassed them all\u201d hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out of the realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the human temple, and be made manifest unto all men, that they may impart unto the world the mysteries of the unchangeable Being, and tell of the subtleties of His imperishable Essence. These sanctified Mirrors, these Day-springs of ancient glory are one and all the Exponents on earth of Him Who is the central Orb of the universe, its Essence and ultimate Purpose. From Him proceed their knowledge and power; from Him is derived their sovereignty. The beauty of their countenance is but a reflection of His image, and their revelation a sign of His deathless glory. They are the Treasuries of divine knowledge, and the Repositories of celestial wisdom. Through them is transmitted a grace that is infinite, and by them is revealed the light that can never fade. Even as He hath said: \u201cThere is no distinction whatsoever between Thee and them; except that they are Thy servants, and are created of Thee.\u201d This is the significance of the tradition: \u201cI am He, Himself, and He is I, myself.\u201d\u201d pp. 99\u2013100 \u201cThese attributes of God are not and have never been vouchsafed specially unto certain Prophets, and withheld from others. Nay, all the Prophets of God, His well-favoured, His holy, and chosen Messengers, are, without exception, the bearers of His names, and the embodiments of His attributes. They only differ in the intensity of their revelation, and the comparative potency of their light. Even as He hath revealed: \u201cSome of the Apostles We have caused to excel the others.\u201d 6 It hath therefore become manifest and evident that within the tabernacles of these Prophets and chosen Ones of God the light of His infinite names and exalted attributes hath been reflected, even though the light of some of these attributes may or may not be outwardly revealed from these luminous Temples to the eyes of men. That a certain attribute of God hath not been outwardly manifested by these Essences of Detachment doth in no wise imply that they Who are the Daysprings of God\u2019s attributes and the Treasuries of His holy names did not actually possess it. Therefore, these illuminated Souls, these beauteous Countenances have, each and every one of them, been endowed with all the attributes of God, such as sovereignty, dominion, and the like, even though to outward seeming they be shorn of all earthly majesty. To every discerning eye this is evident and manifest; it requireth neither proof nor evidence.\u201d pp. 103\u2013104 ",

Baha\u2019u\u2019llah writes : \u201cTen thousand Prophets, each a Moses, are thunderstruck upon the Sinai of their search at His forbidding voice, \"Thou shalt never behold Me!\"; whilst a myriad Messengers, each as great as Jesus, stand dismayed upon their heavenly thrones by the interdiction, \"Mine Essence thou shalt never apprehend!\"  \u2026 \u201cHow bewildering to me, insignificant as I am, is the attempt to fathom the sacred depths of Thy knowledge! How futile my efforts to visualize the magnitude of the power inherent in Thine handiwork -- the revelation of Thy creative power! How can mine eye, which hath no faculty to perceive itself, claim to have discerned Thine Essence, and how can mine heart, already powerless to apprehend the significance of its own potentialities, pretend to have comprehended Thy nature? How can I claim to have known Thee, when the entire creation is bewildered by Thy mystery, and how can I confess not to have known Thee, when, lo, the whole universe proclaimeth Thy Presence and testifieth to Thy truth? \u2026\u201d (Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 62) ",
