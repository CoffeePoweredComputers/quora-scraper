            "answer_text": "The most legit jobs are traditional 9\u20135 jobs that are offered by the company as a remote job. That means you\u2019re getting the same pay, benefits as a traditional full time worker. If you want to avoid the hustle of freelance or starting your own business these are the best options for you. There are thousands of online jobs that are legit at companies that might not be household names (Trello, Zapier, Buffer, Github), and those that are more familiar (Kaplan, Aetna, Amazon). There are companies that have a headquarters and allow remote work, and companies that are fully 100% remote, which means everyone from the CEO to admin are remote workers. These companies also have rad benefits. Mapillary is a good example of a company with an HQ but offers remote work as an option. Here\u2019s how they describe their team: We've got our headquarters in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, but work with a remote team. Today we have colleagues in Barcelona, Graz, Los Angeles, New York, Stockholm, and Zagreb. As a team, we work distributed, and people work where they want when they want. GitHub, Google Drive, Hangouts, and Slack are our main tools. We ship early, in the open, and make multiple releases every day. Love that focus on *work where they want when they want.* Plus that team is hella global. Now look at the benefits:  That\u2019s a pretty sweet, legit company with legit online jobs. Right now they\u2019re hiring for data analysts and product managers. But you don\u2019t have to be a tech person to get these jobs. There are non tech remote jobs. Here\u2019s a high paying legit online job for a Director of Content at a full 100% remote company. Check the benefits and pay:   The best legit online jobs are ones that are just like you\u2019d find in the 9\u20135, except you don\u2019t have to put on pants to do the job. It\u2019s pretty great really. The video below shows you were where to find these legit online jobs. And there\u2019s an online course you can sign up for to learn you how to transition your traditional 9\u20135 into a full time remote job.  ",
