            "answer_text": "No. There are countably many proofs (of anything), and there are uncountably many undecideable problems. Therefore we cannot map every undecideable problem to a proof, let alone a proof of the problem\u2019s undecideability. Any proof can be written in formal language, encoded in binary, and then interpreted as a natural number. Therefore the number of proofs is less than or equal to the number of natural numbers. Any problem can be represented as a language on a finite alphabet, and vice-versa. Every language can be mapped to the power-set of words on the alphabet and every word can be interpreted as a natural number. Therefore, there are as many languages as the power set of natural numbers. Since decideable problems are countable (since they can be mapped to Turing Machines), there are uncountably many undecideable problems. ",

            "answer_text": "Can every undecidable problem be proven undecidable? Definitely not. 1. In any given first-order theory the number of proofs is countable, and the set of such proofs is recursively enumerable.The set of first-order theories with recursively enumerable sets of axioms is countable.The set of all proofs in all such first-order theories is therefore countable. That covers all of math that is explicitly accessible to humans. 2. For any given transfinite number \u03b1\u03b1 in the von Neumann hierarchy there are vast numbers of sets of cardinality \u03b1\u03b1, with 2\u03b12\u03b1 subsets each. From this we can define a set of vastly more than 2\u03b12\u03b1 problems. The collection of all such problems is too big to be a ZFC or NBG set, but can accordingly be an NBG class. 3. If we like, we can add Large Cardinal Axioms to ZFC or NBG, creating the presumption of even bigger sets of undecidable, unstatable problems. ",
