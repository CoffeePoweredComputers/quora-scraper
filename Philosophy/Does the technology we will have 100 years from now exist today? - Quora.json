            "answer_text": "Sure lots of it, but maybe not the sense you intended by the question. Just as we are using much of the same basic technology we had in 1900, people will be using basic technologies we have today: Basic mechanical systems: wheel & axle, gear & pulley, clutch & differential, electic motor, etc.Basic electrical and electronic: copper wires, resistors, diodes, capacitors, mechanical switches, integrated circuits, etc.Mundane building materials: glass, plastics, wood, concrete and cement, iron & steel, etc.And so on. . .I\u2019m not saying there will be no improvements in these basic, everyday technologies, it\u2019s just that most of them will stay essentially the same.

            "answer_text": "Yes some of it will still exist, but others will have become obsolete , nothing to worry about though, new technology means we will do things better. I think mobile phones, and reading books will disappear and be replaced by telepathy and online databases. Some will laugh at the idea of telepathy but in reality it\u2019s already being developed, by reading mind patterns and translating them into machine computer code, you can transfer your thoughts to another device, and then re-translate it into human thought waves and transfer information in that way.
