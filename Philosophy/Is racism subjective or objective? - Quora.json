            "answer_text": "It used to be that there were clear definitions of racism. In the modern world of political correctness, the original definitions have been bastardized. What racism should mean is that a person judges another person on the basis of their race. This is a prejudice. It could also mean that a person dislikes or hates others because of their race. Another form of racism is the belief that one is superior to others on the basis of race. One can be a racist and not hate others. For example, a white slave owner could theoretically love his black slaves. But, he is still a racist because he views black people as property. Today, racism is often used by the left to bludgeon those who disagree with their political beliefs. For example, in the eyes of many liberals, one is a racist if one opposes affirmative action or if one is pro law and order or if one opposes multigenerational welfare statism or if one opposes open borders. Ironically, today those who believe that color is irrelevant and should never matter are labeled as racists. ",

Objective Racism: Scientific Racism and forms of logical stereotyping, if you grow up in an area with a large amount of Black crime (where the majority of blacks commit crimes) your stereotyping would be completely logical and in fact be beneficial as a trait to help you survive. Subjective Racism: Basing your racism not on any experiences or sciences but just on the basis of \u201cI don\u2019t like other races\u201d, this would be entirely part of your own opinion, and you would not have any evidence, or experiences to back up your thoughts.
