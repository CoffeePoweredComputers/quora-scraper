            "answer_text": "I can't speak to other universities, but UT Austin has many leading researchers in a lot of areas of neuroscience. As a neuroscience major in undergrad, I had easy access to around 10 specifically neuroscience labs, and possible access to any of the research labs if you got to know the professor well enough to ask to join their lab as an independent researcher. We've recently gotten even more renowned researchers with the Dell Medical School just opening, with many looking for undergrad and graduate researchers to assist them. Although the neuroscience department itself is fairly new at UT, it is expanding rapidly. When I started the major, it was only around a year old, with only a few upper division lectures and research labs available. By my third year, however, the available lectures and labs in neuroscience had probably tripled, on top of the fact that you can join virtually any of the faculty\u2019s labs. ",
