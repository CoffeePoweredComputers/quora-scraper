            "answer_text": "Someone wrote:The self consists of three things \u2013 who I think I am, who I want others to think I am, and who others actually think I am. The closer these points are together, the more complete your self is. Ok that doesn't say what the self actually is, but it might give some kind of triangulation on where it is. Maybe the best way of understanding the self, like the brain, is studying what happens when things go wrong. Such as: Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder) \u2013 literally lots of people with separate identities, memories and personalities living within one body. We're all different \"selves\" in different situations (such as: at work, at your parents, with your life partner) and we all experience zoning out and reacting to, but not consciously experiencing our environment, but DIS is a complete separation of all these \"selves\" as the only way of coping with a traumatic event from very early childhood. Maybe narcissistic personality disorder \u2013 outright rejection of your own sense of self, outsourcing the self to what you want others to think about you, requiring constant adulation, obedience, praise etc. known as narcissistic supply to preserve the sense of self. Ok this is very tentative, but self-proclaimed narcissist Sam Vaknin has written extensively on it. Solipsism might be worth looking into too \u2013 the idea that nothing exists outside of the self. A concept that comes in various manifestations, I'm referring to metaphysical solipsism. ",

            "answer_text": "The self, the \"I\" that is me, this is a story our brain tells itself. It is an illusion: something that is different than it appears to be.  A Grand IllusionWe have the strong belief we are some sort of unified perceiver and decision maker, constant across time, existing inside our bodies, causing our bodies to do things-- but mechanistically speaking, functionally speaking, biologically speaking, this probably isn't true. Brain science doesn't support any sort of central, serial-processing center where the \"self\" might manifest. And if you reject Dualism, then you realize that the whole notion of a \"self\" seems to break down philosophically.    \"We certainly seem to be conscious, and that requires explaining, but the right kind of explanation is one that accounts for why we have this particular illusion. - Blackmore, [1] p. 218 So what is the self? There is no such thing. The self doesn't exist beyond the narratives that our brains and societies create. These stories about selves are powerful and useful both evolutionarily and culturally, but there is no biological basis for them in the forms that we imagine them to exist. Of course, this is a controversial topic, and is closely tied to ideas about Free Will and Consciousness which are informed both by brain sciences (Neuroscience, Psychology) as well as philosophy (Philosophy of Mind,  Consciousness Studies). If you are interested in this topic, I think Susan Blackmore's Consciousness: An Introduction [1] or \"Conversations on Consciousness\" [3] are very accessible places to start, or Daniel Dennett's Consciousness Explained [2], if you are feeling more ambitious.  For a related answer on this topic, I recommend my answer to:Does consciousness emerge from the brain?
