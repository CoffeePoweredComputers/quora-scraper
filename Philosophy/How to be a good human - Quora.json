            "answer_text": "Some days are good, some days are bad, but remember for every good day you\u2019re having, someone else might have just stubbed their toe, spilled coffee on their shirt en route to an interview, or just woke up on the wrong side of the bed, or on the street, or\u2026well let\u2019s not go in a depressed direction thinking about someone waking up on the wrong side of the dumpster and move on to the simple gestures and nice things each of us can do daily. Smile at people. Maybe it\u2019s a stranger, maybe you\u2019re passing by hundreds of people in rush, or it\u2019s just someone that you\u2019re sharing an elevator with. A genuine smile can make someone\u2019s day. And it\u2019s super easy, unless you have a cheek or mouth disease, then that could make it difficult, but fight through it and smile like you mean it. It goes a long way and each time you smile, it will make you feel good. Tell someone they look nice today. Maybe they\u2019re wearing an outfit that makes you question everyday fashion, but who cares? Compliments can truly make that persons day. Want to amp it up a bit? Walk past that person (in your office/at a restaurant/etc.) then take a few steps back and say, \u201cWow, I love that top; so pretty.\u201d Kill them will kindness. Be concise, as helpful as you can, talk in a positive tone; make the conversation a little playful. The majority of the time the problem will be fixed with maybe a little something extra thrown in because out of the hundreds of hateful screaming trash that they deal with daily, you will be a straight up ray of sunshine. Hold the door open for people. A man holding the door open for women is a timeless courtesy that should always happen. But whether you\u2019re female or male, or if you know the person or not, just simply step back and hold the door open for whomever else is cramming in there with you. Drink a big glass of ice water first thing when you wake up. I wouldn\u2019t dare tell you to stop drinking coffee or whatever your morning fix is, but when you immediately drink a huge glass of ice water, chug style, it gets your metabolism going and makes you feel fresh. And when you feel fresh, you want to pass that freshness on to others. Spend ten minutes with your pet.Taking them on a walk is great, but we don\u2019t always have time for that in the morning. What I mean is ten minutes of loving on your pet that gives 24 hours of loving you back. Play with them, hug them, hold them, talk to them and just give them your full attention. You will leave with lovely thoughts of your pet BFF and start your day in a good mood. Treat waiters with respect. You are not above them in any way (unless you eat sitting on top of a ladder) and if you are a jerk to them you are way below them. Smile, be polite, engage them, but understand they are busy. If you don\u2019t feel like they are giving you proper attention, look around and you\u2019ll probably see that you are one of eight tables they are catering to. Every time you eat out, treat your waiter like they are your kid, or loved one, or JUST A PERSON. Be polite. Be respectful. Be a good example to everyone around you. Oh and here\u2019s a tip: TIP. It\u2019s how they make a living, pay for school, get gas, and so on. Don\u2019t drive angry. If someone isn\u2019t using their blinker or cuts you off or is just a jerk on the road, who cares? Don\u2019t combat with them. Don\u2019t let it make you mad. Just really, who cares? Smile and wave because that\u2019s the last thing they would want you to do. But don\u2019t let it be any sweat off your back. That\u2019s their problem, not yours. Don\u2019t let negativity be contagious. It\u2019s all around us, all the time. People love to complain, and let them, just don\u2019t listen to them. One person\u2019s meaningless complaint has nothing to do with you. Be positive. Let that positivity glow on you. Soon, your positive attitude will be contagious, and next thing you know you\u2019re rubbing off on the people who drive you mad daily.  ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, this is a very difficult question to answer as it is perhaps the most central question to one\u2019s existence, we all ask ourselves this question but very few do something about it. First of all, you need to go with the age old \u201cknow thyself\u201d (Written in the pronaos (forecourt) of the Temple of Apollo in Delphi, attributed to Socrates).  This will leave you to a long process of self analysis , try new things , experiment , join online communities , read , go out \u2026 You\u2019ve got to identify your strengths and your weaknesses, this can be learn thought experience and interacting with people, nowadays there are some other resources like the MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator ) which will help you pinpoint your strengths and offer ways for you to act upon those. Then through effort, hard work , courage and networking you can start to \u201cBecome who you are \u201d as Nietzsche said.  For this, there\u2019s an advice that has really helped me over the years, it\u2019s a concept that was used by Benjamin Franklin , and reiterated by Warren Buffet in this excellent speech that he delivered at the University of Florida in 1998. ( He got it from his mentor Benjamin Graham ).  And that is to \u201cWrite down the qualities of the persons you admire the most\u201d and then think about them for and make them habitual. Is it Obama\u2019s eloquence that you admire ?  or Elon Musk\u2019s grit ?  Mother Theresa\u2019s kindness and self devotion?  \u201cThe chains of habits are to light to be felt until they\u2019re to heavy to be broken\u201d. You will then be able to create and provide value to others while fulling your potential, and that is a life well lived , and that\u2019s being a \u201c great person\u201d.
