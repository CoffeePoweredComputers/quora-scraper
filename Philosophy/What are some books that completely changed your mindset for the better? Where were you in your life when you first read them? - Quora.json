            "answer_text": "The 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey. It didn\u2019t alter my life, I\u2019ve been incorporating the said habits in my life unconsciously for a long time. However the book gave a structure to my thoughts, and helped me become mindful towards my priorities in life. The exercise about drafting a mission statement in life is just incredibly difficult yet fulfilling . You slowly earn the power to walk away from anything that doesn\u2019t add value to your life and helps you get closer to your goals. ",

This is likely the most important book in the world, and a free copy can be downloaded online. Next is Dodecalogue, the original 12 commandments. Yes there were 12. The short list can also be found online. Finally the Talmud Jmmanuel scrolls written by Judas Ischkerioth. These scrolls were found in a tomb in old Jerusalem in 1963. They were studied for decades amd determined to be written before the gospel of Matthew. These three books are in my opinion the most important books in the world. ",
