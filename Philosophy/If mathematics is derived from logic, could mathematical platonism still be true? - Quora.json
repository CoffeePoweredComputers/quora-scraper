            "answer_text": "Mathematics is not derived from Logic. That would have been the dream of Gottlob Frege, dream that has failed. Mathematics needs Logic plus a bunch of non-logical axioms in order to work properly and to say anything interesting. The implication in your question, being based on a false premise, is valid. Though the conclusion is not necessarily true. You can find plenty of mathematicians and philosophers that do not agree with Platonism in the foundation of Mathematics. ",

Constructivism (philosophy of mathematics) - Wikipedia. And you\u2019ll note that mathematics is not derived from logic: Principia Mathematica - Volume One: Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell: 9781603864374: Amazon.com: Books (3 volumes). But it\u2019s great to have someone ask a question about the philosophy of mathematics. And mathematics is not \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d. ",

Laws of logic, like the axioms in math, are ideals that do not apply strictly to our reality. The concepts that we call numbers are purely imaginary and have no relation to anything in this world. Galileo\u2019s belief that, all of nature is numbers, was an example of total self-deception. ",
