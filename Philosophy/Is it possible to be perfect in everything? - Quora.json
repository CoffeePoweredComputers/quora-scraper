            "answer_text": "Few people were given the status of Uomo Universale / Polymath.People who had gotten this status had expertises in nearly every field possible. To get the status of Polymath, you need to have expertises in the following fields: ArtPoliticsEconomicsInventionScienceBiologyAstronomyPhysicsChemistryPhilosophyMusicSportsBusiness You don\u2019t just have to be good in these things, you have to excel in them. You should realise by now that becoming a Polymath is rather difficult, especially as there is a lot more to be known today than 400 years ago. That\u2019s also why nobody living today has this status anymore. And although many people have gotten this status through history, the most famous one must be Leonardo DaVinci, a famous person who\u2019s well known for being good in everything.  Being officialy names a Polymath comes closest to being perfect in everything, but of course we all know that everyone, Da Vinci included, has imperfections. I wish you good luck and hope to see you on the list soon! ",

You do realize that in order for a person to have perfected all areas of life, they must have entire knowledge about each and every subject/topic/idea EVER in history and then some?? This notion just seems completely absurd to me. I do apologize, but I sure hope you can realize this to be true. ",
