            "answer_text": "Subjective of course! How could I ever be objective? No matter how hard I try I could never accomplish it! That\u2019s why judges recuse themselves if they have any knowledge or relation with any party, or if a similar incident has happened to them! Because it is incredibly difficult to be objective. What I do about it is I assume an opposing opinion has as much possibility of being the right one as mine. So I discuss. Over the years there are some people in my life with whom I share certain values and whose opinion I have asked several times! This saves me a lot of time. If they disagree with me, my confidence in my opinion takes a serious hit. Unless convinced I still have the same opinion but I am extremely more reluctant about it. If one or two of them agree, I tend to be sure of my convictions. The most important thing is to be open to the possibility you are wrong and to want to be saved from your delusions if you are. Today people will defend obviously ridiculous points to avoid being proven wrong\u2026 ",
