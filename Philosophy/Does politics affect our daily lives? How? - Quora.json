            "answer_text": "People usually don\u2019t like to talk about politics. While many have their own unique reason, the fact of the matter is that most people don\u2019t even know enough about politics so that they can have a meaningful discussion. That in itself is a sad problem of our society, as many people simply believe that politics are detached from their daily lives, and so they don\u2019t give it enough thought. The truth could not be further from that point of view. Politicsare in fact so much intertwined with our daily lives, that it can easily be the most deciding factor in almost everything we do, the thing is most people don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care until it directly affects them. Politics are important, so much so, that every law that we follow has been written by politicians. Even the products that we have in our stores are allowed in our country by politics and cost a certain amount due to the laws that are written by politicians. The future of every country is its people, and so people should be aware of how much politics does affect and can affect their lives. To be perfectly aware just how politics can shape our surroundings, think about the situation of women in Saudi Arabia for instance. Their women were not allowed to drive their cars without a male guardian present. Only today in 2018 has the law been changed so that women can drive the cars without males present in the car. This is a huge difference compared to America and the rest of the western world, where man and women have equal rights.  Another great example of how politics affects our daily lives is if you are a student that wants to study abroad and if you are not part of the European Union or a country that does not have direct access with the country where you want to study, you will then need a visa. The trick is you could be denied that visa, and so your dreams of studying in that particular country have come to an end. This is all because of how politics of your country and the country where you want to study come to terms. If you are lucky that both countries and their politics are on equal terms than you can freely move from one to another without too much paperwork and hassle, but if they aren\u2019t then tough luck. In conclusion people need to be aware of just how much politics affect their lives, and they should not just go and vote for one side all the time, but in fact, they should research all the sides of the political spectrum in their country, and get to know everything that their political party wants to change and how it will directly affect them and their daily lives. A country without an educated populace about how their politics works will rarely advance towards a greater good, and will always lead down to a corrupt government which is not good either for the country or for its people.

            "answer_text": "This one is quite easy. Politics has a very strong impact on the way that people think and the way people operate within a complex social and political system. The connection between cultures and ideologies must be manifest through the actions which we take which are political in nature, and if we do not allow the political to influence the societal then we have a problem because society, without a political system on which it is predicated, cannot thrive or function because even unity must be enforced at some level. This is why I support the Democratic Party. Even though I do not consider myself a Democrat, and would rather call myself a leftist, it seems clear to me that the only way to achieve the so-called \u201cleftist agenda\u201d (as it is sometimes called by conservatives) is by electing officials who are predominantly Democratic in their political orientation. Issues like free speech, abortion, political correctness and immigration are just some of the things that need to be addressed in our society, and it seems like it's the conservatives who want to prevent us from having real life discussions on these subjects. The reason for this may have to do with the conservative agenda, which is not interested in diversity of opinion (though they may claim otherwise) but are much rather interested in being dominant on the societal level through the influences of religion and the state. This is why I think we need to have a change in the way that we operate within society so that we can accommodate these changes and allow for real change to take place when the common forms of change haven't. The best way to push this is to make conservatives get out of the way so that other groups of people can thrive, and we do not need the help of any conservative. What we need are people who are willing to help those who are suffering and who are willing to lift them up out of poverty and starvation. Thank you. ",

Now, that I've grown up a bit, still 20 tho, i became much more aware of matters that was completely useless to my 17 year old self. Why would I fucking wanna know who won the election? Who got more votes? Who took control over electricity ? Who took the majority of the decisions? Who made the war? Who are the republicans and who are the democrats? What is ISIS? Why North Korea is still isolated from the rest of the world? Why would i fucking wanna know how many presidents are there in the US? Why would i even care if the regime\u2019s plan was a good or a bad one? All these questions wouldn't even occur to my 17year old self because i was that ignorant. My 17year old self cared more about cloth, sports, grades and whatever. I did not acknowledge that politics evolves around all the universe. In fact, it is nearly as important as everything else, if not more. The 20 year old self that i am is still ignorant. Just not as much as i used to be, and, that is okay. You do not need to know everything at a young age, you do not need to know the differences and similarities between countries. It is okay to not know. But, as you grow older, it is a must, to be able to speak and negotiate subjects that matters to the world. Politics, arts, design and all these are constantly being discussed by humans. 30year old self from now, learn more about the world! ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a story about G.K. Chesterton that I\u2019ve heard, but can\u2019t find the reference for, so I\u2019ll post it from memory. He was offered a job writing a column for a newspaper as long as he didn\u2019t write about religion or politics. He took the job and said that he then spent 20 years writing about religion and politics; because religion is man\u2019s relationship with the ultimate questions, and politics is mans relationship with his fellow man. Politics is the term we use for what happens in government, but it is also what happens in day to day life. You have give and take (or should), you use politeness even when you don\u2019t know people (or you know and don\u2019t like them) because it makes interactions easier. To act altruistically because you are a good person, but even if not because you want the people you help to someday help you if you need it. If you are humble, you support those who may someday take over your job, (whether you want to leave or not) because others helped you. Interactions between people often have an aspect of power. This person can do something to harm that person, so that person has to watch out. Sometimes this is real power, and people with often come to think they deserve the power to rule even in areas outside their domain. To take a leaf from fiction, there was a TV show many years ago called _The Paper Chase_ about law students. The contracts professor gives them a set of very difficult questions to answer over a weekend. The students rush around trying to find reference material, discovering it checked out by other students or just missing. They try their best, and only answer a few questions. Then they get together, and negotiate answers and reference material, bartering on the difficulty of what they have to offer vs. what the others have, and in the end, everyone in the class has all of the answers. When asked by the professor what they learned, only one realizes that they used contracts to share the answers, and the professor agrees, pointing out that contracts aren\u2019t just in a classroom but a real thing in life. Politics isn\u2019t just in the government, but it is a real thing in our interactions. It\u2019s a shame that the elected officials aren\u2019t taking any lessons from the people they govern. ",

As Kevin Baker said \"Politics affects pretty much every aspect of your life, because government affects nearly every aspect of your life.\" If you are able to live in a house that has a mortgage, the mortgage process and the institution which provided the mortgage are government controlled. Why? because of political pressure and involvement.  Your safe streets and highway, they are possible because 'politicians' taxed you and spent for you to provide that which you use daily.  Taxes, benefits, laws, water, health, crime, religion... everything is impacted by politics. If you don't vote, somebody else is definitely voting 'for you.' Just by ignoring an issue, does not render the issue obsolete or gone, but rather inconspicuously implemented by others who care more than you. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer from my reading of Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Right (1821): When we speak of politics, we speak of our national government, and therefore we speak of our Constitution. In each nation, the national Constitution carefully defines the Freedoms that the citizens (or subjects) of that government will allow, and will fight for in actual combat. Now \u2014 Hegel says that Freedom is the main factor in life that makes us who we are. The level of Freedom that we have \u2014 like the level of guidance that we have \u2014 all of this forms our young Personalities so that we develop into who we are. Hegel concludes, that I owe everything I am to the Freedoms that I have enjoyed under my national Constitution \u2014 therefore, I literally owe my nation military service whenever I am asked. I might be killed when performing my military service duties \u2014 but that is precisely what I owe to my nation the source of my Freedom \u2014 my very own life. The blood of the patriots of my nation gave their lives so that I can enjoy the Freedoms that make me who I am. So \u2014 politics is a matter of life and death. Now, what could be more relevant to our daily lives than matters of life and death? Every ordinary citizen wants to read his or her national Constitution, and understand the Freedoms and Rules of the nation. Our modern knowledge of politics begins and ends there. There\u2019s my reading. ",

Once politicians get into office they usually don\u2019t do what they campaigned on and if they do they make sure their donors benefit more then their constituents. It\u2019s a simple fact that corporations and big businesses would like to control any organization that would have power to reign in their excess. That organization is the government and these corporations corrupted it and told everyone the government is a boogeyman so after they corrupted it we wouldn\u2019t bother taking it back. Politics and the battle for ideas are like a bludgeon that the rich and powerful use to hit average workers over the head while they go on news channels and say the stock market is doing fine.

There are differences, however, between countries in how they go about it. These are political decisions! So, say, Germany is run quite differently to UK or US, who adopted so called free economy. Germany is doing much better because their economy is coordinated, so it has better control of its society. As to people, it is quite interesting to see how easily they adapt. Enough that some shmock will get on some platform and start spouting hatered, there will immediately be million of mindless followers who will do just the same, and more, in consequence. Look at UK and Brexit! Or Trump. N.Farage did just that, few years ago, and by now there are millions from which some run around urinating at people, shouting abuse at other humans, setting their houses on fire, and you name it.
