An example of this can be seen in the province of Alberta Canada where a barrel of oil is now worth less than $5 CADAn Increase in carbon and light pollution worldwidethe recommended self isolation has caused for many businesses, factories, and forms of transportation to halt. Post pandemic we will likely see all of this slowly start to pick back up and return to its original stateA Much Needed Reform to the North American Medical Sectorwhat we\u2019re starting to see worldwide is that there is a shortage of both medical supplies and doctors. Countries like Italy and the United States are now looking to increase the amount of medical equipment they have on deck. An example of this can be seen in the United States where President Donald Trump is calling for General Motors to produce 30,000 ventilators for hospitalsanother possible reform to the medical field would be to help combat the shortage of doctors in North America. Countries like the US and Canada make it very strenuous for any one person to become a medical professional. They require for one to obtain first an undergraduate degree, progress to a medical school, and then continue with their training as a doctor. This turns a large population of people away from the field and ultimately leads to a shortage of doctors. Countries in Europe such as Spain and the United Kingdom offer medicine as an undergraduate program, this allows for passionate students to directly enter medicine from high school and incentivizes more to do so.(I was able to come up with 3 hopefully someone else can elaborate) ",
