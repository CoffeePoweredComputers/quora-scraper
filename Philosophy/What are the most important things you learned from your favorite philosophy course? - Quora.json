            "answer_text": "I college, a required course was Ethics. I took the only one offered, but it turned out to be a Philosophy class. After taking the class, I learned that there is no objective \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. It all depends on how you look at it. I still essentially subscribe to the Golden Rule, but I was impressed at how philosophers of days past were able to make the argument that some actions that most would objectively label wrong are, on further examination and thought, just and good. About the only thing I remember clearly from that class is Occam\u2019s Razor: When you have two competing theories that make exactly the same predictions, the simpler one is the better Or, in other words: Where there are two or more ways to explain something, the simpler one must be correct The last one was the way we learned it. So, for example, suppose you wondered, \u201cHow did that light turn on in that room?\u201d There are two ways presented that it happened: Through an phenomena not understood, an entity formed a conduit from the power source to the lightbulbSomeone flicked on the light switchWhich is more likely? Therefore, it must be correct. ",
