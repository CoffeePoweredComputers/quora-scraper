Bismuth, a pentavalent poor metal, chemically resembles arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but is often seen in air with a pink tinge owing to surface oxidation.

            "answer_text": "Nature is an intricately designed pattern. Science cannot explain them fully even after millions of years of human existence. If the most intelligent creature on earth cannot explain a pattern of nature, then nature must be more intelligent than humans? Lets see through these examples: A nerka salmon (fish) takes birth in fresh water, lives in freshwater lake for 3 years of its life. Suddenly, as if it cannot help itself, moves to sea water traveling over 1000 miles through waterfalls, rivers, and ultimately in pacific ocean. After living there for another 2 years, something changes in its head & it heads back to its place of birth! On way back, it eats more than it should until it crosses back from ocean to river. Climbs back up the same waterfalls it had come down from & ultimately reaching back to its place of birth. Once it is there, it looks for a partner & they lay eggs there. Because they do not eat anything once back in fresh water & tired from the return journey, it loses its life!! Isnt it amazing that a fish can remember the exact route after living so far, can adjust itself twice to fresh water to sea water to fresh water. Annually kenya & tanzania region witness migration of 1mn+ animal species - mostly wildebeest, zebras & antelopes. this is how it looks like. they travel the same route year on year almost circling around in search for easier climate & food. a human pair can produce ~84,00,000 types of child. Genes are a complex thread and contains answers to all that we do in life. Yet, we do not know anything about them",
