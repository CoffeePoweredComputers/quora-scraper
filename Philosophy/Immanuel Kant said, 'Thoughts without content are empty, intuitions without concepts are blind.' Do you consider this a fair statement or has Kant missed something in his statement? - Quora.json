            "answer_text": "Please excuse my lack of background in philosophy. From a layperson\u2019s perspective I understand the communication from the philosopher is saying \u201c To think (thoughts) , I need perceptions of something to think about (content) and if I do not have the tools to think (concepts) I am thinking (intuitions) in the dark (blind). Or in Martin Jenkin's analogy below \u201cI\u201d is the signet ring, something to \u201cthink about\u201d is the softened wax and \u201cI\u201d (the signet ring) need to create concept/s (the impression on the wax) which are the tools (the impressions) to think (have intuitions) clearly. This is how thinking evolves as the mind receives perceptions which are interpreted and concepts are proposed, debated, discussed, accepted, rejected. To philosophise is the luxury of the person with air to breath, potable water to drink, edible food, shelter, security and reasonable health. Without the basics of life we are too busy trying to survive. Yet some of the wisest people struggle to survive and have more wisdom than many philosophers. Jesus for example said Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 18:3 \u201cThose words of Kant epitomise his philosophy of Critical Idealism espoused in the Critique of Pure Reason. How do we know what we know? Kant sought to answer this perennial question. If I can firstly use an analogy. Think of the sealing wax and signet ring. The mind is like a signet ring because it will impose Form upon the wax \u2013 the Forms are like Conceptions or Categories. The signet ring is applied to the hot sealing wax to give it Form and the wax gives content to it. Without the shaping of the ring/Mind, there can be no content or intuitions. Without the content [or intuitions] of the wax, the Form or Categories remain empty. Both are needed in the act of synthesis\u201d. Martin Jenkins Kant on empty thoughts and blind intuitions ",

            "answer_text": "It's been quite a few moons since I've studied Kant, aside from being fond of duty, so I feel it necessary to define what we are talking about. So I will add the current definitions along with the assumed lexicon an then my assessment of fairness as you say. Definitions: Thoughts an idea or opinion produced by thinking, or occurring suddenly in the mind without content does he mean without valid content (contains an element of subjectivity) or substance (relationship to real facts) are empty without any real meaning. Intuitions knowledge from an ability to understand or know something immediately based on your feelings rather than facts without concepts a basic idea or rule of how things work are blind unable to notice or understand. Layman's Translation: An idea produced by thinking without relationship to facts lack meaning, immediate understanding based on feelings alone without a basic idea or rules of how it works we are unable to be conscious of or conceive. Refined layman: thoughts without facts are meaningless or cannot be represented, learned knowledge based on feelings sans observation or reason without it being presented first we cannot be conscious of. Assessment: My first thought is where does instinct lie? We have the ability to sense danger without knowing what it is or what danger means aside from bad, but we also know hunger so if stuck in a cave with wolves outside we could reason that one is more important than the other (risk of starving, vs risk of being eaten by wolves) without knowing which one is a fact, nor what reason is. My next thought is that it seems dangerously close to a god complex, basically saying that our reasoning and conceptualization make us the authority on reality and the \u201crealness\u201d of things. We saw the earth as flat, but then some mindless hack made an assumption without stone cold facts that it was round and lo and behold-the Hubble\u2026.I would say that many of our greatest achievements were based on intuiting something exists without knowing how it works. So maybe I am reading it wrong what he means by concepts and content because I feel that it's entirely possible to have a concept or theory without intuition and that you can pull Both off without first being presented with them. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f ",
