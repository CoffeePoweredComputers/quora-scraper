            "answer_text": "One of the best examples was Italy for a more than 20 yr period, from about 1922 or so until at least 1943 (July of \u201943 Mussolini was officially deposed, and eventually \u201cimprisoned\u201d, but he was shortly thereafter rescued by his German allies and re-installed in northerly Italy as Duce of the mostly Berlin-controlled fascist Salo\u2019 Republic). And not all Italians actually went over to the Allied side as of September of 43. The country really was in near total shambles at that point, and practically a sort of civil war (as well as being foreign-occupied: by everyone from the Anglos and Americans, to the Nazi Germans). The Italians were fighting among themselves, and some were fighting alongside the Allies, some were uninvolved, and some were essentially remaining true to the Axis (i.e., the Nazi-led forces). Nazi Germany was a fascist-based system; although there were significant differences between it and fascist Italy (particularly prior to the start of WWII). Germany\u2019s \u2018variety\u2019 of fascism had much more of a fixation from its very earliest days on extreme anti-Semitism, racialism, \u201cAryanism\u201d, and such racial- type issues were really at its very core and were intrinsic to it. Whereas Italian fascism didn\u2019t really \u201cadopt\u201d those things until the very late 30\u2019s; and even then, those ideas were never half as well accepted or truly absorbed into the collective Italian public mindset the way that they were in Germany. Spain was under a basically fascist system as well, the Franco regime. Which was an originally corporatist/syndicalist type of system, promoting fascist economy and autarky (the idea that a nation can be truly self-sufficient with only bare minimal or almost no foreign trade or investment or involvement at all). It was closer to the Catholic Church than Mussolini\u2019s regime (which nonetheless the latter co-existed with the Catholic Church as well, and found some supporters among Catholic clergy; if nothing else than as a useful bulwark against atheist communism). And later after the war we might be able to call Spain something like a quasi-fascist (mostly fascist) strongly Catholic-inclined autocracy. Spain didn\u2019t really significantly move away from fascism until about the mid-50\u2019s or early-60\u2019s when economically neoliberal type \u201ctechnocrats\u201d began moving the country\u2019s economy out of a truly fascist sort of economic framework and into a more genuinely capitalist free-market, free-trade inclined sort of system. (While nonetheless still retaining the overall non-democratic, autocratic framework until about the mid-1970\u2019s; think of this perhaps kind of how, in more recent times, countries like China or Vietnam \u2014 while remaining ostensibly or technically communist as far as governing style, etc \u2014 have largely switched over to \u201cmixed\u201d or much more capitalist-friendly economies). Therefore in a sense Spain was probably one of the longest-lived originally truly fascist (that is, WWII-era fascist) sorts of regimes. Even though, as noted, it became more like an economically somewhat neo-liberal, more capitalist-friendly, Catholic-inclined autocracy as time went on long after the war. Other noteworthy European fascist (or quasi-fascist) movements that either ruled or partly ruled for a time during the WWII era or prior were the Romanian Iron Guard - Wikipedia , which was a strongly Romanian Orthodox-inclined semi- mystical sort of particularly Romanian fascism/racialist type of movement. Or the Croatian Ustase, which was an ultra-nationalist, anti-Semitic, devoutly Catholic Croat movement. During WWII however the \u201cIndependent State of Croatia\u201d was really an Axis protectorate, or some may say \u201cpuppet\u201d (at Nuremberg it was determined to not have been a truly sovereign power), although it was ruled at least nominally independently by Croatian fascist Ante Pavelic.

            "answer_text": "Here is some info List of fascist movements Page issues This article discusses regimes and movements that have described themselves as fascist, or are alleged to have been fascist or sympathetic to fascism. It is often a matter of dispute whether a certain government is to be characterized as fascist (radical authoritarian nationalism), authoritarian, totalitarian, or a police state. The term \"fascism\" itself is controversial, and has been defined in various ways by different authors. Many of the regimes and movements discussed in this article can be considered fascist according to some definitions but not according to others. See definitions of fascism for more information on that subject. The Axis (1922-1945)Edit Italy (1922\u20131943)Edit Main article: Italian Fascism The first fascist country, Italy, was ruled by Benito Mussolini (Il Duce) until he was dismissed and arrested on 25 July 1943. Mussolini was then rescued from prison by the Wehrmacht, and set up a short-lived puppet state named \"Repubblica di Sal\u00f2\" in northern Italy under the protection of the Wehrmacht. Germany (1933\u20131945)Edit Main article: Nazism The National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazis) came to power in Germany as a minority party when its leader, Adolf Hitler, was named chancellor following the elections of 1933. Hitler moved swiftly to consolidate power, first through passage of the Enabling Act of 1933. After the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in 1934, the entire power of the German state was concentrated in Hitler's hands. The German National socialists were known for their use of thuggery and intimidation of political opponents and dissenters, including outright persecution of the country's Jewish citizenry, resulting in the Holocaust. Nonetheless, they were widely popular among many segments of the German population, particularly the working class, for their perceived success in reversing the nation's economic decline. [1] One of Hitler's cornerstone policies was known as Lebensraum, which served as the rationale for Germany's expansionist foreign policy and ultimately led to the Second World War. Japan (1931\u20131945)Edit Main article: Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan Right-wing elements in Japan, including industrialists, military officers, and the nobility, had long opposed democracy as an anathema to national unity. Military cliques began to dominate the national government starting in the 1930s. A major militarist nationalist movement in Japan from the 1920s to the 1930s was the Imperial Way Faction\"Kodoha\" of which future wartime Prime Minister Hideki T\u014dj\u014d was a part. In 1936, Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, aimed at countering the Soviet Union and the Communist International. In 1940, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoyeestablished the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, or Taisei Yokusankai, to consolidate all political parties under a single umbrella group. That same year, Japan joined Germany and Italy in the Tripartite Pact.
