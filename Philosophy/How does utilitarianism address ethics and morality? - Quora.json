            "answer_text": "It departs from hedonism as in humans seek pleasure and avoid pain by their nature therefore what gives pleasure is good and what gives pain is evil. If you want to look further back, it connects to the sophist notion that man is the measure of all things. Subjectivism is deeply rooted in that line of thinking. Consequently, there are no universals, no truths, no knowing anything. You carry on by saying I am right if I say so, and when that doesn\u2019t work, might makes right. Obviously that is not very supportive of living with other people. You need to come up with a solution to the problem of might being the only tool of interaction with others. Why is that a problem? Well, there is always someone mightier than you are. Utilitarianism extrapolates hedonism from the individual to the collective. It does that by borrowing collective subjectivism from Kant. You may remember Kant said humans can\u2019t know reality, and all they can do is to take what everybody else says as if it was real. This of course requires you to accept the worst of dictators is a nice guy if everybody says so. But social harmony is more important to Kant than your petty opinions. Anyway. Utilitarianism takes that idea from Kant and adapts to hedonism: If what gives pleasure to one man is good, what gives pleasure to everyone should be great! How do we know what gives pleasure to most people? By empirical evidence. Do most people like flying? Yes. Can most people fly? No. So if you make flight tickets cheaper and flight cabins crampier, you can count the physically existing passengers in greater numbers. You knew they had wanted to fly. Here they are flying. You have made the greatest number of people happier. But where all the planes come from? That, dear utilitarian friend, doesn\u2019t matter. You can always bend some rules to create resources for plane making at tax payer expense without asking them. Ends justify means. Which ends? Well, unless you have figured that out already, ends are a subjective matter. Means are subjective too. Everything is subjective. It depends. In case of a disagreement, might makes it right. ",

            "answer_text": "Utilitarianism is the doctrine that actions are right if they are useful or for the benefit of a majority. As Daniel Zhukovin said, it doesn\u2019t address ethics or morality at all, except by extension. If something is \u201cuseful or for the benefit of a majority\u201d, you could consider it ethical or moral. (Since ethics and morality are relative, not absolute, that\u2019s fine - there\u2019s no problem there.) ",
