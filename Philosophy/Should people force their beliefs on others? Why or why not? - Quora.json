            "answer_text": "I hear this question a lot and wonder about its origins. No one can force anyone to believe anything unless brainwashing and torture are involved. My theory about the origin of this question is that a great many people don't know where to get facts because of propaganda. Part of the intellectual maturation of any adult is a better understanding of what we do not know. This learned wisdom is broken in the United States due to a strategy often called gaslighting. How does gaslighting work? The media over the years has built up a kind of trust. People like Dan Rather, Edward R. Morrow, Walter Cronkite, McNeil and Lehrer, David Brinkley etc were the most trusted voices in America. At one point, Walter Cronkite had higher trust rating than any other American including Presidents. So the media, at one time, was highly trusted and by the way it still is! Now suppose Walter Cronkite decided to lie to us about something that we thought we knew. Suppose he said, \u201cThere is a conspiracy in government to hide the true color of the sky which is really green and all of those jets spewing chemtrails are painting the sky to keep us from knowing the truth.\u201d This is called gaslighting. It is designed to be crazy making and to twist reality. Now, all the other news broadcasters react by not saying anything or insisting that the sky really is blue. So the people have a choice on where to go to get news. Those who believe Walter Cronkite are going to go to him exclusively for their news. Those that don\u2019t will go somewhere else. The news is now segmented through a lie. Welcome, to Fox News. This question, \u201cShould people be able to force their beliefs on others?\u201d is really akin asking \u201cShould people be forced to believe the sky is blue?\u201d There is a fundamental confusion about the nature of knowledge and truth. Part of this is a poor basic education but the other part is greed. We have conservative media commentators telling listeners that science is false news. We have conservative evangelical ministers, trusted implicitly by their audience, preaching their mysticism as a kind of scientific fact. This is creating a situation that is a danger to the continued viability of the United States. Why is a foreign owned media outlet, Fox News allowed to destroy the USA? ",

            "answer_text": "FORCE their beliefs on others? No. That's the beautiful thing about free will. We all have a path to walk. I like Brian saying \"it's like forcing people to drink their coffee black . . .\" That's a great way to sum it up. But there is the slippy side to the subject, simply because what some people see as \"forcing,\" the other side sees as the freedom to share their beliefs. My biggest concern right now is that apparently we can't have conversations about things like adults anymore, because somebody (and all \"sides\" are guilty of this) sticks their fingers in their ears and starts humming as loudly as possible.  I don't believe anybody should be allowed to force their beliefs on anyone else - whether those beliefs are religious, lifestyle, or political. But we DO need to make sure that we are maintaining an environment where everyone can live out their beliefs so long as those beliefs are not physically affecting others, and where they are free to discuss those beliefs without fear of persecution.
