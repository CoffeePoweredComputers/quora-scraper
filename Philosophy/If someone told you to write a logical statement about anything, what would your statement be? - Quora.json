A value is a meaning per say, and it's value becomes the main contributor to its purpose. Life\u2019s meaning is what everyone wants from it, if no one wants anything for life it's value becomes null. As long as you want something, your life has meaning and purpose. Pretty cool huh? Another one is (following the previous logic) The more you have, the less you want So the more life you have, the less you want that. That's why people with \u2018no lives\u2019 are generally happy, the do what they want. ",
