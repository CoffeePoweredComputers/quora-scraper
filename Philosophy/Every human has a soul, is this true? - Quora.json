Indestructible and internal that the constitution manifests to how many inorganic and organic beings exist in the Universe. Such a person is integrated with transcendental matter to which scientific inexperience, peculiar to the era in which Thales of Miletus lived, called it electricity. Each type is offered before our senses when it is covered with ponderable matter; he gives cohesion and other physical properties to the mineral bodies, and organization, forms and biological functions to the vegetal and animal beings.- The HUMAN SPIRIT is the typical synthesis of organic nucleus of transcendental matter, which in its bosom integrates and summarizes the inferior elements or types that correspond, which, persistent and immortal, evolved, acquiring in the medium of rigorous experience, all the properties and attributes that added and harmoniously combined in the organic core in question, are revealed in faculties of conscience . There is not a single atom (elementary particle) of ponderable matter, which does not have in itself another electric atom of identical nature, that is, if the ponderable atom is red, the electric atom that serves as the soul will be of the same color; if the ponderable atom is corresponding to the first of the seven shades, the electric atom that serves as the soul will be of the same somber tone.

            "answer_text": "Well, if souls were real then I would demand that if humans were all supposed to have one, they'd all would have one. There would be no excuse for one not to have one. But the good news is, there is no evidence of a soul. So the question regarding \u201cSouls\u201d, does not count here. ",
