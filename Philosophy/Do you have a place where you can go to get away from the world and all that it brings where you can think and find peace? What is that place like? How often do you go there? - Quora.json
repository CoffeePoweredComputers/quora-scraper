A big, rambling old house with a checquered history (built as a pub 1855, burned down 1856 rebuilt as three cottages 1885, clubrooms added 1910, modified several times) on half an acre. For six years we have worked on both house and garden. There are several spots where one can be alone in the quiet. And of course I go to one or other of these spots several times per day. Sometime we go together, sometimes separately. ",

            "answer_text": "The feeling of constantly being on edge is in large part due to the constant stream of notifications from our smartphones. We are so conditioned to receiving notifications that it is not uncommon to feel a phantom buzz of a smartphone in our pocket if we haven\u2019t received a notification in a while. I\u2019ve found that if I really need to concentrate on something, I will put my phone into airplane mode, and that aids enormously in my ability to focus on the present, which leads to peace. A quiet work environment also helps a lot in helping me to find peace. However, this is not always possible, and in fact there are often benefits (in the form of peer pressure and exchange of ideas) to working in an open office environment with others. ",

I challenge my body with the natural world and when I\u2019m exhausted I find someplace to relax. I set and watch the wind blow through the leaves. I set on my balcony and watch the birds fly around. I stand by the ocean and watch the water move. I set by a river and watch the water move. Movement gives me peace. I enjoy watching it. I find peace very often. Well driving or setting on my balcony. I often find peace watching the world move. ",
