            "answer_text": "Absolutely. In fact, I\u2019d say the vast majority \u2013 if not all, experience no pain whatsoever. I\u2019m being a slight dick with the terminology though. A heart attack is a slow process involving build-up of crap in the arteries. A cardiac arrest is a fairly sudden event that may or may not cause pain. I\u2019ll even confuse the terms during typical discussions from time to time. From Heart Attack or Sudden Cardiac Arrest: How Are They Different? What is a heart attack?  A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a section of the heart. If the blocked artery is not reopened quickly, the part of the heart normally nourished by that artery begins to die. The longer a person goes without treatment, the greater the damage. Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men. What is cardiac arrest? Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment. I\u2019ve experienced a few V-Fibs (cardiac arrests) as a result of a heart attack (100% blockage in an artery). I felt no pain, just basically blacked out. Naturally, other versions of cardiac arrests can be painful. ",

Women also have a tolerance to pain (think of delivering a 10 lb bowling ball out of your butt) and often ignore the signals of a heart attack.
