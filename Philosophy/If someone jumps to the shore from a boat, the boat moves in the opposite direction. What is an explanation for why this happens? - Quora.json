            "answer_text": "Conservation of Momentum. Also, boats are designed to move easily through the water. The momentum of an object is its mass multiplied by its velocity. The total momentum of all bodies is the same, everywhere, always (even during explosions). When you jump ashore, you gain momentum towards the shore. That means that something must gain an exact equal amount of momentum away from the shore. Since you jumped off the boat, it\u2019s the boat that moves (as others said, per Newton\u2019s Second Law). The velocity of the boat will be given by [math] v_2 = -v_1 \\times m_1 / m_2 [/math]where [math]v_1[/math] is your velocity and [math]m_1[/math] , [math]m_2 [/math]are your respective masses. If the boat is large, [math]m_2[/math] is large and you won\u2019t notice. In a small boat, with a small mass, the effect is much larger. If I step off the front of my little catamaran, which weighs about the same as I do, from the point of view of an observer on the shore I moved half as fast as I would normally, fell short of the dock, and went in the water. If I step off the side of the catamaran, I have less chance of getting wet. I still transfer the same amount of momentum to it, but the hulls won\u2019t move so easily sideways. The momentum will be transferred to the water, and thence to the entire planet. If you jump to the kerb from a bus, the same thing applies. The friction of the tires on the road surface prevent the bus from moving sideways, so although you have the exact same momentum as when you stepped off the boat, and exerted the same force on it when you did so, the entire planet moves in the opposite direction. Since it\u2019s so massive, no-one notices, and as soon as you reach the kerb and stop, the momentum is transferred back again so that the entire sum of momentum of the planet plus you plus any boats, buses etc. remains constant.

            "answer_text": "The snarky answer is \u201cthe crew neglected to tie the boat to the \u201cshore\u201d or dock as they ought to have\u201d. But there's a better answer. Being on a boat calls all sorts of physics into play which we simply do not notice on shore. The principle here is \u201cfor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\u201d. On shore if I stand on, say, the deck of a stationary truck I can get to ground by pushing myself away from the truck. If the truck brakes or Park are on, it won't move. When I push myself off the boat to reach a solid surface, I am not only pushing myself toward the dock. I am also pushing against the boat, in my case with enough force to move 185 pounds away from the boat. If not held to shore, the boat is free to demonstrate \u201can equal and opposite reaction\u201d by moving away. Actually, theoretically we could get a light truck to do the same thing if in neutral on a flat, smooth surface. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the law of conservation of momentum says so. And, if you do not actually jump, you can weigh the boat like this. I have put a longer answer up about this, but it was a while ago. It is how you can weigh a boat with a ruler. Pull the boat up to the dock. Stand near the other end, and walk a measured distance towards the dock. The boat will move away from the dock. The distance you moved, (across the bottom, subtract the boats movement,) times your weight, equals the distance the boat moved, times its weight. Wind and current must be calm, of course. I have actually done this, with a big self dumping log barge (the Seaspan Rigger) that had lost an unknown amount of steel following a grounding on Edward King Island. I used a 14 ton Hyster fork lift that we drove down the length of the barge alongside the wharf at Esquimalt. There were likely inaccuracies, but it was sufficient to do the calculations needed to dock the ship for repair. This is real old time Naval Architect stuff! ",
