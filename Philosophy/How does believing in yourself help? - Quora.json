            "answer_text": "It's really quite simple. If you don't think you can do something, then why would you do it? When I began training to play football, some of the more experienced players came over to teach me how to lift. When we got to power cleans, I could barely pick up the bar off the ground. Some of the other guys were doing 2 or 3 plates on each side. For the uninitiated, that\u2019s 225 to 315 pounds. I couldn't do 95 pounds. I was discouraged, and always skipped power cleans when they came up in the workout rotation, because I simply didn't think I could do it. At the beginning of the next season, we had to test the maximum amount we could lift on each of our exercises, including power cleans, which I dreaded. However, after my coach showed me the proper technique, I was able to do 155 pounds with ease. I had been strong enough to lift 155 pounds the entire time, but I just didn't know it. I encounter similar situations all of the time, and whenever I think I can't do something, I think of power cleans. We usually live up to our own expectations. If you truly believe that you can succeed at something, then you will find a way. ",

            "answer_text": "The key to success in anything that you do is \u201cyou\u201d yourself. This is because, it is only you who knows what your strengths are and where your weaknesses lie. As a result, what may seem to be impossible to many may be possible for you because of the self-belief which comes from you knowing yourself well. The belief in self is more pronounced in situations which demand that you be on top of things or simply put do-or-die situations. This is on account of the fact that you back yourself to make the right decision because of your knowledge of self whence others are not too sure about it. Additionally, since it is a situation wherein you are running the show, it may not be possible for everyone to get the entire picture. Thus belief in yourself will go a long way when it comes to making tough decisions. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a psychological concept of Locus of Control. You either have an internal locus of control, or external locus of control. a person with an external locus of control has the limiting belief that they are in a sort, helpless. They have no influence on the events around them, and have no agency to control the world around them. They believe it\u2019s the external world that has power over them. A person with an internal locus of control believes that they can influence the outcome of the events around them. they believe it\u2019s them, and the strength to change the world comes from within, or internally. To believe in yourself is a euphemism for having an internal locus of control. In studies it\u2019s shown that people with an internal locus of control are more achievement oriented, which makes sense, right? If you have an external locus of control, you would not have motivation to go into the world since you have the limiting belief that you can\u2019t change anything. So to believe in yourself, is to active yourself to your own self-agency to be performative. That said, people with an external locus of control can be perfectly happy people. ",
