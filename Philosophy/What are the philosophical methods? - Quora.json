            "answer_text": "Philosophical method (or philosophical methodology) is the study of how to do philosophy. A common view among philosophers is that philosophy is distinguished by the ways that philosophers follow in addressing philosophical questions. There is not just one method that philosophers use to answer philosophical questions. Systematic philosophy attempts to provide a framework in reason that can explain all questions and problems related to human life. Examples of systematic philosophers include Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza and Hegel. In many ways, any attempts to formulate a philosophical method that provides the ultimate constituents of reality, a metaphysics, can be considered systematic philosophy. In modern philosophy the reaction to systematic philosophy began with Kierkegaard and continued in various forms through analytic philosophy, existentialism, hermeneutics, and deconstructionism. Some common features of the methods that philosophers follow (and discuss when discussing philosophical method) include: Methodic Doubt - a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs.Argument - provide an argument or several arguments supporting the solution.Dialetic - present the solution and arguments for criticism by other philosophers, and help them judge their own.Doubt and the sense of wonder Plato said that \"philosophy begins in wonder\", a view which is echoed by Aristotle: \"It was their wonder, astonishment, that first led men to philosophize and still leads them.\" Philosophizing may begin with some simple doubts about accepted beliefs. The initial impulse to philosophize may arise from suspicion, for example that we do not fully understand, and have not fully justified, even our most basic beliefs about the world. Formulate questions and problems Another element of philosophical method is to formulate questions to be answered or problems to be solved. The working assumption is that the more clearly the question or problem is stated, the easier it is to identify critical issues. A relatively small number of major philosophers prefer not to be quick, but to spend more time trying to get extremely clear on what the problem is all about. Enunciate a solution Another approach is to enunciate a theory, or to offer a definition or analysis, which constitutes an attempt to solve a philosophical problem. Sometimes a philosophical theory by itself can be stated quite briefly. All the supporting philosophical text is offered by way of hedging, explanation, and argument. Not all proposed solutions to philosophical problems consist of definitions or generalizations. Sometimes what is called for is a certain sort of explanation \u2014 not a causal explanation, but an explanation for example of how two different views, which seem to be contrary to one another, can be held at the same time, consistently. One can call this a philosophical explanation. Justify the solution An argument is a set of statements, one of which (the conclusion), it is said or implied, follows from the others (the premises). One might think of arguments as bundles of reasons \u2014 often not just a list, but logically interconnected statements \u2014 followed by the claim they are reasons for. The reasons are the premises, the claim they support is the conclusion; together they make an argument. Philosophical arguments and justifications are another important part of philosophical method. It is rare to find a philosopher, particularly in the Western philosophical tradition, who lacks many arguments. Philosophers are, or at least are expected to be, very good at giving arguments. They constantly demand and offer arguments for different claims they make. This therefore indicates that philosophy is a quest for arguments. A good argument \u2014 a clear, organized, and sound statement of reasons \u2014 may ultimately cure the original doubts that motivated us to take up philosophy. If one is willing to be satisfied without any good supporting reasons, then a Western philosophical approach may not be what one actually requires. ",

            "answer_text": "The predominant and most interesting method of Western Philosophy is the promotion of Reason as a way to discern Truth in any field. When Aristotle (pupil of Plato) applied this method to the Natural Sciences, he and his staff composed the first University level textbooks on: Analytical LogicPhysicsAstronomyGeologyBotanyBiologyZoologyAnatomyPsychology.All these textbooks were authoritative for over one thousand years. Scientists who improved upon these sciences continued to use Analytical Logic for their own methods. According to Kant, Aristotle's Analytical Logic remained authoritative for over two thousand years. But there is much more. Beyond Analytical Logic, Aristotle used Philosophy and the method of Reason to expand our knowledge of the Human Sciences as well. He and his staff also wrote the first University level textbooks on: MetaphysicsEthicsPoliticsRhetoricPoetryDramatic TheaterArt CriticismWorld HistoryThanks to Socrates-Plato-Aristotle, the method of Reason has illuminated civilization wherever it has obtained some contact. The method of Reason is Philosophy's most important method. The method of reasoning includes debate, though some distinguish debate (dialogue) as a separate method. ",
