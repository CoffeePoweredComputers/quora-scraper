            "answer_text": "Indeed we are part of nature. However, animals in the natural world don\u2019t actively perform acts that would be construed as being evil; however with primates there is room for such a possibility, as is seen quite often in Chimpanzees; our closest living relatives. When humans commit heinous acts however; its a calculated and deliberate act with the intent of causing as much harm as conceivably possible to an individual(s). The function of rape is different for humans as opposed to animals. In nature, rape is done with the intention of attempting to reproduce; individuals with undesirable traits have a greater challenge when it comes to finding a mate. As such, rape is the only way for them to ensure the continuation of their lineage. In humans, there is an additional component to the act of rape; it\u2019s performed with the intention of being dominant and controlling; most often by individuals who lack this aspect in their daily lives, and so seek to obtain it by effectively depriving others of it. That being said, everything we do is a choice governed by reason. Animals conduct their choices based on their instincts and act so accordingly. Unlike animals, humans possess sapience, which among other things, gives them the capacity to have insight into their actions and act with common sense accordingly. It is for this reason that human actions aren\u2019t considered to be natural, but deliberate and purposeful. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. That\u2019s an interesting perspective. Indeed, the consensus view among anthropologists now is that little of the Earth\u2019s land area remains pristine, or void of human re-engineering. (Even the Amazon rainforest now appears to be a human creation.) Here\u2019s what I said about human nature in my book: \u201c\u2026 it is just as possible that humans evolved from cooperative primates similar to the bonobo as that we evolved from chimpanzee-like, more violent ones. Indeed, the recently discovered fossil record of Ardipithecus ramidus suggests a more bonobo-like origin for humanity.[1]\u201d Also, the lost civilization of the Central Middle Ages was highly cooperative, with little violence or poverty. They attained a quality of life that, in many ways, we have still not recovered. Research is increasingly finding that the behavior of humans is far more influenced by our environment than most of us ever imagined. For example, raise a sociopathic child (it is a brain that lacks empathic function) in a violent environment, and a dangerous adult sociopath will result. But raise a sociopathic child in a loving, nurturing environment free of violence, and the resulting adult may be a highly productive member of society. (Example: the life of Dr. James Fallon.)

            "answer_text": "All animals behave according to their instinctual nature. Humans appear to be unique in that we ask ourselves about ourselves. (At least we presume we're unique because we have never established inter-species communication to the point of being able to ask other animals such a question. ) The nature of morality is in those questions. It is as much a part of our nature as social animals as the intricate dance bees do to communicate the location of a new source of food. The categorization between \"natural\" and \"manmade\" - the process of categorizing, not the categories themselves, are part of our nature. The value judgments OP has picked up on is the natural, socializing aspect of human behavior. So, yes, most human actions can be seen in animal actions - except for the decision process of what is moral and what is not. That\u2019s not to say social animals don\u2019t at times cast out individuals. It\u2019s just that we have no way of knowing if any moral judgement might be coming into play when they do. ",

            "answer_text": "Your thesis confuses the parts (components) of nature with its functions (the forces that act upon the parts). Structure and function in nature are different things, but are related.In science, especially biology, structures (forms) follow functions. This means that the forces of nature act upon matter (the parts) over time. This is the definition of work\u2014something was changed and a function was accomplished.These changes in matter (functions) produce anatomical and other structures and biological systems that allow humans (all organisms) to adapt to the changes in the environments where they live.The behavior of humans involves the use of its structures to fulfill the functions that nature needs us to perform in order to sustain our lives and perpetuate our species.Since natural forces create the functions to maintain our lives through the structures that nature shaped through our DNA and learning capabilities, among others\u2014we cannot escape our fundamental connections with nature.Bad behavior in science applies to the things we do that conflict with and are counterproductive to achieving the functions of adaptability that nature requires to sustain our lives. Well-being is a function of nature for us and all organisms, because it motivates us to engage in positive ways for attaining functional objectives in the most efficient manner.Thus, we are part of nature, the whole of it, as well as its functions. Bad behavior under this circumstance would not be functionally natural at any level of existence.Rampant bad behavior in a human population is self-destructive, and eventually leads to extinction of our kind. It is not natural\u2026but is certainly stupid.Nature\u2019s way of dealing with such miscreants is through natural selection where their genes get diluted and weeded out over time. So consider that those prone to bad behavior are akin to noxious weeds that get ousted when the trees move in that are better adapted.",

We can think logically, morally, socially, politically, scientifically, all at the same time. It also allows us to decide what is right and what is wrong. This has a great implication. It makes us much more responsible. Don' t forget, we have created nuclear weapons that can virtually wipe out everything that belongs to this world. Don't you think it\u2019s time to pull up our socks and feel the danger we are facing? So no, everything we do is not part of nature, even if it seems so! ",

Being aware of our behavior and our social constraints. we sometimes manage to do that. This is probably best seen in the progress we've made from ancient religious practices and tyranny to more liberal religions, scientific investigation into natural and social processes. and freedom, with a substantial swing away from dogmatic retribution, revenge, and capital punishment in our more modern, liberal religious and civil governing structures. We are still capable of evil, sometimes great evil \u2013 but we have the ability to refrain from committing them. We have the ability to foresee what behaviors would lead us to do better, and also which will lead us to do worse, and if we can discard our irrational attachment to tradition, we might be able to do that, too.
