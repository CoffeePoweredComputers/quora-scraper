            "answer_text": "I'd recommend Philippicae, a series of 14 speeches that were delivered against Mark Antony. They're funny, passionate, well done, and would be awesome to use against someone in your own life. And then read Plutarch's Life of Cicero and Life of Antony, as well as Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (for Antony's speech after the assassination) Other great ones are the Cataline Orations. Here's a short bit:  Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos eludet? Quem ad finem sese effrenata iactabit audacia? This is also where the famous \"O tempora, o mores!\" appears. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Josh, A very deep question. You are obviously a scholar of public speaking. The answer is a very definite RHETORIC. Cicero is one of the founders of this genre. A great book, if you want to follow this up, is Nathan Crick\u2019s \u201cRhetorical Public Speaking\u201d. Brilliant. Hope this helps, Paul ",
