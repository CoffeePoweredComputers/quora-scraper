            "answer_text": "Travelling Alone  There have been many days when I woke up in morning and things weren\u2019t the way I wanted, that\u2019s where I try to look into my past experiences and think about all the positive points I have achieved. These are the times when I pack my bags and travel to places I have never been to, I talk to people I have never met, hear them and their stories try to forget about my identity back home. I read somewhere \u2018Let all be lost. Let them take away everything. As long as you have your heart beating strong, as long as you have your nostrils working fine, as long as the blood flows in your veins, you will live, you will breathe and you can get it all back\u2026 again and again. For, if you can do it once, you can damn well do it again. It\u2019s just a game we play \u2013 Life\u2019. Every word is true for those who want to travel, want to lost among the crowd, just don\u2019t make plans every summers, execute them. Travel the places you have always thought of. Last year I travelled to various cities of South India, A road journey. Starting from Madhurai and ending at Madhurai. On the first leg, I travelled from Madhurai to Rameshwaram, mind boggling journey that will always have a special place in my heart. Madhurai is known for its temples, I will discuss about Madhurai in one of the next article. I was heading towards Rameshwaram, the birthplace of APJ Abdul Kalam and one of the most important pilgrimage place to Hindus all over the world. Travelling through small towns, villages and lush green fields I was enjoying slight drizzle. Just like a kid, I was super excited to reach an Island for the first time, passing by the world famous Pamban Bridge (Yeah, Chennai Express Bridge). I have always dreamt about visiting all those places I have heard, read, seen in various Ramayana Adaptation. The Famous Temples, the end point of India in Bay of Bengal. I was told to wake up at 3:30 AM for the temple, I woke on time and visited the entire temple, it took around 3-4 Hours. A relaxing experience. Architectural designs that will surely attract your attention covered the entire temple premises, the smell that would all follow you throughout the city. Walking towards the ocean and taking a dip, and completing all the rituals. All of it was a beautiful experience.  (A random restaurant, they have really good vegetarian food )  (Pamban Bridge, The railway line below, really windy and cool breeze.)  (Ever changing weather, it was sunny few seconds ago !! )  (Amazing road to Rameshwaram, passing through old railway lines and woods) After visiting the holy temple early morning, I left for Dhanushkodi, it is a must visit if you are in Rameshwaram, the place is extremely beautiful, fishing boats and nets all around and the small town which was destructed by a Cyclone in 1964. The route from Rameshwaram to Dhanushkodi is simply amazing, passing through dense jungles, ruins of old railway lines and small villages. Locals selling hand made products made from shells, fishes, fresh coconuts and variety of stones. This place has a soul, a calm soul, which not only pulls people who love silence but all of those who love nature, undisturbed by the interference of Human Products.  (Small villages near the sea, mostly fishermen families)  (Trying to capture myself, a failed attempt.)  (The ruins of the old city of Dhanushkodi, cyclone in 1964)  (The beautiful blue water, I was trying to see the horizon beyond the sea) While I was going back from Dhanushkodi, I started conversing with my driver, he was 27 years old. He asked me where all I have been to ? I was very happy to see his politeness and way of speaking, I answered all of his questions. He was from a middle class family, his father passed away when he was a 22, studying and doing part time work in a travel agency. His name was Shiva. Shiva shared his dream to travel around the country, he said \u201cit\u2019s always not about success or money, we spend all of our health (lives) on earning money and later on in our lives we spend all the money on our health(lives), my father did the same, we spent all of his hard earned money on his health, I have enough for myself and would surely enjoy my short life\u201d. I learn from these conversations, such conversations makes me believe happiness comes not from having much to live on, but having much to live for. I saw small kids selling fishes on the roadsides, shining eyes and holding small fishes, helping their mothers. Later I went to visit the birthplace of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, it was house turned into a museum. Amazing place, a powerful source of inspiration to lot of students. The entire trip was an breathtaking experience, right from standing on the road bridge, facing the strong oceanic winds, watching a train slowly pass by the Pamban bridge to taking an early morning dip in the sea. Visiting the less explored Dhanushkodi, which is very near to the neighbouring Srilanka. Local temples, and the birthplace of our former president. Rameshwaram, not only meant for religious people but all of those who want to visit less explored places. Its been a paradigm shifting experience for me, I have grown as a person towards a positive end and would surely keep following it. ",

            "answer_text": "I am experiencing a paradigm shift in my research right now. I am interested in evolution, especially of single celled life, and I have found that existing theories explain it to a large extent in the opposite directions. Therefore a paradigm shift is unavoidable in biological evolution theory. Today it is dominated by the endosymbiosis theory, which states that mitochondria and chloroplasts invaded a eukaryote to become organelles. This theory is a headache each day for researchers trying to explain various observations. There is however a much better way to explain it. Instead of positing that bacteria invaded eukaryotes, I posit that the organelles were created in eukaryotes, some of them escaped from their host and became bacteria. Thereby the origin of bacteria is also explained and a lot of problems are avoided. The theory that explains this, the Organelle Escape Theory, will be a paradigm shift in association with the Eukaryote Extension Theory, which explains how eukaryotes occurred. The theories are evaluated and found to be much better than existing theories. The endosymbiosis theory is also disproved. Many project will be very much simplified. ",
