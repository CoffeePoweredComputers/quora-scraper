            "answer_text": "This is what happens at the point of death, according to the Bhagavata Purana. If you have been very good and pious, you will upon leaving the body be led to the planets of the demigods - the heavenly planets. There you will enjoy for millions of years before you again will be born on earth as a human. On the heavenly planets you enjoy basically as you do on earth - sex, drugs and rock-n-roll - but it takes place on a subtle plane, the astral plane as some call it. You are in a subtle body - a psychic, finer physical body that doesn't exude excretions. IOW, you don't perspire, fart or stink. In heaven there are heavenly society girls, who are extremely beautiful. In fact, it says they make earthly women look like crows. There is the soma-drink - an intoxication that makes you feel good and prolongs life. The music is delivered by the gandharvas - some sort of angles who are the musicians of the heavenly planets. On the heavenly planets there is no disease or old age, but eventually you die and fall back to a human body on earth. Now, at the point of death, if you have been very cruel and evil not caring or empathizing with other living entities, you will be picked up by the Yamadhutas, the messengers of Yamaraja - the god of Death - and taken to the hellish planets, where you will be tortured and undergo purgatory for what feels like eternity. Like on the heavenly planets, it happens on a subtle, astral plane, so a moment can feel like a long, long time - like in a dream. After having ended your prescribed suffering, you will again be born on earth, but not necessarily from a human womb. You can be born in any of the 8.400.000 species of life. If you have just been an ordinary, somewhat decent human, neither too good nor too evil, like people are most, at the point of death you will fall into a deep sleep and stay like that for 7 months after which you'll wake up and find yourself tied up in a womb. The situation for the fetus is full of pain and distress. You are in full consciousness but you are totally bound up and gagged, it's like being bound up very tightly in a sack. If you are lucky, you will remember everything you did to land you in this particular womb, why you will be born to certain parents. Then after 2 months of such hell you are squeezed out of a hole much too little for you, and born in shock into total forgetfulness. The foster state is described in the Bhagavat Purana in great detail. If, however, you have practiced spiritual life and think of Krishna at the time of death, you will return to the spiritual world in your original constitution of eternity, knowledge and bliss. Or you will be born in some universe on some planet where Krishna has descended to reveal His pastimes. When that period has ended, you will return with Krishna to Goloka either as one of His friends, His girl-friends or as His elder in a parental mood. The choice is yours. Where ever you go after death will be according to how you formed your mental body. The mental or the psychic body is formed after the activities of your gross, physical body and the mentality you have been cultivating. Krishna says: And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt. (Bg. 8.5) Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kunti, that state he will attain without fail. (Bg 8.6)  ",

            "answer_text": "Logically speaking Heaven and Hell obviously wouldn\u2019t exist, but people have the right of believing in them as their religion tells them so. As for how would they look, Qu\u2019ran describes Heaven as this: \u201cAnd give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, \u2018This is what we were provided with before.\u2019 And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.\u201d (Q. 2:25) \u201cTheir Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and approval and of gardens for them wherein is enduring pleasure. [They will be] abiding therein forever. Indeed, Allah has with Him a great reward.\u201d (Q. 9:21-22) \u201cThose will have gardens of perpetual residence; beneath them rivers will flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining therein on adorned couches. Excellent is the reward, and good is the resting place.\u201d (Q. 18:31) So basically Heaven is the place of the afterlife where good people who believed and did righteous deeds in this world will go as a \u201creward\u201d for their faith. It\u2019s extraordinarily beautiful and it has everything a believer would need to have a perfect life. As for Hell, Qu\u2019ran says: The description of Jahannam as a place of blazing fire appears in almost every verse in the Qur'an describing hell. Jahannam is described as being located below heaven, having seven gates, each for a specific group or at least a different \"portion\" or \"party\" of sinners. The Quran also mentions wrongdoers having \"degrees (or ranks) according to their deeds\" which some scholars believe refers to the seven gates.The one mention of levels of hell is that hypocrites will be found in its very bottom. \"...fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith\" (2:24). \"...Enough is Hell for a burning fire. Those who reject Our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire... For Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise\" (4:55-56). \"But he whose balance (of good deeds) is found to be light, will have his home in a (bottomless) Pit. And what will explain to you what this is? A Fire blazing fiercely!\" (101:8-11). ",

We will all find out eventually but everything is pure speculation. many people and many books written have descriptions but isn\u2019t it fascinating how imaginative the human mind is? As far as if there is Heaven or hell\u2026The concept of a omnipresent, omnipotent, celestial entity that can read everyone\u2019s thoughts and keep tabs on everyone\u2019s good deeds and bad deeds is a hard sell, for me at least. I know and everyone else knows there is no Santa clause but a celestial entity that has the same omnipresence and knowledgeable of everyone\u2019s doings is somehow supposed to be worshipped, and feared, and loved or else you burn for eternity? isn\u2019t it crazy how the geographical area you are born and raised in could have you molded and raised to conform to a certain set of beliefs and spirituality, but if your born on the other side of the planet you will have a completely different set of beliefs and culture? Man has always been searching for answers, and that\u2019s where the great imagination comes in. That and throughout history each group of humans survival is best achieved through numbers, and the best way to do so is to get everyone on the same page and belief system together, what better way than religion?
