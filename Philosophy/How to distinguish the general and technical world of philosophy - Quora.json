            "answer_text": "General would be about the basic questions and speculation where technical is method, conclusion, or proof like mathematical logic. The former might be seen as what is the same across approaches and the latter what is different. Philosophy can also be referred to in the sense of learning, writing, or research, so there are general and technical sides to those often also about distinct terminology and method in each field. Translating from the originals is also a technical problem. Science became much more technical as did technology. That allowed them to be predictive. Ironically the senses were considered more specific than ideals at first, and then later they were bypassed through machines. Now computation and statistics often surpass argument and theory. How can code be as descriptive as text? Ethics looks at what science and tech should be concerned by. For example issues of determinism and control from cybernetics to autonomous systems. Spirituality seemed to go the way of metaphysics though transhumanists have recently brought such discussion into areas like artificial general intelligence. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the terms you\u2019re looking for are analytical vs continental philosophy. Analytical leans more towards pure logical reasoning free from existential or relative worldviews. This concept is closely tied to the logical positivist movement. Take Russell\u2019s paradox as an example. When the set of all sets cannot be a member of itself. \u201cLet R be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. If R is not a member of itself, then its definition dictates that it must contain itself, and if it contains itself, then it contradicts its own definition as the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.\u201d - Wikipedia The popularity of mathematical logic inspired Saul Kripke to developed a symbolic system of logic. In what\u2019s known today as Kripke semantics, this classical system of logic gave birth to the modal formula and a family of other logical formulas that have been added since. Continentalism leans more towards metaphysics, historicity, and ontology. To a continentialist subjectivity plays an essential role in its outlook thus philosophy cannot be separated from human experience, its history, and socio-cultural identity. This idea evolved from specific philosophical movements such as existentialism, post-structuralism, and phenomenology. The term commonly refers to Western ideologies but it can also be contrasted with many Eastern philosophies, such as legalism, confucianism, and some shinto sects. So there essentially the same subject but asking two fundamentally different questions: S believes that P, becomes what is the nature of S to P? Or a better explanation might be Marcus Aurelius. \u201cFor every thing we must ask what is this, fundamentally? What is its nature and substance, its reason for being?\" ",
