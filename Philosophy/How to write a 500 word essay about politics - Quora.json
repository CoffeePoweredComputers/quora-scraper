            "answer_text": "Always plan your essay first: it will save heaps of time! Break up every single concept/topic into key parts with subtitles to make your points clearer; use your question as a pointer towards what depth and range of questions you will have to cover. Don\u2019t spend too long on one point and make sure your points develop in a logical order e.g. background/context \u2014-importance\u2014- interpretation (yours or someone else\u2019s)\u2014-quotes or sources to back your claim\u2014\u2014 mini-conclusion. Then hint at next paragraph to make your essay flow - this is really important, you wouldn\u2019t suddenly talk about babies and then discuss trains without something to link these topics. I usually categorise the answers to different questions into a schematic action plan. (Just to be clear - you get the subtitles from questions you have derived from the essay title and question.) Small concepts or arguments: description or background info, time+ context, key facts, arguments/ implications etc. Processes: e.g. how the election system works, or how Mao transformed China etc. Medium (sized) concepts or arguments: more depth/ context, time, key facts, impact, changes to political views etc. Larger concepts or arguments: covers more background in less depth, general facts, conclusions, larger data summations, trends and how its impact shaped political views to this day etc. Include references for essays always if this is formal/ submitted to an exam board. Try to use objective+ formal syntax at all times. Hope this is helpful! ",
