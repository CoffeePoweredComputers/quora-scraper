            "answer_text": "The definitions for faith, religion, a system of beliefs, and spirituality are going to vary quite a bit depending upon whom you ask. The dictionary definitions of these things are generally unhelpful for differentiating them - and yet, as used by people describing religious and transcendental practices and experiences, it\u2019s clear that there are different contexts for these four things. Here\u2019s my take on the four terms: Faith - Having faith is different than practicing a faith tradition (see: religion). Having faith is placing certainty or belief into something for which you have insufficient grounds for belief. For instance, if I buy a lotto ticket and am convinced that I\u2019ve picked the winning numbers, this is a form of faith. As it applies to religion, faith is the belief in something that is apparently impossible (e.g. miracles) or for which there is poor supporting evidence (e.g. creation myths). Note that colloquially, faith isn\u2019t always used in this sense. It is not uncommon to say something like, \u201cI have faith that Bob will be on time.\u201d - but this meaning is often the opposite of what I\u2019ve described above, because your faith is based upon past instances where Bob has been on time or pulled through in a crisis situation. Be aware of this conflation of terms, because debate opponents will often switch between the different meanings of faith in an attempt to trip you up. Religion - Religions are also sometimes called \u201cfaith traditions\u201d, which are sometimes shortened to \u201cfaiths\u201d, but religion and faith aren\u2019t the same thing. Religions have some sort of component of faith, but they also have a practice element to them (i.e. there are certain things you have to do), and religions universally have some sort of doctrine, whether passed on through oral tradition or in a holy text. In other words, religions are systems of faith that are organized around practices and doctrines. This gets everybody on the same page, so to speak, and can act as a unifying factor within the community. Conversely, differences in practice and doctrine between different religions can be quite divisive. Religion often has a spiritual aspect (see \u2018spirituality\u2019 below), but need not do so (e.g. atheist Quakers). Belief (system) - A belief is some proposition about the world that you think is true (e.g. \u201cI believe the sky is blue\u201d or \u201cI believe Jesus was resurrected\u201d) regardless of the evidence for it. That is, you can believe things on faith, you can believe them based on evidence, or on whatever other criterion you come up with for assessing truth. A belief system is a group of interrelated beliefs that come as a package deal. For instance, it would be very unusual for somebody to believe in Noah\u2019s flood, but to reject the stories of Adam and Eve or Abraham, as well. It can happen, but such a belief would be highly idiosyncratic, as it would straddle belief systems. Spirituality - Spirituality consists of beliefs and practices that deal with spirits or the transcendental. Some spiritual practices (e.g. intercessory prayer) require the belief that you have a literal spirit or soul that is in communion with other spirits (e.g. God\u2019s). Sometimes, spirituality refers to phenomena that transcend our everyday conscious experiences without necessarily involving spirits - e.g. transcendental meditation and psychedelic experiences can be understood as material phenomena, but are generally considered spiritual. There are quite a few people who consider themselves spiritual but not religious. These are people who have faith in one or more spiritual phenomena (e.g. karma, astral projection, psychic healing, etc.) without necessarily adhering to a single religion or belief system. So my take on it is that the four are different, overlapping concepts. As an atheist who suspects there\u2019s nothing beyond the physical world, I have no religion and no faith. My beliefs I try to base off of evidence rather than faith. And my spirituality is restricted to the pursuit of transcendental experiences that I understand not to involve literal spirits. ",

            "answer_text": "These are capsules, not exhaustive answers, that have been helpful in distinguishing among these terms. (BTW: \u201cbetween\u201d applies to only two options; \u201camong\u201d for three or more.) \u201cFaith is not belief in spite of evidence. Faith is action despite the consequences.\u201d \u201cSpirituality is the staircase ascending toward the Divine. Religion is the handrail.\u201d A religion is also a belief system , but not all belief systems are religious. Many of them are social , heart of secular traditions, and have to do with the roles that we perceive differences between\u2026err, among\u2026 human beings create. A belief system is a construct to shortcut decision making. It helps me decide when I need to do so quickly or in an overly complex situation. However, I must always be willing to challenge or alter my beliefs when they are not bringing me the result I desire. A man's belief system, perhaps arising from his religion, may lead him to be authoritarian, critical, demanding, and controlling in his home; expecting that this will lead to his family feeling happy and valued, loving and safe. Instead they feel demeaned, frustrated, invalidated, and enslaved to serve his whims. He may escalate his exercise of his beliefs to establish control, even feeling justified to do violence to enforce his role. His belief that he is the man of the house results in his either being the man out of the house, or the man of an empty house. In such a case, he may wish to challenge his own belief system a la' Dr Phil: \u201cHow's that working for you?\u201d Belief systems may be strong, but sometimes reality just refuses to cooperate, and it is easier to change my belief system than to change the universe. Belief systems can be valuable to help people find common ground or make their way in a complex world, but remember that they can be changed with experience or new knowledge. The alternative is deliberate ignorance. ",
