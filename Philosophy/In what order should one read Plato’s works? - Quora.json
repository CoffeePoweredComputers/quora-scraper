            "answer_text": "The usual way to start is with the trilogy on the death of Socrates: Apology; Crito; Phaedo. The first will give you a vivid idea of the conflict between democracy and philosophy; the second will establish that social contract theory is a very old idea; the third will present the Platonic case for soul/body dualism and the immortality of the former. The trilogy is, it seems to me, a fine way to start. Beyond that, here\u2019s another trilogy: The Republic; Protagoras; Parmenides. When you\u2019ve read all this, you\u2019ll have a sound grounding and you can let your own curiosity (and the secondary works you will by then want to read) take you from there. Enjoy the trip. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of his writings are not in any chronological order so there is not any actual required order. I myself starting reading his works somewhat out of order and have noticed you\u2019re left wondering what some of the terms mean if you weren\u2019t previously exposed; don\u2019t start with Laws is my point. I myself started with the Republic and then went to Laws after that read Statemen and then Sophist. I will begin after I finish the book I am currently reading an anthology released through Penguin Classics of his early writings titled \u201cThe Last Days of Socrates\u201d which includes Euthypro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo. I guess that would put me just about half way through his works and almost completely through his major works. ",
