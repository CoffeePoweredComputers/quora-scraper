            "answer_text": "If you were to choose among the philosophical perspective when it comes to art. What would it be and why Explain the connection? Great question, Mine is the pursuit of excellence in beauty. The closer the artist comes to perfecting the beautiful and lovely, the more aesthetic value the art has - in my opinion. I can say without a doubt that art that will actually stand the test of time and be held in high esteem needs to be something that is lovely and beautiful; and if it is, then it is the exact opposite of Crime! Why? Because beautiful art enhances culture with an enchantment that is not found in ugly art, which may have a certain historical value, or other qualities that gives it a perceived aesthetic value. The natural tendency for people to fall in love with flowers, pretty birds, or kittens is what is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes and all of the senses for that matter. In contrast, looking at a Black Widow Spider, a Rat, or a fresh pile of garbage with maggots crawling through it, is not a pleasant experience, at least to a great majority of people, unless they have a morbid sense of humor. Because not everyone can make beautiful or lovely art in large enough quantities to please art dealers, ugly art is more prevalent, perhaps simply because the artist can make lots of them in a single day. It is easier to promote and sell anything there\u2019s lots of, rather than something unique or there are not very many of. Yet, art that looks like someone just cleaned up a mess with a rag, or threw a pizza on the floor, is meaningless to those people who love flowers, pretty birds and kittens etc. - because it\u2019s not lovely or beautiful. The art market is made up of of what the art dealers choose to celebrate for money, and what the ignorant and ill-informed people demand. In the same manner that people go to automobile races to see the wrecks, most egotists like the \u201craised eye-brow\u201d more than they do beauty. Some adolescents are over 50 years of age and they have money to burn on the idea of \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses\u201d and \u201cone-up\u2019s-man-ship!\u201d Therefore they often prefer the so called \u201cNon-objective Expressionism\u201d that doesn\u2019t take a dextral genius to make, more than what is truly lovely. It\u2019s amazing to me that some people will spend $20,000 on a fantastic sofa and then hang a picture that looks like a used diaper on the wall beside it! \u201cOuch!\u201d Sorry about that. Wait, you\u2019re chuckling at nothing yet! Wait till you see the painting hanging over their dinning room table! Yea, and when their friends come over for dinner, they will even stand beside them and turn their heads and squint their eyes with them, while they explain \u201cThe Emperors new clothes,\u201d or how this fabulous Masterpiece was made by an \u201cInternational Living Treasure of a genius.\u201d Meanwhile, the dinner guests are about as happy to look at it as if they saw a big rat run across the floor - \u201cYuck!\u201d It\u2019s not enough that the \u201cBlow-hard\u201d rich bullies play such parlor games, but that it is then copied, echoed, or mimicked at the other echelons in society, all the way down to the lower levels of small midwestern town suburbia and influences the Handicrafts market also, in not such a pleasant way. A genuine William DeKooning may have some real value, but a copy of a copy-cat\u2019s take on what a good Abstract is - is perhaps the most wasted art materials on the planet! I\u2019m Loren Adams and I stand for realistic beauty and the re-enchantment of the world.  C@2020 \u201cThe Lady Linda, sailing out of the darkness into the light\u201d \u00a92020 Loren Adams \u201cThe nature of beauty is one of the most enduring and controversial themes in Western philosophy, and is\u2014with the nature of art\u2014one of the two fundamental issues in philosophical aesthetics. Beauty has traditionally been counted among the ultimate values, with goodness, truth, and justice.\u201d ~ Author and Citation Information for \"Beauty\" The latest version of the entry \"Beauty\" may be cited via the earliest archive in which this version appears: Sartwell, Crispin, \"Beauty\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N.
