            "answer_text": "Can you clarify the question? Are you asking if all true beliefs are justified? This is plainly not the case - conjectures might be right but aren't justified.  Are you asking if the \"justified true belief\" account of knowledge is accurate? Again there is reason to be skeptical from getter type counter examples where you have beliefs that are justified and true but you are only right by chance (ie your belief doesn't track the truth in similar situations).

            "answer_text": "No. By \"knowledge\", you implicitly mean empirical facts. No empirical fact, from the nature of the self to the nature of reality, can be understood with perfect confidence. Hume established this, Kant tried to cheat around it and got caught.  If you have aesthetic or value precepts, I'd say that most philosophers would agree that certainty that those ideas are what you believe and want to hold onto is fair. ",
