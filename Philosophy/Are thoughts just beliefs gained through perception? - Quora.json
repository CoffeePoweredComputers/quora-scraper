            "answer_text": "Basically: no. When you think/feel that a statement is true, it is useful to investigate, distinguish, be aware of your basis, on what ground you think it is true. The main possibilities of the bases are: perception, logical thinking (deduction or induction), a trustworthy authority (others) said so, a teaching/indoctrination, a gut feeling, inability to think differently, a belief without any perceptional/materialistic support or even contrary to (even your own) everyday experience. Belief in its narrow sense is a diametrical opposite of perception. If you perceive sg, there is no need to believe; belief is a last resort when you have not enough empirical and logical rationale. In the wide sense you might say that if you know sg, you also believe it, but this sense does not help to see clearly the possible origins of your assertions, it would just confuse you. Beliefs are firm convictions, whereas thoughts can be discussed, changed, you can be convinced to think the contrary. Thoughts might be hypothetical, guesses, expectations; you might be able to aware of multiple possibilities and give more or less probability in your expectation, whereas a belief is jealous, the one and only. Thoughts do not provide you with the (possibly false) sense of security, so if you want comfort, assurance, rock-solid confidence, and despise/dread the inherent refutability/falsifiability of the scientific knowledge, you always want to be sure that you are right, then believe. Thoughts are much closer to perception, logical/rational thinking, whereas beliefs are independent from experiences, should not be given up, no matter what happens. For thoughts/knowledge you can require to be evidence based, whereas beliefs can be, used to be, must be maintained without questioning them. If you try to base your belief on evidence and accept the requirement that you would give up your belief if your experience would contradict the belief, then your belief is not firm, is not a belief, then you do not trust the authority that told you your belief, and you are like the non-believers, in disguise. Through perception you can gain data, hypotheses, you can count occurences, relative frequency, you can try formulating models, theories, but not beliefs. Beliefs are gained through teaching/preaching, your own interest to believe, because it is easier/happier to live with beliefs, complying/belonging to your community. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings Lawson, I feel thoughts are more than just personal perceptions we have gathered from our experiences. A writer, poet, artist, sage or just our daydreaming brings idle thoughts/inspiration to us. Many of of us (mortal humans) fail to realize that we are in touch with the Universal consciousness of the Universe; a collective consciousness. Just as we see thousands of birds flying in what we would call aerial acrobatics, instantly turning left and right as they swoop up down without colliding into each other; it is their collective consciousness which assists them to intuitively know what the other birds are about to do. When we are in-tune with ourselves and can distinguish our thoughts from one another, we can then realize that they are coming from the Universal consciousness of the Universe; a collective consciousness. All we have to do is stop and listen to our intuitive nature; it is in this stillness where we receive thoughts outside of our normal range of awareness. ",

We live in a soup of nothingness until our senses begin to receive input, perceive it, memorize it, recall and ponder it when we want to. Our \u201cthoughts\u201d are a conglomerate of those cognitive faculties that our complex brain employs to make sense of and guide us through our surroundings. They are what has allowed us to survive as long as we have. So, the \u201cthoughts\u201d themselves are developments of perception, meaning that without perception there is nothing to think about while \u201cbeliefs\u201d are conscious determinations (beliefs) based on those thoughts, making the lineage; perceptions-thoughts-beliefs\u2026at least in a sane world.

In addition to perception, one\u2019s mind is capable of playing \u201cmix and match\u201d with perceptions, whether those embody beliefs acquired from other sources or personal experiences (including dreaming or imaginary ones). There is, also, the function of associationism, thoughts that share some common element tend to arise together, even if the commonality is marked contrast. One must also bear in mind that much thinking goes on below conscious processing, so thoughts are often not connected to real-time events. ",
