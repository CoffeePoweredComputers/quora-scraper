            "answer_text": "No. It reflects low moral fibre - the herd mentality - a failure to stand up and be counted - a fear of standing out from the crowd. It paves the way forward for cowards and bullies. It\u2019s responsible for alcoholism, drugs, crime, bad driving habits, sexism, racism and all sorts of other anti-social or socially destructive behaviour. When you say \u201ca valid reason\u201d, I take it you mean \u201can excuse\u201d. The whole point of ethics and morals is to set the standard that the society in which a person lives is expected to meet. By setting those standards, the society has already decided the issue. Everyone is expected to meet those standards. And frankly, anyone who doesn\u2019t want to meet the standards that society sets should go and live somewhere else. The reason for many of the laws we have is that some people do NOT want to behave in an ethical or moral manner. So they have to be forced to. It is also a large part of the reason for our police force and other law enforcement agencies. A long while ago, I spent 8 years of my life in a law enforcement role, responsible for the administration and enforcement of the laws which applied in this state at the time, regulating companies and the behaviour of their directors and other officers. (Those laws were later taken over by the Federal government - at the time when I was involved, they were state laws). And when I commenced in that role, little or nothing had been done to enforce the law. So I was confronted with a huge mess, where company directors etc either weren\u2019t fully aware of what they were expected to do - or did know, and simply didn\u2019t care - just wanted to do as they pleased. Things changed very smartly when I started prosecuting them for breaching the law. And by the time I left, corporate crime at any serious level had \u201cre-located\u201d to other parts of the country. What I found particularly distasteful was the number of times people tried to interfere with my power to prosecute such breaches - and the identity of some of the people who tried it. ",

            "answer_text": "Is \"everyone else is doing it\" a valid reason for unethical and immoral behavior? \u201cEveryone else is doing it\u201d is not itself a reason for any behavior. However if the behavior itself is not criminal, not against any code of ethics I\u2019ve sworn to uphold, not immoral per my gigantically driving and minutely considered and examined conscience and lights, then the fact it may be illegal in another country, or against someone else\u2019s code of ethics, or the fact another may consider it immoral is no reason for me not to do it. Mind you in the latter case, I\u2019m keen to see the wrong they see, and often ask! Good discussions all around. You do realize individuals are not bound to doctors\u2019, researchers\u2019, lawyers\u2019, accountants\u2019, educators\u2019 ethics when they are not doctors, researchers, lawyers, accountants or educators? These are higher standards of conduct than are relevant to the general public. The public entrusts these professionals with their lives and health, their case at law, their finances, their children, in ways that open up areas of potential abuse. Risks which the code of ethics is there to address. It\u2019s a sales job on the public confidence: to reassure them their public trusts are not misplaced. To assure them \u201cwe see the specific risks entailed, and have sworn to uphold and enforce a higher standard.\u201d A standard it would be ludicrous to apply to others, where those specific risks do not exist - hence \u201chigher standard.\u201d Higher in a way that is purposeful and apt. A professor having sex with the customers is concerning in a way an auto mechanic having sex with the customers is not, presuming all involved are adults. There is a dynamic of power and influence in the former case that creates the concern. I can tell right from wrong. Some people who claim this and that are moral or immoral literally can\u2019t. What they say is wrong - what\u2019s wrong with it? What does it risk, damage, diminish, destroy? What they say is right, what good is it? What does it create, enable, support, protect? If you can tell right from wrong, these questions have answers. The risks of wrong and benefits of right are considerable and demonstrable. \u201cTell\u201d at the very least means \u201csay,\u201d if you mean to tell another. Another\u2019s idea of immorality is wrong for me and immoral for me if they share it and share why - they can indeed say what\u2019s wrong with what they call wrong - and I can see yes, this is considerable, demonstrable wrong. Otherwise? Otherwise, let\u2019s just observe a person is free to find and value their own goods. To derive their right and wrong by what furthers or opposes those goods. Fair enough. If someone says something\u2019s immoral and they have no idea why, that\u2019s on them. They\u2019re free to abhor and avoid it. I won\u2019t say they\u2019re immoral. They\u2019ve got their own compass. If they can read it, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s cryptic and unreadable to others. Morality\u2019s deepest and highest purpose is self-control, not to command, control, coerce and condemn others. We are not exactly helpless, at the mercy of others\u2019 morality. Law is a subset of morality, in its criminal code. It contains all the worst, most wrong, most immoral acts - acts so wrong even the general public can see \u201cWow, that\u2019s so bad we need to hire help to punish even ourselves if we do it.\u201d Beyond the high, dotty line of law, we are all free to attempt\u2026anything. Able to follow and so hone (in ownership of consequence) our own conscience, and not subject to another\u2019s. These are both great goods, and hard to say which is the greater. Another cannot judge or punish you. Only we all can, only by the hired help, only for one of the listed judgeable, punishable acts, only via due process. Good setup. But no, \u201ceverybody else is doing it\u201d is no reason for anyone to do anything. Just like \u201cnobody else is doing it\u201d is no reason not to. Just like \u201ceverybody else is doing it\u201d is no reason not to. If you want reasons not to do something, you\u2019re going to have to go deeper than a popularity survey. ",
