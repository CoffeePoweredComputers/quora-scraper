            "answer_text": "The central distinction Heidegger makes concerning technology is that the Being of technology is, in it\u2019s being, is a collapsing of distance. In other words the more technological something is the faster, the easier, the closer\u2026etc. Heidegger warned that the danger is that Being conceals itself in it\u2019s nearness. Thus the more technological we are the more the Being of our being is concealed and forgotten in it\u2019s nearness. He referred to our age technology as a \u201cdark time\u201d. A dark time, according to Heidegger, is not a time in which people are saying to themselves \u201cthis is a dark time\u201d. Rather the very darkness lay in that no one is noticing the darkness. In other words the darkness is \u201cin the dark\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "In \u201cThe Question Concerning Technology\u201d he says that the reduction of distances brings us no closer to things. He is partly reflecting on the failure of both the Americans and the Nazis to use technology to help people. His only comment on the Holocaust was toward the end of his life, when he said that agriculture and the gas chambers are two parts of the same system. In other words, because modern agriculture relies on a massive amount of wealth held in reserve, a massive amount of waste is also produced, for the purpose of driving profits. This is also true in economics (standing reserve of labor) and in nuclear strategy. The Jews killed by the policies of bureaucrats like Heidegger and Goebbels represented this portion of \u201creserve\u201d to the state, just like the leftover food thrown away by restaurants and farms as an everyday part of capitalism. Many commentators saw this comment of Heidegger\u2019s, made in Der Spiegel around 1976, to be a cowardly shifting of blame away from himself, but it is consistent with his career-long condemnation of Bestand (reserve as fiscal policy). Another example of the use of reserve, described by Fran\u00e7ois Ewald, a French Heideggerian, is the policy of mandatory insurance, as with auto insurance. This decreases the need for personal care and responsibility, because it makes an automatic accommodation for accidents. ",
