That\u2019s not just Narcs but a lot of our younger generations just don\u2019t see it the way it used to be. It\u2019s all about ghosting and moving on but not ever deleting numbers. I am guilty of some of this behavior myself. It\u2019s easy to do. But morally it\u2019s wrong. Don\u2019t take a person and demand they commit to only you while you toy them along. Be open and honest about what you want and things typically work out without anyone being scarred or hurt beyond normal. Now there is also the Narc that will then be grand with you as his dedicated arm candy. Raising his stature up and feeding that ever present need they have to be adored and envied. Also guilty of some of these behaviors too. Of course I want to show off my beautiful partner. But I\u2019m not demanding any of my partners do anything above their normal. Sweats and tank or sexy dress is no different to me. We all have Narc traits so just pay attention to how you feel in your gut when they\u2019re around. Them butterflies acting really really crazy is not usually a good thing all the time. It\u2019s anxiety and doubt mixed with euphoria and elaborate future dreams. It\u2019s dangerous when you allow someone who has severe Narc traits or full blown NPD the keys to your life and dreams. Imagine it was your dream car in mint condition they drove off in and returned with a totaled car and said here ya go. Someone smashed into me, here\u2019s their information, good luck and goodbye forever. Like wtf kind of person would take your trust and smash it to pieces and not even attempt to help put it back Together. Or to repair it. They just wanna find the next flashy new car driving nice person to repeat the same actions. They don\u2019t grow or care to grow and will never appreciate any pointers concerns or criticisms without a full blown tantrum. if it feels too fast and sudden listen to your body and feelings. And then look at it logically. Relationships with my horse people can succeed if you\u2019re willing to take some random shit and drama down the line. It\u2019s about how much of that shit can you handle. You can\u2019t do what they do that causes you hurt because that\u2019s a slight and you\u2019ll be discarded surely. But if you take it and accept that fate they will lrovide some good things here and thereZ ",
