            "answer_text": "Determinism* is flawed and makes a number of false assumptions, the worst being that even human behavior is predetermined. In fact, this answer will show, no one who understands its full implications really believes in it or can\u2014and their own behavior demonstrates it. Further, the determinist has no rational basis for dismissing the volition of the human mind and the role of the self in directing one\u2019s own thoughts. The very act of making arguments in favor of determinism shows that they assume the volition of their listeners. For, if they truly believed all things, including people\u2019s thoughts, are completely determined by preexisting causes, then why would they ever use words to communicate ideas with people? Particularly, why would they think it necessary\u2014or even possible\u2014to persuade others all things are deterministic? Why would they feel people need to know (if it were true) they have no \u201cfree will\u201d? If they indeed had no free will, what would the determinist\u2019s \u201crevelation\u201d to them change? Their attempt to communicate, then, is proof positive they either don\u2019t truly believe in determinism, or they\u2019re stupid or insane. If determinism was true (regarding human thought and behavior), then nothing anyone could say or otherwise communicate to another person would affect that person\u2019s thoughts or change their mind. Whatever happens or has happened in the physical universe is what would determine their thoughts and behavior. All their future thoughts would already be written upon reality. And, if the determinist\u2019s words ever do manage to change someone\u2019s mind, how does the determinist think that happens? Do they think the physical phenomenon of sound (if the words are spoken) or the light (if written) exerted some kind of force on the person\u2019s body that compelled them to act against their motives and intents? Again, unless they are insane, of course not! Rather, they expect their communication to be received by the other person\u2019s brain (via their physical senses) and to be evaluated by them (that is, by their mind) using reason and understanding. Also, they hope to appeal to the other person\u2019s desires, values, and motives\u2014all of which play a role in the decision that leads to the resulting behavior. And all of which exclusively reside inside the mind of that individual. If you ask me if I want some chocolate ice cream, my response comes entirely from within me. Nothing outside of me\u2014including the past history of the universe, or even my life in particular\u2014controls that moment, and that decision. Even if I\u2019ve had some past bad experience with chocolate ice cream\u2014for example, I found a roach in a new box of chocolate ice cream\u2014all my future reactions to chocolate ice cream are entirely up to how I choose to handle those occasions when they arise. It\u2019s on me\u2014and not on the universe, or on that past event. The determinist would point to someone who had a similar experience and was traumatized by it and thus developed a permanent repulsion towards chocolate ice cream, and say all their subsequent reactions to chocolate ice cream were a necessary consequence of everything that preceded those occasions, including that bad experience. In other words, they cannot help their reactions. The situation forever controls their future decisions regarding chocolate ice cream. What they don\u2019t comprehend is that the very fact different people react differently to the same situations is precisely what proves they are not deterministic. One person develops a phobia or compulsive disorder. The other person uses reason and goes on to enjoy chocolate ice cream another day. One exhibits weakness while the other exhibits strength. Yet, even these are choices made by the individuals\u2014in the moment of decision. And though a person who is weak in character has behaved in a weak manner in the past, this does not prevent them at any given moment from choosing to behave strongly\u2014thus building strength. The physical parallel to this is the skinny kid who can\u2019t lift a certain amount of weight. Let\u2019s say he\u2019s 90 pounds and can\u2019t raise 150 pounds over his head. (That was me somewhere around the sixth grade.) He tries to pick up the weight and can\u2019t. Does his not being able to do so take away his free will? Of course not! It neither prevents him from wanting to, or attempting to pick up the object. Neither is every future attempt by him to lift 150 pounds already determined for him. Why? Because he has the option\u2014the \u201cfree will\u201d\u2014to change his daily routine to include working out and changing his nutritional habits, to build his body strength to the point he is later able to lift 150 pounds. Now, the person who is (ironically) determined to hold to his determinist views will argue that, by the time the guy has developed the strength to lift the weight, all the exercise and proper eating are what made it possible for him to lift the weight\u2014which is true. But, to cite these as \u201ccauses\u201d leading up to the behavior of lifting the weight would be dishonest and deceitful. Why? Because the \u201ccauses\u201d were not themselves necessary events. Rather, they were determined by the person way back when he was unable to lift the weight. His inability to lift it at 90 pounds did not\u2014could not\u2014determine his future efforts to build himself up. He\u2014and he alone\u2014made the decision. In the exact same way, people having weaknesses or strengths of character can either build up or break down one or the other by making decisions in the moment that can go against their predominant trait. Someone who is, by nature, a coward can do something courageous in the heat of the moment. How many times have you heard tales of either heroic or horrific acts by individuals where those who know the person who performed the deed say it was not like that person to do such a thing? Going back to my example of the 90-pound weakling: I was that weakling! And because I was so frail and weak, I was also known for running from my bullies. Then one day my number one bully made the mistake of making Mary cry. Mary Montanez-Rivera was my sun and moon. And when she told me who had made her cry, fear kicked in. And, against all that I was at that moment\u2014as determined by all that had occurred in my past\u2014I sought this boy out and kicked his butt! According to determinism, my past behavior would not have allowed this to happen. Because my \u201cwill\u201d should have been determined by the fear I could not help. But what determinism always ignores is the fact that we all have multiple wills! My will for not getting beat up existed right alongside my will to see Mary happy; and my will to stay out of the principle\u2019s office; and my will not to have Mary think I was a coward; and my will not to think of myself as a coward; and my will to act according to my values; and so many others. Still, this would not deter the determinist, who would argue that factors such as skinny kid\u2019s desire to bulk up, due to (for example) social pressures to do so\u2014perhaps to impress girls, or to stop being bullied\u2014dictated his decision. In other words, it was inevitable he would make the decision. But this is complete nonsense, and totally unsupported by evidence. There is no known principle or law by which this can be shown to be true. To the contrary, it can easily be demonstrated to be false. But first we need to separate simple, honest reasoning from the scholarly-sounding but vacuous language of those who seek to attribute to the intangible and abstract quality of mind the properties of the tangible and physical. We should not allow ourselves to be so impressed by references to lofty scientific concepts in fields such as quantum physics, and that invoke the names of brilliant thinkers in history, that we falsely presume the latter informs the former. Often people do confuse the two. And whereas those who question and would debate whether \u201cdeterminism\u201d exists do so because of a related concern over \u201cfree will\u201d\u2014which means the kind in question is that which deals with human thought and behavior, or Causal Determination\u2014someone will always conflate the two as if what scientifically applies (that is, to the universe) metaphysically applies (to the individual). The simple fact non-living matter and energy do not possess mind should tell a moderately intelligent person why it doesn\u2019t.  Hard Evidence The notion that we don\u2019t have \u201cfree will\u201d (a better term is \u201cfree moral agency\u201d) is predicated by many on the claim some readers no doubt have heard (some attribute to Schopenhauer[1] and translate as): Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills. I can personally attest to the falsity of this statement. I\u2019m not denying something called temptation, or physical attraction. It\u2019s a fact that sexual attraction, for example, is to some extent built into my physiology. But this may be the most convincing proof of our ability to will what we will. It\u2019s precisely because certain aspects of my physiology are attracted to certain aspects of female physiology, that creates a mental attraction in me to the female body, that I know I can ultimately will what I will. Because I am able to apply reason and moral values to direct my will away from having this attraction for certain females and towards a particular female: namely, my own wife. Not only can I direct it in a particular direction, but also at particular times. And so can many others reading this. I\u2019m sure many have had honeymoons and been on dates. Therefore you have put your hard-on on schedule! Men, if you were not able to \u201cwill what you will,\u201d you would be walking around with a noticeable bulge in your pants\u2014if not at all times and in all places, at the most inconvenient of times and places. When you are at work, for example, or in church, or in grocery stores, or walking down city streets. You will see plenty of sexually desirable people. And you will and have directed your will toward other appropriate things quite frequently. Of course, I don\u2019t expect people to admit any of these things. (Not that I\u2019m trying to exact an admission from anyone.) Ironically, many will read this and simply shrug it off not realizing they\u2019ve exercised their \u201cfree will\u201d by doing so.  * Assuming we\u2019re talking about the so-called Causal Determination and not those that pretend to be purely scientific (though they aren\u2019t).

            "answer_text": "Determinism is undoubtedly a concept which we will resist less if it is believed. However, it is rooted in the belief in an omnipotent God. Without such a God, there is nothing precisely making matter \u2018resist to us\u2019. It seems true there are some things we can\u2019t control, or not in retrospect, such as the types of material choices we have. We cannot decide what is perfect if there is nothing better. But sometimes we have the freedom to imagine and change the confines of what we assume we mean. We have the freedom to destroy mental barriers at times when we have even very small opportunities to do so, and these moments result in very great differences in how life is lived. True, on the surface, we may not have much choice, but the difference for our value system is very easily modified and converted. There are four categories: determining determinations, determining the will, willful determinations, and willful volition, and half of it by necessity is compatibilism, and the other half is about some type of determination, willful or not. Think of it this way: free will is a type of determination, with a standard that may be present or absent, and on top of it all there is no determinism without determinations. All free will is slave to the preferences. There is no free will without preferences, and so perfect fulfillment of preferences is the maximal concept of the will. So, in a sense, the ultimate concept of will is in part the desire for some preferences to go unfulfilled, to live the dream of arbitrary behavior. But really we cannot get more than we want, if we are being honest. ",
