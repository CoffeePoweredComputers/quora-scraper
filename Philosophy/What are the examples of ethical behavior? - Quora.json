            "answer_text": "Ethics, as someone described, do include an element of social norms, but not all social norms are ethical. Ethics, at its core, is doing the thing that least violates the dignity and worth of yourself AND others. It is the least self-serving decision. It may be acceptable to drink alcohol in our society, but ethics help you determine in which situations drinking alcohol won\u2019t injure or hurt someone. For example\u2026probably not a good idea to drink at a youth camp where you are responsible for the lives of young people. We would call that unethical behavior. It crosses a line, a boundary that should be maintained between you and those you are charged with caring for. Ethics are not always clear-cut. In many professions we talk about ethical dilemmas. These are situations where you have to weigh some of your options because the choice is not as clear. For example: Taking gifts from clients or students when you are in a position of power can be tricky. When is it okay? When is it not? The cost or the kind of gift might help me determine whether I accept the gift or not. Sometimes there isn\u2019t a good choice. In social work we talk about \u201cdual roles\u201d with clients as being unethical. But, there are times when those roles may be unavoidable. When you live in a really small town with one auto mechanic and that auto mechanic is your client, there may be no way to avoid a dual relationship. At some point you are likely to need an auto mechanic. If you talk about your roles ahead of time and address any potential issues before they arise, then it helps when navigating these situations. In this situation, neither of you wants to feel as though the other is taking advantage because of their power and authority. Ethics is an entire field of study because it isn\u2019t as easy as we might think. I use the following litmus test sometimes to help determine my actions: Is it kind? Is it true? And, is it necessary? ",

            "answer_text": "ANY behaviour is ethical behaviour - for some value of \u201cethical.\u201d There is not a single, universally accepted, worldwide morality. People have differing view of what is \u201cright conduct.\u201d You and I would probably disagree, somewhere, if we got down to discussing cases. We might argue about it, and try to persuade each other to change out views - all very interesting, but usually quite futile. And we cannot spend the time to \u201csort out\u201d our disagreements, even if we could, with all the other 7,499,999,998 inhabitants of this earth. I cannot spare the time: could you ? So, each one of us does what we each think is \u201cbest\u201d - using our own estimate of what is \u201cbest\u201d - and that is always a personal decision. Anyone who thinks the \u201cbest\u201d way to proceed is to beat everyone who disagrees over the head will probably become quite unpopular, and, in any half way normal world, will earn himself a thump on the head from an outraged local society - he will (be forced to) learn the error of his ways. But if you do not hurt others, then your weird behaviour, or \u201ccrazy\u201d set of values, will be accepted - possibly with laughter - but you will survive. Some kinds of conduct will be the object of widespread acclaim: not always justified. But a good press coverage helps. The example of Mother Theresa is instructive. She objected to her brother, who joined the Royal guards in the day when their country had a King, and he came home to proudly show off his new Uniform. But his sister said, \u201cYou are so proud - but pride is a sin. You are going to serve an earthly, a mere mortal King. But I, I am going to serve the King of Heaven !\u201d Now that is the SIN of PRIDE in trumps - but she gets away with it, and is now on her way to be canonised. Did she display \u201cethical\u201d behaviour ? Ask yourself. I think she showed abominable ethics, but I will not deny that her conduct can be judged ethically: I just give it a low rating, where the press, and the Church, give her a high positive rating. See, we\u2019re all different. You must make up your own mind. You can agree with me, or the Vatican. I could not care less what you think is ethical - only you must worry about that. Only you can worry about that. And that worry, too, is \u201cethical\u201d behaviou: a good example, even if the ethics are not good. ",
