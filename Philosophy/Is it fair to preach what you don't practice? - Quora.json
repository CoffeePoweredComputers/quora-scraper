            "answer_text": "Was Judas saved? No. Did the people who followed Christ suddenly become lost when Judas betrayed Him? No. Paul in Philippians 1, says it doesn\u2019t matter why Christ is Preached, as long as HE is preached. Here is the important thing, that Christ be preached!!! If you wait for the sinless man of God to preach, you will wait until the return of Christ. Having spent 25 years of my life in pastoral ministry 20+ of those years preaching every Sunday, I can say without hesitation that there have been many days when I had to preach through, over, around, or past my own sin. I pray that I delivered the message of God to the People of God appropriately. But if I could only preach when I NEVER SINNED, well, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten up on many occasions. Preach the TRUTH, even if you can\u2019t live it perfectly. It still has to be preached. As Christians we believe in the perfection of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. We also believe in the imperfection of men and women which is why the Son had to come. ",

            "answer_text": "In a word, no. Perhaps to explain this answer a little better, allow me to rephrase the question: \u201cIs it fair to preach what you aren\u2019t trying to practice without transparency?\u201d If I knew that I was struggling with a sin (gluttony, for example), I would feel strongly about being openly transparent in regards to my struggle with that sin, then I would teach what I\u2019ve found in scripture and how I\u2019m submitting to the Bible, then invite others on the journey with me. In my humble opinion, it is hypocritical and unfair to the people whom you shepherd to preach what you aren\u2019t at least trying to practice or live. ",
