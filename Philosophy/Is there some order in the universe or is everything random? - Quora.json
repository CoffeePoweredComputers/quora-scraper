            "answer_text": "The universe arrived courtesy of Big Bang in the highest state of order, i.e. of thermodynamic equilibrium that it would ever be in. The background temperature and density was perfect to one part in 100,000. That tiny imperfection, that tiny bit of disorder was the key to the evolution of the universe and ultimately to you and me being here. In the places where the temp was a bit colder (by one part in 100,000), matter collected, matter that eventually clumped into gas clouds, which clumped into stars, which clumped into galaxies. The stars produced complex elements which eventually clumped into planets and life, and hence into complex life. That clumping is increasing entropy, increasing disorder. But somehow, in the face of increasing disorder, gas, clouds, stars, elements and life arrived over long periods of galactic and universal time. It does not seem to have been random. The laws of physics were so finely tuned that there was an inevitability to it all; not necessarily to you and me specifically, but to life and ultimately to complex, intelligent life. Why? Because it is a quantum universe, and thus an observer-dependent universe, one that needs complex observers in order for reality to exist. Having said that, it is also a Chaotic universe, that is, a universe where Chaos Theory has a large role to play in the form of the Butterfly Effect. Tiny, immeasurable (many times), unpredictable variations in initial conditions drastically affect the outcome of any set of circumstances in our universe, making things largely unpredictable except within a broad range. So we can predict the number of hurricanes in any given hurricane season with uncanny accuracy, but we have no idea where they will go or how damaging they will be when they get there. Interestingly, those tiny variations in the background radiation in the early universe are exactly the Butterfly Effect. That 1 part in 100,000 variation, plus a 1 in a billion quantum mechanical chance that particles of matter will arrive without their anti-particle analogue, determined that matter would exist, and that it would clump into, well, eventually you and me. It doesn\u2019t seem to be random at all; just radically unpredictable. A simple map then of the evolution of the universe looks like this: Order=>Disorder=>Order. Out of order, disorder, and out of disorder, order. Eventually, of course, entropy wins and all becomes maximally disordered. But it will not be chaos. It will be still, quiet, and empty, cold and dead, this universe. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course there is some order, do you really think everything happens by accident? If everything was random, why is grass green, why does a hare have no horns, why is water wet, nature has so many things that we still don\u2019t know, but they are not random. Albert Einstein: \u201cThe belief in an external world independent of the observing subject lies at the foundation of all natural science. However, since sense-perceptions only inform us about this external world, or physical reality, indirectly, it is only in a speculative way that it can be grasped by us. Consequently our conceptions of physical reality can never be final. We must always be ready to change these conceptions, i.e. the axiomatic basis of physics, in order to do justice to the facts of observation in the most complete way that is logically possible. In actual fact, a glance at the development of physics shows that this axiomatic basis has met with radical changes from time to time.\u201d All natural science is based upon this belief, but what if this belief is not completely true? The way we look at things in the external, material world and the way we assume how they exist creates a lot of misperception and misconception. In the end, all is that we see, hear, smell, taste, touch and think and the entire world is a manifestation of the mind itself. How this manifestation of the mind exactly works was already told by many ancient sages like Buddha. And somehow we have not only forgotten, we even forgot what we have forgotten. ",
