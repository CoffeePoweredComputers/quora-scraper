            "answer_text": "Humans are irrational animals capable of brief bursts of rational thought and planning. I don\u2019t mean that to be coy or evasive. This is an important insight that I gained through years of study of the brain and human behavior. We like to think of ourselves as rational because at our best, when we stop what we\u2019re doing and devote all our attention to thinking through a problem or choosing a course of action, we are capable of behaving rationally. However, when you look at the number of decisions we are confronted with every day for our whole lives, and the time it takes to think a single choice through to a rational conclusion.. we don\u2019t have nearly enough time to think about even 1% of them. We aren\u2019t even consciously aware of the vast majority of choices we make. And of course rational behavior isn\u2019t always a matter of discrete choices that are simple to execute such as whether to buy A or B. For example, smoking is not rational, and most smokers are well aware of that. On top of all that, our emotions constantly interact with and influence our behavior in irrational ways. Our behavior is more about habit and learned experience than conscious, rational decision making. The simple reason is that rational thought requires time and mental energy that we have in limited supply. Ideally, we save it for the most important or consequential decisions in life, leaving our subconscious perceptions, learned associations, emotions and impulses in charge most of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two possible answers to this question. If you study too much psychology, everyone is sane. I.e. they will make the best decisions given their value system, current frame of reference, given mental machinery, etc. In practice, the answer you want is: No. For most people, they will act against their declared value systems or act inconsistently under different circumstances. For a comprehensive list: List of cognitive biases. For a systematic, practical, well written read, try Thinking, Fast and Slow: Daniel Kahneman. ",
