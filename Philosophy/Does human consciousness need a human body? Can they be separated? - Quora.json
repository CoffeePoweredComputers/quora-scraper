            "answer_text": "The consciousness that you are experiencing this moment with isn't yours. The universe itself is conscious in you. This is an important distinction, because we all tend to get wrapped up in illusions of identity and miss this universal connection. It's like they say in zen: beginner's mind is Buddha mind. And it's all one mind, plugging into the experiential flow of a human organism. And a human organism is a damn cool thing to experience life - your cosmic self - with. Everybody has their own take on this, because the forms this universal consciousness takes are infinite and truth itself can't be spoken. So here's my two cents in the infinite tip jar. I think one way of understanding interconnectedness is to realize that words like the concept itself doesn't do it justice. It's just a word, a symbol. If you hold on to it too much you may get rightfully confused as to how your perspective of reality, right now through your senses, could possibly be a perspective of and by \"everything\", \"The one\"... since it's so trivial, so singular, so localised... how can \"you\" possibly be everything? Well, you have to drop words and appearances if you want to really feel it. What you think you are is an idea. It's a thought the brain, and by extension the universe, is having. Why \"by extension the universe\"? Because your brain is the way it is because of your parents' genes, actions and the events in the extended environment. Every moment in time that passes adds an incomprehensible amount new causes and effects to the flow of matter and energy that simply aren't and can't be understood. The universe is a flow. You can play a game of \"follow the chain of events\" which is what science is, and you may learn more about the chain, but you won't get to an end. Even if you do, there is always the potential metaphysical extension to the chain you can't comprehend. This is something you could meditate on. Your I is a thought and it can only be what it is if the rest of the universe is what it is. It is an incarnation of sentience, spawned as a particular arrangement of energy, which all comes from and is founded on the same source which we call the universe. What I like about the \"no self\" philosophy of Buddhism is that it helps you to let go of the dualistic view where you are a \"soul\" experiencing a \"greater soul\" (the universe). You are not a soul, there is no such thing, unless you look at it from the most trivial perspective imaginable, the one I'm guessing most of us are experiencing day to day and probably right now. You are YOU only as long as your brain conjures up, and is self-aware of, an identity. When that identity is either dropped or seen through you get the enlightenment all the philosophers are talking about. You aren't \"in\" the universe... you are so intertwined with what we call the universe that you can be nothing but the universe itself. ",

How can it be called human consciousness, if it is not existing in the human body? We are tripartite beings, we have to work in accord in all these states, be it physical, nonphysical or metaphysical. The human consciousness cannot be separated from the human body. It is not existing if it is not staying somewhere. It is the body that ignites consciousness. The brain is the main base of our consciousness, and it is stimulated by actions and pains which we sometimes feel. These pains most often happen in other parts of the body. Imagine a situation, where a person is subjected to torture. To make them accept some brainwashing, a consciousness that will contradict what they previously held as ideology. This pains will quicken their mind to go through a new consciousness, which may be with them after they have been freed from the torture. The body and the consciousness are inseparable. It is the basis of human consciousness. The body is the main ",

Not purchased computer. It is in my hand Now. Now where the windows ten living. It is living in waves and as well as in CD which I am holding. Now I purchased a computer and installed windows ten. Now Windows ten living in its wave, in CD, in computer, in its server of Microsoft. Now brake the CD. Feel that you killed windows ten. Does it mean that you killed windows ten. No. Hence it is wave. It creates body. Mind thoughts creates body. It is like a cobweb create it's string and live at centre. The center of creation of waves is universal soul. You will be tuned according to that soul, but a simulation. ",

Consciousness is the running, pre-installed firmware and software, and the brain is the ROM, RAM, motherboard and processor, and there's no backup drive. Consciousness needs the brain and then, the parts of the brain whose functions contribute to consciousness. Remove or damage or kill off those, and consciousness ceases. Consciousness can't even move to a neighbouring, undamaged part of the brain. Billions of deceased humans and no continuing consciousness thereof tends to suggest that this has always been the case.
