            "answer_text": "Being an anarchist is about rejecting power structures and hierarchy. It's about not accepting anyone above you or accepting a place above anyone else. Fundamentally, having power over others, rather than simply having power to do stuff, limits what you can do while maintaining that power. The slave master must whip the slave, or their power cannot be maintained. The capitalist must pursue endless profit, or their power cannot be maintained. And others having power over you restrains you even more. The slave master has total domination over the slave. The capitalists has almost complete control over the worker when the worker is at work. So being an anarchist is about building a world where those power relationships don't exist. Where no one is above anyone else and no one is below anyone else. Warlords are no more anarchy than the state. Capitalism is no more anarchy than warlords. The patriarchy is no more anarchy than capitalism. Each of these are the enemy of the anarchist. Each of these are systems of power and domination that restrain and control all who are a part of them.  So a good reason to be an anarchist is not to become a warlord. A good reason to become an anarchist is to create a world where there are no restraints. Where no one is dominated. It's not easy. It's not simple. It can't be described through pithy slogans like what I just used. But I'm not about to give a treatise on what anarchy is right now. I have better things to do with my time and better fights to fight. It's more important to me to live as an anarchist than to tell others about anarchism. ",

            "answer_text": "In the words of the late,great Henry David Thoreau,Anarchism takes the classical liberal creed \"The best government is that which governs least\" and extends this to its logical conclusion \"The best government is that which governs not at all.\"Anarchism also recognizes that most evils of this world result not as liberals and vulgar-materialists assert from any fixed human nature but rather from the mechanization and regimentation resulting from hierarchy.If you doubt this fact,then consider the ease with which a man when given a badge,gun and baton brutalizes his fellow man under the pretext of maintaining order.Also,then,consider how politicians,lawyers,corporate CEOs and priests are allowed to lie repeatedly as their profession and yet people risk social ostracism if they dare speak out on these lies.Consider also that a high-level corporate CEO is far more likely to be a psychopath at 12% than an everyday citizen at 1%.
