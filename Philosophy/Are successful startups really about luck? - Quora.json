            "answer_text": "In a way there\u2019s a bit of luck involved for any business. The market forces can change at any time, the customer sentiment may vary and other unseen forces can either make or break a company. It\u2019s not just about startups, it\u2019s about any business in general. Nothing in business guarantees success forever. Technology is always changing, new products and companies coming into the market. You just have to be able to adapt as best as you can and make the changes quickly and correctly. Running a company is like trying to drive down a road that is literally changing right in front of your eyes. You can\u2019t take your eye off the road. The best thing a business, startup or entrepreneur can do, is to do everything in their own power to put the company in the best position to succeed. You have to set yourself up for success. Even then there is no guarantee you will succeed. If you work hard, do the best you can, adapt and with some luck you can make it happen. So is luck part of it? Yes to some degree. That\u2019s my 2 cents. ",

            "answer_text": "To an extent. It\u2019s hard to predict the market, to the point where someone taking credit for the success of their idea is stretching the truth. The availability of good (or bad) people is also random, some people might not need to be a good judge of character to avoid having anyone undermine their business, because they might simply not encounter anyone who will do so. Others won\u2019t be saved by this, because they might encounter someone who is particularly skilled at deception. Other unpredictable environmental factors, including some outside the startup\u2019s control, can also place a role. Location, timing, current events, even the weather. It\u2019s not all luck. The most important single factor is probably whether the new business is (perceived as) necessary (by the customers). But, it\u2019s not all in control, either, which is why risk management and insurance are critical. ",
