            "answer_text": "Well, both.. It\u2019s still bad, but good in a different respect. You\u2019d be referring to different aspects of the thing. Take for example a terribly offensive joke, but one that is absolutely hilarious. It is bad insofar as it is detrimental to people or making light of something that ought to be taken seriously, but good insofar as it succeeds at doing what a joke does, which is making us laugh because of a certain incongruity or cleverness. It seems something \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d usually refers to humor. Aristotle called humor \u201ca species of the ugly.\u201d Ugly, meaning, things are not as they are supposed to be. (I\u2019d add that humor includes cleverness, which would mean something being unusually good, the key being \u201cunusual.\u201d) We laugh at things because of their extraordinary badness or goodness. If we see something performed very badly, it becomes good humor. But good humor might also be something performed so well that it surprises you. In both cases, there is \u201cugliness\u201d in the general sense\u2014that things are not as they usually are. This dual nature of humor makes it something like a consolation prize for the ugliness of the world. ",
