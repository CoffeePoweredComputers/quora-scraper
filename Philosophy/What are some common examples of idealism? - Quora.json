            "answer_text": "First of all, everyone is an idealist. The real question is what do they do about it. The answer to this question revolves around their beliefs about their ability to attain their ideals. In simplest terms, either you do believe that you can attain your ideals or you don\u2019t. If you do, then you will lean toward \u201cpractical idealism.\u201d If not, you will lean toward fanaticism. The basic difference between a practical idealist and a fanatic is that the practical idealist is satisfied with taking whatever steps are available toward achieving their ideals, even if they have to take smaller steps than they would like to. They take only actions that are worthy of the ideals they hope to achieve. The fanatic, however, plays by a different set of rules. To them, the end justifies the means. They will take any action they believe is necessary to achieve their ideals, including actions that are actually contradictory to their ideals. They use rationalization to justify even the most radical solutions. Obviously, almost no one is entirely a practical idealist or a fanatic. There are countless shades of gray. Some people believe in the attainability of some of their ideals, but not others. They will express fanaticism in some areas and not in others. But fanaticism is a fool's paradise: it promises much and delivers little of value because of its built-in contradictions. Whereas the practicing idealist takes only steps that are worthy of the ideals they hope to accomplish. It is the surest, if not always the fastest path to the ideals we hope to achieve. ",
