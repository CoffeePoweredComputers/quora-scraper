We are a species that works best when we are a \u2018part of\u2019 rather than \u2018a part from\u2019. When you were a child you had parents who looked or for all your needs, Food Board Clothing Education They paid the bills, handled all outcomes, thereby allowing you to enjoy the journey as an adventure. This is as it should be, i remember my childhood,my parents loved me as best they could,iwanted for nothing Anna until i experienced a trauna event outside of their control, it was a wonderful adventure. After i suffered my event,filled with shame and brokenness, i pulled away from everyone and tried to go it alone, to hide my shame. It is only much later in life, having suffered in silence for too long that i was willing to go to any lengths, willing to embrace any practice, willing to embrace to self awareness that my best want good enough, didn't work anymore and i needed to ask for and accept help. Due to my trauma event, i was uncomfortable letting any human in and so allowed God in. I had the most amazing spiritual awakening when i learned from an elderly Jesuit priest that religion and God were two seperate entity's. One is man-made and one isn't. I realised i had issues with organised religion and i had thrown out the baby with the bath water when i had rejected it. This self awareness allowed me to give all my troubles, conflicts and shame to Him and accept 24 hour increments of peace of mind, compassion, forgiveness,tolerance, among other ideals. This led me into wonderful confidence, i was like a new man, reborn I pray this helps you Kind regards Richard T author: Your Energy Works ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there! Thanks for the request to answer. Great question. I say yes, self-awareness is essential to self-improvement. If it were not, then would one even recognize or want to pursue improving oneself? I want to first note that self-improvement can cover many aspects from physically, financially, spiritually, emotionally, mentally\u2026 So now getting back to self-awareness being essential for self-improvement to take place\u2026 Say, for example, the desire to get in better shape. There has to be an awareness that person has where they recognize they may not be in the best shape they can be in currently and they believe that they can improve their physical state and in order to do so they need to take action for that to happen. That is a pretty straight forward example. However, say, for instance, emotional intelligence. One wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to pursue improving their ability to handle their emotions in a more effective way if one was not aware that it can actually be improved. So when it comes to self-awareness being essential to self-improvement, one of the main keys of importance to keep in mind is the level of one\u2019s awareness and it\u2019s role in one\u2019s desire to improve. Someone might have a high self-awareness when it comes to their physical and financial aspects of their lives and, therefore, take action to stay in great shape and be financially secure\u2026 However they may have a very low self-awareness when it comes to relationships and because of that choose partners that are not right for them and stay in unhealthy relationships.
