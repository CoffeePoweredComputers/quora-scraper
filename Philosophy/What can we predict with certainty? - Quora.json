            "answer_text": "If we can predict things with certainty depends on your concept of certainty and the confines of the prediction. Do we mean things that are guaranteed 1 of 1 times to be true or do we mean things that are so certain to be true that in the history of the universe it has probably never been false or do we mean some other standard? Many things have been established with such a consistent track record that we can make the prediction that the results will continue to be the same with no fear of being wrong. For example I can predict that any device, process or engine will be less than 100% efficient. We know this from the study of thermodynamics. Before you even begin examining the device or process you know it will not be 100% efficient and you doubly know it cannot be more than 100% efficient. In Quantum entanglement we know with certainty that once two particles are entangled they will be identical until something acts upon them. So I have two particles and I know that if one has a certain property the other particle has the same property. We can know with certainty that if they were entangled this will be true before we even examine the second particle. Some things could be wrong be we are so certain we are right that it is meaningless to try and classify it as uncertain.  For example Rydberg constant    This has a relative standard uncertainty of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 which means it is very unlikely to be wrong based on all observations and tests. When dealing with such a very small chance of being wrong it is best to just call it certain. ",
