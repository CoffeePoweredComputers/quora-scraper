            "answer_text": "I am fortunate in that throughout my life, I have always had a young person's eager curiosity and sense of discovery. Even now, at age 60, my general attitude, upon waking each day, is \"What interesting things will there be to learn and experience today?\" If I find something that interests me, I follow through to find out more. At age 13, in the mid 1960s, seeing Ted Cassidy as \"Lurch\" play a few bars on the harpsichord on \"The Addams Family\" series, I became curious about the instrument, so I went to our local public library and checked out LP recordings of Polish harpsichordist Wanda Landowska, who had almost single-handedly revived modern interest in this form of keyboard performance. This experience, in turn, helped to open up the world of Baroque music to me, and it has remained a lifelong interest. Some years ago, watching the audio commentary for Terminator III, I heard actress Kristanna Loken remark that she had prepared for her role for the female terminator, in part, by studying Krav Maga. I had never heard of it before but later discovered that it is a method of hand-to-hand combat used by the Israeli armed forces. A couple of years ago, an offer popped up in \"Living Social\" deals for unlimited Krav Maga lessons for a month. I went to the dojo and studied there for several months. I never felt I was really very good at it, but to some degree, I entered that world and its way of thinking and certainly learned some things. The same is true of a brief study of Kendo I made some years ago. I was pounded to hamburger, but the whole ethos of Kendo fascinated me, and I would still like to think I might take it up once more. Ten years ago, for a 2-year period, I became a volunteer docent in a 25-room Victorian mansion and spent my Saturday and Sunday afternoons giving guided tours. Although the last owner of the house had been alive during my lifetime, I had never known any of these people, but I felt as if I had come to know them and added a great many details to my tours that other guides did not include, always sharing in an enthusiastic manner. Once, when I was getting my hair cut and talking to the stylist, another customer nearby was heard to remark that she thought she must know me and even recognized my voice, and I'm pretty sure it must be that she had taken one of my tours. As I mentioned above, I'm now 60 and live alone; my two kids are grown and in other cities. I don't attend church (I have actually tried a couple of times and have met some very nice people, but the overall determined simple-mindedness of religion is so exasperating that it makes me just want to stand up and start throwing things), and I'm a rather solitary, serious, bookish person. Nevertheless, I feel I live a very interesting life, and I have managed to put one together from the following: 1. Reading. I own about a thousand books and subscribe to 9 magazines (e.g., Harper's, The Atlantic, Smithsonian, The Economist, etc.) which makes me feel as if I am taking part in a great conversation, as Mortimer Adler put it, not only across the miles but across the centuries. 2. Blogging. I started a blog called \"Read No Further\" on Create your free Blog a few years ago, and though I don't keep that up like I used to, I generally use my Facebook page as my own personal Huffington Post. I share interesting articles I have read from The New York Times, The Washington Post, Politics, Business, Technology, and the Arts, The New Republic, National Review, Mother Jones, Lapham's Quarterly, and so forth, often with my comments. I share the same articles, with somewhat abbreviated comments, in Twitter.  In addition, when I go on a trip to some interesting place, I take about 300 pictures with my little Kodak digital camera, and when I come home, I post the pictures as a photo album on Facebook, along with my comments, making into a sort of photo essay about my trip. 3. Walking. I took up walking for fitness in a big way about 2 1/2 years ago and eventually lost 50 pounds. We have a Greenline in our city, a former railroad bed that was asphalted and turned into a path for walking and biking, and I walk the complete round trip, which is 13 miles and takes 3 1/2 to 4 hours. This is a solitary activity (though I occasionally meet people I know or even get into chats with strangers), but I've found that it does me good to be alone with my thoughts. I also walked a 10-mile section of the Appalachian Trail. 4. Trivia. I seem to have the kind of memory that enables me to do well in trivia contests, and I recruit teams to enter local tournaments. It's interesting to do this, because, on the one hand, you have to keep everyone focused during the tournaments and make sure we come up with accurate answers, but on the other, everyone on the team is smart and has a healthy ego, so you can't act as though you're barking out orders or dealing with wayward children. It's an interesting balance, but in any case, the teams I put together have compiled a good record of wins. My city's public library puts on a \"Corporate Knowledge Bowl\" tournament for a week every September, and I entered teams in that event for several years and greatly enjoyed it. I have also auditioned for Jeopardy twice, though I've never been invited to be on the show. 5. Music. Although I don't usually turn on my car radio, I have a nice CD collection, and I have created several radio stations in my Pandora subscription keyed to Renaissance and Baroque music, as well as Mozart, Wagner, the opera in general, etc. I also live near a theater that shows live-in-HD broadcasts of Metropolitan Opera performances, which I enjoy a great deal. 6. Travel. I don't really have the budget for extensive travel, but I can manage interesting \"long weekend\" trips occasionally. For instance, after driving to Knoxville for my son's college graduation last May, I drove 120 miles further to Asheville to see the Biltmore Mansion, where I hadn't been for 10 years. And when I was invited to audition for Jeopardy on a Monday in New Orleans, which I had never visited, I went down the Friday before and made it a long weekend of sightseeing. Sometimes, I'll make a trip for no reason but that I read about something interesting in a magazine and want to see it personally. For instance, 8 years ago, I read about an interesting exhibit of art and antiques at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, which is only about 485 miles from me, so I went to see it. Then, I discovered that the Kimbell Art Museum just down the street had an equally interesting exhibit, so I took that in as well. Finally, I went a short distance down the street from the Kimbell and toured the Japanese Garden before heading home. 7. Conversation. I'm not sure why this comes about so much, since I know I have a rather serious, formal manner, but I often find myself in pleasant conversations with strangers, as often as not on my travels. Part of this is that I am genuinely interested in finding out about what others do and think. For instance, staying in a bed and breakfast in New Orleans, I had at least three interesting conversations. One was with a man who was in town for the Shriners' Convention, and we talked about the Shriners' hospitals for burn victims, particularly children. Another was with a retired Navy Chief who had been responsible for supervising the loading of cargo planes. A third conversation was with a young woman who was about to begin law school at Tulane and had a keen interest in international law. For that matter, on a Grayline tour of New York City a couple of years ago, I ended up in conversation with a young woman sitting next to me on the bus, and we both got off the bus to walk through the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. It turned out that she was a Ph.D. candidate in biology visiting the United States from her home in Australia. We had a late lunch and talked for a couple of hours, mostly about her work. Then we parted and went back to our respective hotels, but it had been a pleasant and memorable afternoon. I have no doubt that to many, my life would seem about as interesting as a bowl of cold mashed potatoes, but it suits me. In that regard, I am reminded of the role of social media. Thirty or forty years ago, there was a Broadway play called \"84 Charing Cross Road\" about a woman in New York, in the early 1950s, ordering hard-to-find antiquarian books from a London bookseller, and striking up a pen pal friendship over the years with the proprietor and his staff. In that day, such a thing was extraordinary; today, with Facebook, online message boards, blogs, and other media, it is commonplace. My introduction to the Internet was AOL in 1995, and for a couple of years, beginning in 1999, I had my own AOL chat room, called \"In Search of Nothing,\" just a friendly room for clean, intelligent chat. For a while, it seemed to gain a following, and I encountered a large number of people there, of all ages, occupations, and places of residence, even from foreign lands. I haven't done that sort of thing for years, and there is a great deal online that I find offensive and inane, but I have found as well that the world of the Internet, including sites like this one, can be very helpful for bringing people together in some sense who might never have had any contact otherwise.

            "answer_text": "Listen to me very carefully. Stay in your room without friends and forget about trying to have a more interesting life while you are in highschool. Just totaly devote every second of your life to doing what it is that you do. That thing that keeps you friendlees in your room living a uninteresting life. And this is why. Pay attention cause it's important. Right now you are living the life that every world changing billionaire was living while they worked on the things that made them into the Elon Musk's and steve jobs or even the Jimmy Hendrix's that they would become after high school. Trust me while you are in highschool you can only do lame ass things that at the time sound cool fun ant intresting. But the truth is really every thing you will find will be way less interesting than you had hoped and just about everything that a highschool student can do that is fun and intresting ends with you either having a baby before you graduate, becomeing addicted to drugs and alchohol, spending many years in prison or dying in a car accident. For real So spend your highschool years being a friendless unintresting nerd that's locked in their room figuring what you want to be as an adult what type of life you want to have and what things you need to accomplish that mission and only do the things that will get you there. And never take a step unless it's in the direction of your dream until you make it reality. Then when you look back at all the people you thought were living the life you think you want now. And they are raising their children and lying to themselves that one day they will finally go to college and get that dream job they wanted until the reality finally snuffs out that hope because you never finish raising kids and all your money will go to their college fund and dream job. The ones who were super cool and popular that go to all the parties are now going to AA metings, methadone clinics, probation or parole with no hope of doing anything other than more meetings, drugs, time in prison and either non stop talk about that one time when they were in highschool and did something that made people think they were cool but really it didn't matter to the rest of the world or they nonstop talk about how much they drank and where they drank it and with who like they are telling you the recipe for the cure for cancer. I don't need to tell you what the ones that died in car accidents are doing cause who cares everyone already forgot about them a week after their funeral. But you will be the smart one that worked and then played and as an up and coming future billionaire just think of the real fun you will have and you can afford lawyers so chances are even if you have to much fun you won't end up in prison.
