            "answer_text": "The simplest pleasures: 1. A conversation that is full of soul. Warm tea and rain. A group of creatives who come to be lifelong friends. The trivialities of acquaintances: book clubs and music suggestions, theater performances or movie. 2. Using something to it\u2019s full capacity: A bottle of perfume that smells like wildflowers, a pencil that writes like a dream, a piece of cloth, an underlined book, a weathered sweater. 3. Being regular at a local cafe that brews excellent french pressed coffee or drip coffee. Something for the eccentrics, where the barista recognizes you every Saturday and calls you by name. Reading a newspaper by a window table. 4. Photographing, being photographed. Filling all your online spaces with beautiful pictures. Remembering the best moments of your life. Journalling. 5. Adventures in a bout of recklessness. Camping goods. To know the sweet woods, to travel well. Rough boots and well-worn limbs. Ragged breath and absolutely spectacular sunrises. Treehouses and waterfalls. 6. To ride a bicycle down cobbled streets to the farmer\u2019s market, or simply to take a walk in a lovely white shirt, with a brown bag for the groceries. The purchase of herbs and organic vegetables. Growing thyme on the sill. 7. Cooking green, and cooking well. Making your own herbal concoctions. Sharing recipes the old way, handwritten with excellent penmanship. Writing letters to people on their birthdays. Being well-worded and educated. Knowing how to give a good speech. 8. Hugs. Golden Retrievers. Independent cinema. Poetry readings. Bookstores. Acting. Falling in love with strangers. 9. Sleeping below the nightsky, shivering beside someone you love. ",
