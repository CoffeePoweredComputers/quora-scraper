One of my books has an interesting, if disturbing, title \u201cYou Are In God: God Is In You\u201d and so the connection is complete, but so many of us have believed the nonsense that we are taught, by most of society, that there can be no connection because they say there can be no such connection; their saying that this is so makes it so! So There!! . All that being said, especially if one believes some who are researching both \u2018human consciousness\u2019 and the possible \u2018Consciousness of the Universe\u2019 then, Yes!, our our consciousness is our connection to God. That same research, at least from some, is rewording things to say that our minds are not created by our brains, although they use them, and the Consciousness of the Universe is The Mind and our mind and The Mind are in complete connection. Some of those who are trying to develop a Theory of Everything, from the bottom up, have accepted that there is such a thing as dimensionless Information (sometimes called Pure Information) that is fundamental to everything in the universe and it is that dimensionless Information (dimensionless like numbers are dimensionless) that guides the ordered formation of Energy and matter (a special form of Energy). Many words have multiple meanings (this is always so in any language) and some talk at cross purposes because of that, but it is likely true that our consciousness and The Consciousness of the Universe do connect. Since much of this is going on in Science, and even the most open of Science types hate to cross over the line to talking about Philosophy and Religion, we may not be able to get them to make a powerful statement about this and have them agree - those in Science who even hint that they are using tools and concepts from Philosophy get shunned as crazy ones who have seriously-sinned! LoL This crazy one (I have been such since my earliest memories) says it out loud, however; \u201cOur consciousness is at least one part of our connection to God!\u201d Love and Above to all who seek the Truth!

            "answer_text": "Not to me, but it may seem like it to those who are religious and believe in one god or another. Consciousness is simply a state in which we are awake and aware of ourselves, our thoughts and our surroundings. And it is also a state in which we can perceive and make contact with other human beings and whatever else may be around us and accomplish tasks that need to get done. There are other creatures on earth who also sleep and wake up and experience a state of consciousness. Most of them are probably not aware of or able to consider the existence of a God although they may see humans as having magical or godlike qualities when we obtain tasty food from a can or bag and feed it to them or step into a noisy contraption and drive away or take them for a ride. I had a Siamese cat once who loved riding in the car next to my head on the bench seat of the car. Nutmeg would provide me with a steady stream of instructions about what to watch for how fast or slow to go and to look out for other cars and remind me of where and when to turn. Once I got stopped by a cop for not making a complete stop at a stop sign when there was nothing coming from either direction and she told him in no uncertain terms that we had looked both ways before going through the stop sign so he decided to just give us a warning instead of a ticket. She provided us with thirty kittens who we were able to give away easily because they were soooooooooooo very CUTE\u2026. ",
