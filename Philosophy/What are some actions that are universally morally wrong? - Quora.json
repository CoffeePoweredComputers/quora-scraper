            "answer_text": "To say just the 10 Commandments would be a vast understatement when there are over 600 laws in the Bible. The 10 Commandments are merely a summary of those 600+ laws and in the New Testament Christ even summed up the 10 Commandments further into just two: Love God with all your heart and love thy neighbor as thy self. In other words, if you loved God then you\u2019d be obedient to him and if you loved your neighbor you\u2018d keep the commandments - I know, it\u2019s redundant. Loving God literally means you\u2019re abiding by the laws (1 John 3:4 Love = Obedience). Not coveting your neighbors wife is showing love for your neighbor; not stealing your neighbors possessions is showing love for your neighbor; not forcibly taking him into slavery and making him work without pay is showing love; not depriving him of a living, not charging him interest, not leaving him lamb in a ditch when you have the ability to help it. All the commandments are geared towards doing what\u2019s right for humanity and when you break one you break the fundamental barriers of morality and then chaos ensues. The Bible is universal moral law, and, no, it\u2019s not bias. ",

            "answer_text": "Morality depends on life. Whatever benefits it is good, whatever harms it is bad (or as Ayn Rand writes, \u201cevil\u201d). Therefore, killing is the ultimate wrong. Following that, initiating physical violence against individuals is wrong, the level depending on how badly hurt they are and how long they\u2019re forced to endure their suffering. For example, initiating violence by blowing someone\u2019s limbs off is worse than punching them (provided it doesn\u2019t kill of seriously harm them). Likewise, compelling individuals to act against their will is also wrong. For example, forcing them to do work they don\u2019t want (slavery), or \u2018disappearing\u2019 them if they publicly disagree with the government. ",
