            "answer_text": "I have a ton of of books that I\u2019d love to recommend\u2026but one that I really remember just giving me a new perspective was The Hiding Place- by Corrie Ten Boom. I love hearing peoples testimonies and seeing truly how God works in peoples lives. She has an amazing story\u2026and one that I think would make you want to know this amazing God we service more. I spent the majority of my 20s agnostic and at one point I realized I really wanted to reconsider the Christian faith I grew up in. I decided I needed to know who Jesus was\u2026and there was a book called \u201cThe Jesus I Never Knew\u201d that really helped me understand Jesus better. LOVED it. I\u2019d also recommend going to the website \u201cI Am Second\u201d and listening to peoples testimonies\u2026so powerful. On my list of books to read is Seeking Allah finding Jesus as I heard it is a powerful book and testimony as well. Also, I would also suggest\u2026just start talking to God. Pray, sing, write a letter to Him, go out in nature\u2026whatever it might be that would make you feel close to Him and just poor your heart out. He so desires this closeness with you and HOW wonderful that you are seeking that right now! Life can throw us some curve balls that can test our Faith and I like to just remind myself of how powerful and loving HE is and all of the things He has done to transform me. If you have had those moments\u2026reflect on them and be grateful for them and ask for more!! I have some other great sites if you need to get more into the Apologetic s part\u2026there is so much evidence backing up the Christian faith\u2026it isn\u2019t all blind faith alone. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey friend. I\u2019m so sorry to hear you feel like you\u2019ve lost your faith. But I am also so encouraged knowing you want to get it back! I know God is going to meet you in this process and work something so beautiful. One book you might want to look into is Daring to Hope by Katie Davis Majors. A few years ago I was at a really hard place with my faith. I wouldn\u2019t say I had lost it completely, but I was questioning a lot of what I had been taught because of some really hard circumstances in my life. Katie\u2019s book is one of the things that really helped me walk through that. Daring to Hope is a beautifully honest book about finding God in the midst of the darkest, driest seasons. It really helped me understand that God was still present and hadn\u2019t changed even though I was struggling to hard to hear and see Him. I hope the book might be encouraging for you as well :) I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk about anything at all! ",
