            "answer_text": "Has anyone composed compelling music that is primarily in the locrian mode? Compelling? No. That\u2019s not Locrian\u2019s style. Even the ancient Greeks understood the locrian mode was wrought with tension, and they didn\u2019t use chords the way we do. If the people who \u201cinvented/developed/discovered\u201d the modes didn\u2019t find it useful, there\u2019s no reason to re-write history. Locrian just doesn\u2019t sound finished. You can only create something compelling when it moves toward a dramatic conclusion \u2014 and Locrian never concludes!! In the end, you have to change to a different mode to get some relief. So compelling music is written in different modes to begin with, since you have to end there, anyway. . Honestly, I think the people who ask so many questions about locrian mode are just trying to up their question counts by any means possible. Give it a rest, already. There is nothing to see, or hear, here. ",
