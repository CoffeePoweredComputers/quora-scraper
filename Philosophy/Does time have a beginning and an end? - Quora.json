            "answer_text": "No. Everything is based on matter in motion. It is matter in motion that shows that there must be space and time, else motion would be impossible. Matter itself is eternal, it is infinite and has no begin or end. Therefore also time and space are infinite. No begin or end to space and time. But take care: we don\u2019t see \u2018matter\u2019 as such, we only see finite material configurations. By necessity, a finite material configuration has a begin and an end. But such as begin is not a begin in or from nothing, but from previous material forms, and like wise the end is not an end in nothing, but into something else. If we exclude the possibility of \u2018self-causation\u2019 (something emerging from nothing) and closed causal loops (something causing itself), then it would lead to the idea of the eternity and infinity of matter, without begin and end. If we take the observable universe (or a finite extension of it) as a finite material configuration, then sure, that too had a begin in time and was caused by some material causes prior to it. Time itself did not begin. Firstly, that notion is a misconception, because the begin refers to events happening in time. A begin of time can not be an event itself, that is self contradictionary. Secondly, you can not go (backtracking a physical model of the universe to the past) from the present observable universe, using valid theories and methods, back to a point of zero dimensions, without breaking one or more physics laws. So it is invalid to derive that the \u2018universe\u2019 would have started (begin of space time and matter from nothing) at some finite time ago. The idea of an absolute begin of time (and space and matter) thus does not belong to physical reality, it is a doctrine from philosophy, that has been put in by hand by theoretical physicists\u2026 They claim that physical laws existed prior to the universe, and allowed the universe to create itself \u2018from nothing\u2019. This is a wrong perception on so many accounts. Physical theories and principles are not themselves material, they only exist as mental models describing real matter in motion. They can only be approximately correct.Outside of matter, no physical laws exist! Where would the law of gravity exist, apart from matter in motion? It could only exist in mental form, requiring a mind. What mind exist prior to the existence of the universe?There is no physics equivalent of a \u2018nothing\u2019 - according to the physical laws and principles itself, such can not exist. It is a mental idea, and does not belong in physical reality.",

            "answer_text": "Time has an end and a beginning: My past has ended now and I have acquired it (I have)My future starts now and I'll shape it according to my wish (I will)The end and the beginning of the time continuously make my present (and so I am)There are only two singularities in my time: the day when I've started wishing and the day when I'll stop accomplishing... But in between it is my time! ------------------------------------------------------(ignore this; the time did not come...)There is a String theory and a M theory.Now look what I got from them:Sub-elementary particle contain some strings which vibrates and their vibrations is the origin of the energy/matter in our observable/three-dimensional universe. However to have vibrations in a string you need that string to be emerged in a flow or the string to be a margin in hole in a membrane to and something flowing through it. The M theory says that our universe is the membrane (although it has three dimensions instead of two, and it is sunken in a 13 dimensions universe.) This membrane, topologically may be a sphere (or something with an inner and outer,) and there are strings attached to it. These strings may be the margins of small holes through which the inner gets out, making the whole margin to vibrate. What is interesting: the flow produced from a difference of pressure between the inside and the outside cannot actually be observed on this surface in any other way that from the vibration it produces in the string, and since its flow cannot be reversed with means available on this surface, we may call it very well... TIME! Also, because the flow through these singularities/holes in the surface, the surface itself changes shape in their proximities (as pushing the surface of a balloon from inside to outside) and the holes tend to gather or to be attracted one to another. This effect we may call GRAVITY. Most of the holes cannot unite because the strong vibrations surrounding them produces STRONG FORCES which may keep them together but still apart forming atomic nuclei. Some other holes can join or break as well; and they actually do! I'm not going further with electro-magnetic forces and why there are only three free dimensions. Just two hints: among the 13 dimensions of the M universe, more than 3 can form such surfaces, also quarks are always three in any elementary particle in our universe! And yes, the membrane can also vibrate large and holes may disappear and re-appear on the nodes of interference of certain waves. Also: string and M theories are actually conjunctures at this time ;^) Big Bang theory is nice, but is merely an observation based on the Doppler effect and the Red Shift. It is also based on the assumption that the speed of light is a constant in the universe which is also an observed fact.  However what is not an observed fact - it is just an assumption - is that the speed of light was always a constant with the same value! If this assumption is not true, there may be other explanations for the shift toward red: what if in the past the speed of light was smaller?   Indeed: if in earlier stages of the universe the density of matter was bigger, the speed of light had to be smaller. In fact the speed of light is a constant in empty spaced: in glass, water and air it is smaller! And as the outer space is empty enough, it is still filled in with galaxies, stars, planets and ... light. This leads to a paradox: after the Big Bang, the density of matter was big and the speed of light had to be smaller - is a proof enough that the Big Bang theory is wrong, but if Big Bang did actually not happens, why the density of matter was bigger and the speed of light smaller?  Maybe Big Bang still has happened, but not at the moment predicted by the actual calculus based on a constant speed of light at all times; Could have happened at the moment of minus infinite of time!  So, does time have a beginning??? ",

            "answer_text": "As some have pointed out, time doesn't 'exist' independent of space. But that's not clear enough. Fundamentally, time is an emergent phenomena. The 'experience' of time emerges from the interaction of space and matter.  This become more evident with relativity - your experience of time changes with your interaction with space. Therefore, a clock in a spaceship doesn't experience time the same way you on planet earth do. Similarly, to the extent you consider BBT to be the correct model for beginning of the universe, time at the beginning was not the same as it is today -- you would have experienced it differently if you were there to see it. To put it differently, there is only one was for anyone to experience time -- to record the change in some entity, be it a clock or a decaying atom or the propagation of em waves. If everything in the universe simply stopped changing, you cannot experience time. So effectively, time 'stops'. Similarly, if the universe started to implode on itself in a big crunch, time would still continue, because the universe continues to change. But your experience of time -- your interaction with space/matter, might possibly change. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no definitive answer yet, as we simply have no way of knowing, but we can make educated guesses.  Time is probably not linear, and it possibly not one-dimensional.  In fact, it may not even be possible to generalize it to a given dimension, as it may be a function of several parameters that we are not even aware of.  For all we know, time could split off into an infinite amount of dimensions based on the possible actions of any given moment (Fatalists would disagree, though).  The \"Big Bang\" and \"Big Crunch\" theories seem to work for me, and possibly describe how the universe can remain in perpetual motion.  Since time is relative to motion (at least, among other things), and motion is driven by energy, entropy presents a problem -- what happens when the universe runs out of energy?  My guess is that the most recent Big Bang was not the first, and quite possibly, there was never a \"first\" just as there is no real beginning or end on a circle.  Black Holes are providing us with a few potential clues.  Interestingly, some Black Holes act like cosmic recyclers, spewing out hot streams of plasma once they reach a critical mass where (apparently) they can no longer contain matter. ",

To talk about the end of time, we cannot say that when our species gets extinct ,that's the end of time. We have not created time , it's a dimension of universe.

In all, it does rather depend on what we mean by time. Possibilities include: The subjective experience of successive events - in the absence of someone to experience the succession of events, time would cease to exist. So kill any observers, and time is gone. Time is just a dimension of things that exist. As such, the universe is not a dynamic entity, but a static one - what we would normally think of as the dynamical evolution of the universe is rather described by the overall phase space of the universe. This could not 'end' then, because there is no dynamical evolution, and hence no change. If time is the ordering of events in dynamical change, then time 'ends' when events cease to occur. This could happen after the heat death of the universe, when entropy has reached a maximum. This is essentially equivalent to the 'arrow of time' losing its direction. ",

If you can freeze light you can stop time, but to the relative observers they will never know that time was frozen. The constancy of the speed of light to a relative observer makes time appear constant in all spaces, but General Relativity suggests time behaves irregularly the more extreme the space. Time dilation paradoxes on the event horizon of a singularity demonstrates that local pockets of time and space can actually \"end\" in a coordinate puckered through a funnel in spacetime. But again, relative to an observer crossing the event horizon, it is the time outside the singularity that ends. ",

Or what must be is that time always existed and we started to count it from big bang(this is what I think). ",
