            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it is that hard to understand that accepting the harsh truths in life, leads to a very great and special kind of freedom. From my own perspective, I am going to try to explain this in a way which I hope is easy enough to understand. I Will begin by claiming that the harsh truths in life are the truths we fear the most, and so to accept the harsh truths, it is necessary that we must first find the strength and courage to be honest with our self and take a very good look at who we are, and recognize and admit to our selves, our own weaknesses. This amount to embarking on a quest for what is true, and that is done from a position of absolute personal responsibility for our own mistakes and our own pain, no matter whatever anyone else might have contributed to it all. It becomes understandable that a position of absolute responsibility for our own pain, we become aware of our own vulnerabilities. Also, personal responsibility for our own mistakes, is bound to be brutal, since facing the harsh truths actually requires us to let go and abandon the illusions of reality we created in our own minds and discover that we believed our own lies to our selves to justify our selves doing things that were wrong and harmful to other people. That is bound to require us to have to take in an awful dose of humility, especially since it will put us in touch with the negative consequences we have had on other people, and that is a path which can lead us to becoming aware that we have been making mistakes that we did not even know we were making. The personal benefits of accepting the harsh truths of life, leads to the realization that it is directly as the result of having been born in an imperfect world that we will have fears of not getting enough of what we need and want, including especially the fear that we might not be worthy and deserving of love, and that altogether, is exactly all which is responsible for all human weaknesses and character defects that will consume our life. If we can consider all this to be true, It then becomes possible to ultimately understand and become aware, that because we all use a combination of anger and denial to fight off our fears, that it is exactly that which very effectively keeps us blind to reality and mostly motivated to blindly and recklessly barge ahead, and we can begin to recognize and become aware that it is inevitable that we can make nothing but increasingly more serious mistakes, and that this in turns fuels the intensity of our fears, along with the intensity of the anger we need to fight off that fears. It becomes possible to understand that our anger can easily reach a point when it has become vengeful anger, which is more like a thirst that compels us to act destructively, and facing harsh truths will lead us to understand that we can much too easily end up having negative and destructive effects, including on people who need us and love us. And it has to be obvious that if we do not face the harsh truths in life, we will continue to see our self as innocent good people, and at the very same time, continue to trash about at our own life and the lives of other people. As an example, a man who was raised in poverty, might very well enter adulthood afraid of poverty, and he ends up absolutely driven to accumulate wealth, but all his success will do is serve to deny to himself that he is afraid of poverty, but his fear will continue to drive him to accumulate more because nothing is ever enough, and because he has ended up driven by greed, he is bound to hurt a lot of people to achieve his own personal goals, and he cannot know that nothing is ever going to be enough, and it fuels his frustrations and anger. It becomes understandable that facing harsh truths is all about confronting our fears, and it will lead us to understand that we really are only just pawns in a battle which is being fought in another dimension of existence, and it becomes increasingly impossible to dismiss the possibility that there might very well be a greater purpose for our existence. After all, is it not obviously true that no one escape the inevitable struggle of this life. Also, as intelligent human beings, we can also understand the difference between right and wrong, and it is inevitable that a times comes when we are forced to make the choice of accepting or denying personal responsibility for our self, and this of course naturally includes that a day may comes when, maybe because it has become no longer possible to escape our own responsibility for negative and or destructive effects we are responsible for, and we find our self force to make the choice of accepting life as a quest to seek what is true. Making the choice of confronting our fears and facing harsh truths to embark on a quest for what is true, is a process in which understanding is everything, and at first, small understandings by them self may not amount to much, but if they serve to release any new degree of energy in any new directions, or provide any degree of relief from pain or fear, we hang on to them and sort of set them aside much the same as if they were similar jig-saw puzzle pieces that we somehow know must fit together but don\u2019t yet know how. And if we persist on our quest for what is true, it will happen very much the same like an ever enlarging assembly of a jig saw puzzle will form an ever greater picture, that so will these different understandings that will revolve around the realities of life, will also in time begin to connect everything together, including every major events of our life, including all the bad and all the pain, and it can become absolutely obvious, that it is as if it was all not only inevitable, but also necessary to all happen exactly as it all did, and it will form a mental image that cannot be mistaken for anything else but what is true and reality itself, and it is a mental image which is increasingly revealing and liberating, and it cannot be directly communicated. This is something that can only be described as a waking process that brings about a new found freedom from fear and ultimately that is the path to the liberation of our own individual spirit. This is going to be experienced as a newly found appreciation, love, and respect for life and all which exits, and we know that it would never have been achieved any other way, other than having made the choice of facing harsh truths, and we end up ultimately understanding that it was not only inevitable that things would go wrong, but also necessary for everything to have happen exactly as it all did, in order that it became possible to find freedom. This will inevitably have the direct effect of transforming our self from being self-absorbed and angry, and into being a true asset to this world, and it is only after it has been achieved that we can be aware that we would choose to die rather than ever surrender it and go back to the way we once were. As an example of all this, we can understand that we will not suspect in the least, the gravity of our mistakes, when we have chosen to lie to someone who respect us and trust us. But the harsh truth about who we have become can be so absolutely brutal that it is near impossible for us to be aware of reality and admit to our self that we have chosen to lie because we knew it was necessary to get from somebody who trusted us, something that we know would not otherwise be voluntarily surrendered, and it is absolutely brutal to acknowledge to our self that this makes us not only no longer worthy or deserving of their trust and respect, but also no longer worthy or deserving of the trust and respect of anybody else. After all, is it not obvious that anyone aware that we have proven that we are capable of betraying the trust of people who have made the mistake of respecting us and trusting us, that they would need to be very great fools to risk trusting us. And is it no obviously true that if we make the mistake of respecting someone who does not really respect us, we risk loosing what we need to make our own way in the world. This is just the tip if the iceberg concerning harsh truths, and it gets even more brutal if we accept the following description of what is cowardice as reasonably accurate concerning what is true. And that is, \u201cAnyone who benefits in any ways, or legitimize or justify or gratify them self, and it is at the expense of someone else who is either more vulnerable or less fortunate, commits an act of cowardice\u201d, and is it not obviously also a harsh truth, that whenever we choose to lie to anyone, we place them in both a less fortunate and more vulnerable position. Also, is it not also a harsh truth that if we choose to betray the trust that anyone has in us, and it is after we have acted to earn their trust and respect, that is exactly how we transform our self into being a traitor, and could it also be true that in terms of sins against our own humanity, traitors belong right alongside murderers. Also, is it not also harsh truths, that the fact that whenever people makes such grave mistakes, that they don\u2019t know what they are doing, and this only serve to confirm their own shallow state of existence, and that in itself confirms that there are no excuses for ignorance, Is it not therefore also a harsh truth to discover that there might not even be one human being in this world, who can claim to have never told a lie during the span of their entire adult life. It really is only after recognizing what harsh truths really are, that we can begin to understand the benefits to anyone who finds the strength and courage to face the harsh truths in this life. It is understandable that this will ultimately lead them to understand that it was the fear of not getting enough of what they needed or wanted which is what was responsible for their weaknesses. They will also understand that it was because they were week that they choose to create illusions of reality in their own minds, and ended up believing their own lies to them self to be what is true as the means to justify them self making such horrible mistakes, and that as blind fools completely oblivious of what they were really doing. What becomes understandable is that anyone who somehow manage to find the strength and courage to be so brutally honest with them self, it is going to be only natural that they will also have found the strength and courage to rise above their fears, and by that same means, rise above their own weaknesses, and who they were can never again be in terms of having the strength to never again be driven to repeat those same mistakes. Confronting fears is the only means by which people can choose to come out of hiding and venture into the unknown where life promises to be always challenging, and interesting, and rewarding, and it can only be all experienced with gratitude for no longer being in a state of being a blind fool madly trashing about their own lives and the lives of people who come near to them. After all, is it not obvious that if we fail to confront our fears, we will not only be oblivious of that being true, but we will also be compelled to lock our self in, and turn out the light, and end up finding comfort hiding in the blackness. A probable very great benefit might be to discover to be true that the fun in life is right in the midst of the inescapable struggle of this life. It becomes possible that gratitude is experience for being aware that they will no longer be facing God still in a state of being an angry blind fool, force to claim that we are innocents for the mistakes we have made that had negative and destructive effects, and that because we did not know what they were doing. Therefore, we will obviously experience gratitude for understanding that should we end up dying still in a state of being an angry blind fool, that this would be like angrily blaming God for not making the world good enough for us and holding Him responsible for our own mistake, and that would amount to a rejection of that precious gift of life. Instead, if we somehow manage to find the strength and courage to rise above our own fears during the span of our life, we will have the opportunity to act for the sake of our own redemption, and it is bound to be with the hope that we will have the strength and courage to leave forgiveness for our self, entirely up to God, and not beg for mercy, but instead remain silent and accept our fate, should it be the worst, which maybe that the world would have been a better place if we had never been born, and still be able to express gratitude to God for having been fortunate enough to have been part of it all as an intelligent human being, and it is fair to expect that a merciful God would not condemn us to have to exists with the a tormented mind for eternity. It maybe a very harsh truth, that to end up being forced to exists for eternity in an other dimension of existence with a tortured mind, could very well be what hell might really be. ",

            "answer_text": "The harsh truth of life, what is the harsh truth of life? Truth is a completely different concept for everyone. There is no blanket overall truth to be known or accepted by the apparent masses. The harsh truth of life from the perspective of this apparent body /mind is that the identification as this body/mind can cling to nothing. Nothing can be permanent, all is transient and the death of this body/mind is a given. Its harsh and also absolutely beautiful because this truth is the driver in searching for the deathless, the unmoving, the unchanging, constant.. Peace itself. Where has this been found this abiding peace, this unmoving still ness, this blissful completeness? Here It is here as this now. Its always been here and I never left it, just thought I did, just believed there was something else and in the want of that , was a perpetuation of an idea of me, an impermanent me looking for permanence. The cosmic joke is.. In finding it, I left. In knowing it I am not. This is life's gift. To be up so totally as the edge of life , surfing life as life that I am no longer found here. I am this while no me is found here. No one to find benefit, no one to gain anything, no one to accept anything. The harsh truth of life as its apparent impermanence becomes the gift of grace in living the deathless ness of this\u2026 Die into and as this and the eternal is revealed Conciousness aware as conciousness.. No one left to judge or prefer or try. ",
