            "answer_text": "I've been an on-and-off teacher throughout the years. When I left College after A levels, I went to University to become a primary school teacher (ages 7-11). I quickly found that teaching the curriculum felt very constrained; there was no room to be spontaneous, and no chance to teach something \u201cjust because it's interesting\u201d as opposed to \u201cbecause it ticks off this part of the curriculum\u201d. The way modern teaching was set up, I thought, was a passion killer; I thought there must be a lot of passionate people out there who would make great teachers, only to be put off by the tiresome, prescriptive nature of the job. If you can do paperwork and stick to the script, you're fine. If you want to go off-piste, you're going to fail in this career, and probably end up hating it, too. On top of that, I found that other people's kids are quite often annoying little shits. I left University, without a clue what I would do, since I had always thought I would be a teacher. Eventually, I ended up becoming a Performance Analyst - a job I enjoy, but not the sort of job you set out at age 18 to pursue. I had always loved horses my whole life, however. I had ridden since I was eight years old, had a natural affinity with animals generally, and was passionate about horses. I'd had my own horses, so the minute my daughter turned 5 years old and was able to start riding lessons, I took her to my local yard to get started. I had learned to ride on the very same yard, and in fact my best friend had worked there since leaving school at 16. As a teen, I'd covered a few riding lessons on the yard, so I offered my friend my services and said if any staff were off sick, I'd be happy to cover. That's how I ended up teaching horse riding lessons to kids aged 5-16, two hours every Saturday afternoon, for the next ten years. I have taught total beginners and those with more experience, probably a couple hundred kids in total over those years. Lessons were completely up to me. I loved this kind of teaching; I could be creative and spontaneous, in fact I needed to be a lot of the time! Kids who came riding, wanted to be there. I could pass on my passion for horses. And I got a nice tan every summer, standing out in the arena, urging and instructing and praising my young riders! I found there were two types of kids I did not like to teach - one, those whose mothers made them ride when they hated it, and two, the spoilt brats. I had one girl who came every week because her mum liked to chat to the other mums. The girl hated riding, and would often be in tears when she arrived. I felt so bad for her, and was really glad when eventually her mum saw sense and stopped forcing her daughter to do a hobby she clearly hated. Please, parents, don't ever do this! The spoiled brats, I faced one down one week, and she walked out. I had put her name against a horse that she didn't like, because he was stubborn and difficult to get moving. She said, \u201cI'm not riding Tom! I don't like him! I want to ride Mary!\u201d The thing with horses is, some are easy and do their jobs and the kids don't have to try so hard. Some are stubborn and slow. Some are a bit frisky and only suitable for more confident riders. I explained to this kid that everyone wants to ride Mary cos she was so easy, but that meant everyone had to take turns so that they all had turns at riding stubborn ones and easy ones. She'd ridden Mary the previous week, so it was only fair to let someone else have a turn. This kid was so rude and so shitty towards me, if I'd been her mum I would have told her off for speaking to someone that way, but her mum just watched and let her spoilt brat carry on. She was also delaying the start of my lesson, so the other kids were losing time. I asked the other kids if anyone wanted to swap with her. No hands were raised, so I said, \u201csorry, it's Tom or it's no one\u201d. Then I turned away and began the lesson, ignoring her bratty little rant. And then, she dismounted and just walked out. I was furious, because one thing we teach the kids early is not to let go of a horse when there are other horses and kids around in an enclosed space. I went and caught the horse and off she went home with her mum, who had paid for the lesson and now lost her money. The difficult thing with that is, when the kid returns the following week, you have to take a deep breath and be nice to them, and forget the way they spoke to you and behaved. They are just kids, and it's the parents\u2019 fault if they are spoilt. But I have to bite my tongue not to be sarcastic or extra-critical or put her on Tom again, just to spite her\u2026 someone has to be the adult here! All the other kids, were a pleasure. Some have more natural ability than others, and it's a pleasure to see them getting noticeably better each week! I had one with no natural ability at all; she was clunky, heavy-handed and sat like she was twice her actual weight. But she was a nice kid, never complained about which horse she rode, and always tried her best to follow my instructions and advice. She got to the point of just not having the ability to get any better - but I didn't mind teaching her because she was nice, and she tried, and she really loved riding, even though she was quite terrible at it. She had the passion, if not the ability, so I happily taught her and gave her fun lessons the whole time she rode with us, with little improvement. She was actually in my best class\u2026 she'd worked hard and earned that, and I respected her for effort. I could easily make challenges slightly easier for some riders if need be! The horses themselves were also good teachers; the easy ones were confidence-givers, the stubborn ones increased rider persistence and strength, the frisky ones improved spontaneous reaction from the rider and taught patience and outside-the-box thinking. It's great to see, since the yard ceased teaching lessons, some of those kids are now young adults with their own horses, and their passion for horses was helped along by me! At work, I was also seconded to IT Training for 6 months, where I trained staff on a new system we were getting. This was mainly so I could understand that system from start to finish, to better understand the data, which was esentially for my Analyst job. I was told I was a great Trainer, and asked if I'd stay on in IT training. But I said no; I like working from home in my current job, I like geeking out with databases and spreadsheets, and some days I don't feel that sociable. Plus, the training job is paid less than my job, but the secondment was ok because they kept me on the same money whilst I was there. So, that's my on-off teaching career! As a teacher, as long as you're a trier, I like teaching you. I like when you ask questions, because that means you want to really understand. I don't like argumentative, disruptive little shits who spoil others\u2019 experience, or spoilt brats. I'd have hated to have taught myself at school! Which is why, in my experience, teaching a sport that kids actually wanted to learn, where I could do things my own way, was the best kind of teaching. ",

            "answer_text": "I like teaching people things, especially practical skills. Some examples I often find myself teaching people are: 1) how to drive a manual transmission car - the first few of us in my group of friends to buy cars bought manuals. As the rest of the friends saw the benefits a manual offers, they wanted to learn. I offered my car and experience for practice. 2) gun safety and shooting tips - I grew up shooting and hunting, whereas most of my friends did not. They became interested in guns for the same reasons many folks do - shooting sports, history, home defense - but never spent years with their fathers and uncles drilling safety into them while out hunting. Whenever we go to the gravel pit I operate as our RO and offer tips. 3) how to be a passenger on a motorcycle - there are some very specific do's and don'ts associated with this that I must teach each new passenger I give a ride to. I enjoy the challenge of figuring out the best way to explain something to a person of a vastly different background than myself. I also have seen that it is infinitely easier to teach a person something if they have a true personal desire to learn it - they ask questions and they progress extremely quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "The Story Of A Young Refugee I am from Afghanistan and moved to Pakistan in 1999 due to Taliban War against govt. I got my Primary education, Matriculation and Faculty of Science (Pre Medical) certificates in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. Currently, I am doing MD. I was not so good in primary school. I was naughty and talkative. I was 2nd in Pre-first and first grade, jumped into Third and was 3rd, in 4th i was at 4th position. But From 5th to 12th grade, got 1st postilion in each class. I was the 3rd representative of class in 5th grade and 1st Representative in 6th to 10th grade. In 11th grade I was 1st Proctor of class and when went to 12th grade I was appointed as head of all representatives of all classes in college. I also represented my school and college in Quiz, Debates, War of Tag game (as captain) and Cricket team. I used to share my knowledge with my class in my school time because I was the 1st position holder and had clear concepts of all subject especially science. I think I was in 4th class when I started helping IMAM SAHAB of Our Mosque in teaching Holy Quran to children. I also used to teach The Holy Quran to my mom because she hadn\u2019t Learnt in childhood (it was the duty of my sister but sometimes I did it). When I was in 8th Class I started working as a tutor for the first time when an aunt brought her son and daughter to me and request to teach them. It was started and then soon I got many students. I was in 9th class when I started teaching part time to students of the same level. Chemistry, Physics, Biology, English, Basics of the computer (from 1st to 8th grade), Mathematics (from 1st to 10th grade). The interesting thing here is that I was so shy in start especially toward female of the same level but later became professional. I also worked in a local middle school as a teacher only 3 days and then resigned. One day I went to Boys Section of Read Foundation (Home -READ (Home -READ)) High School in our area and wanted hand over my CV but came back from the door just to due to fear of rejection. Next day I went again and handed over my CV. They needed a science teacher and they were so much impressed by my academic performance & social behavior (all the staff knew me because I was the topper of the best school in the area). I passed test and interview and got selected and worked here for about 2 years. I was the youngest most junior among teachers because I was only 18 with FSc (12th grade) certificate and A NEW TEACHER in SCHOOL. All others were above 25 and with Masters and Bachelor degree holders with at least 5 years of experience. I taught Chemistry, Biology and General Science and also helped students in other subjects as much as possible. I used to listen and solve all the problems of students and soon became the most popular and favorite of students. But I proved my abilities and was given Headship of Examination Committee and then the Headship of Discipline Committee. All this increased my interest and I became more keen in my work. And the day came when Head of Our section resigned and I was selected as Acting Head of Boys Section for one month. It was my success, In my one month headship school system became much better although there was lack of budget for many things needed to be improved. I listened to each teacher and student and worked to solve all the problems. All this continued until April 2016 and then I moved to Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, I joined an education center as English Teacher and Teacher of Graphics Designing but resigned and continued working as a freelancer. Many of my students are elder than me. Some have got married even some have kids, soon some of my students are going to get their professional degrees before me. All of them are in Pakistan and I am in Afghanistan now but still, they respect me, love me and remember me. That\u2019s Why I Love Pakistan same as my homeland Afghanistan. In 18 years, I never faced racism or nationalism or any other issue.Thanks Pakistan and specially people of Mirpur, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. ",

Perhaps I\u2019ll give you a sample of one:  This dragon is an Asian dragon. Of course, with the long prominent whiskers, no wings, and short legs, everyone knows that it is a Chinese dragon\u2026at least, if you are a fan of dragons. ",

I have had two that out did me by several orders of magnitude and 3 more that are a lot better than I am. A lot of the work is interfacing analog hardware with a digital world in ways other than using a A/D converter. I am amazed that students today don\u2019t to learn to profile and optimize code, write projects in multiple languages on more than one computer using distributed processing. Or write a program using features of different languages and operating systems to solve even a simple problem. They run into this kind of problem all the time. Take data from Excel, then do work on it and write a statical report and put it in a paper. Cran R makes it lot easier to do but a few short C programs piped together calling the R scripts can do much faster. One student managed to write script that makes a list passing out all the parts out to parallel processors on the same or different computer and reassemble the results. That takes things a great deal beyond what I had in mind when I discussed it with him. Everyone of us should teach a kid how to do something better than they know how to do today. ",
