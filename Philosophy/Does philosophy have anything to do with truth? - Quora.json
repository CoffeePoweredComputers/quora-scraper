            "answer_text": ">>>Does philosophy have anything to do with truth?<<< Let me put it this way: All that I read in respect to \u201cPhilosophy\u201d does meticulously, conspicuously, imho deceptively AVOID. Namely providing a clear definition (proclamation, determination = assertion) what truth is, in a nutshell. (1) Truth = awareness = individual observed-HOOD = knowledge = Information or informed-HOOD = property = opinion = subjective momentary-construct = imaginary mere-effect = epiphaenomenon = element of the human consciousness Wahrheit = Bewusstheit = Individuelle Wahr-GENOMMEN-heit = Wissen = Information oder Informiert-HEIT = Eigenschaft = Meinung = subjektives Momentan-Konstrukt = imagin\u00e4rer nur-Effekt = Epiphaenomen = Element des menschlichen Bewusst-SEINS \u2192 (2) The individual human consciousness is an epiphaenomenon, BECAUSE it is the entirety of the momentarily-being elicited TRUTHS in the individual brain Das individuelle menschliche Bewusstsein ist ein Epiphaenomen, DENN es ist die momentan hervorgerufen werdende Gesamtheit an individuellen Wahrheiten  Now, WHERE do we read these two proclamations? NO WHERE! All that we DO read on this occasion, it is: Epiphenomenalism - Wikipedia Das Epiph\u00e4nomen des Bewu\u00dftseins - Tabula Rasa Magazin and WHERE do we read a praeliminary collection, compilation, listing of TRUTHS? NO WHERE! Well, and in all humility, I WILL provide a praeliminary listing below.  Truth is - as such, it-self, on its own a subjective, momentary construct. A mere-GIVEN from a GIVER which is the cosmos as such, in the first place, the primary GIVER. Via an observation-process. Any truth is as such, it-self, on its own non-observable, It is merely uttered, manifested, proclaimed, symbol-IZED, object-IFIED, determined, defined, asserted. An utteration, manifestation, proclamation, symbol-IZATION, object-IFICATION, determination, definition, assertion OF truth is observable and a secondary GIVER of truth. \u201cProperty\u201d, \u201cTruth\u201d and \u201cexistence\u201d The symbols mean the same: They are synonymous with \u201copinion\u201d \u201cProperty\u201d, \u201cTruth\u201d and \u201cexistence\u201d is, as such, it-self, on its own, an \u201dopinion\u201d The eventual (outside-brain-)source- = CAUSE-, namely of truth = existence = information = property is the observable, the facts, Information-SOURCES, matter that is.The immediate momentaneous-CREATOR = exciter, of truth = information = property is the brain.Any truth = information = property is an inside-brain EFFECT, a subjective, imaginary, momentary CONSTRUCT. Made up, elicited, fabricated, faked that is. During and ONLY during an observation process, ONLY as long as the observation process even endures, that is. The observation process can also be totally internal. Memories, dreams, phantom sensations including those on a missing limb the patient had never had in the first place, and hallucinations such as Near Death- and out-of-body-experiences are examples. In any case, a truth = information = property is aka thought, awareness, knowledge, opinion, concept - and, for a further clarification what I mean I symbolize TRUTH also through my own and quite favored \u201cobserved-HOOD\u201d - and it is always an EFFECT, TO-, ON- OF-, obtained/acquired FROM-, ABOUT- CAUSE = FACT, Information-SOURCE, object[IVE templates], matter, the cosmos [as such] = [PRIMARY] information-SOURCE. The imaginary realm of any information is logically following from the consideration, namely that any information is, scientifically demonstrable, elicited inside the brain (we scientists, I am one, DO even know what location of the brain does account for a specific kind of information) - YET the brain does not-, it will indeed NEVER: Provide the information that all that it IS eliciting inside, BE being elicited inside. It rather provides the information (which is effectively a simulation) namely that all that it IS eliciting inside, BE accurately located where the observable-, the just being-observed-template is, outside the brain that is.The objectivity, the permanence of any subjective, imaginary, momentary CONSTRUCT = TRUTH = INFORMATION = observed-HOOD = PROPERTY, it is merely made up, elicited, fabricated, faked that is, through an observable and durable (permanent) utterance, an expression, manifestation, proclamation, symbol(ification), object(ification), definition, determination, 2nd-hand (Secondary) Information-SOURCE, an assertion, of the respective CONSTRUCT. Mostly on the patient paper.My proclamation - PRIMARY information-SOURCEversus TRUTH = INFORMATION = PROPERTYversus SECONDARY Information-SOURCE = object-IFICATION of TRUTHdoes not only reflect the Triangle of Reference = Semiotic Triangle: REFERENT versus REFERENCE versus SYMBOL that is, but also the \u201c3 worlds\u201d (realms) by Sire KR POPPER: world 1 versus world 2 versus world 3 All that I am introducing as a logical and inescapable innovation is, what is generally unbeknown: TRUTHS = PROPERTIES = INFORMATIONS = momentary subjective constructs. Summarized as observed-HOODS I am the first author worldwide, of a praeliminary listing of TRUTHS which comprises ALL sensations, emotions, problems, values (such as beauty and usefulness), ought-, should-, and must-HOODS, necessities that is; meanings, intentions, purposes, desires-/ wills - and the respective counteremotions. Such as: Love and hate, appreciation and disgust, bright-NESS and dark-NESS.ALL parameters in the language of physics: MASS, distance, area, space, density, time, velocity, acceleration (gravity is an example), force, impulse, pressure, power, ENERGY, temperatureALL Constants, Axioms, fields in the language of physics. And all LAWS - of legislature, AND of logic, morality, physicsALL them so very well KNOWN G-Ds such as YHWH, Jesus (THE) Christ, AllahAnyone who believes that any of these truths = momentary subjective constructs be in existence as such, on its own, in self sustained existencecan do anything in other words: Be a cause, a causal agency, can changerather than being a mere simulation, is subscribed/committed to a faith which I call religious.

            "answer_text": "Philosophy is about giving you the thinking tools to seek truth for yourself. Philosophy is not going to lead you to truth. You are the only one that can lead yourself to truth.  For example, your car is not going to get you to school. You driving your car to school is going to get you to school.  Philosophy is not going to get you to truth. You using philosophy and seeking truth is going to lead you to truth.  Does philosophy have anything to do with truth? Can someone disagree with all philosophers but still be correct? The answer to both question is a yes.  ",

            "answer_text": "Historically, the main distinguishing feature of philosophy versus ancient wisdom teachings is the clear presence of an epistemology in the work, or philosophy of knowledge. Since Plato, the standard account of knowledge has been that knowledge is justified true belief, sometimes called the JTB account. Each represents its own distinct condition for knowledge and can be studied independently. Most epistemology discuss theories of epistemic justification. Metaphysics, ontology, and logic discuss theories of truth. Belief is usually part of the discussion of philosophy of mind, which is often intertwined with philosophy of language. So yes, theories of truth primarily come out of philosophical discussions. You could call it one of the three pillars of philosophy. To get an introductory overview of some of the theories and issue which have been discussed so far, you might like to read Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). ",

Other branches of philosophy do not claim to deal with truth, but in how to best explain topics such as epistemology - how we acquire knowledge, ethics- how do we determine good and evil, aesthetics- the nature of beauty, and several others which address all our experiences about our world. Philosophy cannot lead us to ultimate truth. ",
