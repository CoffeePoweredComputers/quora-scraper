            "answer_text": "There is no difference between an opinion and a belief. To answer your question, NO. Not all beliefs are subjective. Take, for example, my belief that Mars has two moons. This belief is justified by numerous empirical observations, that makes it objective. Maybe we will discover some other moon orbiting around Mars. Given that possibility, I could revise my belief slightly that, given all empirical evidence to date, Mars has two moons. It qualifies as justified true belief and is therefore considered knowledge. Now let\u2019s consider a subjective belief. I believe that I am experiencing the tactile sensation of typing as I write this answer. No one else can feel this sensation but me. I have privileged epistemic access to the sensation. But it is also true and justified. Therefore, I know that I am feeling this sensation. The difference between subjective and objective belief is the epistemic access to the content of the belief. In the first case, the content of the belief is something external to myself\u2014Mar\u2019s moons. Access to those requires going at least to the Wikipedia page and doing a minute\u2019s worth of reading. It\u2019s fallible, but unlikely false in this case. The content on that page is verified by astronomers using telescopes. In the second case, the content of the belief is something only I have access to. Perhaps one day neuroscience will be able to individuate sensations, but for now this type of belief is subjective because no one else can access the content of the belief. ",

The problem of the \u201cother\u201d, in which you determine if others exist, to what extent you exist, and the goals of musing with the intent of communication, and communicating with the intent of pursuading, etc. \u201copinion\u201d X, presumably expressed in a known language, in the context of others, with the intent of pursuasion, and eliciting a personally meaningful response, etc. becomes a part of a consensual reality in which the subjective is shared and developed and the \u2018objective\u2019 is immaterial. Given an accord in this context then opinion becomes \u2018fact\u2019 no more or less meaningful. Given a context of objective reality where the unobserved bear does in fact shit in the woods, opinion is always forever subjective, and may be deemed in line with objective reality, and true, and thus also an objective fact.

If you could objectify an opinion or belief, it would become knowledge or fact. Epistemologically, the differences between knowledge, facts, opinions, and beliefs can become blurred because everything we think we know is based on assumptions (axioms). But in the real, everyday, world of human experience, knowledge and facts are the best representations of objective reality that we have. As Stephen Jay Gould points out:  In science, \u2018fact\u2019 can only mean \u2018confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.\u2019 I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.
