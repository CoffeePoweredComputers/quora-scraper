            "answer_text": "If the person has done something socially or legally unacceptable, then its once choice whether to take action against them. Well i recommend going for it . But if they have done something that has hurt your feelings or self-esteem, I think cutting off all ties with such a person would be a better idea. Or if you cant avoid being in the same place at the same time with them, as they are your colleagues/schoolmates/relatives, minimize interaction with them. One may have a much more peaceful time by diminishing the negativity in their life and spending their time with the people who actually love and support them. You may start developing your interests and doing the things that you love, rather that plotting a revenge on or sulking about that person who may even does not deserve a second of your life. Some stupid person should not take your peace away. Life is much bigger than that, there is so much more to it than some hurtful episodes. So turn your eyes to the new doors that God has opened for you, and leave the ground where you have been hurt. Liberate yourself from that sorrow, darkness and the feeling of avenge, and explore all the possible ways in which you can find yourself, unleash your potential and make your life beautiful and meaningful again. Do the things that scare you, excite you, liberate you. Do whatever makes you feel like yourself. And suffering is definitely not it. Remember, strength is not the ability to not get hurt, but to be able to rebound from that situation which afflicts you. And one got to be strong right now. Take your time, you are allowed to be upset for some time. After that try to analyse the situation and figure out what actually went wrong, so you are better in sync with your emotions and careful of your own ways, the type of company you actually enjoy and are comfortable with and what you actually look for in a person. You can also discuss with that person who hurt you about the issue, if possible and does not disturb your mental state. But if the doesnt seem to understand your concerns and starts confronting you or getting rude towards you, leave right away, without any regrets. You have done the last and most appropriate thing you could have done to address the issue. Make peace with yourself, and accept that the person wasnt ever supposed to be in your life. Your life is yours, and you will decide what matters to you and who you want to be with. YOU HAVE NEW ROAD TO TAKE NOW!! ",

            "answer_text": "Doing something defines you, represents your character be it good or evil. Here in your question you are defining someone as evil I think he has done some immoral/evil things to someone or let's just consider that that \u201csomeone\u201d is you. Now you are considering him as evil because of his actions towards you. After doing something evil to him you will also be considered an evil person because of your actions towards him. Now this will turn into a vicious cycle of hate. A great personality(Martin Luther King Jr) once said that \u201cDarkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that, hate cannot drive out hate only love can.\u201d If you try to be a better person and treat an evil dude with love there are fair chances for him to change if your not that good of a person then just leave him to be and he will surely face consequences for his actions one way or the other. Don't get down to his level or try to change into him instead just try to bring him upto your standards. I hope you will do what needs to be done. ",
