            "answer_text": "The \"neural correlates of consciousness\" (the NCCs) is a concept that was coined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick in 1990 to frame the attempt to understand consciousness in a scientifically tractable way. Before Crick & Koch came along, studying consciousness was a taboo topic in neuroscience and psychology research, and so no one was \"allowed\" to study it. William James, arguably the father of modern psychology in the 1890s, was fascinated with consciousness and wrote about it extensively. The problem was that the scholarly study of psychology was all over the place, and popular theories like those of Freud and Jung were basically untestable, so there was no way to reach scientific consensus on the reality of these conceptual models. The behaviorists came along in the 1920s to 1960s (notably B.F. Skinner) and argued convincingly that anything that cannot be observed with instruments is irrelevant to science. They went so far as to discredit any study of subjective experience, especially consciousness, to the point that consciousness did not actually exist as a phenomenon according to legitimate psychology research. Francis Crick, with credibility earned from his Nobel prize discovering DNA, took up the task, with Christof Koch, of defining consciousness scientifically. Their model was that consciousness exists scientifically because: People report it; andWhat they perceive subjectively can be measured, as with the Face-Vase illusion mentioned by Joyce Schenkein, or with binocular rivalry experiments.With conscious experience now measurable scientifically, Crick & Koch set out to frame the search for its underlying neural mechanisms. They framed the problem in terms of the NCCs: Some neurons are clearly not involved in consciousness, for example the neurons activated in the visual brain that represent visual features you didn't see (e.g. in binocular rivalry).Other neurons clearly are involved in consciousness, since you reported an experience, and the chain reaction of action can be traced backwards to neurons that represent what you saw. These are the \"neural correlates of consciousness\" or the NCCs.They didn't say these NCC neurons are conscious, nor that they cause consciousness, only that they are correlated with it. This was now a tractable scientific problem: Find the NCCs, figure out what makes NCCs different from non-NCCs, and figure out the relationship between the NCCs and reported subjective conscious experience. This framing opened up much scholarly discussion and started a thaw of the deep-freeze on the study of consciousness in scientific circles. Now after 20 years of scientific investigation, the idea of the NCCs is slowly, itself, fading away. The NCC framing is fine, but it is increasingly clear that consciousness is not the result of special neurons or special circuits. Consciousness is appearing more and more to be a process that can incorporate some neurons or others at different times depending on the holistic pattern of neural activity in the brain. So a particular neuron might be correlated with consciousness in one moment, but not in the next. Thus the NCCs are not particular neurons with special properties, but rather populations of neurons at a particular moment in time in the context of the global signaling dynamics going on in the brain at that moment. The currently dominant thinking on the neural mechanisms of consciousness is a combination of the \"global neuronal workspace\" concept (of Stanislas Dehaene) and the Information Integration Theory (IIT) of Giulio Tononi. Christof Koch is, himself, a particular fan of IIT. This review of Dehaene's latest book compares the progression of consciousness research from the NCCs to current theory: Page on brainfacts.org Related What is consciousness?What defines the conscious vs. the unconscious parts of the brain?Is consciousness an emergent property of the brain or a fundamental property of matter?

            "answer_text": "In recent studies, through functional magnetic resonance, Dehaene, Tononi and other neuroscientists have identified the brain areas that are active only during conscious perception but not in simple unconscious perception. Other studies on \"hemineglect\" highlight the areas of the brain whose injury causes the loss of Consciousness but does not prevent the unconscious perception. These researches have as a result that specific areas of the Cerebral Cortex are the neural correlates of Consciousness. Instead, for example, the removal of the cerebellum damaged by trauma does not prevent the explication of Consciousness. The injury of the brain stem causes the loss of Consciousness but also prevents unconscious perception. Consciousness ensures that within the vast unconscious perception, information selected in a utilitarian way is quickly memorized. Such information, once present in the Memory, may be producing mental images that alone or together with conscious images from the external environment are used to reason (and to communicate with other subjects in the case of Man or the apes). Oakley and Halligan (2017) based on studies about hypnosis (eg, Schlegel et al., 2015, Lush et al., 2017), the divided brain (Gazzaniga, 1988), decision making (Libet et al., 1983 ) and neglect (eg, Driver and Mattingley, 1998; Frigato, 2014), have come to the conclusion that brain operations responsible for all our mental activities take place at the unconscious level. Activities that include perceptions, actions and emotions, but also reasoning, self-control and sense of self. Oakley and Halligan do not use the generic concept of \"Consciousness\", but they operate the very useful distinction between Personal Narrative (contents of Consciousness) and Personal Awareness (experience of Consciousness) emphasizing how the latter constantly accompany the first in parallel, without minimally influencing the mechanisms responsible for our mental abilities. On the other hand, the Personal Narrative \"serves the powerful evolutionary functions of enabling individuals to communicate (external broadcast) the contents of internal broadcasting\" and to deposit the contents of consciousness in the higher level Memoirs: Semantic, Episodic and Autobiographical. Reading this article helped me a lot in revisiting the theoretical work I have undertaken to try to identify the neural correlates of consciousness (Frigato, 2014). Something I haven't done in my analysis was making the distinction between Personal Narrative and Personal Awareness. Another distinction that can be made is that between simple automatic unconscious mechanisms and complex unconscious mechanisms (e.g., Gazzaniga, 1988; Moscovictch and Umilt\u00e0, 1991; Frigato, 2014). The first are not accompanied by the Personal Narrative and therefore not even by Personal Awareness, the latter instead yes. An example of automatic mechanism is to drive along a road well known to us, perhaps even overtaking, stopping at traffic lights, etc., and realizing only after a certain time, to have passed through it without remembering that we did it. There are therefore unconscious automatic behaviors which we cannot refer about and that we cannot memorize in the 3 higher level Memoirs. Instead the most important and complex unconscious experiences, being able to give rise to the Personal Narrative, can be deposited in the 3 Memoirs which are the source of mental images. In my opinion (Frigato, 2014) the images of the external environment and the mental images present in the Personal Narrative are used not only to exchange information with our neighbors (Oakley and Halligan, 2017), but also to be able to learn in a manner complex through reasoning. Therefore the Personal Narrative not only provides the great evolutionary advantage of being able to communicate with others, but also gives reasoning ability. It can therefore be assumed that up to fish and amphibians there are only automatic learning and memory mechanisms and, starting from the reptiles, a minimum capacity of reasoning appeared, which evolved in birds and mammals to reach the highest levels of efficiency in man (Bitermann and Mackintosh, 1969; Denton,2006). Through a review of the literature related to neglect, I hypothesized (Frigato, 2014) that the mechanism that produces the Personal Narrative is made of 8 + 8 large areas specularly present in the two cerebral hemispheres. They all work simultaneously in parallel as \"points of convergence\" between the 3 higher level Memories and other 8 + 8 brain areas specialized in perception and movement. The latter are responsible respectively for the recognition of a specific object, its position in space, the emotions it produces, the position of the body with respect to the object itself, the state of the body at the moment of perception and the 3 motor potentials related to that object. In the specific case of visual Personal Narrative (Frigato, 2014), the medial-superior temporal lobe work as a \u201cpoint of convergence\u201d and keep simultaneously active both the occipital and inferior temporal cortices, responsible for visual perception, and the precuneus-posterior cingulate, the seat of 3 Superior Memories. Therefore, to obtain the Personal Narrative of external perception, in addition to the image that comes from the environment, the mirror memory corresponding to that image should to be simultaneously activated and superimposed. Conversely when the Personal Narrative is produced through visual mental images that come from memory, the superior-medial temporal lobe simultaneously maintains active the neurons in the sensorial cortices (occipital and inferior temporal), which have been the source of external visual perception in the corresponding previous experiences. There would therefore be a continuous feedback and alternation between activation of the neurons responsible for perception and those responsible for memory. With mental images there would obviously be a predominance of precuneus memory, while during external perception the prevailing activities would be in the sensory cortices (Ganis et al., 2004; Mechelli et al., 2004). As already highlighted, Oakley and Halligan operate the very useful distinction between Personal Narrative and Personal Awareness. They say that after trying to explain the Personal Narrative, the \"New Hard Problem\" still remains to solve the identification of the neural mechanisms of Personal Awareness: \"How and why do neurophysiological activities produce the \"experience of consciousness\"?\"; (Chalmers, 1996). My theoretical work (Frigato, 2014) tries to explain the feeling of Personal Awareness with the fact that, in the production of Personal Narrative, are involved the 8 + 8 \"points of convergence\", the 3 Memories, and 8 + 8 sensory and motor areas. All these areas acting simultaneously and in parallel could create a wide \"psychophysical activation\" such as to produce Personal Awareness. For example, the images coming from the external environment or the mental images of a red sunset, of a green landscape, of human faces and so on, would create practically infinite different combinations of psychophysical sensations. Such as to explain how Personal Awareness varies at any moment and is absolutely private and personal. The presence of these almost infinite combinations would also explain why the problem of Personal Awareness appears as a \"Hard Problem\": the human brain usually reasons on at most 3-4 spatio-temporal dimensions and therefore finds hard to explain rationally such large and complicated combinations.
