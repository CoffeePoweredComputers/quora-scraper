            "answer_text": "Revenge and Justice are two separate concepts that may occasionally intersect but are frequently at odds with each other.  The Justice System does not exist to extract revenge nor does it ever make any claims of doing so. The purpose of the justice system is to ensure a stable and prosperous society; where contracts are enforced, and people treat each other within the generally accepted parameters of fairness and decency. If someone deviates from these social norms, whether through failing to deliver on their contract, taking someone else's property by force, or committing a murder etc an effort is made to punish them. The intent behind this effort is to deter others from similarly stepping beyond the legislated boundaries. By stipulating and enforcing a punishment, the government can hope that most people, out of the fear of the consequences, will respect the law. Additionally, by either incarcerating, executing, or rehabilitating the criminal, it is hoped that he/she would not commit further crimes.  Now occasionally, the punishment may give solace or closure to the victims or their loved ones. However unless the punishment is a form of restitution, it rarely does. I do not have any empirical evidence to back up this claim (at the moment). Anecdotaly, I believe that most people do not get \"revenge\" through the justice system. Victims or their families, do not get their lives back and often have to go through years of therapy before experiencing anything approaching closure or normalcy.  An interpersonal act of revenge is usually extra-judicial and is thus highly discouraged by the justice system. In fact, when people seek out revenge, it usually an indicator that the justice system has failed to do its job in maintaing order and stability. This is a very common trope in movies and tv shows. The protagonists usually seek out revenge when the original perpetrators either go free or do not receive adequate punishment. In general most governments go to great lengths to discourage this kind of behavior as it is very injurious to prosperity. As most conflicts come from business related transactions, governments have a strong incentive to prevent rent-seeking and enforce contracts. Otherwise, people would resort to acts of violence to enforce contracts etc. This would discourage business, growth and innovation etc. I could go on... but I think I made my point. Please feel free to disagree/ask questions in the comments and I will revise my answer accordingly.    ",
