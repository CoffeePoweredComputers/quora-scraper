            "answer_text": "It\u2019s said that in the spiritual realm time is conspicuous by it\u2019s absence. I\u2019ve found that when I go deep into meditation I\u2019ll sometimes experience a very brief moment when time ceases to exist and everything is somehow intransient and immutable. It\u2019s sort of like seeing a teeny tiny light at the end of a tunnel but it\u2019s enough to kindle renewed enthusiasm and abundant energy every time it happens. ",

The other was during my Enlightenment experience where during the space of about a second and a half in physical time I had so much experience that it can sometimes take me as long as four hours to give a detailed account of what I experienced.
