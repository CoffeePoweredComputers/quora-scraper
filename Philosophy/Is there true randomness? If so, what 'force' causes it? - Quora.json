            "answer_text": "It's a rare occasion when I can suggest a definition that is more than just arbitrary. While many who have studied mathematics, myself included, will be primed to associate randomness and probability, the two are only marginally related. Probability deals with how accurately we can predict events given what we know of the universe. That is more of a mathematical topic, so we should limit ourselves to the other form of randomness.  The more common description of randomness in the extant, physical world is that of an event that can not be predicted, not because of our limited capacities, but because it is independent from causality. When I say independent from causality, I really do mean an event for which there is no cause.  As they could not be explained at all, let alone through any kind of physics, random events could be bumped up to the level of being metaphysical events. The metaphysical level is generally accepted as the source of all rules governing the physical universe (think of it as the definition of such). Together, all of the basic laws of physics constitute metaphysics.  So let us promote randomness to a metaphysical law. This, however is to state that randomness is not only permitted, but necessitated inasmuch as it is a metaphysical principle that governs the physical world. Thus an uncaused event is caused (by the law), which of course butts up against the definition. Randomness is the presence of uncaused events.  Let's talk about how we perceive events. It lends a perspective that is useful to a comprehensive understanding of this topic.  Knowing what we do of human nature, it seems clear that we are capable of perceiving the world only with a limited number of frameworks. One is space. Another is time. Inexorably tied to our understanding of time is our belief in the absoluteness of causation. We are incapable of acting in the world as though random events happen. When the snake strikes, we recoil to avoid it. When tax day comes, we leave the country.  Our reactions are automatic, because we are hardwired (as opposed to just being intellectual believers) to treat the world as a machine that will give reactions. We do not hold out any hope of random events playing a role in our lives any more than we wait for time to flow backwards or for space to collapse into one dimension.  All of this is important to know, as it addresses the chief objection to my theory: We do not possess absolute knowledge that causation is a force in the universe, and we definitely do not know that random events do not occur.  The skeptic's objection is sound. In order to know anything with certainty, we must have immanent knowledge of the entire cosmos. I won't be holding my breath for that. The standard is so high that no information of any value can ever survive its scrutiny. My response to the objection is that even if we dismiss the proof I have given in the first section, people simply can not abandon the notion that every event is the effect of a cause, and every event leads to a causal effect. Since that's how we are programmed, we must be mindful of that in our everyday decisions.* Sometimes randomness is not invoked in the metaphysical sense. This term is used lazily by people to describe events that they simply do not understand. The examples are everywhere: Weather patterns are random.Nuclear decay is random.Light patterns passing through a slit are random....ad nauseum.  Our reply to this should reflect the lessons of intellectual history, remembering that most superstitious explanations of phenomena are proven wrong with enough time and discovery. The wise man would say, as did Steven Hawking in The Grand Design, that we do not need to inject randomness as a metaphysical principle (he argues against the God of Gaps) simply to explain events we do not comprehend.  And that's all that randomness really is! It is an effort of saying \"I don't understand what's happening, therefore it is an uncaused event.\" Disingenuous, sloppy, and ultimately damaging to a progressive humanity. To the highest standard anything can be known, uncaused events do not occur.=====*Our everyday decisions that are directly affected by a proper view of causality will be everything from illusory belief in free will, attribution of responsibility in law, and the myriad of debunked religious dogmas. Should anyone wish to discuss these topics further, I would consider it a pleasure. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's say you want to understand reality. Then you want to make a mental model of reality that makes accurate predictions about it. A good mental model should be able to assign a number between 0 and 1 to every outcome in possibility-space, such that all the numbers add up to 1. We call these numbers \"probabilities\". When your best mental model insists on spreading its probability-mass in a fuzzy blob, e.g. when Weather.com assigns 0.1 to \"it will rain tomorrow\" and 0.9 to \"it won't rain tomorrow\", then we say that an event is \"random\" relative to your mental model. So \"random\" is a property of a possibility, defined with respect to a predictive model. When you ask a computer to give you a random number, it's random with respect to you, because you don't have a better-than-naive way of distributing your expectations about what the number will be. But it's not random with respect to someone who knows the pseudorandom algorithm (and how it was seeded). If you want to predict whether a radioactive atom will decay over the course of one half-life's worth of time, you can't do better than to assign 0.5 to both possible outcomes. So people are tempted to look at that scenario and say that radioactive decay and other quantum phenomena are \"truly random\". But the real reason you can't make a good predictive model about radioactive decay is that the entire world splits into two copies, and your brain splits with it, and one brain-instance sees a decayed atom and one brain-instance sees an intact atom. If you wanted to make a computer simulation of our universe, it wouldn't need a special \"randomness module\". It would simply represent the constantly-splitting many-worlds universe, and the humans with their limited understanding of epistemology would continue BSing about \"true randomness\". ",
