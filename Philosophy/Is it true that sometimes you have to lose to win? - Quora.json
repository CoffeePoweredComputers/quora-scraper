            "answer_text": "Is it true that sometimes you have to lose to win? My father used to let me win at monopoly. I knew he was doing it but I played on all the same, often taking advantage of unfair deals and transactions. Back the I didn't really realise the reason why he did it, I mean, you play to win right? Fast forward a decade or two and I'm sitting round the table with my (then) girlfriend and her sour-faced never-happy flat mate. We decide to pull out the Monopoly board and have a game. My girlfriend was ruthless, and was slowly dominating the board. After a few more turns the Flatmate offers me a very one sided deal. I think about it, and then the thought of my dad and our games come back to me. At that point I realise that winning was far less important to me than the Flatmate, and I also realise that our next few hours happiness depends on Flatmate winning the game. So I make the bad deal. The girlfriend gives me the evil stare, but it doesn't last long. In fact she is quick to realise the same thing I have: if Flatmate loses the game we are in for hours of complaints and moody atmosphere. The game ended pretty soon after that. So what did I lose? A game that was enjoyable to play, and lose. What I won was peace and quiet for the rest of the evening. ",

            "answer_text": "I do agree this statement. I\u2019ll illustrate you my personal experience. There is a kid who is around 7 yrs old near my house.He used to wish me daily while i\u2019m returning from my college. As usually, one day he approached me on his cycle and asked me for a race. I thought its cool to have a race with him but lacking of a bicycle made me think a while. Then he came up with an idea to get my moped for race. I laughed at his innocence and tried to explain him the scenario despite he hesitated to listen what my intention is. His total focus is on the race no matter what his opponent\u2019s pros are. As a matter of fun i got my bike and proceeded towards him. He himself elucidated the boundaries and the extremities of the race. After the race started i was surprised to see his determination to win the race at any cost. The moment i realised this i began to decelerate my vehicle and allowed him to overtake me. And as a matter of fact we had three gone for three laps and in all the three he had won. I don\u2019t credit myself on this incident as it was his will to make it happen. After i had lost to him in three laps he was overjoyed and was very eager to share his success with my mom to make me cry for my defeat. That was the day i personally felt \u201csometimes we need to lose to win\u201d. Thank you for reading. PR ",
