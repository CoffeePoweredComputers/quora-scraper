            "answer_text": "For example in the Enlightenment era (Locke, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Paine, Leibniz, etc) as well as more recently: Is knowledge foundationalistic? (Is knowledge transcendent?) (What is knowledge?) What are the characteristics of reason? What is life's explanation (physics or metaphysics) stemming from reason or foundations? What is life's essential purpose or meaning? (Can we have knowledge? Is knowledge even useful?) Are humans significant, and if so, what meaning is there in practice? (Do only humans have meaning?) (Can there be a meaningful science?) (Is life subjective or objective?) (What do we gather from existence?) Is there a possibility of ethics? If so, what form does it take? Is life complex? If so, what makes it complex? Is life absurd? What makes it absurd? Is there such a thing as some special, 'consecrated\u2019 truth? What is life's worth at the end of the day? How should we feel about existence? Is there a right feeling? Are feelings in some way accurate descriptions of the world / universe? Is it possible to understand the universe, or does human knowledge pale by comparison? Is there a God, and if so, what are his / her / its attributes? What is the role for God within experience, or is there a God? What are humanity's limits, and what brings us to surpass them if we surpass them? Do you believe humans will enter a posthuman era? What will this be like, or will it not be much different? What is humanity's greatest hour / greatest achievement? What makes you think? What is consciousness? Do humans have souls? Are we even humans? Have you ever felt successful, and if so, what made you feel successful? What is human success in life? \u2026 I find these are still the questions to ask today. ",
