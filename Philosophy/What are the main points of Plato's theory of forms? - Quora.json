            "answer_text": "For Plato, Forms or Ideals (\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2; eidos) are essences or originals of qualities or things. They are real (not abstractions), and exist independently of the material objects that express them.Unlike material objects, they are perfect. For example, no two material lines are *exactly* parallel. But there is a perfect Form of parallel lines.Forms are eternal, and exist outside or apart form the material universe.Human beings perceive Forms by means of a higher intellective faculty called noesis.Of particular interest to Plato are certain moral Forms, such as those of Truth, Beauty, Virtue and Goodness. So, for example, all beautiful things have in common that they express the Form of Beauty.These higher moral Forms have religious and spiritual significance. They are glorious to behold and may be seen by the \u2018inner eye\u2019 by various means, including dialectic, moral practice, and contemplation.Most important is the Form of the Good \u2014 which is the essence and origin of every good thing. For Plato, the Form of the Good is, basically, God.",

            "answer_text": "Plato's Theory of Forms asserts that the physical realm is only a shadow, or image, of the true reality of the Realm of Forms. So what are these Forms, according to Plato? The Forms are abstract, perfect, unchanging concepts or ideals that transcend time and space; they exist in the Realm of Forms. ",
