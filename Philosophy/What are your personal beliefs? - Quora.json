List of things I don't believe in:god(s)fatemagicastrologyfortune tellingthings labelled 'paranormal'UFO sightingsconspiracy theoriesoriental beliefs implemented in the west I'm sure I left out a few.Things I believe in are things that I consider logical, well-founded and coherent with other things. As for politics, I have long lost the belief that politicians are actually striving to make our lives better. Most of the times this is just one of the conditions on which they can stay in office longer, and being in office has many perks. I don't remember the time I've seen a politician with the sole purpouse to 'do good', though I'm aware I haven't seen them all and might be biased by my country's ways.I believe in democracy with certain constrains, for instance I disagree with public opinion deciding over things the public actually has no clue about and thus can be manipulated either way. I think specific problems should be dealt with by people who work on that field.I believe in a free market with the condition that the government acts as a moderator.I believe health care should be run by the government. If there is one thing that shouldn't be about making money it's healthcare, and if my illness is a deficit for a profit-seeking entity then that entity will do everything possible to minimize the loss, and that does not sound like I'll be getting the better deal. Also, if the government has to deal with everything it makes more sense to put more money in research of vaccines and antidotes because prevention is always cheeper than treatment.I know a few people who have similar convictions, and with those I can discuss these things ocasionally. But it's not really a belief system as you can see... ",

            "answer_text": " I have quite a few , my own personal self-help pocket book, only I carry it upstairs, I\u2019d might say. Both my parents came from families that were considered wealthy, land wise. Combined they owned half the land surrounding our village and up to the borders of the neighboring village Mesochori. That\u2019s just the land that\u2019s been in the family hundreds of years, father added to the land by purchasing also. When the wars came to our shores rather then sell the land because of hardships, my grandparents chose to utilize the land to the advantage of their families and the whole village. Both my grandfathers were hunted by the Nazis, hiding in the mountains, the land was used by the villagers. They grew enough not to starve and have food stocked for their livestock. Rather then mortgage the land or sell it outright, they loaned it to families to plant and reap its rewards, for the sake of survival. It is frowned upon to sell your inheritance here, you see we believe we never truly own the land, it owns us for a time, until we pass it to the next generation. It is a matter of pride to hold on to what is in your family for hundreds of years. It is something we care for and it rewards us for that care, it feeds us and will nurture our children\u2019s, children\u2019s, children. I remember watching Gone with the Wind, from the entire film one phrase remains with me. When Scarlett\u2019s father places some red clay into her palm and says,  I understood this, I watched my parents fight to keep it, it\u2019s home, no matter where I travel I always like Scarlet return home, this is where I thrive. Or when Rhett said to Scarlet   Those were also the words phrased differently my father would say to me. I always knew this I don\u2019t remember when I first became aware of it. At times I saw it in the way father was treated by his peers when he attended social gatherings or when some would visit our home, they\u2019d ask father for his help his opinion. Father was a humble man he didn\u2019t treat our villagers differently, he treated them as brothers, uncles, fathers, family, he worked alongside them earning their respect. No matter how much wealth my father amassed, he never forget his origins nor the struggle. Father was quiet wealth, never ever, using against his community but for his community. So, they had the land, amassed the wealth but they never forgot that little rock in the Aegean called home, our Tara. That rock that with its magnetism keeps us grounded, telling us, you last but for a short time, I will house you when you leave, I will be here for your children and their children, People living in jungles of cement\u2026do not see the wonder I live. Nor how truly wealthy I am\u2026because. Money doesn\u2019t make you who you are, it magnifies what you are! If you are a plebeian miser with no wealth, You\u2019ll be a proletarian hoarder with wealth. If you are a humble yet generously dignified gentleman without wealth. You\u2019ll be a dignified generous gentleman with wealth. My personal beliefs\u2026wealth is home.  ",
