            "answer_text": "What we usually refer to as democracy, is \u201cliberal democracy\u201d, a political system marked by constitutional entrenchment of: \u2022\tfundamental human rights, including rights of person; and freedom of belief and speech, of assembly and of political organisation; \u2022\tthe rule of law and equality before the law; \u2022\tthe separation of executive, legislative and judicial powers; and \u2022\tfree elections with universal adult suffrage. Liberal democracy is representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise power is subject to the rule of law, under a constitution that protects the rights and freedoms of individuals and constrains the majority from overriding the interests of minorities. It is premised on acceptance by all parties of the legitimacy of the state and the political system, entrenchment of the sovereignty of the people, equal rights to participate in social institutions and the economy, and political competition. Free elections do not guarantee a transition from autocratic rule to democracy. A wider shift in political culture and entrenchment of the institutions of democratic government are needed. There are many examples of countries being unable to sustain democracy without emergence of a political culture of constitutional constraints on state power based on entrenchment of the rule of law and acceptance of the rights of individuals against the state . The concept of a loyal opposition is central. All parties in a liberal democracy accept the legitimacy of the state, and the principles and values of the political system. Political parties disagree on how best to advance national welfare and constituency interests, but their advocacy is moderated by acceptance of the legitimacy of the political system and the right of other parties to advocate their positions. Parties whose positions do not secure majority support in the polls, accept the judgment of the electorate and allow a peaceful transfer of power, knowing that they will not lose their lives, liberty or economic opportunities, and can still participate in public life. Their \u201cloyalty\u201d in opposition is not to the policies their opponents will implement, but to the legitimacy of the state and the democratic process. Experience teaches that it is difficult to achieve this in societies where transitions have taken place through violence. Perhaps the most important element of a functioning liberal democracy, however, however, is the application throughout society of the rule of law, the framework of fundamental rights, and the rules established to protect them, to enable a fair society that permits human advancement. There are four principal components: 1.\tAccountability: The government, its principal office bearers, officials and agents, as well as private persons and entities, are all subject to, and accountable under, the law. 2.\tClarity: The laws are clear, public and just; they protect fundamental rights, including the security of person and property; and are applied equally to all. 3.\tAccessibility: The processes of enactment, administration and enforcement of the laws are accessible and equitable. 4.\tEfficacy: Justice is delivered in a timely manner by competent, ethical, independent officials who are sufficient in number, properly resourced, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.

            "answer_text": "Principles of Democracy: Rule of law, freedom of press, respect of human rights, active political processes & enlightened citizens. Each of these 'basic' to democracy, meaning that democracy can't exist without all of them. 1. The Rule of Law - we are a nation of laws, not of men. Presidents and legislatures can't just do whatever they can get away with, they are limited by law. Laws represent the will of the people. 2. Freedom of the Press - in a democracy it's people, the voters, who are ultimately in control. The people need information in order to vote wisely, and that's why we need a free press and freedom of political speech. 3. Respect of human rights - we must realize that people are the most important thing, the purpose of government is to serve the needs of the people, not vice versa. This is the main reason for the Bill of Rights. 4. Active Political Processes - democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participation sport. It won't work if most people don't take part. A lot of the trouble we've been having in the US can be blamed on the lack of participation of so many people, small voter turnouts, etc. The more people who care enough to vote, and who then stick around to see how their votes turned out, the better off we'll be. 5. Enlightened Citizens - This is another problem we have here. Citizens must be educated and must understand the purpose of democracy, how and why we have it.
