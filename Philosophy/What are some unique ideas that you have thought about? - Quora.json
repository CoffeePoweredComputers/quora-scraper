Companies in exchange for buying that \u2018space\u2019 can give money or perks to the person who gets registered in the campaign. To promote this new form of advertisement, companies can even give-away free digital phone covers. InkCase- The Second Screen for Your Phone is some what close to the above idea. http://www.inkcase.com/en.html This was one of those random ideas. I would like to think that no one has thought of this idea yet. Of course, I may be wrong so please let me know why this idea has not been executed by any corporate organisation. I do realize that this will make advertisements more inescapable but advertisement is the bloodline of media industry so let\u2019s have some discussions:) Spreading KindnessIf speaking kindly to plants helps them grow then imagine what speaking kindly to humans can do. A few years ago, I thought of an idea. I thought of writing tiny motivational letters and leaving them at various public places for people to find. I did write 5\u20136 letters and left them randomly, and I wish those letters made some one\u2019s day. This called to mind when I came across this site- for the one who finds me. For the One Who Finds Me was founded in June 2015 by Danika Laine which involves the act of creating and placing tiny bouquets in public spaces for strangers to find.
