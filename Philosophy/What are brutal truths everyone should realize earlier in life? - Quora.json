            "answer_text": "The first chicken to stand higher than the others will be pecked mercilessly.After the originator of a good idea or the doer of a good dead has been punished for being different, someone else will convince the crowd it\u2019s a good thing, and be rewarded for it.Life is tough. In fact, it is literally hopeless. Because of this, we all live in our own fantasy to pretend life is good. We show some skin, some muscle, act tough or sexy, make straight A\u2019s or win every race\u2014and then believe that we are good, popular, loved, and accepted. In fact, we\u2019re still living among people who live in their own fantasy, just like we are.You must learn to smile and approve of other people\u2019s fantasies. Never bring to light that they are being used by their partners. Never bring to light that their religion is false. Never bring to light that they are misinformed or simply not very bright.People hate the truth more than perhaps anything else.Most of what people say is not to be taken literally. They don\u2019t really mean it, or they\u2019re being temporarily irresponsible, or they\u2019re lying, or they\u2019re wishful thinking, or they\u2019re blowing off steam, or they\u2019re using hyperbole, or they\u2019re hoping someone else will take the words seriously and do it\u2014taking responsibility for the speaker\u2019s bad intentions.Fully half of the people you meet are subpar intelligence. Most of the rest aren\u2019t really all that bright either. Almost all of the remainder have such emotional problems that their superior intelligence can\u2019t be trusted either.Nearly all of the time, nearly no one is altruistic or thinking of the good of the group. At best, they\u2019re fooling themselves.After about age 9, maybe 3rd grade, people are who they are always going to be. Winners will be winners. Whiners will stay whiners. Bullies will remain bullies.If you think the first nine principles are wrongheaded, you are a normal person and probably getting along just fine\u2014in the lying world of fantasies that is normal society.BONUS WISDOM: Keep your best thoughts to yourself, especially your intentions or aspirations. Most people, especially those who love you, are ready to find flaws in your thoughts, discourage your dream, or show that they know better. PS: On the other hand, if you discover these words to be truth and act on them, you will not be welcome anywhere by anyone but other weirdoes. ",

            "answer_text": " Not an expert, sharing with you all just what I feel - Either it is right or easy.Money is the most important part of our life (not emotions, not love, nothing). Just observe how many people are with you when you have enough money compared to when you had no or less money.Only you know what you want in your life so don't even bother to expect anyone else to know it for you.'Survival of the fittest' is the most exact quote ever made. You need to fit in to survive.You cannot make everyone happy so quit trying. If you don't stop you'll loose yourself eventually.Hope is a dangerous emotion. Don't just hope, work and hope.Type of friends you hang out with will determine your behavior and personality. Often it's too late to realize that you were with wrong people all the way so just pay attention.Talent is nothing when you are not consistent. Consistency is the key.Don't just go with the flow. Chances are you will end up nowhere.Nobody cares how much you are struggling. So better keep it to yourself rather than having a feeling of left alone.Three most important things in the world - Food, education and parents. Everything else come after these.Every pleasure is temporary and bound to end at some point of time.Looks do matter. A lot.People do judge. A lot.Success doesn't comes overnight.No one is going to come to fix you. You are your own savior. Movies are straightforward unrealistic.You might fail. A lot.Time management is all you need. You will always have lesser time than you think you have.Just because you're busy doesn't mean you are accomplishing something.No one wants you to be yourself.No one is listening to you most of the time. They are hearing you.If someone is sorry for what they did to you, they're not.Assume that everyone is lying to you. This way you will be able to save yourself from a lot of idiots.The world is full of haters and selfish people.Stay accountable and responsible for your deeds. Because it is going to come to you in one way or another.Money is not happiness but you will want to opt for money rather than happiness.Ps - All the points above are subject to one or the other exceptions.
