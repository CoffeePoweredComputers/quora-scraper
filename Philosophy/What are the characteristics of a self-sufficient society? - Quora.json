            "answer_text": "Well, \u201cself-sufficiency:\u201d the ability to sustain itself without \u201coutside\u201d help. It will consume only what it produces; its birthrate will equal its death rate from all causes, it will avoid negatively affecting its environment beyond its capacity to heal, it will reuse or recycle all of its waste. In addition, of course, its environment will need to be relatively stable and enough of its members must have developed immunity to endemic diseases. All \u201cprogress,\u201d all changes in the society, must be perfectly harmonized with the environment. A self-sufficient society cannot coexist with a society that isn\u2019t self-sufficient. That is, it cannot share its environmental \u201cspace.\u201d A society that shares its space with a powerful predator must be able to balance its own needs with those of the predator, or either the (human) society or the \u201cpredator society\u201d will cease to be self-sufficient. Since human societies are, for the most part, \u201cinvading\u201d each other\u2019s environmental spaces, and since\u2014whether as a consequence of human or other factors (or both)\u2014our planet has a limited environmental capacity, \u201cself-sufficient human societies\u201d may no longer be possible on earth without extremely radical changes.
