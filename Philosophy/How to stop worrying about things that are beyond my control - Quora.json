            "answer_text": "I can tell you what worked for me. The first thing I will say though is the fact that you already realize these are things that are outside of your control. You being able to identify this already puts you in the mindset of understanding. Now that you have the understanding that there are things outside of your control, sit down and think on it. Anxiety is something that a lot of people feel. When I was younger, I would feel anxious about certain things (such as feeling nervous when speaking in front of a lot of people, or trying to give a briefing to a well-experienced audience). Over time, just simply going through those measures over-and-over helped me realize that there are just some things that you cannot help (such as your entire audience never fully agreeing with you). Through a combination about thinking about the things I can control versus the things I cannot, I then focused on my feelings on the things I couldn\u2019t control and rationalized them away. You and I both know it\u2019s silly to worry about things you have no control over\u2026these days through a combination of experience, understanding, and logical thinking, I\u2019ve been able to rid most of these emotions which are meaningless (with regards to speaking about things outside of your control). This also doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t encounter situations in the future which will cause you anxiety once again. Just use the things that you have in the past that have worked for you. If what I mentioned above doesn\u2019t work for you, try this: what is something that you used to be anxious about but are no longer anxious about? Why are you no longer anxious about those things? These situations could mean anything such as meeting new people, talking to a lady or gentleman you may have a crush on, or taking a test. Over time, you see that there was no point in being worried about those events. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen\u201d is a common phrase you can refer to when being anxious for \u201cno reason\u201d. Hopefully you found this helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "This is my favorite fortune cookie prediction ever and I carry it with me always.  You see, I used to be a worrier. I worried all the time. I worried that something was going to happen to someone I loved, or that something was going to happen to me. I worried that my family was not safe in Mexico City (where I'm from). I worried if a friend expressed anything less that ecstatic joy. I worried that I forgot to close the garage door. Why was it hard for me to even consider letting go of something that could be making me sick? Because, even though for a long time I couldn't articulate this, I somehow believed that if I worried about something, I could prevent it. Yup. I believed that most things I worried about wouldn't happen precisely because I worried about them. I saw my worry as a sort of protective shield, an undetectable force that swirled around the people that I loved and accompanied them wherever they went like an aura/guardian, like a halo on an angel\u2019s head. I explained this to a friend who looked at me before asking \"Nice. How is that working for you?\" I was stumped. I was stunned. I realized I had inadvertently been practicing being a worrier for years, and that, as such, I could un-learn it. I replaced every worry-thought with another thought. (\"All is well\". \"Everything is going to be ok.\" Or even - \"even if that was going to happen my worry is not going to prevent it\".) I can't say I don't worry anymore but I worry a lot less. And when I do, I get to work on letting that crap go. ",
