            "answer_text": "The source for popularizing the claim that Karl Marx was a Satanist comes from the book Was Karl Marx a Satanist? by Richard Wurmbrand, a Romanian Jewish convert to Christianity who was persecuted by the Communists for his Christian ministry work.  As with most titles that include a question mark at the end, you can probably assume that Betteridge's law of headlines applies (i.e., if the author could actually prove the statement implied by the question, they wouldn't have posed it as a question in the first place).      The definitive takedown of Wurmbrand's book can be found in Francis Wheen's critical biography of Karl Marx:  Just as halfwitted or power-hungry followers deified Marx, so his critics have often succumbed to the equal and opposite error of imagining him as an agent of Satan. \"There were times when Marx seemed to be possessed by demons,\" writes a modern biographer, Robert Payne.  \"He had the devil's view of the world, and the devil's malignity.  Sometimes he seemed to know that he was accomplishing works of evil.\" This school of thought--more of a borstal, really--reaches its absurd conclusion in Was Karl Marx a Satanist?, a bizarre book published in 1976 by a famous American hot-gospeller, the Reverend Richard Wurmbrand, author of such imperishable masterpieces as Tortured for Christ ('over two million copies sold') and The Answer to Moscow's Bible.   According to Wurmbrand, the young Karl Marx was initiated into a 'highly secret Satanist church' which he then served faithfully and wickedly for the rest of his life. No proof can be found, of course, but this merely strengthens the dog-collared detective's hunch: 'Since the Satanist sect is highly secret, we have only leads about the possibilities of his connection with it.'  What are these leads?  Well, when he was a student he wrote a verse-play whose title, Oulanem, is more or less an anagram of Emanuel, the biblical name for Jesus--and thus 'reminds us of the inversions of the Satanic black mass.'  Most incriminating; but there's more to come.  'Have you ever wondered,\" Wurmbrand asks, 'about Marx's hairstyle? Men usually wore beards in his time, but not beards like this... Marx's manner of bearing himself was characteristic of the disciples of Joanna Southcott, a Satanic priestess who considered herself in contact with the demon Shiloh.' In fact, the England inhabited by Marx had plenty of bushy-bearded gents, from the cricketer W. G. Grace to the politician Lord Salisbury.  Were they, too, on speaking terms with the demon Shiloh? Wheen misleadingly makes Wurmbrand sound like an American-born evangelical preacher, but otherwise his dismantling of Wurmbrand's argument is quite damning.  Wurmbrand's \"evidence\" for the claim that Karl Marx was a Satanist is mostly based on poetry and plays that Marx wrote as a young man.  If you look at Marx's verse-play Oulanem, you will find references to \"hell\" and \"devils,\" but there's a much simpler explanation for this than positing that Karl Marx belonged to a 19th century German Satanic cult for which no historical evidence exists.  The more likely explanation is that Marx, like most 19th century German students, would have been exceedingly familiar with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's version of the Faust story, a classic German legend about a scholar who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the gift of knowledge. Oulanem is probably just an immature literary attempt by Karl Marx as a young student to write something in imitation of Goethe.   Another factor that may account for the popularity of the belief that Karl Marx was a Satanist is that some American evangelical Christians don't see much of a distinction between an atheist (which Marx definitely was) and a Satanist (which Marx almost definitely was not). If you are an evangelical who has absolute certainty that God exists and that you are working on the side of God, then you might find it hard to believe that an atheist really doesn't believe in God. Instead, you might suspect that the atheist really does believe in God's existence, but simply chooses to work in opposition to God, which would place the atheist on the same side as Satan.   According to some reviews of the book posted on Amazon, Was Karl Marx a Satanist? also borrows from anti-Semitic literature, although Wurmbrand probably sanitized his source material in the process.  Wurmbrand's dubious source material probably followed a line of argument like this: (1) Karl Marx was Jewish, (2) Jews are in league with Satan, therefore (3) Karl Marx was a Satanist.  Wurmbrand probably mined the source material for whatever he could use to prove #3, while avoiding the anti-Semitic material that focused on #1 and #2.  This may absolve Wurmbrand of anti-Semitism, but it doesn't make Wurmbrand's claims any less dubious. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no solid evidence show Karl Marx is a Satanist, he didn\u2019t say it in public, or wrote in his diary, However, I need to say: We should not jugde someone by what he said, but what he did. Here are some facts about him: 1.In a paper written by Marx in his student days, the word \"destruction\" was repeated six times - none of his classmates used this word in exams. So \"destruction\" became Marx's nickname. 2.Heinrich Heine, a famous German poet, is a close friend of Marx. He is a Satanist. Marx was his fans. 3.In Marx's poem The White Girl, he wrote:So I have lost heaven.I know that.I once believed in the soul of God.Now destined to go to hell. 4.\"Destruction\", \"collapse\" and \"collapse\" often appear in his other poems.In my opinion, this is not a positive signal. 5.Marx and his maid Helen Demuth had an illegitimate son. Marx also drank heavily. 6.Marx used to be a whistleblower for money. On January 9, 1960, the German newspaper Reichsruf reported the fact that Raabe, the Prime Minister of Austria, had sent a written letter from Karl Marx to Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev did not like the letter because it confirmed that Marx had been a reward informer for the Austrian police and that he was a spy in the revolutionary ranks. The letter was discovered by accident in a secret archive. It testifies that Marx, as an informer, denounced his comrades during his exile in London. For each piece of information, Marx received a reward of 25 yuan. His tips concerned revolutionaries in exile in London, Paris and Switzerland. One of the defendants was Ruge, who considered himself a close friend of Marx. The enthusiastic communication between the two still exists today. 7. Rolv Heuer describes Marx's extravagant life in his book Genius and Rich Man:\"When he was a student in Berlin, Marx, the child who relied on his father, received 700 silver dollars a year in pocket money.\" That's a huge amount, because at that time, only five percent of the people earned more than 300 silver dollars a year. According to the information of Marx College, Marx obtained about six million francs from Engels in his life. 8.Marx coveted the legacy of his family. When one of his uncles was in extreme pain, Marx wrote, \"If that dog dies, it will do me no harm.\" Engels replies, \"Congratulations, the obstacle to your inheritance is sick, and I hope he's in trouble right now.\" After the death of the dog, Marx wrote on March 8, 1855, \"This is a lucky thing. Yesterday we were told that my wife's ninety-year-old uncle had died. My wife will receive about 100 Lst; if it weren't for the old dog who gave the big head of his property to the hostess of his house, my wife would have got more. Marx had no mercy on those who were closer to him than his uncle. This is true even when talking about his mother. Marx wrote to Engels in December 1863: \"Two hours ago, I received a telegram saying that my mother was dead... In many cases, what I need is not an old woman, but something else. I have to go to Trier to receive the inheritance. That's all Marx had to say about his mother's death. In addition, there is ample evidence that Marx had a bad relationship with his wife. She left him twice, but then she went back. After her death, Marx did not even attend her funeral. Need more facts? He may be a Satanist or not, a Nazi or not, a Destroyer or not, ALL NO SOLID EVIDENCE. The point is, His life is a mess and his character is a mess. His theory indirectly caused 100 million deaths. I think he has already surpassed the Satanists. He is Satan himself. ",
