            "answer_text": "\u201cWe are all human, yet we categorize ourselves as \"races\". Why?\u201d First, I am NOT claiming that one group of humans are \u2018better\u2019 than another! With that said, there are different races of human beings broadly classified as; 1. Caucasoid (European) 2. Negroid (African) 3. Mongoloid (Asiatic or Oriental) 4. Indie (Hindu) 5. Australoid (Australian aboriginals) 6. Polynesians/Melanesian/Micronesian (some\u00adtimes, these three are classified as the Oceanic) 7. American Indian. These groups share many characteristics, yet there are differences that include (but not limited to) skin color, hair, muscular/skeletal structure and DNA. (Major Physical Characteristics of Racial Groups) Races, or racial groups are terms used in categorization of groups of humans. (Race (human categorization) - Wikipedia) Just as we use \u2018breed\u2019 to define different groups of other mammals (dogs, cats, horses, cattle, swine, etc.), we use \u2018race\u2019 to define different groups of humans.

            "answer_text": "Because equality is an illusion, a tool used to seduce you into believing all men were created equal. By using \u201craces\u201d & \u201cethnic groups\u201d, the people in power can promote nationalism. If there was not color boundary, nationalistic ideals would seem impractical. Take the Bible. Most Christians have been seduced into believing a lie\u2014all families in the Bible as equal in Christ. But Jesus said himself: I came to save only the lost people of Israel\u2014a.k.a. Israelites. Not Americans, not Germans, not Israelis, not Nigerians, not Persians, not Chinese, not Indians, not Iraqis, etc. The Bible states Jesus\u2019s 1st Coming was to notify the lost Israelites of their redemption & salvation; and that his 2nd Coming is to restore the kingdom OF ISRAEL to worldwide rulership (not in 1948). Jesus makes it clear: Israelites are children of God\u2014above all other people. There\u2019s is no equality with them. So the current ruling powers vie for world control, and one of the biggest ways to accomplish and maintain that control is to distinguish your people as a separate biological group. This is why Israel kept going into slavery: they kept trying to acclimate into \u201cother\u201d cultures & heritages not their own, so they eventually fell away from their God-given heritage & identity and were conquered by other nations. So-called African-Americans do this too. We try to to adopt & embrace everybody else\u2019s heritage & never our God-given own, thus we remain at the bottom of someone else\u2019s society. White people went from calling us \u201cNegros\u201d to \u201cniggers\u201d to \u201ccoloreds\u201d to \u201cblacks\u201d. But it was a white-folk-loving Negro who asked \u201cmasta\u201d to start calling us \u201cAfrican Americans\u201d. And the white man, who clearly & undeniably understands the power of self-heritage, was quick to oblige his former servants, knowing FULLY well, that such a label keeps that people mentally subordinate to him. And you can\u2019t fault him, because in the Bible, God actually COMMANDS the black Israelites to do the same damn thing: be a nationalistically separate people & CONQUER your enemies. It\u2019s the deceived lot that tries to convince you we\u2019re all from Adam. We\u2019re all equal. We\u2019re one human family. No, we are not. History testifies to the contrary. ",
