            "answer_text": "1 - remember that ALL answers are based upon the responder\u2019s perspective, and perspectives are unique to the individual - based upon their life experiences, their interpretations of those experiences, what they\u2019ve been taught, what they believe, etc. 2 - remember that ALL descriptions/explanations are relative truth - that is, relative to the person making the description; not THE truth. 3 - therefore, ALL answers have SOME truth and SOME falsehood to them. ULTIMATELY - YOU need to figure out your own answer. That being said\u2026.. MY perspective, based upon my interpretation of my life experiences, my beliefs, etc.: There are multiple levels of consciousness - and they are given many names from mind, inner self, emotional self, soul, mental realm, spiritual realm - and on and on and on. NOTE: I once studied with a spiritual teacher who said - at the time, in the 1980s - he had traveled to 64 different realms, and there were many, many more. SOME of the \u201cnames\u201d used by people likely refer to the same \u201cplace\u201d - but, of course, it is difficult to know as everyone\u2019s description is unique - even when there is similarity between descriptions. My understanding - and experience - is that what is typically referred to as \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cinner self\u201d are NOT the same \u201cplace\u201d - so, by definition, they are NOT the same. They CAN be similar, though, depending on how each is functioning in a given moment. AND as ALL levels of consciousness are essentially from the same \u201csource\u201d, they ARE, in a sense, the same. BUT different. Think of it this way - in music there are only 12 distinct notes: C, C sharp/Db, D, D sharp/Eb, E, F, F sharp/Gb, G, G sharp/Ab, A, A sharp/Bb, and B BUT there are numerous octaves. SO while middle C and high C are still both C, they are different vibrational frequencies. They are the same - yet different. The REAL question here is the reason you asked this question in the first place. Was it curiosity? Trying to figure something out? Attempting to understand your own experience? THAT is where your growth lies <g> ",

            "answer_text": "If you can define \u201cinner self\u201d which implies also defining \u201couter self\u201d then we have a chance to address your interest. Roughly speaking, the mind (consciousness, attention, awareness, memory, imagination) is a body function; it serves as the body\u2019s navigational / guidance system, enabling the body to move around in search of food, water, mates, shelter, safety, comfort. The self is a social construct; it enables the body to negotiate the social terrain, so we can identify each other, sort like zebra stripes. We treasure our uniqueness but perhaps we don\u2019t all fully appreciate the evolutionary value of being distinguished from each other. Going by common usage, it appears that \u201cinner self\u201d refers to what one \u201creally\u201d feels about someone or some situation that involves others vs how you plaster a fake smile on your face - that would be your \u201couter self\u201d - so you don\u2019t offend anyone\u2019s dignity by telling them what you \u201creally\u201d feel. I put \u201creally\u201d in quotes because, well, how we feel about others and situations involving others is always some kind of considering, thinking about what others think and feel so as not to engender a bad opinion towards us. But all this is so superficial, compared to what it feels like to just be aware of yourself in a very neutral way, without judging anything or anyone, a kind of ideal moment, especially nowadays. The point is, none of this seems very real; what is real is that we are alive, we are animals with animal concerns, and we will die one day and we know it. Knowing we will die is what drives everything else. All our concerns, all our thoughts, our hobbies, beliefs, ideologies, endeavors, hopes, dreams, aspirations, all are driven by the knowledge we are mortal. That is real, and compared to that reality, all this inner and outer self business is not real, it is trivial. ",
