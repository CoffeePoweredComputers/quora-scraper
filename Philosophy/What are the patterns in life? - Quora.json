            "answer_text": "If something wants to hide, all it has to do is move slowly. *skip to the bottom for the life hack* When I was in High School (aka secondary school) I had an acquaintance that was incredibly smart, worked hard, and we all thought she would \u201cmake it.\u201d As time went on, she kept doing more and more - despite a rather undesirable upbringing. Year 11 she started dating a guy who was involved in some less-than-desirable activities. She continued dating him while I knew her, and since I didn\u2019t see much of a change in her I didn\u2019t think anything of it.  Let me take a quick break from her and fill you in on a secret I learned about humans: We don\u2019t tend to notice slow changes. This is known as the slow-change blindness effect.[1] [2] [3] [4] You might be thinking what I thought when I read about this, \u201cWhat an enormous flaw!\u201d To learn why we have this \u2018flaw\u2019, we have to travel back in time.  Imagine with me: You\u2019re hungry, scared, and a bit annoyed\u2026It has been 3 days since your last meal. You want food and you want it NOW. You finally catch your food, eat it, and the day is over. The next day, you wake up to find a chill coming over you\u2026It\u2019s time to move again. Then across the plains you go! Off to the next meal or place to stay. Now we can look at this across time; weeks turn to months, months turn to years, and eventually, we died.  There has been no true reason to remember things across time within ourselves or others. (Outside of the basics for survival.) We only need the next few months or years. (Although the fact you\u2019re on Quora signifies that you\u2019re interested in remembering more than that - Thus improving yourself.[5] )  This starts to become an issue when we are looking to improve ourselves and measure things across time. Don\u2019t believe me? Let me prove it. What are 3 concrete lessons you\u2019ve learned in the last 2 months? If you\u2019re anything like me, you don\u2019t have an answer ready for this question. It\u2019s hard to truly measure! I ask myself this around 6 times a year. Every time it\u2019s the same story, struggle to remember and quantify, examine journal, and solidify my list. (To add to the complexity of this, you can also ask your friends what changes that have noticed in you.)   Here\u2019s a common proverb about this effect: Frogs normally won\u2019t go into boiling water. They\u2019ll jump out and keep themselves away from very hot water. But, if placed in a tub of water at normal temperature that is being heated slowly, according to the anecdote, they don\u2019t react and end up getting cooked in the boiling water.[6][7] (This is FALSE, please don\u2019t go boil a frog. Still a good story nonetheless.)  Back to my acquaintance. She is now a few years older and has slid further than anyone could have imagined. Nothing has changed for the better, and the feedback loop of good habits has almost disappeared. The guy she still dates has ended up doing even worse things and he led her into another terrible feedback loop. She is in a negative feedback loop - A downward spiral to an unfulfilled life. This story has no happy ending. This is a life lived with the slow-change blinders on.  (Don\u2019t live like this.) I saw this happen from the same classroom to thousands of miles away and feel terrible for her. I would never want someone I love to experience this.   My argument: I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re truly capable of tracking ourselves across time.[8] [9][10][11][12] As you\u2019ll see below, I don\u2019t trust myself to remember what I do. We can barely keep up with the changes of our closest friends\u2026what makes me think I can track my own? I keep an Excel sheet of changes to my mood and life, but even that is difficult to objectively measure. The point I\u2019m trying to make is: What are you doing right now that will affect you in 6 months? Are you blind to the things that will affect you over time? How do your feedback loops currently hurt you?  Here\u2019s the life hack. How to track the impact of your feedback loops: There\u2019s a saying by Peter Drucker, \u201cWhat gets measured gets managed.\u201d[13] If you\u2019re relying on your mind to track your changes\u2026 I hate to say it, but you\u2019re wrong.[14] [15] [16] How I track myself across time: I record a video, write 200 words, or record a voice note. Something easy that takes 5 minutes. Then I say \u201cHey Siri\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d and mention that I\u2019d like to be reminded of this video in 4 months. I\u2019ve become considerably more aware of my own feedback loops and how my friends' feedback loops affect me. When I lived in Germany, I was quite consistent. Almost every video from there is joyful and upbeat. Korea? Same story. Happy and ready to explore.  Now the new story in Hawaii? I\u2019ll tell you in a few months. (Want to start reading more?

            "answer_text": "Though there are many different ways to look at patterns, my belief is that all patterns are originated in our Creator. Our minds are a minute dirivative of that original mind. From our viewpoint, as one grain of sand, look out upon other grains of sand, upon the beaches of sand, upon the shorelines and upon the sand dunes of the earth, upon our planet in orbit around our sun, upon our solar system's position in our Milky Way galaxy, upon the upteen gazillion galaxies of the universe. Now try to contemplate that this viewpoint is just of the nonliving material universe. Now try to contemplate the same viewpoint from a life force origin. An original living bit of material, grouped in a combination of chemical units, arranged in a double helix pattern, pumping out instructions to surrounding living material to duplicate the pattern of the first group, then replicate the same thereafter. From DNA, to cell, to organ, to organism, to creature. The patterns of the universe are everywhere, to be observed with the eye, and to evaluate and contemplate with the mind. ",
