            "answer_text": "You already got some helpful names but here is a line of enquiry that might come up: physical economy which has been used to test some economic positions and even Theories--remember Aristotle wrote (not so well) on economics.  In college, before I became a philosophy major (although I had a number of philosophy courses, I was an Economics major.  More pilosophy helped me see that \"Economics\" (as in most references) is empiricist extrapolations with dubious axioms.         These days I still follow PHYSICAL ECONOMY (i.e., how are things going with the human beings and their resources [it's what Leibnitz* in, for example. \"Societat und Wirtshaft\"--I was going to translate it but was beaten to it in an obscure publication, which name I have forgotten] it's what Marx did and Benj. Franklin (as acknowledge by a Soviet publication entitled  A Science in its Youth [or maybe \"Infancy] and Hamilton did and  Matthew and  Henry C. Carey did and there a few around today.      But most of this has been shoved into the \"Memory Hole\" for political reasons and Economics [sic] has become the orthodoxy in this area.      Even Plato (in another science) does original math or at least reports on it in Theaetetus: when he makes a teenager (Theaetetus) say that he came up with a universal treatment of incommensurables which his teacher Theodorus  could handle (partially and pragmatically) only for a few incommensurables.   I understand your query.  This is a very confused and fragmented culture we live in.     *I did once publish a paper entitled \"God, Love and the Steam Engine\" --for those with extraordinary couriosity and diligence--in Nihil Sine Ratione (2001) [\"NOTHING\"= my emphasis--\"Without Reason\"].  Part of this overall project--in the tradition of Leibniz-- was to deny that there exist many universes/cosmoses. Theology,  Philosophy of Love, Physics, technology and Physical Economy all part of one theory.   Of course the English speaking countries have Worldviews that are content (or even favor strongly) incoherent Pluralism. Thus your being unsure whether anyone does both philosophy and \"science\" or even whether any philosophers are scientifically informed. But this has not generally been the case. ",

Philosophers of Physics Just taking a few called David, and selecting four whose work I know and rate highly: David Albert (holds a PhD in physics that he gained before switching to philosophy) -- he wrote an especially clear book called Time and Chance about the philosophical implications of Thermodynamics.  He has a distinctive writing style -- and this is the crazy bit -- you either love or hate it.  That's it.  No argument. Works by David Albert - PhilPapers David Baker does work especially with Hans Halvorsen, centred on Algebraic Quantum Field Theory Profile for David Baker - PhilPapers David Malament specialises in special and general relativity -- he has a bit of gift for formalising philosophical assertions into statements about spacetime that he then proves or disproves Works by David Malament - PhilPapers David Wallace (another who started with a PhD in physics before switching) this David is best known for his work on showing how probability could make sense in the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
