            "answer_text": "It depends\u2026.are you talking about judging someone morally or making righteous moral judgments? If you are judging someone about their morality, in some way you are doing the same thing you are judging someone for. Its basically hypocritical. But if you are making righteous moral judgments thats always a good thing. As far as moral behavior, someone can act moral but its just a disguise for their intentions. Its just to put a show on to others and doesn't reflect whats really in the heart. If moral behavior and the heart has the right intentions it is the right way to be a moral person. And as far as matching moral behavior with righteous moral judgment the two go hand in hand. But in the flip side if you are judging someones morality you are being a hypocrite. If you are behaving morally just as a disguise you are being decietful. Those go hand in hand. But sometimes you may make a moral judgment that is good and not be able to match it with moral behavior. Or Vice versa, you may behave morally and mean it but not be able to judge the situation correctly. And frankly if one of those elements is right you are doing something right. They may not align at the time but you are human so give yourself some slack! ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean, do those who judge other\u2019s morality hold themselves to that same standard? The answer is unequivocally NO. We have the term hypocrisy and double-standard because many, perhaps most people, while being able to spot other people\u2019s immoral behavior have either simultaneously exempted themselves from adhering to this same code (because\u2026 reasons), or are oblivious to the fact that they are in violation of this same code.

            "answer_text": "Sometimes. The key thing with aspirational values, like having some self-proclaimed moral judgement, is that for perfect alignment to be maintained with the actual behaviours, one must not ever be forced into a reality check in which the moral aspiration must react to an unaligned force. Survival against competing requirements is but one example. ",
