Rephrasing the question: Lawrence Goethe defined insanity as Humanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting Humanity to improve. When did Humanity go insane by this standard? 2000 years ago and the insanity has been increasing exponentially since then and now the Polar Bears have no homes to go to and nor do the Eskimos. However, the up-side is that a lot of people purchased the rubbish that they have been brain-washed into believing that they could not live without. Soon they will find out that they can live without it because they will have to. \u00a9 2019 Lawrence Goethe ~ Wrath of God Against The Imbeciles ",
