            "answer_text": "First of all I love you. Is enlightenment amoral? No. There are two little boys sitting in a sand box. One throws sand. The other doesn\u2019t like it. \u201cNo throwing sand, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d He says in defense of his boundaries.  The one boy builds a castle, the other smashes it under foot. \u201cHey! No smashing castles, I don\u2019t like that.\u201d He says protecting his property. The one boy takes all the sand box toys and piles them in his corner. \u201cHey! I was using that, share the toys please\u201d, says the boy wanting things to be fair. A third boy comes to the sand box with his heart full of love for these two other boys. He sees them as precious siblings whose presence is nothing but a gift to him. They can do no wrong in his eyes. He admires their sand skill, finds them pleasant to be near and only wishes to be of service to all. I ask you. Does this third boy need to be informed of the rules? Will he throw sand? Will he stomp on another\u2019s castle? Will his open heart allow him to hoard all the toys? Love includes morality, but morality does not necessarily include love. (It is possible to be moral and unloving at the same time, like when a boy shares his toys only after being forced by an adult). If I see you as a part of me, do I need to be told not to kill you? If I see you as a part of me, do I need to be reminded not to steal from you? If I see you as a part of me, do I need a rule to tell me to respect you? Morality is an attempt to enforce love. Love is an attempt to include all! A person living in love will follow all the rules because that\u2019s what love does, but a moral person may not reach out or seek another\u2019s well being, or connect heart to heart with another, making them feel welcome and included, offering a connection of hearts, because it has not been specifically required by the rules. If I\u2019m 40 years old that includes being 30 years old too, but being 30 does not yet include being 40. So too does love include morality but love goes beyond morality as well. Ultimately there is only one rule, as St Augustine said, \u201cLove, and do whatever you want!\u201d Blessings! ",

            "answer_text": "Morality is an invention of the human mind. Enlightenment exists beyond the human mind, so morals don\u2019t apply to it. That does not mean that, in enlightenment, everything goes. A normal human reaction to the idea that moral rules don\u2019t apply is that, without those rules, one would immediately become destructive, aggressive, bad, evil. From the human perspective, one must have something that \u201cmakes one\u201d control oneself and one\u2019s own trauma such that one doesn\u2019t lash out and create pain and trauma for others. Enlightened ones don\u2019t need rules to support their self control. Enlightened ones don\u2019t need to control anything at all because they are completely present as everything. Being present with the trauma, they don\u2019t react blindly, unconsciously out of the trauma, therefore they don\u2019t create more pain and trauma. The actions of one who doesn\u2019t react blindly, who doesn\u2019t flail their fists around because he is in too much pain or too scared or too unconscious to remain present, can be perceived as good and moral because they would match closely what a good and moral and kind action is supposed to be. But, in truth, they are not good and moral so much as they are present. When one is present, there is never any need to hurt anyone. ",
