            "answer_text": "Spacetime is existence, essentially anything outside of it wouldn\u2019t exist in the normal definition of the word. Spacetime is the combined amalgam of at least 4 dimensions (there is debate about whether the universe is 5\u201327 dimensional). It gives things the property that can allow them to inhabit or to have volume or area or otherwise. A dimensionless object would an infinitesimal point, it simply couldn\u2019t exist! Equally, even if we forget spatial dimensions, we have problems. Consider time! There would be no gravitational effect within the G-field and it\u2019s not that \u201cno time would pass for that object\u201d, because that happens with light, it would be that time doesn\u2019t interact with that object, making it so that object wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t appear in any timeline! Essentially, you\u2019d have some really serious problems if you didn\u2019t inhabit some form of spacetime. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing can exist without spacetime. Spacetime is an energy medium containing E0 energy (See other posts that explain the hierarchy of energy at the basis for the theory of everything). Before the big bang all the energy in the universe existed as E0 energy. During the big bang, conditions came to exist that allowed E0 energy to make the jump to E1 and E2 energy. We know E1 energy as light (photons) and E2 energy as particles containing mass. After the big bang, the transition between E0 energy and E1 energy was no longer possible but also the transition from E1 energy to E0 energy was also no longer possible. If E1 energy were able to return back to the energy of spacetime, then nothing would exist in our universe except spacetime. It is for this reason why the law of conservation of energy exists. So now we have particles existing \u201cin\u201d spacetime. A particle\u2019s energy fields are a result of their E1 and E2 energy co-existing \u201cin\u201d the E0 energy of spacetime. The interaction of these energies result in the energy fields. You heard it hear first. This is why no particles can exist without spacetime. ",

            "answer_text": "Our existence depends on being consisted of matter. Whenever we use our 5 senses, or when we use an apparatus to measure something with, it is always sensed/measured by matter. For all things made up of matter, there is clearly such a thing as spacetime (including a thermodynamic direction for time). For all things made of matter, the distances of space and time appears to change when in motion, in such a way that light will always be measured at a constant speed by it, no matter the relative velocity. But we can only ever directly sense and measure radiation. We never sense or measure the world-lines of the matter itself. For instance, when we touch something, we only feel the electromagnetic force (the exchange of virtual photons) of repelling electrons. Our minds use this information to calculate where the matter must be. And even though this radiation is clearly observed inside matter\u2019s spacetime, for the radiation itself all time and space has shrunk to zero. This is why the speed of light cannot be a frame of reference. Even a Universe with only radiation can still be imagined by us from some imagined matter\u2019s frame of reference spacetime point of view, even though there would be nothing there to observe this radiation with. Also matter is just fields interacting, which gives us these spin \u00bd particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Understand that there\u2019s just no spacetime on its own. There\u2019s just fields. To quote Einstein; \u201cThere is no such thing as an empty space, i.e. a space without field. Space-time does not claim existence on its own, but only as a structural quality of the field.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Isky, I have to take exception with what you posted. If you think of the primitives in classical mechanics (point mass with location and momentum, a charge indicating time evolution) then I agree. Unfortunately , that is not reality. In quantum reality the primitives are states as vectors in a (complex) projective linear vector space (called Hilbert space) and a connection between time and energy. Quantum mechanics is quite happy with being, existence, without any contrivance of \u2018space\u2019 at all. Am I missing the point of the question? ",

            "answer_text": "Spacetime is the foundation of a mathematical model called General Relativity. And it is just that, a model that is an approximation of what we observe in the universe. Do not confuse mathematical models with reality. The models always have problems when you look at extreme conditions. Newton\u2019s model of gravitation works just fine until you get close to massive objects, then the prediction breaks down. General Relativity works just fine until you look closely at very small objects such as atoms and elementary particles. Then you need another model, Quantum Mechanics. And Quantum Mechanics does you no good in computing the trajectory of spacecraft in the Solar System. ",
