            "answer_text": "Augmented reality (AR) has revolutionized the way humans interact with their physical environment. However, the key source of immersive user experience is the underlying combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR). AI encompasses computer vision development services that enable controlling of 2D and 3D objects in AR systems. Today, the combination of AI and AR is entering various business operations such as assembly, warehousing, repair, and maintenance. This blog post explores potential industrial use cases of augmented reality with artificial intelligence. Augmented reality overlays our physical reality by adding layers of computer-generated contextual information including text, graphics, video, sound, feedback, GPS data, and more. AI-powered AR systems provide a real-time user interface for human interaction with objects like retail products, business equipment, and digital devices. Social Media Platforms The introduction of AR has given a major boost to the popularity of social media platforms. Businesses have witnessed a significant increase in sales resulting from active social media outreach efforts and audience engagement. Platforms with vibrant facial filters such as Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, etc. are creating a magnetic effect on millennials.  Gaming Industry The multi-dimensional applications of AR in video gaming is essential for an enhanced and immersive gaming experience. Ericsson Consumer Lab\u2019s report Ready, Stead, Game! suggests that the immersive experience of augmented reality is the core driving factor for AR gamers. Here is how gaming developers can deploy AI and AR for engaging user experience- a) AI\u2019s machine learning algorithms use with specific gaming data to trigger real-time changes across devices. ",

            "answer_text": "The powerfulness of the immersive range of technologies, which include Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, is fully realized when paired with both the technologies mentioned in your question. Yes, we mean that these three technologies could be interlinked. Meanwhile, it may be noted that Machine Learning is nothing but a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning Let\u2019s start with the distinction first. Augmented Reality (AR) overlays virtual elements in a physical setting. Examples of the same include the game Pok\u00e9mon Go or Snapchat. Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is again closely related to machine learning, comprises algorithms and statistical models that could perform tasks with no explicit instructions. Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that capacitates systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The combination of AR, AI, and ML could effectively transform digital experiences. AR experiences are highly stimulating, which prompts the need for objects that behave in accordance with the rules of the real world. So, the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning could render photorealistic results, the likes of which would have necessitated hours of creative work in the past. It allows creators to develop immersive experiences much faster while allowing users to interact with the created experiences in real-time. But here\u2019s the catch; the application of AI goes beyond accelerated content creation. It can help designers use data on consumer preferences and showcase products in 3D, just the way they want it. This promotes customer interaction, and customer interaction leads to improved services. It paves the way for the creation of mind-blowing 3D content and helps customers interact with such content. For visual artists \u2013 it facilitates a new medium of expression; and to brands \u2013 a new way to promote, interact and cater to the market appropriately. ",
