            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say that laissez faire was an historical movement against protectionist trade policies and in favor of free trade. It brought with it the economic arguments for the benefits of free markets. In parallel there was the liberal movement (in the old sense of the word), an historical movement that advocated for greater personal freedoms, for freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, etc. It was a humanist movement that saw a more just, and more satisfying world if people were generally allowed to have greater freedom. The above were mainly 18th century movements. Then in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries you saw increasing critiques of the state, of the concentration of power, of the presumed authority of that power. These ideas, along with others, like the socialist critique of private property, combined and recombined many times over the years, and went by many names. Libertarianism, is the name given to the movement, since the 1950s, that sees economic freedom as a part of personal freedom, advocates for both, and treats the state with great suspicion. ",

The more powers (scope of influence) we grant the government the larger it has to be. When it starts curtaining competition and productivity is when problems arise. Where is the balance? ",
