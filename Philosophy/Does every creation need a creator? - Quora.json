            "answer_text": "Does any creation need a creator? Yes, except for God as he is eternal. As recorded in Qur\u2019an 52:35-36 unbelievers will be asked: \u2018Were they created without a Creator? Or were they their own creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? In fact, they have no firm belief\u2019 Everything in the universe is a miracle and is a proof about the existence of God Everything in our own creation is a miracle and is a proof about the existence of God Moving your hand is a miracle; check with a paralyzed person if you have doubts about that Sight and hearing are miracles, check with blind and deaf people if you have doubts about that Every newborn baby is a miracle Scientists cannot create any sort of male and female objects which will re-produce Scientists cannot create a fly or a misquote If the unbeliever wants a strong evidence about the existence of God or the afterlife (like to see God or someone should rise from the dead), then life will not be a test environment anymore. Even if that miracle would happen, unbelievers might not be convinced and might find other excuses for their disbelief. Those who can see the miracles in everything around them and in their own creation then deny the existence of God, might not believe even if someone should rise from the dead. In Luke 16:19-31, Jesus taught the parable of The Rich Man and Lazarus and explained that If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead. \u201cAnd even if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead spoke to them and We gathered together everything in front of them, they would not believe unless God should will. But most of them are ignorant\u201d Qur\u2019an 6:111 God sends prophets to guide people to believe in the only true God who created everything, to repent, obey him, and do good deeds Prophets did not teach that God has preserved the holy book; they advised that there would be changes and warned of such additions and manipulation. Scribes have added and manipulated scripture verses for boasting and to explain religion to their benefits. Truth seekers ignore the additions and manipulations that are not in the common-ground teachings Some people pay attentions to the additions and manipulations and consider that as an excuse for atheism It is true that people thought of many supernatural beings, but that does not disprove a great creator It is true that scribes have inserted many verses for boasting, but that does not disprove a great creator It is true that scholars have manipulated the scripture and explained it to their benefits, but that does not disprove a great creator It is true that priests have tortured their opponents and still reap the financial gifts in exchange of the alleged spiritual gifts, but that does not disprove a great creator Bad religion teachings should not lead us to deny the existence of God. Bad scholars should not lead us to deny the existence of God because prophets have warned us of the bad teachers and of their bad fruits (their wrong actions and wrong teachings) Even if you are agnostic, you should not have a problem accepting a creator for that marvelous universe, pray to that God. Do not call any name like the God of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, just pray to the only true God who has created everything. Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives; we may not feel inner peace without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day...for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates God is testing us in our short life on earth; the wealthy father has the right to test his children before distributing the wealth. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: Sabri Shahin's answer to How do we know our purpose of existence in this world?

            "answer_text": "Once you define a thing using the word \u201ccreation\" or the related word \u201ccreature\", you have assumed a creator. By the way, I do not object to that. I am a Christian, and definitely believe in a God who \u201ccreated heaven and earth\". But words have meaning, and we need to be clear that we do not derive our theology simply from our vocabulary. One thing to settle would be to decide what we mean by \u201ccreator.\u201d The first job is ALWAYS to define terms! Does a creator have to be a personal entity; something having mind, will, emotions, purpose and intent? All those things we mean by personality or person-hood? Or might we use that word for a set of fundamental principles, which cannot be themself reduced as being effects of other principles, and result in the universe (singular or plural) inexorably working out the way it has. Can this also be a fit recipient of the title \u201cGround of Being\" or \u201cFirst Cause\"? Perhaps that is time. Although I doubt that. Perhaps it is the elusive \u201cunified field theory\" that resolves the 4 fundamental forces as manifestations of one another, and all matter as expressions of that energy. Perhaps something else (at least something better said!). But at the very least, things that simply are what they are, and result in the way other things work. I wonder how much acceptance this scheme would get, whether we use the name God or not. As a monotheist, I believe that this is the minimum understanding of God, and is shared by most of us. If we dont take that as being at least part of what we mean by God, then He is NOT the fundamental reality, only one of the items in it, and must hand over the executive stationary and the corner office to the real fundamental. After this, it is a matter of deciding if those \u201cpersonal\" descriptors I asked about in the beginning are in anyway appropriate. (Spoiler alert - I think they are, but that is a much longer discussion.) ",

            "answer_text": "I propose an alternative approach to this old question. Let\u2019s reframe it as: \u201cDoes every object or group of objects have a history ?\u201d This then includes objects such as human brains which can contain emotions and feelings, or not. Then to answer the question I say \u201cYes\u201d. So far, from our experiment and observation, objects have a history, that is they have a past. Now that does not imply they have always existed in the form they have today, for example, consider a round stone you might find on the beach. It has a history which probably involves water and movement and changing form. So can we agree that every object has undergone a creative PROCESS\u201d. No need to invent any agents so far. N.B. this can be destructive as well, such as a volcano or storm, or radioactive decay. And we do know that matter can (is expected to) emerge from empty space, so this is also part of the creative process, the movement of energy into its different manifestations. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with the concept of a creator is \u201cwhere did he or she come form?\u201d If you assume the universe needed a creator, then why doesn\u2019t the creator need a creator too? If we assume the creator didn\u2019t need a creator but has always existed, why don\u2019t we apply the same logic to the universe? As it happens astronomy has confirmed that there was an instant of creation, but what followed took vastly longer than seven days, 13,500,000,00 years or so. The Laws of Physics that govern it are totally consistent in every place and time and look suspiciously like they were designed to create life in very solar system with a planet the right distance from its star. I can forgive Genesis for allowing that a metaphor works better than trying to explain all that to Iron Age tribes, and I can commend it for still conveying the same message in 2020. I can\u2019t forgive those who insist on interpreting it literally & discarding he wisdom of the metaphor. ",
