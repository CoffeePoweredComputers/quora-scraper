            "answer_text": "Some people feel that the question of a maker or creator or designer or god or afterlife or soul are outside their ability to answer and make no difference whatsoever in their daily goings sons, so they just do not care. Is there a god? Is there not a god??\u2026 are NOT questions an existentialist will bother considering, not when more important things like\u2026 What am I going to have for dinner? Do I have enough snacks for the party this weekend? I wonder if Bob is available for golf next Tuesday afternoon? Because they realize those matters are far more important to their existence. Their stance is \u201cWe don\u2019t care, leave us alone\u201d. In a manner of speaking. ",

            "answer_text": "I would explain existentialism as an assessment that, at best, can only superficially dabble in various metaphysical concepts. Is there a universal or objective meaning to life? Does life have a purpose that goes beyond our organic paradigm? When you get past a philosophy that espouses a pragmatic approach, these kinds of questions suddenly fall into the realm of dalliance. As an organism, we\u2019re given a canvas. We paint it with concepts and behavior. Creating a philosophical abstraction that can orient our existence here is done at a local level and is made to fulfill our needs and desires. Trying to create an abstraction that can orient our existence beyond this is a metaphysical work of art or a religion and it cannot be taken all that seriously (except by the believers). We do not have the tools to answer the questions that are extending beyond our own parochial shorelines. ",
