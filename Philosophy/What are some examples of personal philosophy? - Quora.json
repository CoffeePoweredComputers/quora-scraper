            "answer_text": "Very few people have thought out personal philosophies. Most people will call an fortune cookie fortune their \u201cphilosophy\u201d. Something akin to \u201calways do good\u201d or \u201ctoday is good, tomorrow will be better, but the best is yet to come.\u201d A philosophy in the way this question is asked would be more like a personal ethos or code of conduct. A specific way of looking at life and its series of events and how to handle or accept their occurrence. But a philosophy is a championed cause. Something one thinks about and mulls over time and time again and tests in all sorts of ways to see if it holds up as a philosophy. For example, just quoting Mark Twain, \u201cSing like no one is listening, love like you never been hurt, dance like no one is watching and live like it is heaven on earth.\u201d is a wonderful sentiment and good advice, but it is not a philosophy. To transition this quote into a philosophy, one would need to contemplate what to \u201csing like no one is listening\u2026\u201d means, or how does one \u201cSing like no one is listening\u201d? Do you actually have to sing? Do you just not care how or what you sound like to others? When is it appropriate to have this attitude? Are there times where this could be detrimental? Each phrase in Mr. Twain\u2019s quote would need to be examined, explained and supported by reason as to its applicability in all situations or justifications for when it can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t work. From those thought out explanations and supported reasonings, one can then develop some practical applications by which to conduct oneself. Now this would start approaching a philosophy. For one to truly have a personal philosophy takes a great deal of though and effort and most people won\u2019t put the time into it; therefore, I can\u2019t give you even one example of a personal philosophy. I use to tell my father that my philosophy started with, \u201cIndecision is the key to flexibility.\u201d Then I was free not to develop a personal philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "The following is a pivotal part of CUSP: common unifying sense plan being constructed fundamentally to address the \u201cwho and why am I in reality\u201d and its response. The dichotomy between the free will human individual and human persons has not been articulate enough. The issue still daze many. For example, personas may confuse confidence on themselves with way/methods to control situations<>others with their grandiosity personality. Yet some personal philosophies are just that: human marionettes interacting with their ventriloquist in a well rehearsed speech acts. Giving advice being unsolicited or not could be constructed as a dereliction of our own responsibility. For the one that is soliciting it and for the one that is giving the advice. One factor in this narrative is that persons are bundled<>clustered together by their culture/society, which can be closed or open. In this context, a fundamental difference between an open and a closed society is that, in an open society there is the probability for persons to recognise themselves as human marionettes, and to accept that, in fact, they are prompted to act by the power acquired by other persons upon them, and this probability is greater in open that in in- closed societies. If a person becomes aware of the conditioning that is applied on them, then that person might start the process towards individualization, which alas is often reduced to person\u2019s vain desires for transcending their own conditioned images of themselves or personality, instead of pursuing what is immanent in themselves: namely, the improvement of humanity by actions devoid of antagonism that are increasingly recognised as actions with a distinct and actual value that might serve as a template for the universal response to the human universal quest being built. In context, and accordingly to speech acts theory, when utilizing human languages we tend to use it partially by ignoring the part that enable speakers to get the intended meaning in utterances because we are bound to depend on known clauses with which we keep regurgitating opinions that are not necessarily useful if they don\u2019t contribute to universalize the response to the universal human quest. In my opinion to act devoid of antagonism carries the humanity spirit that is effected by agonistic actions. For these reasons is highly probable that the best intentionality of human spirituality is manifest in actions devoid of antagonism. ",
