            "answer_text": "Yes, it is possible to have parallel worlds. There is no pratical proof for this statement but there are many theoretical opnions and assumptions. We have seen multiple dimensions or heard the concept of it in many movies or TV series like Dr Strange, Ultimate Spiderman, The flash, Avengers Endgame etc. According to MCU's Dr Strange and Avengers Endgame, there is a multi verse. And the alternate timelines are created when we change the past. But there will be no change in the present timeline. For example, in Avengers Endgame, when Thanos and his army comes from past to present, present Nebula kills the past Nebula, yet the Nebula of the present is alive. In this way two parallel worlds are created, in one Nebula is dead and in another she isn't. It is like if I go back in time and kill one of my friend, my friend won't be alive in the future of my past timeline but he will be alive when I come back to the present time. So there are two worlds, one in which my friend is not alive and the other in which he is. This theory is completely contrary to The Flash theory. In flash, if you change the past, your future will be changed. Parallel worlds in flash are shown as a different earth in this series. Like there is universe, and in this universe there are many galaxies and in each galaxy there is planet Earth. In Earth 1, if I am dauntless in another earth I will be timid. And in Ultimate Spiderman there are just parallel worlds similar to flash but there are no multiple earths. Its just parallel worlds where I am male in one world and female is another. In one world, the cities are highly sophisticated and in another it is not. What I believe is there are parallel worlds like Ultimate spiderman. And these parallel worlds emerge because of the decisions we make in our lives. Every day we gets choices, what we opt will be our reality and what we didn't will be our alternate reality. For instance a girl comes and proposes me and I accept, this is my present reality and the alternate is the one where I didn't accept her. And I would love to travel between parallel worlds and see my other selves. My biggest fantacy is to meet my female version. Edit - There is also an alternate reality where all the people who read this answers leaves an upvote. Lets make this that universe. -Vikramadithya B) ",

            "answer_text": "The MULTIVERSE theory states that the universe we live in may not be the only one in extentance. In fact, our universe could be just one of an infinite number of universes making up a \"multiverse.\" There are several theories explaining how multiverses are formed - like the extension theory, inflation, parallel universes, daughter universes, mathematical universes etc. I will not attempt to explain all.  It is  vast subject. Since we are only looking at the possibilities of their existence, we need to take a look at what quantum mechanics says in this regard. According to quantum mechanics, 'objective reality' does not exist. What are seeing are only probabilities that are converging into a certain configuration, and all other possible realities must exist in a multiverse. There are two main theories as to what these different universes may contain. The first proposes that the same matter and the physical laws that exist in our universe prevail in these universes too. However, due the varying degrees with which they were created, it allowed for these other universes to have every possible combination of particles available - meaning - the continents would probably be where our oceans are, and so on. The second idea is that the other universes may not even operate in the same way as ours does. There could even be different physical laws and spatial dimensions. The first model allows the idea that any given person can exist at the same time in more than one place. If  we are able to find out how to travel to these other universes, we would be able to \u2018meet\u2019 our other selves - a'la \"FRINGE\" the American SciFi TV serial in which travelling to a parallel universe is shown. In one world you could be a scientist, in another world a Formula-1 racer, in yet another world a Golf champion, and so forth. The options would be virtually limitless. Mathematical discoveries made by scientists positively state that multiple universes exist.  Parallel universe theory was first proposed by an American physicist, Hugh Everett in the mid-1950s. The theory attempts to solve many of the mysteries of quantum mechanics. Everett claimed that the universe splits every time a new physical opportunity is explored.  There is a possible alternative outcome in the alternate universe for each event occurred in our own universe.  This theory has gained great acceptance not only from quantum physicists, but also from past life regression therapists. I personally dismiss parallel universe theory as scientific fiction, as the idea is quite unearthly as of now. But many well- known researchers are propagating this theory these days.  It is gaining new supporters all the time. I fully agree, new research studies may unveil fresh evidence. Already, scientists at Oxford University have offered a mathematical answer to this controversial theory. This research shows that Dr Hugh Everett was on the right track. So much so, this research is one of the most important developments in the history of science.  The eminent American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman once noted: \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\" ",

            "answer_text": "There is practically no book, no publication about cosmology, where you don't have to drive the road to the parallel universe at some point. Because back there lies the solution to a problem most people don't know anything about. So the point is that you don't understand why the world is the way it is. Quite simply. Why is the world the way it is? And if you take a closer look at it: Why is there such an incredibly finely tuned nature, a universe that can't be any different, otherwise everything would collapse? The fine tuning thing goes back to a work by Stephen Hawking from the 70s. Where he calculated: If I would disturb the universe a bit at the beginning, a bit more energy or a bit less energy, what would that mean for the long-term development of the universe? The fact is that when a universe has a lot of mass, it collapses again. After initial expansion, mass, i.e. gravity, would retract the universe and then collapse back to 0. And so there's the so-called cyclic universe. There's the idea that it always repeats itself. Then there's the other variant: A universe begins with an expansion, but it's too light that this expansion can be brought back again by its own gravity and races apart! And then there's the variant in between. Where everything is exactly right. So the universe will just start to expand and will go on and on and on and on. In this universe it just goes on and on. And what Hawking found out is that you have to fine-tune the universe. It looks like a ballpoint pen is standing on its tip, but if a ballpoint pen is standing on its tip and the tip is not standing on a table and stops. The probability that the pen will stop now is almost 0. Of course there is no such thing. It doesn't just stand on a plate and stop, it stands on a razor blade. And this razor blade stands with its blade again on a razor blade on another razor blade on a razor blade on a razor blade. One could get the impression that there are 10^55 razor blades standing on top of each other and at the very top the ballpoint pen is standing. And does not fall over. The universe is so finely tuned. This is of course a provocation for a scientist. That can't be! There's always room for manoeuvre. And the others said: Nope, necessary. It could be that there are 10^500 parallel universes. Yes! One universe is too heavy. Falling down again. The other one is too light and flies apart. And so the one in which we live is the one where the combination of natural constants and laws of nature has led to exactly what we are today. This is how the idea arises that there could have been others outside our universe, at least in terms of time. So without the beginning of a universe there's no time. But we could say that there is a multiverse. So a super-universe, in which individual universes would arise. And that's how they would have come into being. Or they were created at the same time as ours. Only somehow differently, somewhere else, so that they didn't survive it in any case. As I said, some of them have flown apart. The others have collapsed. There was actually a completely empirical reason, because there are a number of observations that cannot be explained any differently than with a kind of over-expansion. This over-expansion is called \"inflationary expansion\". What is inflation anyway? Inflation is over-expansion. So there's the normal expansion and then there's the sudden over-accelerated expansion of the whole universe. And that was clearly after the Big Bang. The big bang is after 10 to 43 seconds and the inflation was at 10^-30 seconds. So there has passed an eternity in between. And there the universe had felt quite well before actually the whole time and then it was disturbed. And then it made Booom! And the universe flies apart by 50 orders of magnitude in 0 time. What kind of universe is that? We observe that the universe is obviously flat as a board. So really as flat as a board. So apart from such small wells - they are caused by the presence of matter. This is known from the general theory of relativity. The presence of matter bends space-time. Yes, where there is a lot of mass, there is spacetime. But if you average it all away, then it's on the long run, as it's so nicely called, it's flat as a board. A three-dimensional body that is flat, that is flat everywhere. It could be a sphere that is so oversized, that you can measure it locally, within a few billion light years, because the universe is so huge. And so the idea of inflation came into the world. But if that's the case, you have to ask yourself: is there any mechanism that can explain it? Yes. There is. To translate that into our world: It's about subcooled water. So water is normal, when it gets cold below 0\u00b0C water starts to freeze from top to bottom. Is clear. If it becomes colder and colder, it will freeze through sometime. But if you cool it down very, very, very slowly so that the water doesn't notice it, then it stays liquid. The world record is well under -20\u00b0C. But of course it is wrong. And what happens to the wrong thing? The smallest disturbance freezes the water. And this freezing naturally releases energy. What used to be the free energy the water molecules still had, now they are locked in crystal, now suddenly this energy is released. And this energy would have been released in the universe. It would have caused the universe to over-expand. And perhaps another tiny hint: the idea of inflation was based on an idea. The idea of scalar fields. So a scalar field is a field that is everywhere. Direction-independent everywhere. That's what we found. Since 2012 we definitely know: There is such a scalar field. It's called a Higgs field. This is an example of a field that could have made this transition in the early cosmos of inflationary expansion. And that would make a great connection between the greatest and the smallest. So elementary particle physics and cosmology. We would have reconnected that now. That's great. And maybe we would have got an idea that it is actually possible that such a fine tuning actually leads at the beginning to the fact that once you put such a ballpoint pen on a razor blade in a real universe, it stops there. That's unbelievable. But of course it's also clear that if the whole thing had taken place again in a superuniverse, then there could also be other universes that are currently expanding parallel to our universe. And they collapsed relatively quickly under their own weight. Others have also stopped for a long time. Expanding somewhere. What is outside our universe and what was before the beginning of the universe, we cannot answer everything. Because we are empirical scientists. We try to gain insights empirically, i.e. with the help of experience. These findings always take place in such a way that one tries to measure something and to observe. And in this way we know today: it could be that there are parallel universes. There is our universe. And that is remarkable. It has the property that there is no turning back. Yes. It is so that since 13.82 billion years a time arrow exists in this universe. And it always goes forward. There is no way back. ",

            "answer_text": "I think they do, given the immense nature of reality. There is so much possibility for a parallel universe to exist, or maybe our universe is just \u2018all that is\u2019. Well, It also really depends on what defined as a parallel universe if we were to take into account this possibility: Quilted Multiverse In a Quilted Multiverse theory, our universe is infinite and endless. In this kind of universe, anything that could ever happen by chance/probability has happened at some point far in space. Anything that you have experienced that correlates with probability has to have happened somewhere. In this universe, there may be infinite copies of you spread across space itself. To get a feel for why imagine a box of legos:  In this image, you can see different pieces that have a fixed amount in which it could be uniquely arranged:  But you can\u2019t arrange bricks uniquely forever. After you recorded all possible arrangements for a fixed amount of bricks, you are gonna end up repeating the arrangement at some point or another. The atoms in your body, all 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 of them are finite. They have a finite number of unique arrangements, yes it may be huge but still finite. Imagine an infinite universe, where possible arrangements are finite but pieces are not, you are bound to find an exact copy of yourself both structurally, and mentally. Anything that has a finite amount of arrangements will eventually end up repeating itself in some extremely far region of space. Most places will look unique and special because of the vast numbers of atoms and arrangements. There are some places that may look almost identical to you but may differ in some parts or another.  Will we ever contact our duplicates? Unlikely, since to find our duplicate within a vast probability of things in infinite space is impossible. Even communication would prove to be impossible because of the finite speed of light, we will likely never contact them. As far as we are concerned we may never know of the existence of duplicates! imagine the crazy stuff would find if we were to traverse far enough. Inflationary Cosmology This theory posits that the \u201cbig bang\u201c is kickstarted by a drop in potential energy filling reality itself. This potential energy is dubbed a \u201cHypothetical Inflaton Field\u201d.  You can imagine The Inflaton field to be like balls on top of hills. When it\u2019s ontop it experiences the highest amount of gravitational potential energy. And when it's on the bottom of hills it experiences no GPE. So using this analogy, an \u201cInflaton field\u201d is just like a ball, when the fields \u201cvalue\u201d is highest, it has the highest potential energy, and when the value is at its lowest it has low potential energy. The theory states that the \u201cbig bang\u201d is caused by the value of the inflaton field to drop just like a ball rolling down a hill. When a ball rolls down a hill, it\u2019s GPE converts into kinetic energy. So when the value drops, the energy coalesces into particles, atoms, planets, stars, galaxies. And the expansion is aided by \u201crepulsive gravity\u201d. The repulsive gravity in the \u201cInflaton Theory\u201d reality itself is filled uniformly with the inflation value everywhere. Since the value is uniform everywhere in space is the same in terms of energy. let's say imagine a bottle with a fixed value in it:  Imagine inside it, is number five. When I slide the cork outwards I am creating extra space, and this field must be equal everywhere, but energy cannot be created. For this not to happen instead of pushing outwards, the cork must pull inwards to cancel the outward force. So using this analogy for the universe, gravity must be repulsive for this very short amount of time to make sure no law is broken. Okay, inflaton field, repulsive gravity, what else? According to this theory, the universe started off really small, as small as an atom. The theory states that quantum mechanics should play a role here, quantum uncertainty should affect the field's value. Think back to the ball analogy, imagine that when a ball is falling down, it is suddenly pushed back up, and some balls ontop slopes are kicked out of their potential energy curve creating a universe of their own. In the vast nature of reality itself, it would seem as if universes are being created here and there. Some collapsing back upon itself and some are undergoing inflation. It's all dictated by quantum uncertainty, and the CMBR(COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND) supports it with its random temperature difference indicated by darker regions.  Binary Universe In this universe, there is a constant amount of universe being created out of nothing, it may seem like it is violating the second law, however, it is not, and here\u2019s why. It this type of universe, there are always a pair of universes being made, but their properties are opposites of each other like charge and mass. A -1/+1 universe, the theory posits an anti-universe made out of pure anti-matter. These types of universes are created from nothing, but as we all know a +1/-1 is always zero, so no law is violated here. That is what the recent evidence for a parallel universe suggests. It is also stated that time runs backward in an anti-universe. Who knows what is out there!  There also many other proposals for a parallel universe, and writing the all would take too long. Reality itself is a much more interesting place than we\u2019ve could ever imagine. thank you for reading ,\u2019:) ",

            "answer_text": "The parallel universe theory is real and has now been proved with a series of physical experiments. The parallel universe theory is formally known as the Everett/Wheeler hypothesis or \u201cthe many worlds\u201d interpretation of quantum mechanics. As a researcher with more than 20 years looking into the theory and its implications, I\u2019ve done more than anyone to look for evidence that it is in fact true, as well as how it applies to fundamental questions in the advanced concept area, such as time travel. Last year, I began to formalize an approach to test my theory that retrocausality experiments and the Everett/Wheeler hypothesis are in fact related and could be brought under the umbrella of the Participatory Universe model, posited by John Archibald Wheeler, the same \u2018Wheeler\u2019 in the Everett/Wheeler hypothesis name. Because there is plenty detail in both the press release that I\u2019ve provided a link to, as well as in the video reel which includes analysis of the experiments themselves, I will just say that my thinking was to mimic the typical retrocausality, \u2018which way path\u2019 test where the path of a photon has been altered after it has already passed that point, and as a result, it appears at a different detector than it should have - as if the change had altered its route in the past and produced an inconsistent result. This has been seen as a violation of causality, i.e. a time paradox, but I know that such paradoxes actually violate the Copenhagen interpretation which states in part that there can only be one outcome per universe. In short, looking at these experiments at the point of the path change, I saw the obvious - that this is where the universe splits - not with the past being changed, but a new parallel universe coming into being that has the new, inconsistent result - the photon at a detector which was not the one for the path that it had originally started down. Unlike the EWH, this is not directly the result of the decoherence of universes from a superpositional state, this is the result of the participatory universe model, where the universe (or omniverse, but NOT multiverse) responds to what has happened, and serves as the engine or functional operating system, for all of these kinds of quantum weirdness. As a result, evidence for parallel universes has been around for decades, but was simply being misinterpreted. My experiment proves this by performing the \u2018which way path\u2019 test with a laser pointer, a 2 way mirror as a beam splitter, and a high speed electric fan as a shutter system, to change the path of the transmission pulses that pass through the beam splitter while the reflective pulses strike a side wall. When a fan blade passes close enough behind a transmission laser pulse, the \u2018which way path\u2019 effect takes place and a laser hit is seen to have hit the side wall where only reflected pulses should have been. The proof that these hits are not reflected pulses is that these hits happen when there is no laser source to account for them. That is correct. The pulse has hit the side wall with no source, just as would be expected for a photon to suddenly hit a detector not in its orginal path, during the \u2018which way path\u2019 tests. These hits are actually the laser pulses arriving from the original universe, which decohered at the moment of the \u2018which way path event\u2019, into the new one which now has a new past - one where the laser did hit the side wall. The implications for all of this are explained in the press release above, which has a link to the paper I wrote, as well as the video reel. However, from this moment on, parallel universes stemming from quantum mechanics can no longer be viewed as simply science fiction. It\u2019s the way reality works, and now those who thought otherwise will just have to deal with it\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I believe there is a parallel dimension to our dimension inside of this one Universe. Because people don\u2019t understand dimensions they talk about other universes. Here is something to help you. Understanding Dimensions An Embarrassing Situation: Dimensions are not understood. Most people don\u2019t know what a dimension is. They only know that it\u2019s a size of something which exists in 3 directions. The embarrassing situation is that even some scientists and mathematicians think that the 1st and 2nd dimensions are real. The truth is that every drawing or picture is in 3 dimensions. Three dimensions are the length, width and height of an object. In a drawing or photo the 3rd dimension is the thickness of the ink or color that makes up the image. I agree that you can use drawings to represent the size of objects. But, don\u2019t imply that these are real dimensions. Reality exists only in 3 dimensions or directions.  Man looking into the Milky Way Galaxy amazed at the immensity of it all Time is not a Dimension! Sorry to shout out another popular belief. Yes, Einstein gave us the idea of spacetime. Time is a constant that only moves forward. Time is the same in any dimension and isn\u2019t a part of the 3 spatial distances of space. Time exists so that everything does not happen at the same time. In the beginning time was very very important during the Big Bang. The process of quantum fluctuations had to be accurately controlled by time. During this process dimensions didn\u2019t exist but time did. For this discussion a dimension is one of the \u201cdimensional\u201d parts of the Universe. The popular misconception is that the 3rd dimension we live in is the entire Universe. The confusion is that the 3 directions of space are called 3 dimensions. Every dimension has 3 directions, including drawings and pictures. The difference in Dimensions is the vibration or frequency of energy. How can people still believe that the world is flat or that this 3rd dimension is all there is? Oh yes, they want proof, don\u2019t they? But it seems that all the proof is useless to the Flat Earth people. How much proof do you need before realizing that other dimensions exist? Proof of Other Dimensions The Big Bang is proof that the universe was created from outside the universe, namely; another dimension. The laws of physics, math and dimensions are tools that existed before our Universe. We are here because the Big Bang worked and the creation of our universe started an evolution into life. One of my beliefs is that creation and evolution work together in harmony. Imagine planting a garden as your creation. Without the attention to water, sunshine and nourishment your garden lacks the evolutionary aspect to grow. This spaceship Earth only grows with the evolution of life and our loving care. The process of learning from experiences happens with creating and evolving during the experience. What is Dark Matter? Why haven\u2019t we found any of it since it makes up about 27% of the universe. Compare that to our 3rd dimension that has less than 5% of the total matter. The answer is too easy for scientists to understand. Dark Matter is inside another dimension of our universe. What is this Dark Matter? Let\u2019s say that the 5th dimension has dark matter. Then that matter is like our matter having the same 3 spatial directions. However, the difference is the frequency of matter. Nikola Tesla said \u201c to understand the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibrations\u201d. Black Holes are responsible for creating dark matter. With the awesome power of gravity black holes convert matter into a different version. This new frequency matter goes into a higher dimension by passing through a phase transition.  This drawing depicts Black Holes sending matter into the next higher frequency dimension. How Many Dimensions Exist? String-Theory is a mathematical explanation that makes a lot of sense. It says that there are 9 or 11 dimensions depending how you count. If you don\u2019t count the 1st and 2nd dimensions because they don\u2019t exist in reality then there are 9 dimensions. There are 4 physical dimensions and 5 non physical dimensions. The 6th and 7th dimension are connected by a Golden Bridge that separates the visible from the invisible. The Eastern Gurus have known this secret for thousands of years from their teacher The Buddha.  The Big Bang enters the Universe from the 6th dimension and another Big Bang ends the Universe as the energy goes back into the 7th dimension and to the Source. The drawing above shows the 3 matter and 3 antimatter dimensions. They will meet in the 6th dimension sending the energy of our universe back to the source of its creation. Key Takeaways: Dimensions are tools used to create a Universe.The 3rd dimension is only one of 4 physical dimensions.The Big Bang came from the 7th dimension.Dark Matter is in the 4th and 5th dimensions.There are 9 dimensions in total. 4 physical and 5 non physical.This universe ends at the 6th dimension in a Big Bang.If you feel that this information resonates with you, please subscribe to my blog.

In fact, our universe could be just one of an infinite number of universes making up a \"multiverse.\" Though the concept may stretch creduLity . there is good physics behind it. And there's not just one way to get to a multiverse \u2014 numerous physics theories independently point to such a conclusion. In fact, some experts think the existence of hidden universes is more likely than not. Here are the five most plausible scientific theories suggesting we live in a multiverse: 1. Infinite Universes Scientists can't be sure what the shape of space-time is, but most likely, it's flat (as opposed to spherical or even donut-shape) and stretches out infinitely. But if space-time goes on forever, then it must start repeating at some point, because there are a finite number of ways particles can be arranged in space and time. So if you look far enough, you would encounter another version of you \u2014 in fact, infinite versions of you. Some of these twins will be doing exactly what you're doing right now, while others will have worn a different sweater this morning, and still others will have made vastly different career and life choices. Because the observable universe extends only as far as light has had a chance to get in the 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang (that would be 13.7 billion light-years), the space-time beyond that distance can be considered to be its own separate universe. In this way, a multitude of universes exists next to each other in a giant patchwork quilt of universes. [Visualizations of Infinity: A Gallery]   \u200b\u200bHiSpace-time may stretch out to infinity. If so, then everything in our universe is bound to repeat at some point, creating a patchwork quilt of infinite universe 2. Bubble Universes In addition to the multiple universes created by infinitely extending space-time, other universes could arise from a theory called \"eternal inflation.\" Inflation is the notion that the universe expanded rapidly after the Big Bang, in effect inflating like a balloon. Eternal inflation, first proposed by Tufts University cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin, suggests that some pockets of space stop inflating, while other regions continue to inflate, thus giving rise to many isolated \"bubble universes.\" Thus, our own universe, where inflation has ended, allowing stars and galaxies to form, is but a small bubble in a vast sea of space, some of which is still inflating, that contains many other bubbles like ours. And in some of these bubble universes, the laws of physics and fundamental constants might be different than in ours, making some universes strange places indeed.  \u200b\u200b 3. Parallel Universes Another idea that arises from string theory is the notion of \"braneworlds\" \u2014 parallel universes that hover just out of reach of our own, proposed by Princeton University's Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada. The idea comes from the possibility of many more dimensions to our world than the three of space and one of time that we know. In addition to our own three-dimensional \"brane\" of space, other three-dimensional branes may float in a higher-dimensional space. \u200bOut universe may live on one membrane, or \"brane\" that is parallel to many others containing their own universes, all floating in a higher-dimensional space.  \u200b 4. Daughter Universes The theory of quantum mechanics, which reigns over the tiny world of subatomic particles, suggests another way multiple universes might arise. Quantum mechanics describes the world in terms of probabilities, rather than definite outcomes. And the mathematics of this theory might suggest that all possible outcomes of a situation do occur \u2014 in their own separate universes. For example, if you reach a crossroads where you can go right or left, the present universe gives rise to two daughter universes: one in which you go right, and one in which you go left.   \u200b 5. Mathematical Universes Scientists have debated whether mathematics is simply a useful tool for describing the universe, or whether math itself is the fundamental reality, and our observations of the universe are just imperfect perceptions of its true mathematical nature. If the latter is the case, then perhaps the particular mathematical structure that makes up our universe isn't the only option, and in fact all possible mathematical structures exist as their own separate universes.  \u200b ",

            "answer_text": "There is no one theory, there are many. They are real, in the sense that the theories exist. Are parallel universes real? That isn't really the important question in science and never has been. You cannot prove that Quora exists, you can prove nothing beyond the existence of your own mind and all that you can prove by logic alone (a small subset of mathematics). Everything else consists of assumptions, presumptions and observations that are (by definition) inaccurate. If you allow that senses you can't prove are telling you anything at all (see James Burke's The Real Thing for just how wrong your senses are) are nonetheless good enough to carry out scientific enquiry (which is obviously the case) then you have to dispense with notions of \"real\" and \"proof\". You are reduced instead to the Scientific Method. The Scientific Method denies that objective reality matters. What does matter, then? First, theories must be as simple as possible to explain the observations, neither being too simple to explain what is observed, nor multiplying entities unnecessarily. Second, theories must be predictive. Correlations don't matter, for they say nothing about whether something is a cause or an effect. Everything described may be an effect, with nothing described being a cause of any of the other phenomena. Everything may be coincidental (broken clocks aren't actually right twice a day, they are merely the same as the correct value). The only way to actually know is to make predictions about what will happen if certain things are true. But you can't be a passive observer, because that still doesn't tell you what's a free variable and what direction the relationship is in. I could predict that the stars come out on a clear night. It would be bogus, but passive observation would deceive you into thinking it was true. Active observation (by flying high enough, for example) would reveal that you can see stars at any time of day. Third, some non-empty set of predictions that can be made must be able to prove the theory false (not true, false). It is not required that every prediction be of this type, it is only necessary that there be at least one at any time. Many Worlds theory is a simple model that explains why quantum effects do not produce every possible outcome. Remember, you cannot have an effect without a cause and there is no cause that can collapse the probability wave. You are thus expressly forbidden from having any probability wave collapse just because. As long as you theorize that quantum particles exist, you have to explain why one and only one outcome is ever actually seen. However, it's not a theory until it makes a prediction. Whether it's testable at the time is unimportant, what matters is that a prediction is made. Since at least one prediction must be capable of proving the theory false, we might as well make this the prediction of interest. We know that the predicted behaviour of a particle, such an electron, is that of a particle and a wave, depending on the situation. Obviously, the laws of physics can't change according to the whim of some observer. If they could, you could cause an old-fashioned television to explode by deciding that electrons should be waves, or cause a modern computer to crash by deciding that electrons must be particles. So clearly, it should be obvious that both behaviours coexist. We are forbidden from explanations that are unduly complex or which fail to explain everything observed (time diffraction, spacial diffraction, electron tunnelling, quantum states, multiple simultaneous states in qbits). Partial explanations are too simple and, under Einstein's rules, too simple is inadequate. Since all of the non-particle behaviours occur over a very short interval of time, but does not occur over a longer time (so the probability waves collapse), you need to say where these entities now are. Conservation of Information forbids information being destroyed. Conservation of matter/energy forbids the structures just vanishing. We still need a prediction. One prediction is that everything is conserved, just conserved somewhere else, the Many Worlds theory. That meets most of our requirements, there really aren't any other theories that fit observations and don't violate conservation in some way. If a probability wave just vanishes then you've altered the total amount of information in the universe. Ok, now we need a prediction that we can falsify. We don't have to have performed the experiment, or know how to, we just have to know it can be done. Well, if we entangle two particles and subject one to an event where the probability wave will appear to collapse in one of two ways, the other end (since it must exist in the opposite state and only two states exist for it to be in) is in an interesting situation. Let's place them in different time frames, perfectly valid thing to do, every object exists in a freely-moving independent frame of reference. That's why two observers can't see things simultaneously, there's no such concept. But if the particles exist in different frames of reference and one particle exists in multiple states simultaneously, the second particle must exist not as a particle but as a wave, also existing in multiple states simultaneously even though it cannot do so as an instantaneous particle. So we now have a falsifiable prediction. If Many Worlds is true, then by linking one particle at the observer's end to the many particles in the different worlds, you force the first particle to behave as a wave. If it does not, if it exists in only one state (and if that state is shown to be what you would expect by observing the other particle) then particle/wave duality is NOT a product of the predicted window of time in which the Many Worlds overlap. We now have a means to falsify, a predictive model, and compliance with the requirements of a good model. That makes Many Worlds valid in science even if it's complete nonsense. Superstrings and Supergravity (a different sort of parallel universe model) also meet these criteria. Superstrings have non-zero (probably negative) gravity, so if you fail to detect regions of quantum foam that have strange variations in density that are not attributable to the randomness of the foam in areas where superstrings should reside, you can say you've falsified superstrings. Superstrings and supergravity model forces in a way that permit them to be unified in a single description, despite gravity being absurdly weak. Supergravity tells you what should happen if you expose gravitons. So we've predictions and falsifiability. Simplicity - that's where you get the real arguments, falsifiability debates are easily falsified. Foam multiverses, it's predicted by the Big Rip and is rather essential to a lot of the underpinnings of quantum mechanics. Falsify quantum mechanics, any of it, and you falsify foam multiverse theory. Because the foam multiverse is a prediction based on an existing model, it is the existing model that matters. ",

This is just a consequence of an infinite universe and only so many configurations that our visible universe can have. The issue is that these other \u201cEarths\u201d are probably all causally disconnected from use, though in some portion of the universe there would be causally connected \u201cEarths\u201d. If you are talking about multiple universes like in either some brane cosmology or eternal inflation then again my answer is \u201cYes\u201d. But in this multiverse the vast majority of \u201cparallel universes\u201d would be, as long as there isn\u2019t something constraining them\u201d vastly different then ours. And this time they are all causally disconnected from us. If you are talking about the \u201cMany-Worlds\u201d hypothesis that people often say every time you make a decision the universe is branched off then no. It, to me, implies some initial causal link but presents no mechanism for these \u201cnew\u201d universes to be created and partitioned from the old universe. It is little more than a sci-fi plot. But let me entertain the situation for a minute. If the universe did split every time some wave function collapsed then since the big bang there would be orders of magnitude more \u201cparallel\u201d universes that have no Earth then ones that do have Earths. Unlike the infinite universe hypothesis there are a limited amount, tho staggering large, number of \u201cdecisions\u201d that have been made since the big bang. We are talking about 6x10^59 Planck time since the big bang multiplied by the number of possible wave function collapses in a Hubble volume at any given instant. Most of which occurred before the Earth was even created at this point so the \u201cEarth\u201d wouldn\u2019t even be around even if you could travel to one of these \u201cparallel\u201d universes you would most likely not be in one that contains an \u201cEarth\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Lots of things start off hypothetical and later are considered to really exist. Everything is possible in cosmology. Physicists and cosmologists are well used to considering all kinds of things which sound outlandish including; parallel universes; multiple universes; 10 or 11 dimensions rather than the 4 we are used to; and much more. In science none of these models have been proven, however science is evolving all the time. A couple of hundred years ago the idea that matter is actually composed entirely of empty space would have seemed like science fiction. Parallel universes are certainly possible and it is not impossible that we could get to the point where we have a widely accepted theory of such. There is one area of physics here where the notion of a SINGLE parallel universe has become \u201ccommonplace\u201d. This is in the study of black holes.  It turns out that it is impossible to study what happens beyond the event horizon of a black hole without using what is called a coordinate transformation. This is called the Maximally Extended Schwarzschild Solution. What the problem is, is that from our place within the universe, any collapse of the black hole beyond the event horizon literally never happens because of gravitational time dilation. (It also means that the future singularity in the black hole must be after the last event in the universe, but I digress.) Nevertheless from General Relativity we know that in the local time frame of the collapsing matter traversing of the event horizon does take place. In order to look at this further it is accepted that the coordinate system must change in order to take into account (i) this universe (ii) the future singularity (within the black hole) (iii) a parallel universe and (iv) the past singularity (Big Bang/white hole)  Well, there you have it, science hypothesises a Parallel Universe! Why this is a required feature of the Maximally Extended Schwarzschild Solution I don\u2019t know. I do know that there is a lot of confusion in science at this time where black holes are being considered. Even the best minds on the planet, like Stephen Hawking, Sean Carroll and Leonard Susskind, are not even close to agreeing what an event horizon actually is. I do know that Sean Carroll for one is investigating a role for an anti- or parallel universe in modelling the expansion of the Big Bang/white hole. So there is at least a chance that a parallel universe is real and not just a hypothesis. ",

I have read various articles on \u201dproof of parallel universes\u201d and I am gonna share some of them with you here. Man from an unknown country On July 1954, a man arrived at Tokyo airport. On checking his passport they found out that he hails from a country called Taured. Now, the passport looked genuine except for the fact that there is no such country as Taured. Also, the currency bills he was carrying were from an unknown bank, the company he claimed to work for had no knowledge of him and the hotel he claimed to have a reservation for had never heard of him either. The man mysteriously vanished the very next day. Ghost city of China People of China were mesmerised when they saw a towering city of sky scrapers appeared from the clouds. It is believed that a parallel universe opened up for a brief amount of time. Obviously, other theories also exist like the phenomenon being called as a mirage or a secret weapon to create holographic images etc Story of Lerina Garc\u00eda Many physicists believe that it is possible for us to make a quantum jump sometimes (unknowingly). When this happens, we shift from our current universe to some other universe. The same happened with Lerina Garc\u00eda when she woke up one day in a world \u2014 our world \u2014 that did not belong to her. Below is a part taken from her interview: \u201cSo I went to work in my car, which was parked where I\u2019d always parked, and it was the same office I\u2019d worked in for the last 20 years. But when I got to my department, it wasn\u2019t my department. It has names on the door and mine wasn\u2019t on it. I thought I was on the wrong floor, but no, it was my own floor. I went over to the office\u2019s wireless section and looked myself up. I still worked there, but in another department, reporting to a superior I didn\u2019t even know.\u201d All these incidents don't give a concrete evidence of the existence of parallel universes but they surely make us wonder that whether there is another universe where the world is at peace, children don\u2019t die of hunger and students don\u2019t commit suicides.

            "answer_text": "We will never really know. Just like extra dimensions, it's something which we can not perceive.  Imagine living in a 2D world. You know only about forwards, backwards and sideways. Up and down is terms you can not understand, and someone can not explain it to you since they can not compare it to anything you know or that you can observe, since everything is in 2D. So if a 3D ball was to float above this 2D world, it would see the 2D word, but the 3D world would not see it, since they do not know about up and down. If this ball was to move downwards, through the 2D world, they would only see a small dot appear, which would then become wider and wider (since the ball becomes wider towards it's center), and then thinner and thinner again until it just disappears. They can only see on the X axis, and not the Y axis.  So will not be able to see a 4D object, since our minds can only understand 3 dimensional objects. So even if it is right in front of us, we might not even see it. But just like the 2D people might have seen a thin line appearing, which just disappears...we might catch glimpses of things appearing and then just disappearing which could point to another dimension existing with things in it. But other than suspecting it, we would not be able to go there, since our minds can not understand it, and we can not see it, even though it could be all around us at this very moment. The same goes for parallel universes. They could be all around us, but since we live in this one, we can not be aware of the other.  When talking about time travelling, then the need for parallel universes becomes more obvious, especially when thinking about the grandmother paradox, where you travel back in time to kill your grandmother. If you kill her, your mother did not get born, and thus, neither did you. If you did not get born, how could you have travelled back in time to kill her in the first place? Thus, if you then add in the possibility of parrallel universes, suddenly time travelling into the past could work, since you you could then time travel, but in essence when you do, you travel to another universe, in which you can kill your grandmother without causing any repercussions in the universe you came from. Thus, you only kill your grandmother in THAT universe, and not the one you came from. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it does not even qualify as a theory. First, for all I know there could be a parallel universe, but since we cannot ever detect anything from it, then what we see is no different from when it does not exist. There is also the \u201cmany worlds\u201d interpretation of quantum mechanics, which argues that the wave function does not collapse, but merely splinters and all possibilities occur in some universe, which seems to imply an infinity of universes. My view is this is just a \u201cget out of jail\u201d card for the inability to deal with the implications of wave function probabilities. In my opinion, a theory has to do several things. The first is it must account, or potentially account for what we know that is relevant. There should also be, in the known data set, some issues that standard theory has trouble with. Standard theory might \u201cexplain\u201d them eventually, but perhaps with a huge number of terms, or terms that you feel do not really make sense, or involve mathematics without a plausible mechanism. The theory of Claudius Ptolemy fitted that - it calculated everything you wanted, but it really did not have a physical basis. So the new theory should fix those issues, and preferably simplify things, and also not involve too many propositions that involve holding your breath. You do not have to get rid of those entirely - Newton\u2019s heliocentric dynamics required gravity to act at a distance and newton did not know why. Quantum electrodynamics requires a rather dubious renormalisation issue. You can swallow some, in the hope that things will eventually be solved properly, but there should be a limit. The next thing is the theory should solve some problem that standard theory does not solve, and it should make some sort of prediction about something. Then it should be in a form that someone else can say, if this is true, then I should see . . . That means there should be a way to test it, and falsify it. The problem with parallel universes is they do not interact with ours, so there is no possible test, the theory explains nothing, because the outputs of what it accounts for is the empty set. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, For all that is worth in my opinion, study, simulations there could be only one Universe for the simple reason that there is only one Energy of Time. Something powers/energises/moves the Universe and everything in it. It is VERA \u2013 The Energy of Time. The object of my endeavours for the last 22 years has been to be able to demonstrate in a practical manner how we can tap directly into VERA and convert it into \u2018our daily needs of energy\u2019. This means a game change step as far as humanity and almost everything to do with energy is concerned. The particles, the electro-magnetism, et al, have all had their time. The future energy will need no particles, no electromagnetism and the likes, the future will go direct to the source of energy and the \u2018poisonous intermediaries\u2019, shall we say, will be made redundant.The force moving the Universe is pre-set, impossible to modify, move or affect in any other way; but could eventually be \u2018tapped in\u2019 for our energy needs. Everybody accepts today the existence of dark matter for a better word, or VERA (the energy of time) as I described it in my publication \u2018Thus Rule I the Energy of Time\u2019 in 1996. In practical terms it means that the Universe is \u2018made\u2019 of approx. 12% Matter (of which we are aware) and 88% of ENERGY (dark matter, or dark energy) of which most scientists are puzzled by; this is made of VERA \u2018entities\u2019 and measured in Teng (time energy unit) according to my research and simulations. Time is not a dimension (arbitrary measurement of movement of cosmic stones -planets, etc.), but the supreme form of Energy without which nothing would exist in Universe. - (please do let me know if you've ever encountered anything that exists outside the Energy of Time and I\u2019ll take a daily job at the local supermarket and put a stop to my theories and simulations! Everything from a thought or a smile to the ever speeding galaxies exists due to Energy of Time, it is energised/moved/powered by The Energy of Time and could only exist within the confines of The Energy of Time.Best regards Mircea Michael Colesnic ",

            "answer_text": "Many mathematical models repeatedly generate solutions that strongly hint at and in many cases require there to be multiple parallel universes. Without going through all the various explanations in too much depth, there appear to be at least 4 levels of parallel universes which range from possible to likely: Universes beyond our observable Universe. The known Universe (i.e., the part that we can see) is a spherical volume of space-time approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter. Measurements taken of the curvature of space suggest that space-time is very flat. Which suggests that it may well go on forever. In which case the Universe that we can see is but one very very very tiny part of a space which may contain an infinity of Universes that we will never be able to see. In my personal opinion, this scenario is not only likely but very probable.Quantum Universes: Research in quantum physics has proved that subatomic particles can exist in more than one location at the same time. In fact, these subatomic particles do not appear to be made up of anything solid at all. They are merely \u2018clouds\u2019 of energy. It is impossible to measure their speed and position at the same time. When you try, all kinds of weird things happen. It appears that each particle has no specific position in space until it is measured. This and other facts, has led science to the conclusion that our quantum Universe is just one of perhaps an infinite number of parallel quantum universes that co-exist together, each with a slightly different history than the other. In my personal opinion, this scenario is also very probable.Higher Dimensional Universes. There is some evidence that our Universe exists in a higher dimensional space (known as the true vacuum) where universes pop into existence all the time, like tiny bubbles in an infinite ocean. They spread out in all directions as they pop out of the nothingness as the space in which they are embedded rapidly expands. Some scientists claim they have found evidence in the distribution of galaxy clusters in our Universe that one or more of these outside universes may have collided, or more accurately, bumped up against, our own. In my personal opinion, this scenario is also very probable.Virtual Universes. There is an argument in science that since we already have the technology to create virtual universes in our computers, then there must exist far more virtual universes than real ones. Since the number of virtual universes is so staggeringly large, so the argument goes, the chances of our living in a real universe are remote. Leading to the conclusion that this Universe and we who occupy it, are simply computer programs operating inside someone else\u2019s machine. The detailed argument is often supported with intricate facts figures and statistics, but this is the gist of it. In my personal opinion, this scenario is rather improbable. Why? Because there is some evidence (however flimsy) for scenarios 1 to 3, but only highly dubious assumptions for scenario 4.In effect, we appear to live in an infinity of universes that span multiple dimensions of space-time that we cannot see. If this is the case then our universe is but one tiny speck in an infinite arena of universes that stretches away forever in an endless cosmic firmament. If you\u2019d like to read about the multiverse from the number one expert in the field, take a look at the website of Professor Max Tegmark, who, to the best of my knowledge, is the world authority on parallel universes.

These universes differ in a variety of physical properties, featuring multiple Big Bangs, space bubbles and maybe even an alternate version of you who is reading this article in a world run by slugs. The \u201cmultiverse\u201d hypothesis has been so far been impossible to test but has supporters among such scientists as Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Leonard Susskind. The study by British astronomers focuses on what\u2019s known as the \u201cCold Spot\u201d - an especially cold area of space that has been observed in the microwave background radiation coming from the early Universe 13 billion years ago. Usually temperatures of the radiation vary throughout the universe, but this area of coolness is much larger than others (about 0.00015 degrees Celsius colder than its surroundings).

The Cold Spot, first found by NASA in 2004, is a strange place 1.8 billion light years across that doesn\u2019t comfortably gel with existing cosmological models. One explanation is that it simply doesn\u2019t exist, being just an illusion created by the expansion of the universe. Spaces with lower amount of galaxies or \u201cvoids\u201d form as the expansion accelerates. With 10,000 fewer galaxies, the Cold Spot would be a \u201csupervoid\u201d. But the study, published in UK\u2019s Royal Astronomical Society, claims to prove that the supervoid is not a valid solution to the Cold Spot's mystery. The researchers think that instead of one giant emptiness in that area, there are galaxy clusters gathered around smaller bubble-like voids. And, significantly, these would be too small to be responsible for lowering the temperature in the Cold Spot. In fact, other answers must be sought. The scientists, led by postgraduate student Ruari Mackenzie and Professor Tom Shanks in Durham University's Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy, think one possible hypothesis is that the Cold Spot resulted from a collision between our universe during its early days and another universe. The energy release of such an impact would have created the Cold Spot. \"We can't entirely rule out that the Spot is caused by an unlikely fluctuation explained by the standard model. But if that isn't the answer, then there are more exotic explanations. Perhaps the most exciting of these is that the Cold Spot was caused by a collision between our universe and another bubble universe. If further, more detailed, analysis of CMB [Cosmic Microwave Background] data proves this to be the case then the Cold Spot might be taken as the first evidence for the multiverse \u2013 and billions of other universes may exist like our own,\u201d said Professor Tom Shanks. The multiverse, while an exciting idea, has its detractors. Some physicists feel since it\u2019s not something observable or provable, then a discussion of it is pointless or even unscientific. But when more ordinary solutions come up empty, the doors of science open wider. [End Excerpt] ",

            "answer_text": "Attention, this information is to be taken with tweezers, but it has the merit of being very interesting for understanding our universe as well as our cosmos. In a study published at the end of April, British researchers from the University of Durham questioned the possibility of the existence of parallel universes, in order to explain an \"anomaly\" in the cosmos. If the subject interests you, here is a TEDx conference on the subject. THE MULTIVERS OR THE FANTASY OF SCIENTISTS To get this article off to a good start, let's take the time to lay the groundwork for parallel universes. If you are a fan of science fiction, the concept must obviously speak to you. What is a multiverse? Broadly speaking, we define this term as the possible existence of other universes having its own physical laws and its own reality. For example, if Chuck Norris is a star of the martial arts and the internet, in another universe, he could be the President of the United States. This idea is taken into account in the theory of multiple parallel universes. An American mathematician and physicist, Hugh Everett, had put forward this hypothesis in the context of quantum physics, with the aim of proposing an interpretation of the mechanism of waves. The expression \"multiverse\" was then theorized, and popularized a little more \"simply\". For fans of the genre, the saga A la Crois\u00e9e des Mondes by Philipp Pulmann evokes this principle in a sentence that has remained famous. A character evokes this idea, having for knowledge the works carried out by Everett. Because this world, like all the other universes, was born from the result of probabilities. Take the example of heads or tails: the coin you throw may fall on heads or tails, but we don't know in advance which side it will fall on. If it's on the face, it means that the possibility that it fell on the pile has failed. But just before we launch it, both probabilities have the same chance. If, in another world, the coin falls on the pile at that time, the two worlds separate. I'm using the example of a coin to make it clearer. In reality, these probability failures occur at the level of elementary particles. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not really a parallel universe but seven universes. Yes, I said seven universes. How do I know, well, the ONE who created them told us so in His verbatim book, the Holy Quran. It is Allah the Almighty who created seven universes though we cannot ever reach the end of our baby universe compared to the other six. If you are looking for a scientific answer, you won\u2019t find it because it doesn\u2019t exist. However, the Holy Quran states very clearly that God created seven skies or heavens while these words are just an English translation of the word universes. The last prophet of God, Mohammad, has also given us a detailed answer to this question and said that there are seven universes though with different sizes and dimensions. Check out what he said here. The universe we know so far is only the first tiny universe and the distance from the first universe to the second is 500 years and 500 years between each of the rest of the universes up to the seventh universe. Universe one compared to the second universe is like a ring in a desert. Universes 1+2 compared to the 3rd. are like a ring in a desert. Universes 1, 2, and 3 compared to the 4th. are like a ring in a desert. Universes 1, 2, 3 and 4 compared to the 5th. are like a ring in a desert. Universes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 compared to the 6th. are like a ring in a desert. Universes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 compared to the 7th. are like a ring in a desert. All the seven universes compared to the chair where God puts His foot are like a ring in a desert. The seven universes and the chair compared to the throne of God are like a ring in a desert. The seven universes, the chair and God\u2019s throne compared to God\u2019s knowledge are like a ring in a desert. Now imagine how small our known universe is in comparison to the rest. Scientists will continue to discover more and more with time but the verbatim book of the creator, the Holy Quran, as well as God\u2019s final Messenger have already given us all the answers. All we have to do is read them and educate ourselves.  ",

            "answer_text": "There is no absolute way to prove such universes are real, or that, as you question implies, many such parallel universes exist. I believe there is at least one such parallel universe and that is the non-physical universe parallel to our physical universe. That non-physical universe is Paradise, interwoven around our physical universe. The salient factor of our physical universe is death, eventual death for all animate creatures in it and finally, eventually, as is postulated, death for our physical universe itself. . There has to be a reason for this. That reason is based on why a universe with such a stigma as death came into existence in the first place. Paradise has existed forever. Eons ago some entity attempted a revolt against the rule of God in that Paradise. God threw that entity out transforming it into living energy, thus forming our universe, the basis of which is energy, a substance\u2026call it what you will\u2026that is capable of dying and being the fundamental punishment inflicted on the disobedient entity. It took several eons for liviing entity, unintelligent, uncomprehending of anything, except a half, understood determination to return to Paradise. Living energy then began that long, arduous, atempted return. It finally realized that \u201canimation,\u201d the spirit of animate creatures, is what Paradise is composed of\u2026. only the most vague sense that \u201cintelligence,\u201d \u201ccomprehension of God\u201d is what Paradise is composed of. How living energy managed to create the first animate entity, we don\u2019t know, but he succeeded, crude as that creation was. But, God, every watching, ever knowing, entered that first \u201ccreature\u201d as well, imparting God\u2019s salient factor, love. (Perhaps God took pity on living energy, knowing of its endeaver to return to Him.) So. as living energy began the long evolutionary journey toward comprehension and intelligence, it, lived and died in all of the various, and collective evolutionary forms that resulted\u2026.overcoming death, in a sense, by the birth of new, gradually evolving offspring. And in that birth, the parents understood without reason what love was, by nourishing and taking tender care of their offspring. Now, this never-ending process was and has been taking place everywhere throughout our physical universe. On our planet, for natural, but difficult to understand reasons, the creature that finally evolved with a growing sense of intelligence and understanding arose from the simian class, until we have today\u2019s human being. Out there in the vast universe, there are evolved animate creatures, evolved millions of years before our planet even came into existence, while there are still young planets out there with animate life still evolving. So, if there are evolved animate creatures on planets out there which have intelligence and have come to a comprehension of God long ago, that means that they have come to a compreension of what death means, a possibility, after death to return to Paradise or, have through their vast intelligence rejected that possibility, having, nevertheless, through that intelligence built civilizations of unimaginable complexity. Either way, emmisaries of such complex civilizations have and are visiting us. My belief is that they are benevelent creatures, knowing God and what the whole existence of phyiscal life and death means and are watchng us very carefully. They are watching us because here on our planet, many of the intelligent and comprehending human being species have and are rejecting that possibility of a return to Paradise. Living energy in us all, finally coming to his goal, now encounters disobedience and willfulness in the very intelligence that he strove for. It is the choice of every human being to accept through comprehension and intelligence the existance and worship of God with the expectation of returning to Paradise after death\u2026.or not. One can only speculate on what happens if the choice is\u2026.not! To finally answer the above question: We only know of the existence of that parallel universe of Paradise through comprehension and acceptance of the God of that universe. When that happens we know there is such a parallel universe! ",

            "answer_text": "As per Wikipedia A parallel universe is a hypothetical self-contained reality co-existing with one's own. A specific group of parallel universes are called a \"multiverse\", although this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that constitute reality. So it may or may not be possible.  This concept was also found in ancient Hindu mythology, in texts such as the Puranas, which expressed an infinite number of universes, each with its own gods.Similarly in Persian literature, \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", a tale in the One Thousand and One Nights, describes the protagonist Bulukiya learning of alternative worlds/universes that are similar to but still distinct from his own. In popular culture like in DC's Flash Traveling from one universe to other is possible through breaches.A breach, also called a portal or wormhole, is a hole or rift in the dimensional barrier, bridging any location to another.Breach act like \"door,\" with a \"hallway\" in between that's always shifting and twisting, and if you stabilize the door, you stabilize the hallway. Experienced speedsters can travel through breaches if they're fast enough. The \"God of Speed\" Savitar is even able to utilize them so well that he can hop in and out of a location. Around 2010, scientists such as Stephen M. Feeney analyzed Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data and claimed to find evidence suggesting that our universe collided with other (parallel) universes in the distant past. However, a more thorough analysis of data from the WMAP and from the Planck satellite, which has a resolution 3 times higher than WMAP, did not reveal any statistically significant evidence of such a bubble universe collision. In addition, there was no evidence of any gravitational pull of other universes on ours. But this in no way means that there isn\u2019t more Universe out there beyond the portion that\u2019s accessible to us. In fact, from both observational and theoretical points-of-view, we have every reason to believe there\u2019s plenty more, and perhaps even infinitely more. Observationally, we can measure a few different interesting quantities, including the spatial curvature of the Universe, how smooth and uniform it is in both temperature and density, and how it\u2019s evolved over time. Even if it was possible for us to travel to parallel universe it would have taken billions of years to reach there. So what does this mean for you? It means it\u2019s up to you to make this Universe count. Make the choices that leave you with no regrets: take the dream job, stand up for yourself, navigate through the pitfalls as best you can, and go all-out every day of your life. There is no other Universe that has this version of you in it, and there is no future for you other than the one you live yourself into. Make it the best one possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps. That\u2019s probably the most honest answer one may give. The notion of parallel universes is but one consideration of a multiverse. Max Tegmark has devised a categorization consisting of four \u2018levels\u2019 of multiverses, each based on different scientific ideas but each being increasingly speculative. I will explain the underlying theories below: Metric expansion of space \u2014 The universe went through a period of exponential expansion from 10\u221236\u221236 to 10\u221232\u221232 seconds after the Big Bang, called the inflationary period. After this period the universe continued to expand, but at a less rapid rate. However, it\u2019s accelerating in its expansion and will continue to do so. As the universe keeps expanding, the observable universe will keep getting smaller as more objects go beyond the so-called Hubble sphere. This is the sphere of observation\u2014beyond which galaxies recede from the observer faster than light\u2014for a given observer in the universe. As the observable universe is estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter, observers who are more than 46.5 billion light-years beyond this diameter will never be able to get any information from our observable universe, nor we from them. For all intents and purposes those island Hubble spheres are separate universes. This is a level 1 multiverse.Eternal inflation \u2014 Inflation could be going on forever. With different inflationary regions, some regions expand faster than others, and so you get distinct regions of space. As such, so-called pocket universes emerge. This is a level 2 multiverse.Many-worlds interpretation \u2014 Everett\u2019s many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics indicates that every quantum possibility inherent to the quantum wavefunction becomes a real possibility in some reality. As such, a construct of parallel universes emerges. This is a level 3 multiverse.Ultimate Ensemble \u2014 This theory posits that all computable mathematical structures must have a reality somewhere. This is a level 4 multiverse.Do these ideas make sense? Yes, but they are increasingly speculative. A level 1 multiverse is a given, but (eternal) inflation already comes with problems. I can highly recommend reading \u201cThe inflation debate \u2014 Is the theory at the heart of modern cosmology deeply flawed?\u201d by Paul Steinhardt to learn more about inflation. As for a level 3 multiverse or a construct of parallel universes, their existence are assumed by some, but may never be validated. Each collapsed wavefunction splits the inherent possibilities and thus these worlds will by definition never be able to communicate. However, it may be that in each parallel universe, certain actions will hold true in a plurality of parallel universes, and so multiple parallel universes may visit the same moment/configuration. This is where one universe can assume to position of a parallel one\u2014exceedingly unlikely as this may be. But the event would be but an experience of a moment, and not a plurality of moments in different universes. So you would still never know if an event was shared by multiple parallel universes.

            "answer_text": "There are two approaches to answer your question, one mathematical and the other philosophical. Neither one is proof of reality or non-reality since theories do not prove anything, they can only be disproven. With that being said I will answer you question using Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything starts with two postulates added to the true void universe. We would need to define that the true void universe means that there are NO other parallel universes either. Gordon\u2019s theory of everything shows how our universe is created. That would mean that our universe would have to be the first universe since its starting postulates are only for our universe. If parallel universes were co-created along with our universe, then they should be able to be derived from the primordial postulates of Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything could not derive the creation of other universes andn provides a very specific reason why parallel universes are not real. The primordial postulates of our universe include 1) The component building block of spacetime that exist in humongous numbers and 2) The incredible amount of energy required for their initial alignment. The component building block of spacetime is called a GOD Entity (Gordon Omnipresent Dot). Let\u2019s say there was only one GOD entity in the universe and we wanted to add another GOD entity. The question to ask is\u2026 Would the first GOD entity interact with the additional GOD entity? If the answer is no, then each GOD entity would exist unto itself and represent a universe unto itself. If the answer is yes, then any more additional GOD entities would also interact with all other existing GOD entities and only one universe would be created. How do I know Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything\u2019s prediction that there is only one universe is correct? Because everything that is possible and real must be able to be derived from the two postulates. If not, then whatever can\u2019t be derived does not represent reality. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything shows that it is not possible for a fundamental particle to exist as a magnetic monopole\u2026 Physicists should stop looking for a fundamental magnetic monopole particle AND parallel universes!

            "answer_text": "I don't think anyone could know definitively if parallel universes are real or not, but I could see different possibilities being played out in this universe alone. The idea of many-worlds interpretation is that all possibilities are encompassed in different parallel (other) universes. But I could see it happening in this world already. e.g. Humans are clones of each other, but each person is different from another in many ways. So the human race is like one human, but split into billions of possibilities, and experience all the different possibilities that a human could experience. So instead of thinking about other parallel universes out there, I could see all the possibilities being played out in different humans, here and now, and in the past and the future. Or take life. Life forms are clones of one original life form, but diverged over time into many species or possibilities, all played out and seen on Earth. Or take galaxies. The Milky Way is one version of how a galaxy turns out. There are billions or trillions of other galaxies out there, each with different possibilities played out. To extend the same idea to bigger scale, there might be other universes out there that play out different possibilities of what universes could be, in a hand-wavy sense, and not in the strict many-worlds interpretation sense where each slightly different outcome splits into another entire universe.

            "answer_text": "According to the science, Parallel universe is just a science fiction. I believe parallel universes may exist because of some incidents and Indian mythological references. In Puranas and in Atharvaveda, there are 14 worlds, seven higher ones (Vyahrtis) and seven lower ones (P\u0101t\u0101las), viz. bhu, bhuvas, svar, mahas, janas, tapas, and satya above and atala, vitala, sutala, ras\u0101tala, tal\u0101tala, mah\u0101tala, p\u0101t\u0101la and naraka below.   Kakabhusundi was able to see Ramayana played out eleven times & Mahabharata sixteen times with different results.What If he watched it from different universes? Because he said different results.  In China people saw floating cities in the sky. But Government of China denied and said it just a mirage. But I don't believe what government said. Because they always hide the truth from people. Example : Roswell incident.  This story is confusing one.  In July 1954 a man arrived at Tokyo airport. He looks like a Caucasian. The officers checked his passport because he looks suspicious. He said he is from the city called Taured. But there is no country like Taured in the world. The guy pointed out the place in the map and said the places in this map is different. He pointed out the Taured is somewhere near Andorra.  He had several European countries currencies. His passport had been stamped by many airports around the globe including previous visit to Tokyo. The company he claimed to work had no knowledge about him even though he had a document to prove his point. The hotel he claimed to have a reservation had never heard of him. The company officials in Tokyo, he was there to do business with, also had not known anything about him. Later the hotel room he was held was opened the man had disappeared. What do you think may be, he is from parallel universe? If you want to understand the parallel universes concept well, then watch this movie \u2018Coherence\u2019.  P.S : Take care of your brain. This movie is insane. ",

            "answer_text": "The recent onset of science fiction movies and books centering on this subject have left no reason not to believe in it. In the words of Isaac Asimov, \u201cToday\u2019s science fiction is tomorrow\u2019s science fact.\u201d So yes, I as a scientist I must volunteer that speculation. However, it contradicts with my long-held belief that Destiny plays a major role in one\u2019s life and that everything that happens takes us to a road that leads us somewhere in life. If you believe in parallel universes, then the theory constricts your free will. It simply means that in a certain situation, you can take multiple decisions that will lead you to different paths in life, however, you can only take one decision each universe. Sounds mind boggling? Here\u2019s an example - Suppose tomorrow you meet someone charming who asks you out on a date. You can say yes, you can say no or you can say \u201cMaybe later\u201d \u201cYes\u201d might lead to you marrying that person \u201cNo\u201d might simply disconnect that person\u2019s existence from your life, thereby setting you on a different life trajectory. \u201cMaybe later\u201d would perhaps change the course of events and would result in either of the two possibilities mentioned above. Now, all these things are possible, just not in the same universe. you can have different versions of your life in different universes and that\u2019s how the concept of parallel universes comes to the fore. I believe, destiny works as a silent and invisible fifth dimension wherein it, along with three visible dimensions and time allows someone to shape the present and future in life. You decide to meet a friend, so you find the place (spatial dimensions) and time. But whether you eventually meet the person or not depends on the fifth dimension, also known as destiny. Anyone reading this idea, please don\u2019t copy it. I\u2019ve earned the copyright for it already. :) ",

            "answer_text": "The Multiverse has been regarded the theory when they have not been proven. There is a difference between Parallel Universe and Multiverse. Multiverse has a group of the Parallel Universe. The Multiverse theory tells us that there will be a number of versions in our universe. They might be different from one another. We have come across Multiverse theory but they are not popular in the theory of Many-Worlds. In the universe at present, I am writing about this topic. In parallel universe, I might be doing something opposite.   The Multiverse Theory has been defined as that theory which is something in addition to the universe at present. There is a different universe also. Every universe has been identified as the Parallel Universe while the total collection of the Parallel Universes has been identified in the form of Multiverse. As people are pondering about Multiverse or Parallel Universes, there is a vision which might appear to some people Many-Worlds theory and we might come across other varieties also. We can begin with the theory of Many Worlds. You should know that a theory is present that the alternative universe is present where a decision had been made. Megaverse is the name of the theory. It is also known as Multiverse. The Parallel World may not be time-travel as you might move back along with the time and modify it. There are other universes which is going on parallel in similar time like ours. You are not able to jump or someone might jump and inform you what the subsequent lottery ticket is going to be. An example is that you are walking across a particular street and you have turned left then in the parallel universe, you might have turned in the right direction. This action is going to predict the order of the activities. It has been named Butterfly Effect where a small change might create a lot of effect. In the present universe, you have been born. On the other hand, in another universe, the parents may have put off possessing you and there is no existence of yours. Alternate Universe has been narrated as another Universe under the Multiverse. Actually, the Alternate Universe is a new term for the Parallel Universe. The Alternate Reality has been the new style of things occurring at present. In the alternate universe, the earth is going to be totally different. According to Harry Turttledove, an author who is writing a large number of stories on the basis of alternate worlds. The Colonization Quadrilogy, the aliens have been identified as the Race gate-crash in the Second World War. The novels written by him where we find the modern weapons have been utilized in the wars day before. In certain Universe, there might be slight changes. On the other hand, there might be extreme change. The Nazi Germany had won Second World War and the way Robert Harris had stated in the book named Fatherland. The Sliders is a television series where Jerry O'Connell is acting. It has been assumed in the theme when they go into new worlds in each episode. Omniverse is another name of Multiverse. Cartoon Ben 10 mentions this omniverse. The Multiverse is smaller than omniverse and it includes a number of Multiverses. When there is a proof of existence in multiverse where there are activities of those particles in our Quantum Mechanics. In beginning of the twentieth century, the scientists have discovered the time they had given effort to find out the right location of those atomic particles like electrons, they have not found them. They discovered that they might be a number of points at one point or it might look like that. They might be in different places at one moment. The research is going on in search of proof of Multiverse in the Cosmic Background Radiation. When the universes have shown collision there might be the evidence of a radiation in the background. No evidence is observed at present. There might be something where the multiverse is present. If the multiverse is not found, this would not indicate multiverse is not present. ",

            "answer_text": "Possibly the most important \u2018why\u2019 question of all, and as such it should receive more attention. Some things are better reasoned through from first principles, and I think the universe is definitely one of those things. Here\u2019s my view. We can fairly safely rephrase the question into \u201cWhy, and how, did the universe come to exist from nothing?\u201d But how can we say it probably came from nothing? Well, the Big Bang played backwards suggests that it began as a dimensionless state. Also, the universe is spatially \u2018flat\u2019, which suggests that the positive energy of the universe balances the negative (gravity). In other words, the net energy sum of the universe is zero. In reference to this feature, physicist Alan Guth once said that the universe is \u201cthe ultimate free lunch\u201d. Some have suggested that the universe may have come from a black hole, or a quantum fluctuation in a preexisting universe. Two problems here - the universe is almost inconceivably big (possibly infinite), so how could it have come from such a state. Also, if we posit some kind of preexisting universe (or black hole) then we come up against the question of where THAT came from, so the question of something from nothing never completely goes away. For something that is potentially infinite in extent, nothingness is an excellent candidate for a preexisting state. That is because nothingness, by its very nature, should have no limit or extent, or else it would be something rather than nothing. So if we ask \u201cWhy, and how, did the universe come to exist from nothing?\u201d, we can apply a couple of other fairly logical caveats. Firstly, that there is nothing else to create the universe but itself (because it came from nothing). Secondly, that the universe EXISTS. Existence, as we know it in this universe, consists of a what, a where and a when. i.e. space, time and complexity. So the universe should be capable of making its own space, time and complexity. I would go so far as to say that these THREE elements should be considered fundamental dimensions but the complexity dimension isn't recognised because it isn't directly measurable, and probably requires some input from a universal consciousness. Both these features (but particularly the latter) cut against the grain of standard scientific reasoning. For more on this see Gavin Rowland's answer to Can we explain the fine-tuned universe without religion or parallel universes? But why would nothingness come into existence, rather than just staying as nothingness? This may be a special case of what is known in physics as symmetry breaking. Basically if something is symmetrical it is seen as being unstable, and prone to breaking symmetrically into something more ordered. As physicist Frank Wilczek has pointed out, nothing is more symmetrical than nothingness, so if symmetry breaking applies in this situation then nothingness would inevitably break into something. It is interesting that, while the universe appears to have created spatial separation and the forward movement of time, it has also created a force, namely gravity, which contracts things spatially and slows time towards a dimensionless point - the spacetime singularity. This is another way of looking at the \u201cfree lunch\u201d idea and food for thought for those who seek some kind of mathematical union between gravity and the other forces of nature. Quantum gravity may ultimately be a fool\u2019s errand because the universe created gravity out of symmetry breaking and conservation of energy considerations. And physics may be floundering for solutions because it isn't thinking simply and fundamentally enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it possible to live another life in a parallel universe or omniverse? When you experience a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, are you drawing this experience from a parallel universe?Let me explain something I apparently know about them. A parallel universe or alternative reality is a hypothetical self-contained separate reality coexisting with one\u2019s own. A specific group of parallel universes is called a \u2018multiverse\u2019, although this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that constitute reality. While the terms \u2018parallel universe\u2019 and \u2018alternative reality\u2019 are generally synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term \u2018alternative reality\u2019 that implies that the reality is a variant of our own. The term \u2018parallel universe\u2019 is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe. A universe where the very laws of nature are different \u2013 for example, one in which there are no relativistic limitations and the speed of light can be exceeded \u2013 would in general count as a parallel universe but not an alternative reality. The correct quantum mechanical definition of parallel universes is \u201cuniverses that are separated from each other by a single quantum  The idea of a \u201cmultiverse\u201d proposes that an infinite amount of universes, including the one. The idea of a \u201cmultiverse\u201d proposes that an infinite amount of universes, including the one we are living in, exist in parallel to each other. These universes differ in a variety of physical properties, featuring multiple Big Bangs, space bubbles and maybe even an alternate version of you who is reading this article in a world run by slugs. The \u201cmultiverse\u201d hypothesis has been so far been impossible to test but has supporters among such scientists as Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Leonard Susskind. The study by British astronomers focuses on what\u2019s known as the \u201cCold Spot\u201d - an especially cold area of space that has been observed in the microwave background radiation coming from the early Universe 13 billion years ago. Usually temperatures of the radiation vary throughout the universe, but this area of coolness is much larger than others (about 0.00015 degrees Celsius colder than its surroundings).  The map of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky produced by the Planck satellite. Red represents slightly warmer regions, and blue slightly cooler regions. Credit: ESA and Durham University. The Cold Spot, first found by NASA in 2004, is a strange place 1.8 billion light years across that doesn\u2019t comfortably gel with existing cosmological models. One explanation is that it simply doesn\u2019t exist, being just an illusion created by the expansion of the universe. Spaces with lower amount of galaxies or \u201cvoids\u201d form as the expansion accelerates. With 10,000 fewer galaxies, the Cold Spot would be a \u201csupervoid\u201d. But the study, published in UK\u2019s Royal Astronomical Society, claims to prove that the supervoid is not a valid solution to the Cold Spot's mystery. The researchers think that instead of one giant emptiness in that area, there are galaxy clusters gathered around smaller bubble-like voids. And, significantly, these would be too small to be responsible for lowering the temperature in the Cold Spot. In fact, other answers must be sought. The scientists, led by postgraduate student Ruari Mackenzie and Professor Tom Shanks in Durham University's Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy, think one possible hypothesis is that the Cold Spot resulted from a collision between our universe during its early days and another universe. The energy release of such an impact would have created the Cold Spot. We can't entirely rule out that the Spot is caused by an unlikely fluctuation explained by the standard model. But if that isn't the answer, then there are more exotic explanations. Perhaps the most exciting of these is that the Cold Spot was caused by a collision between our universe and another bubble universe. If further, more detailed, analysis of CMB [Cosmic Microwave Background] data proves this to be the case then the Cold Spot might be taken as the first evidence for the multiverse \u2013 and billions of other universes may exist like our own, The multiverse, while an exciting idea, has its detractors. Some physicists feel since it\u2019s not something observable or provable, then a discussion of it is pointless or even unscientific. But when more ordinary solutions come up empty, the doors of science open wider. Thank you for reading. ",

Simply you are made up of a combination of particle and energy. think of this i am giving you 3 blanks and asking you to fill it with 1, 2, or 3 in any arrangement you want, but you must fill all 3 blanks 1.__ __ __ 2.__ __ __ .. 28. __ __ __ Eg:- you can fill [1 2 4] [1 1 1] etc you can fill upto 27 different values and the 28th will be a repeat if i gave you 100 blanks with 3 each, all you can do is repeat the 27 values ( 3 raise to 3 gives 27) Same thing applies to the universe also There must be atleast 4 hydrogen atom per cubic cm. and the amount of energy per unit space should exeed too much or it will became a blackhole. when stars exeeds the limit of particle and energy it can contain in that space it became a blackhole. particles are different, as it in above its was easier to place 1,2,3 in whichever way you want but not in case of particle. Some particles can be kept together some cant. you can never place a carbon atom and Radium atom together. Now think big.. The universe its infinite infinte maybe even 300Billion light years wide or even more like 10 Trillion Billion Light years, its infinite imagine our whole galaxy. it will have a finite amout of particles and energy arranged in a specified order in spacetime. but there is like a Gazillion Gazillion galaxies like Trillion raise to Trillion Galaxies. after a finite set the same galaxy will repeat ie the same milkyway with earth sun mars and even you and me.. and this will repeat again and again,. and in some of them there will be a slight different like you may be wearing a spectales and some will have major difference like i have a girlfriend or Hitler won the war etc etc. While all these are technically, theorotically true but we cant proove it cause the differences starts far far away like Trillion light years away.. maybe one day we may able to reach them. let me end this with a joke: What about the reality in which hitler cures cancer morty ?

            "answer_text": "Thats basically a question of the opinion. According to some, they are real, and some think they are just a phantasy. But Quantum physics try to explain the theory of parallel worlds. There are really good vids on Youtube on this topic. Like e.g. this:  This vid is also funny, I think.:) The kitty cat in the vid is the observer of the changes in reality. I think that parallel realities exist. Therefore its likely we may have copies of ourselves out there doing some things differently than we do in this reality. Basically, based on this video, if I understand it well then, every action we make can be compared to a wave. Like e.g. when we throw a stone into the water. There are waves created that can overlap but are still differing somehow. Or when we throw a ball to the wall. Thats also a wave action, though it doesnt seem that way - we can only observe one outcome of this action all the time, cause we can only see things that are happening in our actual reality. We cant see the different outcomes of our actions that are happening in other, parallel realities. It is suggested in the video that the particles and therefore things, outcomes, organize themselves in the way we observe them in our reality. It seems that even molecules can think for themselves so that they can organize themselves in the way we observed them first after making an action in our reality. In a different reality, they organize themselves differently to our copy, observing the outcome. Every time you put yourself out there by some action, in parallel realities, there are copies of you doing the same action but with different outcomes. You can only sense one outcome, happening in your own reality. But that doesnt mean that other outcomes arent there, they are just happening in different realities. I personally think that the other realities may not even belong to different universes but they may coexist in our own universe, all detached by some quantum walls. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting and fully filled science fiction are the reaction that people give on the parallel universe theory. But, if we for an instant say, forget that something like this could also exist. What about god? This is to be talked on later. Your question is just what the parallel universe theory is? So, parallel universes just mean that universes with indifferent laws acting on it. There could be different color radiations, there would be some other ways else than ellipse that planets would have been using to revolve around there particular star. Say, we can have a universe in which there would not be as many as 4 dimensions that we have whereas, it could have more or less than that. This theory of having can have it is the only parallel universe theory. But, the second question is just that is there a possibility for it to occur or is it just a science fiction. Now, comes god\u2019s way in it. Our universe when started was the starting of time inside out universal nutshell as well but, what before that, was it the only start of the cosmos. Relativity and Stephan Hawkings say so but, what created out universe and the other parallel ones as well. The answer is just, \u201c The Quantum Fluctuations\u201d. The procedure God would have took to produce the universe would have been somewhat like creating a positive and negative side of Energy of universe. Its equally relevant but, how could it be? This could only be when not only our but, many of the universe would have been formed. I say so just because if god would have created our universe only that it may lead us to believe in a god that is physically alike to us but, it is obviously not the same. The universe just to begin needed a flow or whatever it was outside our universe\u2019s nutshell. And, the flow was not only for our universe but, every other like or unlike to ours. Parallel universe could be big ones like our and smaller ones which we never saw. Even our universe could one of the smaller ones relative to other ones which we can never imagined and can never as well but, before that its just unknown to us. So, parallel universe is not a scientifically thrown away theory but, its in the minds of our leading physicist. And, according to me, it would be a better choice for all if we use parallel universe theory as the starting our universe. ",

            "answer_text": "What do we mean by parallel universes? It is my belief that there are two distinct answers to this question. 1. Our universe is a duality, in one part of which we exist. The other part, which we can consider to be parallel to ours, is currently unknowable. I further believe that it exists in other, negative and 'imaginary' dimensions, the existence of which I demonstrate in the 'Davies Hypothesis'. The DAVIES Hypothesis - YouTube 2. Our dual universe is not unique. The random process which created our universe also created others all of which obey the same rules of physics we can sense and measure. Each of these universes, which we might call \u2018parallel\u2019, expands (inflates) and coalesces in perpetuity. As demonstrated by the Taijitu representation of the universe, some of our 'sister' universe exists in ours and vice versa perhaps allowing us to glimpse these other worlds. For instance Dark Matter and Dark Energy have never been observed in our part of the universe. Might it be because they exist in different dimensions. I also think that our brains operate in three dimensions of time that represent the past, present and future, of which we, from the beginning to the end of our lives, ONLY exist in the 'now'. I call the divide that separates us from our sister universe the \u2018Veil of Reality\u2019. We can\u2019t sense it but there is one place where we might expect to meet it; the bottom of a black hole where \u2018real\u2019 matter, that which we can sense and measure, is converted into \u2018unreal\u2019 and \u2018imaginary\u2019 matter and dispersed into our \u2018sister\u2019 universe via a \u2018white hole\u2019.

Though I do believe in the existence of other universes and galaxies (andromeda can be seen with naked eyes since it is the closest galaxy to ours) . But parallel universe is a whole new concept and the cosmologists are afraid already to prove it, though some research work is going on. The fact that the extraterrestrial organisms (if any) present in the parallel universe have had experienced events like ours though in an unimaginable way and eventually leading to different consequences is a fiction for me. So parallel universe?  No.  Well, our solar system is situated at the edge of our milky way galaxy with Sagittarius A* (black hole) in the middle. This galaxy, along with other galaxies,  forms a cluster. Many clusters together make one supercluster.  And many superclusters make a universe.  In the end it is said that there exists many universes. ",

            "answer_text": "We don't know what the shape of space-time is exactly. One prominent theory is that it is flat and goes on forever. This would present the possibility of many universes being out there. But with that topic in mind, it's possible that universes can start repeating themselves. That's because particles can only be put together in so many ways. More about that in a moment. 2. Another theory for multiple universes comes from \"eternal inflation.\" Based on research from Tufts University cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin, when looking at space-time as a whole, some areas of space stop inflating like the Big Bang inflated our own universe. Others, however, will keep getting larger. So if we picture our own universe as a bubble, it is sitting in a network of bubble universes of space. What's interesting about this theory is the other universes could have very different laws of physics than our own, since they are not linked. 3. Or perhaps multiple universes can follow the theory of quantum mechanics (how subatomic particles behave), as part of the \"daughter universe\" theory. If you follow the laws of probability, it suggests that for every outcome that could come from one of your decisions, there would be a range of universes \u2014 each of which saw one outcome come to be. So in one universe, you took that job to China. In another, perhaps you were on your way and your plane landed somewhere different, and you decided to stay. And so on. 4. Another possible avenue is exploring mathematical universes, which, simply put, explain that the structure of mathematics may change depending in which universe you reside. \"A mathematical structure is something that you can describe in a way that's completely independent of human baggage,\" said theory-proposer Max Tegmark of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as quoted in the 2012 article. \"I really believe that there is this universe out there that can exist independently of me that would continue to exist even if there were no humans.\" 5. And last but not least as the idea of parallel universes. To go back to the idea that space-time is flat, the number of possible particle configurations in multiple universes would be limited to 10^10^122 distinct possibilities, to be exact. So, with an infinite number of cosmic patches, the particle arrangements within them must repeat \u2014 infinitely many times over. This means there are infinitely many \"parallel universes\": cosmic patches exactly the same as ours (containing someone exactly like you), as well as patches that differ by just one particle's position, patches that differ by two particles' positions, and so on down to patches that are totally different from ours. Arguing against a parallel universe Not everyone agrees with the parallel universe theory, however. A 2015 article on Medium by astrophysicist Ethan Siegal agreed that space-time could go on forever in theory, but said that there are some limitations with that idea. The key problem is the universe is just under 14 billion years old. So our universe's age itself is obviously not infinite, but a finite amount. This would (simply put) limit the number of possibilities for particles to rearrange themselves, and sadly make it less possible that your alternate self did get on that plane after all to see China. Also, the expansion at the beginning of the universe took place exponentially because there was so much \"energy inherent to space itself,\" he said. But over time, that inflation obviously slowed \u2014 those particles of matter created at the Big Bang are not continuing to expand, he pointed out. Among his conclusions: that means that multiverses would have different rates of inflation and different times (longer or shorter) for inflation. This decreases the possibilities of universes similar to our own. \"Even setting aside issues that there may be an infinite number of possible values for fundamental constants, particles and interactions, and even setting aside interpretation issues such as whether the many-worlds-interpretation actually describes our physical reality,\" Siegal said, \"the fact of the matter is that the number of possible outcomes rises so quickly\u200a\u2014\u200aso much faster than merely exponentially\u200a\u2014\u200athat unless inflation has been occurring for a truly infinite amount of time, there are no parallel universes identical to this one.\" But rather than seeing this lack of other universes as a limitation, Siegal instead takes the philosophy that it shows how important it is to celebrate being unique. He advises to make the choices that work for you, which \"leave you with no regrets.\" That's because there are no other realities where the choices of your dream self play out; you, therefore, are the only person that can make those choices happen.

This diagram over here is called as a PENROSE diagram. It is specifically used for the understanding of space-time and the influence of a black hole on the observable universe. This act as a tool for explaining the theoritical existence of a parallel universe. In the penrose diagram, the time dimension takes the vertical axis and the space dimension takes the horizontal axis. Thus we can map the activity or events of any particle( say a photon) in thr graph. It interprets infinite time and space in a very compact manner. Although this graph is incomplete. The full graph appears as follows.  Where the top position is occupied by the black hole. The bottommost postion is occupied by the white hole which is indeed a theoritical giant or a conspiracy. And the left most is the so called parallel universe. This diagram is the simplest way to interpret the theory of the existence of a parallel universe eventhough there are several many methods.

In Quantum Mechanics, the outcome of any given event is not certain but can be described by a set of probabilities, one for each possible outcome. Everett\u2019s thesis is that each outcome must occur, each in a different universe. It implies that there is then an infinity of universes. This theory is not falsifiable, that is there is no way to test the theory. As such it\u2019s not really part of science but is what we might call a conjecture, perhaps a part of Metaphysics. In recent times the theory has become popular among some prominent theoretical cosmologists. It is sometimes combined with the idea of a multiverse. This plethora of universes suggests an explanation of the constants of nature that are fundamental to the existence of our world. Had any of these constants been off by a small amount, our world could not exist. But if there is an infinity of universes, then we appear in the only one that can support our existence, simply because it would not be possible for our world to evolve anywhere else\u2014this is the so-called anthropomorphic theory of our universe. So, is it real? We\u2019ll never know. Unless someone comes up with a way of detecting other universes. ",

But seriously, folks. Nobody knows, and nobody will ever know if there are parallel universes, but even if there are, they have their own reality and we have ours (see Trump reference above). So the answer has to be \u201cNo\u201d, since this is the only reality we know about, and there are no parallel universes in it. Except for (see Trump reference above). There are many more places in the universe than we will ever be able to know about, since we are stuck in the (barely) observable universe, so God only knows what\u2019s going on in the rest of the unobservable universe. And if Trump is God\u2019s gift to humanity, then I LOVE that God, because he has an awesome sense of humor. Be careful what you ask for. ",

            "answer_text": "That being said, we could only take account of the statement in a theoritical way. It is practically impossible for existence of multiple dimensions. There are theroies stated with more dept about the possibility. But there isn't any way for that to happen. 2D Dimension world is just an illusion for us, there are no organism that lives in 2D world. As well as 4D organism, even 9D or even 1000D, you want to count it further, thats your choice. That is one prove that it is just a thesis. Our universe is infinite and it is ever expanding, thats a paradox. How can an infinity expand more? Well the expansion is just occupying the space and time. So space and time is everything, the infinte vacuum. When we couldn't expand more infinte vacuum, we just bought in the parallel universe and multidimension in perspectives, theoretically! (See what they did there, just bought in extra layers of security to defend the multi existence theory) interesting but too much complex connection to prove it practically. That will give an example. And theoritically, if you want to make these dimensions real or even time travel real, you just have to find a wormhole, search through the entire universe which will take billions of light years, which we have not even found one yet, and connect it to space and time continuum blah blah\u2026. And travel back in time where the universe time lapse is being blend into the open portal of the wormhole. And boom you are back in time and that doesn't mean the time is ever stopping in the real dimension. You would be gone, dead as ever since you didn't have a clone machine which will replace you in the actual reality. You have to find a mysterious portal, where? We don't know, you just have to travel the universe in your spaceship for about billions of years to find it to get to a parallel universe where if you are a man, would have been a woman in the alternate universe and vice versa, if you come home empty-handed your earth will be gone, maybe even your solar system because of the time dilation. And with no cultivation, you will starve and die obviously! Well good luck. ",

But matter of fact-ly, we accelerate through time and space. If you\u2019re concerned that you could be living parallel lives, think of it this way. Your consciousness is like and also physically equivalent to electricity. It only directs itself through one possibility but the other ones have always been, if not shaded by pre-existing conditions of the nature of our universe as creation plays a role. That\u2019s why it\u2019s possible to have dreams during sleep, the feeling that something has already happened, and the ability to visualize and materialize a different playing out of life. We can\u2019t all say we fully understand how everything came to fruition or why there is chaos. But we can think of concepts like free will, natural order, and time, and at least rationalize to ourselves that the story has been somehow written for all of us as we become aware of ourselves in the lifespan we\u2019ve witnessed and dreamt. Parallel life is true. I wanted to be clear about my definition. So I recommend allowing the other possibilities and lessons to align your judgment and conscious experience to fully embrace the lives and capabilities we\u2019re dealt. ",

            "answer_text": "A simple answer. No. No proof of an alternate or parallel universe of what we understand of the multiverse theory is known. Multiverse theorists argue that the continuous expansion of the universe has produced various pockets of energy that ended up expanding at a much faster rate and created several other pocket universes of their own.What are pocket universes? New universes, a universe that has yet to expand. Some scientists pointed out that this theory of cosmic inflation, or the ancient universe's rapid expansion, lends itself to the plausibility of a multiverse. Of which I agree with.MIT researcher and inflation theory advocates state that most versions of the inflation concept result in an eternal inflation, leading to many other pocket universes being created.While the idea of multiple and parallel universes is supported by a number of well-known cosmologists and astrophysicists, other scientists choose to dismiss the possibility, calling it more philosophy or science fiction than hard science.Opponents of multiverse theories argue that the essence of empirical science does not allow such theories to be proven or disproven. Meanwhile, other experts in the field seek a common ground on the debate. However. There are clear documented accounts from those who have stepped from one reality to another and either they or those they knew, realized significant changes from this journey. Hard proof? NOT EVEN. But it does lead one to believe in the multiverse theory. Personally, I believe in only one you and me. I go with the belief that for a universe to expand, and not eventually collapse, there has to other universes that both give and take energy to maintain or sustain life. I do not subscribe to the eventual collapse of the known universe. And that is why we have a multiverse. One word of warning. It is a short jump from science to Pseudoscience. ",

Should I go left or right, a universe exists for both choices, branching out. If you could time travel back in time & change the outcome of WW2, where Germany & the axis powers won, you wouldn't change the future in our universe but a new universe would branch out, existing with that chilling outcome. There's even a universe where Hillary Clinton became President, Donald Trump's treasonous deal with the Russians exposed & he sits in prison, where he belongs. So for every choice, every possible outcome spawns a new universe, like a branching off & let's NOT forget this would mean there are countless alternate or parallel universes. So yes, there are an infinite number of alternate, parallel universes & we're just one of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes quite possibly. Observations of the cosmic microwave background are consistent with inflation. And many of those models have eternal inflation. Eternal inflation results in a myriad of pocket universes as they drop out of the larger inflation process. Andrei Linde is one of the fathers of inflationary Big Bang theory, and the originator of the chaotic inflation models. Chaotic inflation, and another leading model, \u2018new\u2019 inflation, both appear to result in eternal inflation; this gives rise to the multiverse scenario. That is, inflation keeps going in most of space, while multiple universes form and separate from the inflation process. That separation out is the Big Bang for a particular universe; at the end of its inflation era it dumps its energy into particles and radiation and a much slower expansion ensues. Here\u2019s my blog on this and it has a link to a Linde review article: Search Results for \u201cMultiverse \u201d \u2013 Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Dark Gravity ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is true that parallel universe exist. There are two theories on it. Theory one: Tree theory of Quantum parallel universe. This theory is the consequence of Scrondinger' s cat problem. The problem was that the cat was inside a box and there was poisonous gas inside the box. Of the cat inhaled the gas give the probability that will it be dead or alive. This was quite unanswerable question for decades. But some scientist tried to answer that the cat is both dead as well as alive. He said that the cat was constantly in contact with it's eniviroment, and this gives her a specific wave function (psi) of herself. But as soon as she inhals the gas she divides her wavefunction into two parts which are no longer interacting with her. Now here the game of probability that where we are present. If we are interesting with her live wave function than she will be live but if we are interacting with her dead wave function she would be dead. But both the case are true and genunine in there places. So the theory comes out to be that our every decision makes a different parallel universe and each universe has emerged from us but only difference is that their wavefunction is no longer interacting with us. So this was the theory of parallel quantum universe. Theory two: String parallel universe. This is much more complex and harder to understand so I won't go in too deep but just give u a glance of it. In this theory we deal with the most Elementary particle called strings. Strings are one dimensional object which produce some vibration. The string make everything in the universe, even we are made of strings. Now when string vibrate the same string vibrate in different dimension and in each dimension it creates different world sheet and that make parallel universe. See I haven't expalin this theory in deep as I don't want your head to spin off but still if u are interested in string parallel universe search it on Google or ask me again. Hope I helped you out. Let me know. ",

            "answer_text": "The current mainstream idea of multiple universes comes from String Theory, whose very powerful mathematics allows for multiple universes.  The idea seems to have gotten a push from people like Leonard Suskind of Stanford University as a response to the naive form of the anthropic principle, an answer in turn to \"the fine tuning problem.\"  There are a dozen or two parameters in the formulas that describe the universe that have extraordinarily precise values and if any one of them were off by the smallest little bit, the universe could not be the way it is and there would be no life in it.  The naive anthropic principle simply states:  The parameters are what they are or we wouldn't be around to wonder about them. Suskind, in his book, \"The Cosmic Landscape\" develops the idea that String Theory describes a reality in which there are 10^500 universes, all with randomly different fine tuning values.  At least one of them would then have to have the values that we observe -- ours. Skeptics point out that String Theory is simply math and no novel part of it is remotely based on observation.  So while one can imagine other universes based on the mathematics of String Theory, no one, to my knowledge, has come up with any plausible way to test the multiple universe idea. But even with 10^500 possible universes, the idea of a truly parallel universe where we all exist in duplicate but follow a different historical trajectory seems intuitively very unlikely, particularly given that the history of our universe (and presumably the history of all other universes) is the result of \"frozen quantum accidents\", fundamentally random in nature and unpredictable (even in theory).

Sometimes they will pretend that they are discussing real science, but they aren\u2019t. (In a similar manner, some magicians will claim they are doing true magic, rather than just tricks.) In science, a theory is not a valid theory unless it shows what kind of observation would falsify it. That was a criterion developed by the great theorist of science, Karl Popper. It was the standard that I was taught when I was a graduate student. I consider it to be the fundamental foundation of science, the criterion that separates science from non-science. The parallel universe \u201ctheory\u201d doesn\u2019t qualify. When I came up with my new theory of time (see my book Now: The Physics of Time) I considered it to be essential to devise an experiment that could falsify the theory, or confirm it\u2014but it had to be able to do both! It was hard, but as I was finishing the book (actually, when the book was in proof!) LIGO discovered its incredible gravitational waves, and I immediately realized that such observations provided the key to testing my theory. I made some additions in the proof that show how to falsify my theory. ",

            "answer_text": "There are at least five theories why a multiverse is possible - 1. We don't know what the shape of space-time is exactly. One prominent theory is that it is flat and goes on forever. This would present the possibility of many universes being out there. But with that topic in mind, it's possible that universes can start repeating themselves. That's because particles can only be put together in so many ways. More about that in a moment. 2. Another theory for multiple universes comes from \"eternal inflation.\" Based on research from Tufts University cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin, when looking at space-time as a whole, some areas of space stop inflating like the Big Bang inflated our own universe. Others, however, will keep getting larger. So if we picture our own universe as a bubble, it is sitting in a network of bubble universes of space. What's interesting about this theory is the other universes could have very different laws of physics than our own, since they are not linked. 3. Or perhaps multiple universes can follow the theory of quantum mechanics (how subatomic particles behave), as part of the \"daughter universe\" theory. If you follow the laws of probability, it suggests that for every outcome that could come from one of your decisions, there would be a range of universes \u2014 each of which saw one outcome come to be. So in one universe, you took that job to India. In another, perhaps you were on your way and your plane landed somewhere different (say Australia) , and you decided to stay. And so on. 4. Another possible avenue is exploring mathematical universes, which, simply put, explain that the structure of mathematics may change depending in which universe you reside. \"A mathematical structure is something that you can describe in a way that's completely independent of human baggage,\" said theory-proposer Max Tegmark of the MIT. \"I really believe that there is this universe out there that can exist independently of me that would continue to exist even if there were no humans.\" 5. And last but not least as the idea of parallel universes. To go back to the idea that space-time is flat, the number of possible particle configurations in multiple universes would be limited to 10^10^122 distinct possibilities, to be exact. So, with an infinite number of cosmic patches, the particle arrangements within them must repeat \u2014 infinitely many times over. This means there are infinitely many \"parallel universes\": cosmic patches exactly the same as ours (containing someone exactly like you), as well as patches that differ by just one particle's position, patches that differ by two particles' positions, and so on down to patches that are totally different from ours.

However, our universe is widely thought to have had a beginning, it may also have a finite lifespan; the theoretical heat death being a possible closing chapter. If the universe has a finite lifespan, and this finite lifespan reaches its conclusion, is that it? The entire lifespan of our universe from Big Bang to theorised heat death could be categorised as one all encompassing event with everything which occurred within being part of this one great event. This may seem a little philosophical, but once an event has occurred, it can never be undone. This would mean that even at the eventual demise of our universe, every last event, even the tiniest event, all of us and everything we ever did shall remain as something which truly took place. Once our universe has met its demise, it may be that the circumstances which set off Big Bang are fit to go again. A new universe is born. All throughout the lifespan of this new universe, right there in the background so to speak, will be us. Our lives are something which are truly taking place, and there is nothing which could undo that, not even the demise of the very universe we physically exist. In this sense, there could be countless universes which once existed which now exist in the background of our own universe as events which once occurred. Parallel universes? Physically, we may come and go, our signature however, may be immortal. Immortal in the truest crystal clear clarity of the moment of occurrence. I am currently working on publishing a book where in one chapter, I shall be discussing this in further detail. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you believe in parallel universes? also state why. Quantum Space Theory gives a very clear description of a plausible multiverse, and actually converted me to the idea. So until contradictory information of more credibility comes my way, I believe in a multiverse, or in parallel universes. However, to explain why I\u2019ll have to give a quick overview of the critical concepts. QST posits the existence of spacetime quanta one plank-length in diameter which resonate (or pulse) in plank-seconds. These are the smallest units of space and time that have any meaning, which is to say that trying to measure anything smaller goes beyond any definition of time or space that we can conceive of. Matter is made of this material, and in between each individual quanta which make up the fabric of spacetime are another four dimensions. Three superspatial dimensions that the quanta move around in, and one supertime dimension, which keeps track of the number of individual resonations (how many times each quanta has pulsed). Furthermore, QST posits that inside each quanta lies another set of quanta, giving the theoretical model three more spatial dimensions. Combined with our spactimes four, and the four of superspacetime (not the model\u2019s term, but mine for the sake of expediency, which this aside most certainly defeats the purpose of), this gives us eleven dimensions. Now, on to why I believe in a multiverse. Please comment if you need any further information to understand, I love talking about Quantum Space Theory. Anyway, theoretically, inside each quanta there could be an entire universe. These tiny cosmi would be of the same structure and type as ours, because that is the way this kind of spacetime geometry would operate. That\u2019s not all; if each quanta in our universe contains its own tiny cosmi, we could possibly be inside one tiny quanta from another unimaginably huge cosmos. If QST is correct, then given the infinitesimally small size of quanta, contained within your body would be enough cosmi that every single potential way the universe could go is present. The full entirety of the possibilities, from if the dinosaurs were still alive to if the Milky Way never existed, would just be happening all around us and inside us. According to QST, the cosmos is a perspective-less infinite fractal happening. Every single moment is resounding into forever alongside every other possible moment. The echoes of eternity crescendo unending. Poetry aside, it\u2019s an amazing theory, and it\u2019s concept of multiverse is one I fully comprehend and ascribe to.

            "answer_text": "As far as there being a parallel universe I believe from my own experience or other experiences I have heard about that there is a parallel universe but no more than one parallel universe. I have also believed that there is a HIGHER DIMENSION. That Higher Dimension I believe is where Heaven is and also where Hell is. We live in the physical universe and when people have near-death-experiences I believe that most of time they are brought into that other universe by the Creator. Sometimes people are on the operating table in a hospital and they slip out of their bodies and hover over their body. They have told what they saw while they were hovering over their body. I believe that the Creator was in control of whether or not that person would slip into the Higher Dimension, and not a Parallel Universe. Most people who were taken to the \u201cGreat Beyond\u201d found themselves suspended in a \u201cGreat Divide.\u201d Some of these people have claimed that they could hear the departed souls of people who were in \u201chell,\u201d and way off in the distance they could barely see what they believed was heaven. These people said that after being in this \u201cGreat Divide\u201d for a while they were pulled back to their bodies and would then wake up after the doctor's had successfully completed their medical treatment inside the operating room. I believe that heaven and hell are in the Higher Dimension, but I am not sure if they are in our Galaxy. Our telescopes can't see heaven or hell so that leads me to believe that they are inside a parallel dimension. I have had an experience where I was screamed at by an invisible spirit. This Spirit growled at me, then it screamed and I believe because of the \u201cevil\u201d I felt and heard that this spirit which was inside a \u201cHigher Dimension\u201d was a demon which is a fallen angel. Most scientists, evolutionists, and Atheists don't believe in God, or heaven, or hell. Whether or not they believe in a \u201cparallel universe\u201d I can't say, but according to the Christian Bible and the testimonies of people who had \u201cNear-Death-Experiences\u201d there is a \u201cHigher Dimension.\u201d People who refuse to believe that there is a \u201cHigher Dimension\u201d will only believe if they have a \u201cNear-Death-Experience.\u201d We are all allowed to have our own opinions. It's wrong for a person to say, \u201c I AM RIGHT AND YOU ARE WRONG.\u201d That is an \u201carrogant\u201d attitude and we should try to respect other people's opinions. I have told my opinion and what I have experienced. You can choose to believe me or not. In my opinion, there is a \u201cHigher Dimension\u201d and possibly more Higher Dimensions than one dimension. I am not convinced that there is a Parallel Universe. Burt Mottola, Christian evangelist and Christian musician ( piano ) ",

It is cooler than its surroundings by around 0.00015 degrees Celsius (0.00027 degrees Fahrenheit), a fact astronomers discovered by measuring background radiation throughout the universe. Previously, astronomers believed that this space could be cooler simply because it had less matter in it than most sections of space. They dubbed it a massive supervoid and estimated that it had 10,000 galaxies fewer than other comparable sections of space. But now astronomers from the Royal Astronomical Society say they have discovered that this supervoide could not exist. They now believe that the galaxies in the cold spot are just clustered around smaller voids that populate the cold spot like bubbles. These small voids, however, cannot explain the temperature difference observed, only multiverse existence can. ",

Even if the direction changed by point everything that has definition starts within the same possibility. If that is what you mean by parallel, then yes, they travel into the multiverses of choice. If your parallel describes the quantum, then, there to you have a science based answer as to the splitting movements of what definition rests within matter. There is never a moment that is without movement. It is a lack in one\u2019s perception that hinders the movement as unknown. It still moves, you are not cognitive on being in the movement. Do I believe there is another me, doing everything I do, only making a different decision and then the two objects of us divide to separate our being while maintaining an essence from parallel paths that extenuate each moment in a different direction in the universe, making another universe, and another, and another, etc. Then as a limited observer I will plead the fifth. As a NDE survivor though, I will give you an observation that I had where those lines of parallel evaporate and what remains is the conundrum of all that is. You see, yet are without sight. I mean everything is there and is not there. There is an eternal sound that is heard without hearing. In that parallel you see a parallel that is not parallel. Definition creates what your able to see. The loss of definition removes the border and leaves its trace on what you think. As long as we question our existence we will be under the inception of the reality to parallel universes. ",

If i haven\u2019t seen the movie or suppose if i have got important call and i need to leave, i might not have started to write on this question and there comes alternate outcome of the several possibilities which might have faced the reality. We can assume that \"alternate universe/multiverses\" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own, with some overlappings with alternate reality. In other words, this means that would it be possible that there\u2019s a Universe out there where everything happened exactly as it did in this one, except you did one tiny thing different, and hence had your life turn out incredibly different as a result? Suppose, if you hadn\u2019t taken that particular train on that day, you might have not met your life partner today. or let me put it this way, if you hadn\u2019t taken that particular train on that day and because of that event you have met your life partner today. The possibility of the outcome is reality and what if might come into the alternate reality which we can term as parallel reality/universe that there\u2019s a Universe out there for every outcome that\u2019s conceivable. There\u2019s one where everything with a non-zero probability of having happened is actually the reality in that Universe. This is my understanding of the parallel universe concept. So, what does this mean for you ? There is no other Universe that has this version of you in it, and there is no future for you other than the one you live yourself into. Make it the best one possible. ",

            "answer_text": "This really sounds like a fun question. Let\u2019s dive in. The word \u2018parallel\u2019 is a neat, comforting and easy to understand concept if we take the school geometry version of it of as two lines in perfect equidistance from each other.  Similarly, the word \u2018universe\u2019 is equally comforting concept if we just stick with the idea of a physical universe being a collection of rocks, elements and gases spreading outwards to physical infinity. Using both these simple definitions we might imagine \u2018parallel universes\u2019 as being lots of different physical universes that are arranged in somewhat of a parallel fashion with each other? Now even that doesn\u2019t seem too hard to imagine either. Whether you believe it or not, the conception is easy enough. For example, I can put my shoes in shoeboxes and stick them neatly on top of each other in my wardrobe. No one box seems to interfere with the other, even though to some extent they are supporting each other. But the contents of each box remains largely unaffected by the existence of the other \u2018universes\u2019 or shoe boxes around it. The first problem with our model is if there are \u2018n\u2019 number of parallel universes then we will need \u2018n\u2019 number of shoeboxes containing \u2018n\u2019 number of universes and we very quickly run into problems imagining how big the wardrobe would need to be to fit all these universes in? So conceptually speaking it's not that we can\u2019t imagine that there is another universe out there running parallel to our own, but moreover, how could an infinity of shoeboxes fit into our wardrobe or cosmos? The great value of this as a mental exercise is that it edges us towards a big challenge for science that holds two objects cannot take up the same parcel of space at the same time.  Our science presently has a conception of space as a mutually exclusive resource so that if a space is held by one physical object, then by definition, that space can\u2019t be also holding another in the same position. As a species, if we become stuck in this line of thinking we will be forever stretching outwards looking for some mythical \u2018boundary\u2019 of our universe where ours \u2018finishes\u2019 and the next one \u2018begins\u2019 (the join between the shoe boxes). Instead, a more flexible science would be looking into the idea of interpenetration and developing thinking and mathematical models around how one universe or object could interpenetrate through another in the same space and for both to exist as distinct and separate physical realities.  In other words, science could consider a wardrobe that contains \u2018n\u2019 or infinite number of shoes (or universes) inside a single shoe-box. There is much more to be said here but we are out of time. ",

They should be part of Grand Reality. Grand Totality of Reality should be superimposed summation of all the options, because every options should be given equal preference of probability. Our Reality is defined by our perspective, it's like we have large spectrum of electro magnetic wave around us, but we can detect only a very narrow range, similarly, we are able to perceive only a narrow range of Reality which we are evolved into. According to my theory, At the beginning of Everything (Absolute Origin) it wasn't Absolute Nothingness. Absolute Origin can't be prebiased to any Specific Preferred State, not even Absolute Nothingness. Absolute Origin should be Superimposed Summation of Absolute Totality of All Options, including All Real- Imaginary, All Past-Present-Future, All Possibilities-Impossibilities etc. The Absolute Origin which is The Absolute Totality is like Absolute Infinite of Existence. Primeval Atom(s) that transcribed into Local Universe(s) are like Unit(1) Existence Entities. During Big Bang or Similar event(s), Primeval Atom(s) transcribed/Reincarnated as Quantized Infinitesimal Entities called Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Absolute Totality is Immutable, Infinitely Infinite, Immortal, Eternal Singular Entity. Time we refer to is usually Process Value-Time of Our Local Universe. Absolute Totality is like An Infinitely Infinite Sided Rubik's Cube, like a static Solid object can be perceived through infinite perspective, similarly Process Value-Time is an illusivecounter of changing perspective created by the Interactions/Interconversions of Real-Imaginary Components of Absolute Totality. Space-Mass-Energy are representation of various densities of Cumulative Value-Time Content. If Space has a Boundary wall, then Time should have similar wall, because Space-Mass-Energy are representation of Process Value-Time of Our Local Universe. Space-Mass-Energy ( & other Expressions of Reality in Our Local Universe) are various densities of Quantized Infinitesimal Entities called Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Quanta/Atoms of Reality represents Process Value-Time of Our Local Universe. Singularity/Primeval Atom(s) before transcribing to Out Local Universe should had been high densities of Mass-Energy, so, it should have ripped open Wormholes connecting it's Past-Present-Future. So, most probably, we are still inside Primeval Atom, what we experience as Space-Mass-Energy(& other Expressions of Reality in Our Local Universe) are Expressions of Cumulative Content of Process Value- Time of Our Local Universe, i.e., like we have evolved to perceive a narrow range of electromagnetic waves as colors, similarly, we had evolved to perceive Cumulative Process Value-Time Content of Our Local Universe as Space-Mass-Energy & other Expressions of Reality. Einstein's Equation under current understanding is defined as Mass-Energy Equivalence, my theory extends this approach to cover Mass-Energy Equivalence with Space-Time and further more. If we consider E=m\u00d7c^2 only as Mass-Energy Equivalence, then we have failed to see the presence and importance of \u201cc^2\u201d in the \u201cE=m\u00d7c^2\u201d. \u201cc^2\u201d represents Space-Time((dx/dt)^2) Entity. Square of \u201cc^2=((dx/dt)^2)\u201d represents the fact that \u201cEnergy-Mass\u201d represents an Integrated value of \u201cSpace-Time\u201d. (If c^2 was a dimension less quantity, then considering c^2 as a Mathematical Entity without physical significance would had been more reasonable. If c is significant, then c^2 should be significant too. Mass and Energy aren't equal, but Energy and m\u00d7c^2 are equal. c^2 is the Dynamic Essence that changes Mass(Static Entity) to Energy (Dynamic Entity). Energy represents Mass entities that can interact with Space-Time. Energy is a representation of Mass-Space-Time Interactions. E= (m\u00d7(dx/dt)^2) & m=(E\u00d7(dt/dx)^2) If c^2 is considered as a Mathematical device/Entity with no physical significance, Mass and Energy will become Physically Indistinguishable.) i.e., \u201cE=m\u00d7c^2\u2033 really represents \u201cEnergy-Mass Entities\u201d is Equivalent to \u201cSpace-Time Entities\u201d. Unlike Time, Space-Mass-Energy are Real Physical Entities/Properties. But, Mass is a property representing Cumulative Potential Energy Content, like Quark Potential Energy. Energy resulting from Higgs field interactions etc. On above premises, let's Consider \u201cE=m\u00d7c^2\u201d and \u201cc=dx/dt\u201d E=m\u00d7c^2 (Energy-Mass Equivalence - This has been proven by Einstein beyond any doubt with best knowledge of mathematics and physics.) and c=dx/dt (velocity=change in position w.r.t change in time), this equation help us understand that it takes 8 minutes for sun\u2019s rays to reach earth.) When we combine E=m\u00d7c^2 and c=dx/dt or dx=c\u00d7dt => c=(E/m)^(1/2)=dx/dt => i. dx/dt=((E/m)^(1/2)) => Space-Time and Energy-Mass are Equivalent Entities. Square/Square Root function implies that Energy-Mass is an Integrated Representation of Space-Time. ii. E= (m\u00d7(dx/dt)^2) & m=(E\u00d7(dt/dx)^2) =>Mass and Energy with Space-Time can be used to define each other, even though considering Mass as representation of Cumulative Potential Energy might be more apt. iii. dt=(dx\u00d7((E/m)^(1/2))) => Time can be represented as an outcome of Space-Energy-Mass interactions/Interconversions. After integration of equation, Space-Mass-Energy can expressions of Cumulative Time Content. More Details: According to my theory, Space-Mass-Energy ( & expressions of Reality in Our Local Universe) are various Densities of Quantized Infinitesimal Entities called Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Quanta/Atoms of Reality represents Process Value-Time of Our Local Universe. Also, Quanta/Atoms of Reality are Roots/ Incarnations of Primeval Atom(s) that transcribed into Our Local Universe. Expansion of Space, Wave-Particle Duality, Virtual Particles Popping In-Out of Existence, Gravitation, Gravitational Lensing etc are Outcome of Space-Mass-Energy Interactions/Interconversions. So, because of above reasons, Mass-Energy systems can't remain stationary in space unless dynamically stabilized. Energy represents momentum of (m\u00d7c). Mass represents (m\u00d70). Mass and Energy are like binary states of Momentum/Speed in Our Local Universe. We use Energy to move Mass-Energy Systems. Under Normal Conditions, Maximum Momentum that can be achieved by diluting Mass-Energy System with Energy can be (m\u00d7c). We may need infinite dilution for completely purging out Mass Components with Energy Components in the System. Further addition of Energy to the System after achieving speed of light will only momentum by increase mass with constant speed to (M\u00d7c). So, system will convert into form of light beam. Einstein's Equation E=m\u00d7c^2 under current understanding is defined as Mass-Energy Equivalence, my theory extends this approach to cover Mass-Energy Equivalence with Space-Time and further more. If we consider E=m\u00d7c^2 only as Mass-Energy Equivalence, then we have failed to see the presence and importance of \u201cc^2\u201d in the \u201cE=m\u00d7c^2\u201d. \u201cc^2\u201d represents Space-Time((dx/dt)^2) Entity. Square of \u201cc^2=((dx/dt)^2)\u201d represents the fact that \u201cEnergy-Mass\u201d represents an Integrated value of \u201cSpace-Time\u201d. If E=m\u00d7c^3, that means in that Local Universe Energy-Mass represents double Integrated states of Space Time, higher density/condensed states. This might be state of matter in Black Holes/Singularity, where E=m\u00d7c^n, where n is greater than or equal to 2 and in wormholes value of n should be less than 2(most probably less than 1). (Unlike Time, Space-Mass-Energy are Real Physical Property/Phenomenon. Mass is a property represented by Cumulative Potential Energy Content.) dt=(dx\u00d7((E/m)^(1/2))) => This equation can represent: Time can be represented as an outcome of Space-Energy-Mass interactions/Interconversions.After integration of equation, Space-Mass-Energy are expressions of Cumulative Time Content.According to my theory, During Big Bang or Similar event(s), Primeval Atom(s) transcribed/Reincarnated as Quantized Infinitesimal Entities called Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Varying densities of Quantized Infinitesimal Entities represents Space-Mass-Energy and other Expressions of Reality in Our Local Universe. Further More Details: According to my theory, At the beginning of Everything (Absolute Origin) it wasn't Absolute Nothingness. Absolute Origin can't be prebiased to any Specific Preferred State, not even Absolute Nothingness.

Varying Densities of these Quantized Infinitesimal Entities called Quanta/Atoms of Reality became Space-Mass-Energy and other Expressions of Reality in Our Local Universe. Below three are my numerical predictions, and i have clearly mentioned what they mean. Einstein's Equation under current understanding is defined as Mass-Energy Equivalence, my theory extends this approach to cover Mass-Energy Equivalence with Space-Time and further more.

            "answer_text": "No!! Otherwise all news channels would be harping about it non-stop :). However, there are certain unexplained questions that can be neatly answered by assuming parallel universes: a) The anthropic principle: Why do certain constants in physics (such as the Gravitational constant, mass of a proton etc.) have exactly the right values. Was the Universe fine tuned by a creator to make life possible? Or do we happen to live in one of infinite universes where the values happen to be right enough, by sheer chance, for us to exist. b) Why is gravity so weak as compared to the other three fundamental forces of nature? Gravity is about ten thousand trillion trillion trillion times weaker than other forces such as the electromagnetic/Strong and weak nuclear forces. That\u2019s the reason why you can easily lift a cup of tea with two fingers even though the entire mass of the Earth is pulling the cup down. Scientists speculate that maybe gravity leaks into higher dimensions/parallel universes and hence in our universe, it appears weak. c) Dark matter: We know that most of the matter in the universe is \u201cdark\u201d, as in, we can only feel its gravitational effect but cannot see it. If gravity leaks into parallel universes (which may exist in higher dimensions), it is possible that the leaking gravity from other universes is responsible for the \u201cmissing/dark matter\u201d in our Universe.

Feeney analyzed Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data and claimed to find evidence suggesting that our universe collided with other (parallel) universes in the distant past. However, a more thorough analysis of data from the WMAP and from the Planck satellite, which has a resolution 3 times higher than WMAP, did not reveal any statistically significant evidence of such a bubble universe collision In addition, there was no evidence of any gravitational pull of other universes on ours. UK\u2019s Royal Astronomical Society, recently published a study on the so-called \u2018cold spot\u2019. This is a particularly cool patch of space seen in the radiation produced by the formation of the Universe more than 13 billion years ago. The cold spot was first glimpsed by NASA\u2019s WMAP satellite in 2004, and then confirmed by ESA\u2019s Planck mission in 2013. It is supremely puzzling. Most astronomers and cosmologists believe that it is highly unlikely to have been produced by the birth of the universe as it is mathematically difficult for the leading theory \u2013 which is called inflation \u2013 to explain. This latest study claims to rule out a last-ditch prosaic explanation: that the cold spot is an optical illusion produced by a lack of intervening galaxies. One of the study\u2019s authors, Professor Tom Shanks of Durham University, told the RAS, \u201cWe can\u2019t entirely rule out that the Spot is caused by an unlikely fluctuation explained by the standard [theory of the Big Bang]. But if that isn\u2019t the answer, then there are more exotic explanations. Perhaps the most exciting of these is that the Cold Spot was caused by a collision between our universe and another bubble universe. If further, more detailed, analysis \u2026 proves this to be the case then the Cold Spot might be taken as the first evidence for the multiverse.\u201d  Arguments against multiverse theories For a start, how is the existence of the other universes to be tested? To be sure, all cosmologists accept that there are some regions of the universe that lie beyond the reach of our telescopes, but somewhere on the slippery slope between that and the idea that there are an infinite number of universes, credibility reaches a limit. As one slips down that slope, more and more must be accepted on faith, and less and less is open to scientific verification. Extreme multiverse explanations are therefore reminiscent of theological discussions. Indeed, invoking an infinity of unseen universes to explain the unusual features of the one we do see is just as ad hoc as invoking an unseen Creator. The multiverse theory may be dressed up in scientific language, but in essence it requires the same leap of faith. \u2014 Paul Davies, The New York Times, \"A Brief History of the Multiverse\" As skeptical as I am, I think the contemplation of the multiverse is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the nature of science and on the ultimate nature of existence: why we are here.... In looking at this concept, we need an open mind, though not too open. It is a delicate path to tread. Parallel universes may or may not exist; the case is unproved. We are going to have to live with that uncertainty. Nothing is wrong with scientifically based philosophical speculation, which is what multiverse proposals are. But we should name it for what it is. \u2014 George Ellis, Scientific American, \"Does the Multiverse Really Exist?\"  Multiverse The multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple separate universes including the universe in which humans live. True Science of Parallel Universes  TWO POPULAR PROPONENTS Max Tegmark and Brian Greene have devised classification schemes:  Max Erik Tegmark is a Swedish-American physicist and cosmologist. Tegmark is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the scientific director of the Foundational Questions Institute. He is also a co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, and has received donations from Elon Musk to investigate existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence. Max Tegmark has provided a taxonomy of universes beyond the familiar observable universe in four levels: Level I: An extension of our Universe A prediction of chaotic inflation is the existence of an infinite ergodic universe, which, being infinite, must contain Hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions. Accordingly, an infinite universe will contain an infinite number of Hubble volumes, all having the same physical laws and physical constants. In regard to configurations such as the distribution of matter, almost all will differ from our Hubble volume. However, because there are infinitely many, far beyond the cosmological horizon, there will eventually be Hubble volumes with similar, and even identical, configurations. Given infinite space, there would, in fact, be an infinite number of Hubble volumes identical to ours in the universe. This follows directly from the cosmological principle, wherein it is assumed that our Hubble volume is not special or unique. Level II: Universes with different physical constants  Bubble universes \u2013 every disk represents a bubble universe. Our universe is represented by one of the disks.Universe 1 to Universe 6 represent bubble universes. Five of them have different physical constants than our universe has. In the chaotic inflation theory, which is a variant of the cosmic inflation theory, the multiverse or space as a whole is stretching and will continue doing so forever, but some regions of space stop stretching and form distinct bubbles (like gas pockets in a loaf of rising bread). Such bubbles are embryonic level I multiverses. Different bubbles may experience different spontaneous symmetry breaking, which results in different properties, such as different physical constants. Level II also includes John Archibald Wheeler's oscillatory universe theory and Lee Smolin's fecund universes theory. Level III: Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics Hugh Everett III's many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is one of several mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics. In brief, one aspect of quantum mechanics is that certain observations cannot be predicted absolutely. Instead, there is a range of possible observations, each with a different probability. According to the MWI, each of these possible observations corresponds to a different universe. Suppose a six-sided die is thrown and that the result of the throw corresponds to a quantum mechanics observable. All six possible ways the die can fall correspond to six different universes. Tegmark argues that a Level III multiverse does not contain more possibilities in the Hubble volume than a Level I or Level II multiverse. In effect, all the different \"worlds\" created by \"splits\" in a Level III multiverse with the same physical constants can be found in some Hubble volume in a Level I multiverse. Tegmark writes that, \"The only difference between Level I and Level III is where your doppelg\u00e4ngers reside. In Level I they live elsewhere in good old three-dimensional space. In Level III they live on another quantum branch in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.\" Similarly, all Level II bubble universes with different physical constants can, in effect, be found as \"worlds\" created by \"splits\" at the moment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a Level III multiverse. According to Yasunori Nomura, Raphael Bousso, and Leonard Susskind, this is because global spacetime appearing in the (eternally) inflating multiverse is a redundant concept. This implies that the multiverses of Levels I, II, and III are, in fact, the same thing. This hypothesis is referred to as \"Multiverse = Quantum Many Worlds\". Related to the many-worlds idea are Richard Feynman's multiple histories interpretation and H. Dieter Zeh's many-minds interpretation. Level IV: Ultimate ensemble The ultimate mathematical universe hypothesis is Tegmark's own hypothesis. This level considers all universes to be equally real which can be described by different mathematical structures.  Brian Randolph Greene is an American theoretical physicist, mathematician, and string theorist. He has been a professor at Columbia University since 1996 and chairman of the World Science Festival since co-founding it in 2008. Brian Greene discussed nine types of multiverses: Quilted The quilted multiverse works only in an infinite universe. With an infinite amount of space, every possible event will occur an infinite number of times. However, the speed of light prevents us from being aware of these other identical areas. Inflationary The inflationary multiverse is composed of various pockets in which inflation fields collapse and form new universes. Brane The brane multiverse version postulates that our entire universe exists on a membrane (brane) which floats in a higher dimension or \"bulk\". In this bulk, there are other membranes with their own universes. These universes can interact with one another, and when they collide, the violence and energy produced is more than enough to give rise to a big bang. The branes float or drift near each other in the bulk, and every few trillion years, attracted by gravity or some other force we do not understand, collide and bang into each other. This repeated contact gives rise to multiple or \"cyclic\" big bangs. This particular hypothesis falls under the string theory umbrella as it requires extra spatial dimensions. Cyclic The cyclic multiverse (via the ekpyrotic scenario) has multiple branes (each a universe) that have collided, causing Big Bangs. The universes bounce back and pass through time until they are pulled back together and again collide, destroying the old contents and creating them anew. Landscape The landscape multiverse relies on string theory's Calabi\u2013Yau spaces. Quantum fluctuations drop the shapes to a lower energy level, creating a pocket with a set of laws different from that of the surrounding space. Quantum The quantum multiverse creates a new universe when a diversion in events occurs, as in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Holographic The holographic multiverse is derived from the theory that the surface area of a space can simulate the volume of the region. Simulated The simulated multiverse exists on complex computer systems that simulate entire universes. Ultimate The ultimate multiverse contains every mathematically possible universe under different laws of physics.  Reality may be made up of multiple universes, but each one may not be so different to our own, according to Stephen Hawking\u2019s final theory of the cosmos.

Physics doesn\u2019t supply any proof of that hypothesis or exclude their possibility. The multiverse is conjectured as a solution to certain features of the universe but it is not the only possible solution, nor is it an overwhelming candidate. Belief is what you accord to something that you feel compelled to accept regardless of the lack of immediate proof. Where there are strong proofs, you can accept a paradigm without according it belief status. I accept the laws of motion, for example. They don\u2019t require my belief. Where the argument is statistical or implied by logic, one enters into the realm of belief. People with religious beliefs are convinced by the logic of a creation requiring a creator. I don\u2019t find that logic compelling (or even that the universe warrants the \u2018creation\u2019 label), hence our beliefs (mine and the theists\u2019) differ. I do believe that life is most likely a feature of the cosmos and not just isolated to Earth because of the speed with which life emerged here (as soon as it could); the ordinariness of planets like ours (we find new exoplanets every day circling distant stars in similar orbits); and the vastness of the cosmos (there are 250 billion \u00b1 150 billion stars in our galaxy alone, a significant percentage with solar systems, and trillions of galaxies in the observable universe; that\u2019s roughly 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars that might, like ours, support living planets). Logic and statistics converge and prompt me to believe something that lacks unequivocal proof. Back to parallel universes then. The logic that makes them a necessary feature of cosmology is not compelling\u2014it\u2019s just convenient, an alternative to other explanations that are no more or less compelling/convenient. When a persuasive argument for parallel universes arises, I\u2019ll take up that belief. ",

I would say that parallel universes; multiple universes exist because there are different states and types of matter, energy (including stored energy, produced energy, transmitted energy as waves), virbrations of atoms; molecules, life, intelligence, and so forth. Sometime in the future, maybe in 100 to 150 years from now, I believe there shall emerge absolute proof scientifically in the reality of parallel universes; multiple universes. There is a theory, many decades old, that there is as well there being an energy and matter universe, that somewhere there exists an anti-matter and anti-energy universe where the molecules spin or orbit in the opposite direction compared to the molecules of conventional; standard energy and matter. Such two different universes are somehow separated from each other because energy and anti-energy have a tendency to clash; to neutralize each other if in contact. The same action occurs if matter and anti-matter would come into contact with each other. I do not believe there would be a total annihilation of their coming together, because according to the laws of physics that state matter, which is stored energy ; highly compacted energy, gets converted to energy and energy will continue to exist but it changes its form under certain conditions. As the many, many years ago by, scientists will learn more and more about energy, matter, antienergy, and antimatter. Perhaps science will discover that somehow energy, matter, antienergy, and antimatter somehow function together to produce some parallel universes; multiple universes, just as Astrophysists have discovered that black holes in our galaxy are responsible, at least to a large extent, for the creation of our sun and the planets and for the creation of life on earth.

Some universes are very similar to ours (you can think of them as our siblings or cousins) while other universes are radically different. The imagination is infinite, and thus, so too is Creation. Every imagining exists in some tangible form somewhere within the multiverse. Consciousness contains the ideas, the thoughts, and the building blocks behind every reality. Sentience, on the other hand, is the creative force that animates reality and experiences all possible emotions and sensations within them. Consciousness creates reality, sentience experiences reality. Together, consciousness and sentience create the totality of Creation. There are many different universes and themes. Just like one hundred pennies make a dollar, certain collections of universes make something that is a collection of energies. Eventually, we will begin to fathom and recognize that there are whole systems of existence that have nothing to do with existence as we are working with it. Our universe is designed as a free-will zone, within which everything is interlocking and inter-working with everything else. One common element within the multiverse is the polarities of pleasure and pain. Ultimately, no matter what reality we find ourselves in, our experience will either be a pleasurable one or a painful one. There is also the neutral state in the middle which can be the combination or lack of both. It may surprise you to know that pain does not exist in some universes. These positive universes only support beautiful experiences. The residents of such realities spend most of their time shifting from one flavor or degree of pleasure to another. Some regions of our universe operate in a similar way. There are some rather negative universes in which pain is the most prominent sensation. These hellish universes are typically ruled by a minority of sadistic souls who use the majority of souls as food or slaves. Some depictions and illustrations of heaven and hell are actually visions of other universes that have seeped into human consciousness and translated into our art and literature. ",

In the Quantum Two Slit experiment it is shown that particles travel as probability waves in which they exist as all probabilities until circumstance forces them to act as a particle. In many cases this is determined by the presence of a conscious observer. Similarly, all physical probabilities exist. Our consciousness causes the future probability wave to collapse as in each moment we determine which probability to actualize and be experienced as a physical reality moment-point. All of the other probabilities that we do not experience are just as real. They just exist sideways in time in a parallel timeline or \u201cparallel Universe\u201d. Also look into simultaneous time.

            "answer_text": "A parallel universe is basically an alternate universe or alternate reality co-existing with this universe .This concept has been used in many books,comics,etc.Nothing has been proved yet.There are some people however who have experienced strange incidents which could be relatable to parallel universe concept.Like the incident in case of \u201cThe man from Taured.\u201dIn Tokyo 1954 a man came to the airport saying that he is from a country named Taured.Officials thought him as fraud and moved him to a side,and started questioning him who he was and was he related to any criminal organisation.The man was astonished.He said he had visited before here ,for business purposes.The officials normally said there was no country named Taured.The man said that Taured had existed for 1000 years.He showed them that Taured was located in a point which was the Principality of Andorra along with parts of Spain and France.Surprisingly when the man\u2019s luggage was checked they found currencies of various countries,passports,company papers which was not existing,but the passports and currencies were not fake.The man was not Japanese,he was European,but could speak Japanese very well.The man demanded to speak to the officials to clear up the matter .As he could not be detained,he was kept in a hotel room with two immigration officers outside guarding the door.The officials were were puzzled as what was going on.The next day when they went to check for him,he was vanished.No one saw him escape. The man was never found again nor anyone ever heard from him. Maybe the world from which he came from,there was a country named Taured,and he came to Tokyo for business purposes before. There are many incidents said like this but none of them need not necessarily be true.For proof observation has to be there.A theory is not valid unless it is experimentally correct.There are many scientists however who believes in this theory.Some say that the decesions that we take break realities in many parts.Suppose one day we get up in a morning and feel confused whether to go to work or stay at home and enjoy time with family and friends.Suppose we decide to go to work.At that moment another reality is created where we have not decided to go to work. Another strange thing that happens with many people including me,that suppose an incident is taking place.Suddenly we realise that this incident has already been experienced before.Suppose a lecture is going on in class.Suddenly we realise that this same,lecture,same way of teaching as if this same incident has happened before.Some scientists say that this is an example of alternate reality.In an alternate world that same lecture had already taken place,and we were present at that reality at that time and it gets stored in the memory.When that incident happens again in real world we seem to remember them happening before. Hope this helps. ",

As it's existence is assumed parallel to the one we live in, it would be just like an extra dimension, something that's beyond perception. Like you can't imagine a 3D object if you only have two dimensions. It could be right in front of our eyes and we may never know. Physicists still don't have a clear idea as to what makes the wave functions collapse, and the idea of parallel worlds was put forth as an explanation. The idea is indeed very charming, but if you ask me, it's got more philosophy in it than physics at this point. ",

            "answer_text": "The notion of another world, just like this one, with a reality different from ours does not exist only in fiction \u2013 science is also familiar with and is looking into the concept of multiple universes. It is possible that within what we call time and space, other dimensions with alternative realities exist. Sometimes those realities vary slightly and sometimes they differ radically. Infinite universe \u2013 infinite possibilities The first idea of parallel universes says that since space is so huge the rules of probability entail that other planets just like Earth exist. As a matter of fact, if the universe is infinite it must have infinitely many planets. Some of them, in all probability, would have almost the same events to those on Earth occurring within or on them. The reason we can\u2019t see these other universes is because our cosmic vision is defined and limited by the ultimate speed of light. Since light started traveling when Big Bang occurred (cca 14 billion years ago) we can\u2019t see past 14 billion light-years. This volume of space known as the Hubble volume represents the universe we can observe.  Bubble expansion The second idea suggests that regions of space are in a continuous inflation phase. Due to the ongoing inflationary phase in these universes, the area between us and the other universes is expanding faster than the speed of light which also makes them completely unreachable. The quantum fluctuations in the initial universe\u2019s vacuum energy produced bubble universes everywhere, expanding at different rates. When inflation starts, it generates not just one, but an infinite number of universes. Possibilities built-in the quantum wavefunction The third idea comes from the many worlds interpretation (MWI) from quantum physics in which every quantum possibility built-in in the quantum wavefunction evolves into a real possibility in some alternate reality. When thinking of a \u201cparallel universe\u201d, the average person is probably thinking of this type of universe. The main difference from other types of universes mentioned previously is that these take place at the same time and within the same place as our own, but there is still no way of accessing them. These types of universes are determined by moments in our lives and decisions we make that cause a split of your \u201cnow\u201d self into a limitless number of future selves, all of which are oblivious to the fact that the other one exists. Mathematically possible is probable The fourth (and most debated) idea follows essentially different mathematical laws of nature than our universe. In a nutshell, any universe that physicists can make work on paper must exist if we follow the mathematical democracy principle which states that each universe that is mathematically possible has the same possibility of truly existing.

And it has always existed, again because how can one logically think otherwise.  Because when within, you can't tell as much as when without, we can't know, ever, the limit of the universe, farther than we can perceive. But looking down the rabbit hole, some smart guy named Plankk or something says, there need not necessarily be something smaller.  Mathematically. Now if one considers that all things seem to be in motion. We need consider, the shape and prevalence of the smallest thing.  To date we have used the sun-planet miniaturized approach, and included vast quantities of nothing, and it has worked out quite \"believably\". And so we have extrapolated considerably.  Using exact mathematics, it seems that all the universe must at one time have been held in a point.  HOW SO, logically, rational, when it is also infinite. Everything we perceive is in motion. Everything we perceive seems ultimately balanced, and counter balanced. We even became convinced this is true of matter, energy, and TIME. So our calculations included time dilating.  We thought it obsurd until seen with our own eyes. But we know more.  We know that we expand and contract on a daily basis (neutrino flow angle rolls over, night to day.     You see everything we think that IS, is not.  The universe is full.  All is in motion.  Constantly.  The root motion and incredibly quick dance of interfering helixes and counter helixes.   With a balance and counter balance pattern with the following as it's \"dimensional POLES\".   These are \"virtual\" and can act magically.  So we believe in \"forces\" when in fact it is clockworklike gears.  One of the dimensions is scale.  We know where it starts, we'll never know where it ends.  We live between layers of balance and not.  We are \"outside\" the earth.  Independent.  Yet free and mobile.  Yet always trmendously in motion through the universe, yet unaware. We FLOW.  Like waves, through and controlling the \"quanta ball world\" with our thoughts. We don't know what we are.  Actually.  Yet.  :-)  Soon.   Theory of everything.  Mechanical.  Logical.  Help see it.

I think a parallel universe can not exist because it will have to be a clone of itself but a multi-universe can certainly exist Even if there is a parallel universe, the subject of the resolution will cause them not to be equal only as an analogy to the identical twins, which are each twin is another one And not the same one The level of distinction between each universe depends on the resolution of the parallel universe but will always be differentiated and they are not parallel universes There are no straight lines in the universe Space curve time Moreover, I do not think there is such a thing as a closed line I think a closed circle can not exist In my opinion a closed reality of a point can not exist This is a super symmetry . A circle exists as a closed thing only from a very particular point of view and not absolute symmetry Therefore, a point dimension that is the beginning and end of the line is somewhat problematic So I do not see anything parallel reconstruction can exist I also doubt if there is a multi-universe but multi-universe is certainly possible Quantum interweaving eliminates the need for a point dimension that is the beginning and end of itself Parallel lines are more similar to quantum interwoven and I think parallel lines assume that there is a concept of parallelism and a point dimension The correct concept is lines in quantum entanglement rather than parallel lines In short, multi-universes are actually universes in quantum entanglement No-cloning theorem - Wikipedia Transversal (geometry) - Wikipedia Image resolution - Wikipedia Quantum entanglement - Wikipedia ",

There is also a spiritual universe in a differnt realm where everything was before the Big Bang or the beginning of solid matter. The spiritual universe contained, Truth, Love, and the positive way which are all a part of God. These things have always existed and they are Etetnal things. The universe of antimatter was created when solid natter was. In my undestanding quasars produced the chemical elements and the quasars were formed from black holes which were formed from elementary particles that were formed from an infinite structure that was designed by God to produce everything that we see. The DNA and RNA of every species was PROGRAMED by God into the structure and a recipe for the sea water that brought it forth. This is why everything we see all works together as a super program because it us a design of God. http://www.infinitestructure.com/ Anything that rotates, rotates in two opposite directions at the same time. Imigine the front wheel on your bicycle as you are moving forward. If you look down at the right hand side of the front wheel, it will be rotating clockwise. If you look at the left hand side, it will be rotating counterclockwise, just the opposite or a mirror image of the right hand side. This wouls also apply to quasars. One side is a mirror image of the other side and antimatter us a mirror image of matter. So the jets on one side would spew out natter while the jets in the other side will spew out antimatter. These jets spew out gas or particles in opposite directions at almost the speed of light. That would be a good reason why they can\u2019t find the antimatter that is supposed to be there, \u2026 it was long gone when it was created in the opposite direction as matter, and still moving on at close to the speed of light.

It is one of the possibility from an observation but the data cannot be definitely interpreted that way (sad face). That was our dear media at work to get our attention. It was overblown. The actual research was very different. Scientists actually found evidence (signals) of fundamental particles that may defy our current understanding of physics. It might even just be an issue with how particles interact with ice. It was ANITA (ANtarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna), a balloon based experiment. \u201cA research paper published in response that posits that ANITA results could provide evidence for a \u201cCPT symmetric universe,\u201d where time would run backwards from the Big Bang and where antimatter would dominate. This is where the \u201cparallel universe\u201d claims come from since the paper reads: \u201cIn this scenario the universe before the Big Bang and the universe after the Big Bang is reinterpreted as a universe/anti-universe pair that is created from nothing.\u201d That was actually kinda awesome. And the research is awesome-er. It's not parallel universes but it is cool. The Standard Model concerning neutrinos doesn\u2019t explain the detection of a rare kind of event by ANITA.

But if someone can believe in all mighty deity why cannot I believe in a universes where every possibility has happend. I just love the idea that there can be a whole Universe that is just like ours, so perfect you could live there and you would never knew the difference. Ofcourse if it is real there can be amazing ones where, I dont know, people evolved to walk on hands because some of our predecesors decided so. But what about a universe so not different that it is just like a mirror. Do you know what is a difference? Me. Yeah thats right. Just me writing this answer. Each choice I make is supposed to create a new universe, look how many words I have choosen and how many more I could have. Each of my words represents ond universe with perfectly mirrored history, just different word in this answer. If that isnt fascinating enough to make me believe there are such a universes, I dont know what fascinating is. ",

At which point we discover a means to identify, study or possibly communicate with another universe it is now part of \"The Universe\".  There is much to say about if we can discover something much deeper or distant than anything we have yet imagined. Remember that the idea of other galaxies was only discovered by Hubble less than a century ago. The Universe has become much bigger since then. It wouldn't surprise if someday we theorize even more.  However, there is the problem that, given modern physics, outside our universe there is no time or space. If there can be no medium in which another universe could grow like ours, not even time, then I doubt seriously that we would be able to break through that spaceless, timeless timeless barrier to the other dimension. If you think about it, the moment we could communicate with them we would also be able to communicate with every inch of that universe, at every time in that universe as well as our own. I think I would have much more left to look at down here. ",

            "answer_text": "There are at least five theories why a multiverse is possible 1. Infinite universes. We don't know what the shape of space-time is exactly. One prominent theory is that it is flat and goes on forever. This would present the possibility of many universes being out there. But with that topic in mind, it's possible that universes can start repeating themselves. That's because particles can only be put together in so many ways. More about that in a moment. 2. Bubble universes. Another theory for multiple universes comes from \"eternal inflation.\" Based on research from Tufts University cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin, when looking at space-time as a whole, some areas of space stop inflating like the Big Bang inflated our own universe. Others, however, will keep getting larger. So if we picture our own universe as a bubble, it is sitting in a network of bubble universes of space. What's interesting about this theory is the other universes could have very different laws of physics than our own, since they are not linked. 3. Daughter universes. Or perhaps multiple universes can follow the theory of quantum mechanics (how subatomic particles behave), as part of the \"daughter universe\" theory. If you follow the laws of probability, it suggests that for every outcome that could come from one of your decisions, there would be a range of universes \u2014 each of which saw one outcome come to be. So in one universe, you took that job to China. In another, perhaps you were on your way and your plane landed somewhere different, and you decided to stay. And so on. 4. Mathematical universes. Another possible avenue is exploring mathematical universes, which, simply put, explain that the structure of mathematics may change depending in which universe you reside. \"A mathematical structure is something that you can describe in a way that's completely independent of human baggage,\" said theory-proposer Max Tegmark of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as quoted in the 2012 article. \"I really believe that there is this universe out there that can exist independently of me that would continue to exist even if there were no humans.\" 5. Parallel universes. And last but not least as the idea of parallel universes. Going back to the idea that space-time is flat, the number of possible particle configurations in multiple universes would be limited to 10^10^122 distinct possibilities, to be exact. So, with an infinite number of cosmic patches, the particle arrangements within them must repeat \u2014 infinitely many times over. This means there are infinitely many \"parallel universes\": cosmic patches exactly the same as ours (containing someone exactly like you), as well as patches that differ by just one particle's position, patches that differ by two particles' positions, and so on down to patches that are totally different from ours.

There is no way to prove or disprove it, so the theory is philosophy not physics. And besides, physicists are far too glib with infinity. Any theory that depends on an infinite number of physical things, whether atoms or universes, is probably nonsense. ",

            "answer_text": "Your definition of parallel realities is inaccurate. Every moment of every day and the billions of moments in between each moment is a different alternate reality. You do not notice your shifting from one reality to the next, because the changes you make in your life are so minute and your understanding of reality was heretofore inaccurate. The philosophy behind it is similar to the individual frames of a movie and you can find more information on YouTube. Search: \u201cParallel Realities\u201d Bentinho Massaro Below, I have outlined the key to conscious parallel reality shifting and here is a brief understanding of exactly what to do. Sit still in meditation with emotional poise.Use concentration skills to imagine the realty or change you wish to embody, with the understanding that it already exists just as real as this one right here. Research parallel realities in advance to develop this understanding.Become as excited as you possibly can by imagining the experience as detailed as possible. (Go gather the necessary details in advance if needed to make it more real for you) Include everything you already enjoy or love, alongside the new references.When your interest reaches its peak, imagine yourself as if you are there, walking around, living life as you would be living, feeling those experiences from the inside out. Roleplay physcially or with inner physical sensations. Dance. Continue until you are calm, attentive, and appreciative.When you are done, slowly open your eyes and take a slow walk. Consider your resolve for the next step in the process.Follow your interest, excitement, joy or peace. Allow yourself to do whatever you wish in any experience you wish with no objections to the moment. If a \u201cbad\u201d experience occurs, calm yourself and assume that it supports you in your vison. If a \u201cgood\u201d experience occurs, calm yourself and assume that it supports you in your vison. This is how you effectively utilize the primal choice, displayed in the diagram below.Ignore what your senses tell you. Assume and trust your inner vison no matter what happens around you. Assume that everything that happens happens in support of your vison even if it seems to directly contradicts it on the surface. Learn from it or ignore it, but keep to the vison. Do not let anything distract you from feeling the excitement and knowingness of your vison existing right now.Be willing to consider yourself crazy and delusional, but madly in love with your vision. Get excited daily with role playing. If you have an experience that surface-contradicts, vividly imagine right before it, getting totally excited. Yet, while having the experience, give it none of your emotion or interest. Afterwards, remember the vison of excitement and forget the \u201csurface\u201d.Continue diligently until syncronicities align and invoke a total reality shift into your new vision, externally. This is the infinity key described visually below.Do not attempt to make large shifts in your reality unless you are willing to go insane or very delusional, at first. Start off small, or start off by using the diagram to analyze the events already occurring in your life. Anytime you make a new decision and change who you are, you are entering into a new parallel reality. Strive to understand this, and you will be living on the cutting edge of the Age of Enlightenment.

Most physicists these days are commonly jumping on the idea of there being an infinite multi-verse. Where there is an infinite number of universes all living on their own membranes. Each universe will have slightly or vastly different rules, and variables ruling how various forces interact with each other etc.. It\u2019s a pretty complicated theory, but in order to answer your question, we just need to focus on the word \u201cinfinite\u201d. If there is an infinite multi-verse, that means that ANYTHING that can happen will. That\u2019s how infinity works. So if there is an infinite multi-verse, then yes, there probably is another universe somewhere where some life-form that looks and acts very similar or just like you and is living a close to exact type of life as you are. Look at the infinite monkey theory in order to better explain the concept of infinity. Infinite monkey theorem - Wikipedia hope this helps. ",

This automatically means that there must be parallel universes, where different outcomes of different events are taking place. For example, a cat touches a live wire in our universe, and dies, then there will be another universe where it will be severely injured, another where it is totally safe, and infinite others where cat doesn't even exist. Though how do these parallel universes exist is still speculative. There might be an infinite matrix of universes, or they may exist in outer space simultaneously. For understanding how they may exist in a matrix, we can assume that atom, or a subatomic particles consists of a universe. Technically, we too would be in such a subatomic universe, and the chain would continue infinitely in both directions. For understanding parallel universes, humans would have to either understand things at the micro level, or at the macro level to a great extent. ",

Now what would have happened if the person opted out for medical. He would have ended up being a doctor, physiotherapist depending on the specialisation he selected. So for every choice he didn't opted for will have a alternate reality or parallel universe. If person somehow time travels and go back in time and make a any different selection the whole reality will be changed for him, He thus will be in some other alternate reality.

Parallel universe is a conceptual reality, a reality that is theoretically in conformity with our current picture of the universe, without contradicting any known law. It is mathematically consistent with the current theoretical world picture of physics. In fact there could be several parallel universes. But there has not been any empirical confirmation of parallel universes. In some ways, this is impossible even in principle. By definition, if we can observe such a thing it would be part of our universe. That is why they are called parallel: They will never intersect. In a sense it may be compared to the God concept of religions, which is in accordance with the worldviews of religions but which seems to be beyond the reach of our observational faculties. So, in principle, it is impossible to answer this question one way or another. It is somewhat like the question (but not the same as): \u201cDo civilizations exist in some remote galaxy? you can answer Yes, and you can answer No, without ever knowing if you are right or wrong. Rarely have physics and metaphysics been so interlinked as in the matter of parallel universes.

The less physical the existence the closer the instance of living is to knowing itself as an aspect of source consciousness. The more physical it\u2019s expression the less it tends to remember that of which it is a fractal part of. ",

What if it was true? It means that what you do does matter for your timeline, but somewhere else, you didn\u2019t. It could lead to greater fatalism among humanity if proven. Larry Niven actually wrote a great story on that concept, where a timeline that learned how to travel to alternate worldlines sees a massive spike in murders and suicides as a result of the discovery. The knowledge that there were other timelines where you were happier, had the life you wanted, bad things didn\u2019t happen as they did for you, lead to people killing themselves and each other.

The universe functions as a computer algorithm. In antiquity people could not reincarnate or exist as spirit because Earth did not have a parallel universe.Those who wanted life after death had to find a planet that had already created a parallel reality.Some advanced civilizations used huge machines for this like pyramids, to project into other solar systems who had parallel realities .In the year zero some entities visited us and created a new parallel reality for us and since then we have a parallel univers. A question I addressed to Stephen Hawking a few months before he died was \u201cWhat was before the Bing Bang and what was ahead the event before the Bing Bang?\u201d It's written in our DNA that we do not know this until we will discover the parallel universes. But Earth is not the only one planet from our solar system who has a parallel universe Mars also have one. the empty space between palnets can not have parallel universes, they represent singularities. Just like traveling with the speed of light: for a subject that remains motionless and observes we are only light, we exist in the form of light, a bright line or a bright spot, but yet for us we exist in flesh and bones. So we can have many forms of existence. ",

In this case, there are different universes, each with different values of fundamental constants and so on.

As per Hindu vedas and other texts existence of parallel universe is true. Way of communicating is the part which i am very much interested. Will post more on this article once I get some proper documents and facts. The above answer posted 2 days ago. Sorry the answer I posted above, I have to contradict it. Parallel Universe may be a wrong word to say. Only one UNIVERSE exists. Different Galaxies like milky way etc\u2026and in those galaxies a living planet like EARTH exists. As per my knowledge 64 dimensions exists, of which we see 3 dimensions and 4th dimension which is in progress scientifically. So as per my knowledge gained thru some of the links i surfed last 2\u20133 days i feel Parallel Earth in a diffferent galaxy may exist not a parallel universe.

And by having a (+/-) Binary Universe System there is balance in the Cosmos. That is, the Cosmos of Nothingness which gives birth to countless other (+/-) Binary Universes as explained below: Nothingness - this is the most difficult concept to understand and especially impossible to visualize because it has never been identified. And there are no tangible comparisons in our universe. But yet it can be identified both mathematically and logically in a 3 part syllogism: If Nothingness = 0,And 0 = +1 and -1Then a (+1) universe and a (-) anti-universe can come from (0) or Nothingness. Or more specifically, the beginning of our universe came into existence at the same time as the beginning of the anti-universe.So, to answer your question, yes, there is a parallel universe right next to you and putting out Dark Energy in 2 forms: One is expanding the universe (Cosmological Constant).And the other resembles regular gravity which is causing the spiral arms of galaxies to rotate faster than they should.Below is a schematic diagram of our universe and its anti-universe partner in its present state.

Another problem is the cause of coincidences or fine tuning. In our universe the fine tuning or complexity is so refined that we normally assume some kind of design, evolution and/or selection is involved. The nature of fine tuning in our universe leads itself to some element of design or evolution. E.g. If many random universes we would have to assume that more universes seem designed than ones that don\u2019t. But we have competing ideas of Entropy and Evolution. If we assume no laws of physics we would assume more messy or non-viable worlds and those worlds that are viable are more likely to seem badly designed. Evolution (or other progressive forces) exist in our universe. Given a progressive force we would assume over time one or more super entities somewhat similar to gods should eventually evolve. Such development would likely take much longer than the billion of years since our big bang. We can safely assume some complexity or design was in place setting up our big bang. Such complexity can happen through multiple bang theories. It can partly be assumed in multiple world models but more likely a mix of multiple universes and some kind of Evolution is more likely. Lee Smolin\u2019s Baby Universes idea is one such model that fits this description. ",

If you have a choice between eating a pizza or a burger today, then what ever you choose is the reality you are in, and the other choice spawns a new parallel universe where you had a different dinner. And this happens for everything including for example whether a quantum particle has an up spin or a down spin. All possible variations the universe could have resulted in up to today are parallel universes. At least that's the theory. If they exist or not is something we do not know. And we might never know, after all if all possible universes exist, there must be some, where the existence of parallel universes is never proven. ",

Alternative or parallel universes of similar age to ours are among the wilder proposals of string theory, in particular -brane theory where the collision between membranes in some unimaginable space-like existence are the cause of the big bang. These ideas are a long way from mainstream, and would appear to be absolutely untestable, and making no worthwhile predictions. We can barely see or understand our own universe. If there are others they are, by definition, closed to us, so not worth worrying about. Dull stuff, really. ",

We live in a finely tuned universe; the physical constants which form the foundation of the mathematics which govern our reality are set at very precise values. If these values were to change even slightly, stars wouldn't have formed, so neither would planets or life. The probability of there being a single universe with constants of absolutely perfect values to produce life are infinitesimal. Realistically there's 4 possibilities. Either\u2026 There is one universe and the physical constants by extremely small chances happen to be perfect to produce life (the chances of this probability are extremely small).There are many or infinite universes with a variety of physical constants and we obviously are born into one with the correct constant values (this seems to me more likely and makes more sense).There is a God or intelligent designed that set the constants at their perfect values.There is a single universe that explodes into existence, then eventually dies, only to be re-born again with different constants and laws. This cycle has been happening over and over until a universe with the correct constants and laws to produce life spawned into existence.To me the multiverse option makes the most sense. There seem to be some current theories in modern physics suggesting this too.  ",

As to whether there's any way to communicate or even detect parallel universes, if they exist, it's unlikely.  Remember, within a black hole, and presumably before the big bang occurred, time was frozen; there was no such thing as our version of time until the big bang occurred.  Every other universe also has its own version of spacetime, presumably completely divorced from ours.  Theoretically two universes could intersect, I suppose, but who knows?  So there's no practical reason to think about parallel universes, but it's kind of fun. ",

It's just like putting a deer in a cage. The beauty of the deer seems to fade out when we look it living inside the cage. But the when the deer is released in a natural habitat, the beauty rise up. The natural habitat here is analogous to higher dimension and the cage for the lower dimension. The deer represents the reality. ",

Although this appears like fiction, it has been postulated on the basis of various experiments. The concept is also found in ancient Hindu mythology, in texts such as the Puranas, which expressed an infinite number of universes, each with its own gods. Similarly in Persian literature, \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", a tale in the One Thousand and One Nights, describes the protagonist Bulukiya learning of alternative worlds/universes that are similar to but still distinct from his own.

Parallel universes circuvent this by each having different physical constants and hence not making our universe \u201cspecial\u201d any more. Indeed, that there may be an infinity of universes each with different physical constants. My personal belief is that this question is answered by the Weak Anthropic Principle and does not require the existence of parallel universes (which are intuitively not right anyway).

Some , that there were infinite parallel universes from the beginning , and in each of them there's an exact version of us from the beginning , living their own life , wondering maybe this question right now . And there is this multiverse theory , which says that at each point of life , the universe diverges according to the numerous decisions we could have taken . For example , the universe must have diverged where a version of me would have not bothered to answer this question . These are the two theories . But theories must be backed by rigid mathematics and Stephen hawking is currently developing the maths for multiverse theory . Keeping this in mind , according to the present state of our technology , we can not confirm nor deny about the validity of both these theories experimentally . Only if maths is developed and gives us favourable results , can we use it as valid theory . ",

I probably don\u2019t have any clue of the interpretation to it but I often get to see strange people in my dreams in which I honestly do not know. Most likely most of my dreams contain people whom i have no idea of who they are. Somehow I think that our minds are internally intertwined to different dimension or such where our dual-lives (or triple, quadruple, quintuple and more) are living distinctively from what we see in each of our everyday life. But that\u2019s only my belief. No scientific study was performed and no statement of hypothesis. ",

            "answer_text": "We don't have evidence of existence of parallel universes yet but there is high chance that parallel universes exist. The universe was created with a Big Bang and expanded faster than speed of light called Inflation. It is believed that this expansion stopped within a fraction of second, but according to the idea Inflationary multiverse, it continued. It continued but just not in our universe where we could see it. We can see into space at a distance of almost 13.7 billion light-years. Beyond that we don't know till now. This gives base to multiverse concept. Thus this Eternal Inflation would have caused infinite number of universes. Thus it is believed that though we can't see them or they are out of our reach but they are and always had been there. Infact the possibility allow us to think that very few of them will have conditions similar to our universe. So give rise to idea of existence of our versions who exactly look like us and think like us. ",

Therefore, there can't be a parallel universe. With in this universe we have natural entities with their own rules governing their behavior. Therefore there is nothing like a logically continuous universe. This logically discontinuous universe creates an illusion of parallel universe. Universe consists of discrete entities rationally connected but transcendentally integrated. As an example of transcendental integration, no law of physics can explain fixed stars such as pole star keeping a fixed position relative to earth.    ",

Now consider taking road B, and the things will happen in other ways than the road A and thus you created a different universe for yourself, lets name it \u201cD\u201d. So you see there is endless possibilities on how you can consider your possible actions and possible universes it creates. There is more theories on this, but I like this one a lot. ",

So accordingly, same will be there for them and more and more. By Concluding this we can travel in future in infinite time and we can travel in past too. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed and time is energy. each seconds is creating energy and it can not even destroyed. so maybe our parallel universe theory is based on this term itself.
