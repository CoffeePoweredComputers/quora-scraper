            "answer_text": "What's a thing you want to erase from your brain?  Erasing memories from the brain (I bet) is something everyone wishes they could do at one time or another in their life. This could be for anything\u2026. based on their own specific circumstances, and how they deal or cope with these circumstances. If you're setting a very honest direct route for yourself, You won't come around things usually that you'd want to forget about. Usually you want to forget about hurt. But this is the very thing that is going to turn you into the human being You deserve to be. It's in, failure, It's in unhappiness, It's in mistakes. \u2026 that hurt, That makes you who you are because now you are hopefully telling people what you want and what you don't want. What you expect from them and what you don't expect from them. About having clear communication. Non-violent communication. Sometimes, it only takes one person to convey a want or need correctly - to make everything That comes after it that much clearer. I think when communication is on the money. I think that stops people from wanting to forget about anything in their life. Because if you forget about something that happened to you you're not the person you're supposed to be. I believe that we need everything, ( Including the pain ) to makes us who we are. Most people really want to deny, or forget about, as well as pretend it's not happening. Yes, Denial.. The ugly word that make people question themselves. Maybe before they went to. Maybe just at the right time. Not trying to understand why you're in pain is denial. In some form or fashion. It is one of the worst things you can do. It'll make you not know what's wrong with you in the long run. You will mistake it for other things. Ohio every denial and deterrent method you do to yourself while you allow yourself to pretend everything's okay. Stand up for what you want. Articulated the best way you know how, because you care. When you really care about something you take full responsibility.. \u2026weather, it's your fault or not. \u2026 Once this is done, you have taken you own stake in your life. You must have a reason to move on. Whether it be just because you want to live longer. Or you're ready to have real relationships that come from insightful words that you understand and that you are conveying. Because, it's something you love.. you don't want to hide from it. Once you're able to take an honest look at yourself. Once you're able to have a reason to want to live your life and not want to be held down by any imaginary obstacle that you imagine that seems like the only reason you're not going where you want to go and do what you want to do. Once you're ready to say to yourself it was your fault .. and you have to make it better. When you care you try.. When you try.. it shows everybody that you care.. At least anybody worth showing that you care. There's some people you don't want to know how good and generous you can be. But with not being in denial, about anything you then start to live in reality. It's things that happened the past things that we want to forget about that keep us doing the right things for ourselves. And if you're trying to hide pain then you're really hiding what caused that pain too. Or you're not dealing with it. Once you do you won't want to forget anything. ",

            "answer_text": "I was in 7th grade when this happened. I have been a very naive kid. I accept it. I have not been on my best behaviour pretty much all my childhood and my parents have had to face quite a few embarrassing situations because I am their daughter. My parents are very honest. They will never take my side when they know their kid is wrong. If needed, they will hand me over to the concerned person and let them punish me. I am so sorry Ma, Pa, for all that I have put you through. I am trying to do better. So there was this guy named Shantanu. He was the typical filthy rich spoiled brat. His father was one of the highly respected members of our school community. We had a fight and he put me in a really compromising situation in front of the whole class. I was embarrassed and angry. I was so angry that if given a knife, I would have murdered him and spent the rest of my life in jail happily. Anyway, so this stupid girl decided to take revenge on him. ( Stupid girl is me) I stole his money. I know right! Shucks what was I thinking? I stole money from his bag in lunch break approximately 3\u20134K.  What was I going to do with this money ? I didn\u2019t know. After lunch break was over everyone came in and settled down. 5th period got over and Shantanu left the classroom in hurry. Later it turned out that he went to our class teacher to report the theft. Class monitors were assigned to check every students bag and desks. Uniforms were also checked. I was caught. I had the money in my skirt and I didn\u2019t know what to do or say. I didn\u2019t even realise that I had put myself in even more compromising situation than he did. My class teacher took me to the principal and on our way to her office she said, \u201c Ankita, I always wanted my daughter to be like you. You are so beautiful and quiet. But not anymore.\u201d I remember looking at her with anger and not saying a word. My parents were called and principal said to my father, \u201c I can\u2019t believe a respectable father like you has a kid like this. I feel really sorry to call you here. But I have to suspend her.\u201d I so was ashamed. I still am. ",
