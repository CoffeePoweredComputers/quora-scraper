            "answer_text": "It is true that everyone is different. It is completely untrue that this makes us all the same. Suppose Alice is different because she's a math genius, and Bob is different because he's an Olympic sprinter. How does that make them the same? It doesn't, because they are different in different ways. That's just a simple example. Pick any two people in the world and you will find another example. Still, this saying is useful in at least one way: if someone believes they're the only one who is different, and thinks everybody else is exactly as they appear to be. I used to think that way. I was terrified that people would find out I was different. In a situation like that, it can be comforting to know that everyone has something about them that is different. It still doesn't make us all the same, but many of us have the same feelings about ourselves because we are different. So, in that sense, the saying has some value as a reminder of the human condition even though it isn't literally true. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Weirdly worded but yes. So what does it actually mean? Ok so \u201ceveryone\u2019s different\u201d, pretty easy concept to understand, everyone is different. But what does it even mean to be different? Acting and thinking a different way? So what determines these things? And that is where this sameness comes in. The things that determine who we are and what makes us different is the same for everyone. That\u2019s what this quote is getting across. If we were to swap our conciousnesses from birth, the \u2018true us\u2019 in my opinion, our awareness. We would all be in the exact same positions in life. We are all different on a surface level but when you look a little closer the similarities grow closer and closer between us and everything else. ",
