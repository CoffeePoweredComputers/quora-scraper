            "answer_text": "I think what philosophers can do is take apart statements like the ones you have made and show how they are based on erroneous assumptions. Whether or not you call this intelligence is up to you but I think most people would. \u201cIf philosophers were smart, wouldn\u2019t they pursue something where they can demonstrate their intelligence?\u201d Just because you\u2019re not aware of what they do, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not demonstrating their smarts somewhere! The kind of questions philosophers are interested in are not those that lend themselves to public forums or great public interest\u2014what is the nature of knowledge? of being? what is a strong argument? There\u2019s a notion in philosophy that philosophers start asking the important questions then when science is able to develop methods for answering the questions, that particular subject area is no longer part of philosophy but becomes physics or chemistry or astronomy. Your statement also seems to assume that only obviously demonstrable things are indicators of intelligence. It seems to lead in the direction of utilitarianism\u2014only things with obvious practical use are valuable. This is an erroneous argument. We don\u2019t need spices on our food but they sure add a lot to the enjoyment of the meal; we don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d Mozart or Shakespeare or Picasso, but they produced some pretty cool art that for many enriches their understanding of humanity. Similarly, we don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d philosophy to survive as a species but it sure does a lot to enhance our understanding of the nature of this world we live in and our place in it. Perhaps these questions cannot (and possibly never can) be definitively answered, perhaps they are subject to relative value judgments but this doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be asked or that to ask them is a valueless endeavor.\u201cI am confused by philosophers because I am not sure if they are only acting like an intellectual.\u201d So they\u2019re pseudo-intellectuals? What is your definition of an intellectual? How do we define a \u201ctrue\u201d vs a \u201cnot-true\u201d intellectual\u201d? This seems like a value judgment to me that reduces to whatever pre-determined criteria you pick out. Many people in the humanities view themselves as intellectuals but I\u2019m sure their compadres in the hard sciences might beg to differ on certain fronts. So who is correct and on what basis? Who says that that particular basis is the \u201ccorrect\u201d one? On what grounds? The word intellectual itself means of or relating to the intellect. It seems to me if you use your intellect to probe some important question or develop methods for the analysis of arguments, of the structure of language or thought, or to investigate possible reasons for some phenomenon or other, then that should qualify as a legitimate test of intellect. Ergo, one is an intellectual. Does this mean every question is capable of being answered in a quantifiable way typical of the sciences? No, of course not, but neither does that mean we shouldn\u2019t ask those questions. Like I said above, we just don\u2019t currently have the capability of quantifying our ruminations in every area of inquiry.Perhaps your statement is directed at continental philosophy vs. analytical philosophy? There is a sense that certain philosophical traditions are more rigorous than others\u2014the Anglo-American analytical tradition exemplified by philosophers like Bertrand Russell (who also had mathematical training) generally falls into this camp. It seems to be based on small-scale, highly rigorous logical analyses of things like modality, quantifier scope, counterfactual statements, etc. It seems to be compositional by nature\u2014i.e., to know the truth about a phenomenon you need to break it down into pieces then analyze them to death basically. This approach contrasts with the European continental philosophical tradition which is far more metaphysical (i.e., non-quantifiable, highly subjective) in nature. This is exemplified by German Idealism, the Frankfurt school, and later French post-structuralism. This approach does seem to have a reputation for lots of imprecise, perhaps pretentious-sounding jargon that many suspect is a lot of hooey. Philosophers of this stripe tend to be hostile toward the analytical tradition and vice versa. They ask big questions that can probably never be definitively answered but make for great debates. Is this a valid approach? Yes, I think it is if you can cut through the jargon to get at the basic argument and evaluate its merits on the usual criteria of providing premises, avoiding unfalsifiable statements, relying upon appeals to authority, traditions, etc. But please don\u2019t think this continental approach is all that philosophy entails. As I\u2019ve stated, there are other, more obviously \u201cdemonstrable,\u201d to use your term, approaches.",

            "answer_text": "It's less a question of general \"intelligence\". Philosophers (by which I mean people who do it professionally or are academically trained or even autodidacts in the area) are specialists in particular kinds of thinking. Those kinds of thinking involve : - self-reflection on what their thinking involves.- logical argument (know when A really does imply B)- metaphorical reasoning (recognising how particular metaphors and analogies can capture the \"spirit\" of an idea and make it more comprehensible or easier to reason about by analogy)- pondering the basic conceptual infrastructure you'd need in order to believe certain things or reason certain ways. They look for opportunities to both improve and demonstrate their skills in these areas.  What philosophers are NOT (necessarily) are : - rhetoricians / lawyers / politicians ie. specialized in making arguments designed to PERSUADE. They may know about rhetoric in theory but not be good practicioners of it. - scientists ie. specialized in empirical knowledge of the natural world. Philosophers may know a lot about how you have to think in order to think scientifically, but not what current scientific thought is.  - theologians ie. experts in or defenders of any particular religious dogma - psychologists. It's interesting that the human brain is constrained to think in a certain way and may be susceptible to certain fallacies. But these constraints don't limit what thinking, in principle, can be. - dreamers. Philosophers work largely in a world of abstractions which may seem very detached from practical, everyday concerns. That doesn't mean anyone who is far from everyday practical concerns is a philosopher. Some philosophers combine philosophy with rhetoric, law, politics, science, theology, psychology and even dreaming, but that's just because they're able to hold down two or more \"jobs\" at the same time.

            "answer_text": "Yes we are intelligent people, I was one of the most intelligent students at the my college, I made the Dean's List six times while I attended Utah Valley University. If you if you look at almost every philosopher, you will realize that they are some of the most intelligent people that exist. Philosophers think about life, the universe, the meaning of existence, politics, social constructs, life's biggest questions, and many other things. Much of what is it known about economics, mathematics, government, engineering, architecture, religion, and why people do things the way they do is because of philosophy. Plato was a genius, he is estimated to have a high IQ of 170. He opened the world's first University, he trained many Athenians in the ways of philosophy, and his most famous student Aristotle, created the field of biology. Philosophers usually just give advice to people, make criticisms of governments and how they should be ran, and Pull-A-Part people's arguments to decide whether or not they make sense. Why do we do this? Because only philosophers can know what is and is not. Why do we know this? Because only philosophers have access to the fourms, which is an abstract concept thought of by Plato where everything exists it's perfect form in its own version of reality. This was expanded upon by Aristotle, he invented a field called metaphysics which allows people to think to an arbitrary amount about something like a chair and use abstract thought to determine what a chair is and what makes it a chair and what is the ideal chair. All science and Discovery is based on philosophy, what we know about the term of science didn't exist until the mid 1800\u2032s, it was called \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d. Without philosophers, we would still be living in the Stone Age, at best the Middle Ages. ",

I used to think my friends grade 5 piano playing was incredible until I got piano lessons; when I was young I used to think road bikers had extreme talent until I got one and now, just yesterday I cycled a century (100 miles). being a \u2018thinker\u2019 gives you morsels of happiness like anything, that\u2019s why people do it. The choice is what you manifest your live on, but after a lot of \u2018thinking\u2019 I can honestly whole heartedly repeat Einstein's quote \u2018everybody is a genius\u2019. If anyone acts like they\u2019re better than you it is because of ego or the endorphins they get from the feeling of being better than you. if you trust me after reading this post or think I\u2019m \u2018intelligent\u2019 you\u2019d be wrong - I think myself an idiot just like you, an idiot whose focused his life more on \u2018thinking\u2019 than you (if you want to do that I will say the search for clarity will only unfold into more and more uncertainty and many roads are deceiving, veganism and socialism is the template so just be them and focus your life on social aspects for happiness and clarity honestly xD) my yt channels my Quora name btw ",

            "answer_text": "Since the question of whether philosophers are \"actually intelligent\" is really a philosophical question, we can ask whether this question is also an intelligent question and find clues as to the common answer. Is the point of the question to really demonstrate intelligence, or to find out a scientifically testable way of measuring the intelligence of philosophers, or is it more about contemplating the larger issues of intelligence, philosophy, and perhaps what we mean by \"actually\". To say 'actually' in this context seems to reference an expectation which we are assumed to share that philosophers are considered intelligent or highly intelligent, but that this assumption may be something of a myth. It is asking whether philosophers may be more like con men than great teachers. Even that question supposes that con men are less intelligent then teachers, which, in the terms that the question is phrased, would not necessarily true, as a con man could be considered to demonstrate their intelligence more directly than a mere thinker or teacher who may not benefit from their own intellect. We might say that 'acting intellectual' is not as intelligent as what is being pretended, but if putting on such an act influences the world for centuries then it would seem that there are certainly many things to be which are 'actually' less intelligent than a philosopher.

            "answer_text": "First, you should ask and answer the question, \u201cWhat do philosophers do?\u201d If you can\u2019t answer that, then the original question is moot. I think most people would agree that philosophers inquire about the broad nature of certain ineffable topics, like \u2018What is truth?\u2019 \u2018What is beauty?\u2019 What is moral\u201d and so forth. So the topics in and of themselves don\u2019t necessarily have to be answered by philosophers. Then we have the method by which philosophers attempt to answer such questions. One method is to refer to authorities that have expostulated on the point in question.. They often do so via logical principles, hypothetical example, the deep study of primary and secondary sources\u2014many which may contain asbstruse terms and vocabulary. A mastery of these terms does take some intelligence, and applying them appropriately to a philosophical question probably means philosophers are intelligent. So in the realm of philosophy, phiosophers may have developed advanced means to respond to these questions, but they may be dumb in other areas. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy is about asking and answering questions- usually at the most basic level, without resorting to subjective assumptions (although, this is often unavoidable). It has nothing to do with demonstrating one's intellectual strength. Anyone can be a philosopher. Of course, you cannot expect others to accept your investigations unless your studies are rational. And the academic community does not take you seriously unless you have a relevant degree- but that only matters if you're trying to publish something. But if you are referring to those with a masters or a doctorate in philosophy (in philosophy), then it is very likely that they have already demonstrated their intellectual skill and integrity to the institute that has awarded them the title. You can certainly expect them to be intellectual. ",

Because mastering hypnotism is a is mastering a skill which need tries and failures. You aim for the failure, you fail, you learn from the failure, you try again. When you have modified enough failures you will be a master. OH! that seems like hard work. You are told to move a huge sack of bricks. It\u2019s impossible to move it alone but you have no other choice. What can you do? You can move the brick one by one. Hard work cut into short works is achievable. But why doing work? What\u2019s the purpose? My point is I know how thing works and how to get it done but I\u2019m too lazy to do them. Maybe laziness is built into me. It gives me more energy to think.

You're assuming that being intelligent implies the need to demonstrate it outside; either it makes oneself feel intelligent or one defines himself/herself by how others think about him/her (which both are actually the same). Why would one do this? Some people, which are more intelligent than others, do it every day. They like to feel being superior compared to people around them. Maybe they judge themselves by how they are seen by others. If they stop showing off their intelligence, they might feel becoming less popular or even less intelligent. So, it is an ego boost, nothing else.  When it comes to philosophers, they simply don't care. They ignore all feelings of ego because it would compromise their objective view of the world. Philosophers love to think and reason, as the name says: love of wisdom. Becoming wise requires to think outside one's limited subjective boxing. If you're thinking that philosophers are only pretending to be intelligent, you'd better to forget your own subjective feelings and focus on purely objective view. Maybe some of them are but certainly not all. Or maybe they are only trolling with the Chinese room argument... ",

In my opinion, one attempts to demonstrate / show off / boast about something he / she is not confident of or lacks. One usually applies and uses, for own benefit, what ones has in abundance. A mature philosopher is much beyond the concerns of how you or anyone else perceives him / her. For them, their philosophy is their ultimate truth and they live by it and live for spreading it with the good intention of people benefiting from it just like they feel they did. ",
