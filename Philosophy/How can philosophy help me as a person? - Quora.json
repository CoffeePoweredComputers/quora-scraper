            "answer_text": "Hi Philip and Readers, It\u2019s not going to help you but it may inspire you in thoughts and ideas. Studying philosophy or life related things can actually create a lot of confusion within you. I experienced that during a period of awakening. It\u2019s quite frustrating because all you wish to know is the truth about who you are, why you are and where you go? But, equally it\u2019s inspiration for your being. Let you inner heart guide you, because it will. Be patient because like a human grows from baby to adult so does the inner spirit of you. It comes when the time is right. You cannot learn life intellectually but through experience and heart you learn a lot. Mind is temporary, Spirit (Source) is permanent. Mind has limitations although they evolve. Spirit has NO limitation because it\u2019s the Source of all. So, ALL answers are within you. Ready for you when you\u2019re ready. Trust yourself and follow your heart intuition. Read that which you feel you shall read. Ponder only that which you feel you should ponder. Answers will come within you. YOU ARE YOUR OWN LAW AND JUDGE. Good luck with your search, Ralph A voice in the Ocean ",

            "answer_text": "Learning to like philosophy depends on your motivation to expand your mind and stretch your imagination. Philosophy allows you to think on more than one level at a time. Learning to abstract and analyse and argue from different points of view is a skill. I believe, this skill is good for intellectual and emotional development. The history of Western thought has in roots in Greek Philosophy. Think of the contributions made to our heritage by names like Aristotle, Plato, and Cicero. There are German, British, and American philosophers. William James is one of my favorites. Thinking clearly requires patience and self reflection. Philosophy helps us to reflect on politics, history, ethics, and even the concept of a \u201cGood Life\u201d. John Kekes has taught me how to understand the nature of \u201cEvil\u201d. Martha Nussbaum taught me about empathy in literature and how to define it. There are wonderful philosophical analysis of critical thinkers like Shakespeare and psychologists like Freud. Murdoch and Midgley have written on the philosophy of \u201cThe Good\u201d and the definition of \u201cWickedness\u201d , respectively. Read any books on the history of Western Thought and you will be reading about Philosophy. Religion is a Philosophical problem and many turn to religious thinkers for spiritual guidance. All in all, developing a taste for the classics is a window for penetrating many of the area studied by philosophers as well. ",

As he stated in his public trial in ancient Athens in 399 BC, that was one of Socrates\u2019 primary motivations. Hence, his statement in his trial of \u201cThe unexamined life is not worth living.\u201d By understanding what the good life consists of one is able to have a model to aim for \u2014 even if we miss it by a little bit then we are not shooting in the dark like most people.

All we need to be a good (better) person is to develop the qualities of kindness, compassion, willingness to help others, a sense of humor, good cheer when with other people, and refrain from anger, hate, and intolerance.

            "answer_text": "Sound philosophy can instruct your mind as to what is true, and incorporating that knowledge can be helpful. However, a decision is required that you will actually follow what you have discovered to be true! Thus we can decide to actually do what leads to the habits of virtue, and refuse vices! This is not an easy task, but well worth it! The books of William Bennett seem to be a good beginning point! ",
