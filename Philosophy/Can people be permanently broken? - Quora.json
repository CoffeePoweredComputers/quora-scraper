            "answer_text": "The answer depends on you. It matters on your response to your brokenness. Lets define what being broken means : lacking sense of self worth. The feeling that we are no longer this amazing person that will succeed, reach goals and achieve great things in life. Because the moment we feel broken, like broken ceramic wares, we can no longer function the way we used to. Horrible past experiences, traumas and wrong decisions are things that makes up who we are today. But they also become reasons and excuses to stay broken. As I have said before, the period of our brokeness depends on ourselves. It could be something permanent, making ourselves \u201chandicapped\u201d. Or we could rise from that brokeness and become an improved version of ourselves.  There\u2019s this Japanese art called Kintsugi (\u91d1\u7d99\u304e) meaning golden (\u201ckin\u201d) and repair (\u201ctsugi\u201d). This traditional Japanese art uses a precious metal \u2013 liquid gold, liquid silver or lacquer dusted with powdered gold \u2013 to bring together pieces of a broken pottery item and enhance the breaks at the same time.They are more expensive than the smooth and perfect version of ceramic bowls. The beautiful patterns in Kitsugi that are formed from by the shattered ceramic pieces or scars increase their worth. And when these bowls are fixed, they are not only just functional again, they are more beautiful and improved than before. Though, it\u2019s worth to note that a ceramic bowl can\u2019t fix their own brokenness by themselves. Especially if the scale is very big and the level is severe. We need our liquid gold and hands to reconnect our sense. Find people that cares, a community perhaps or someone that could help us regain our form and help us fix our brokenness. Bit by bit, time by time we will heal as we keep regaining our self worth and self love. Don't give up on your brokenness. Your future version of yourself will thank you for making brave little steps. ps : I know that it's really expected to talk about God and religion when speaking about brokenness. But it's true that brokenness isn't easy to fix. The only one who knows us best is Our Creator, the one who also holds our life\u2019s blue print. So we might as well seek Him for help. \u201cThe Lord is close to the brokenhearted; he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.\u201d Psalms\u202c 34:18\u202c NLT\u202c\u202c \u201cIf your heart is broken, you\u2019ll find GOD right there; if you\u2019re kicked in the gut, he\u2019ll help you catch your breath.\u201d Psalm\u202c 34:18\u202c MSG\u202c\u202c If you have nobody to help you, I\u2019m willing to try my best. Let\u2019s get to know each other, remember that your life too precious to waste in brokenness. Our life goes by as fast as mist. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Some are like trees and others like reeds. When a heavy storm rages the trees are broken permanently whereas the reeds survive to live through another one. So, when faced with a seemingly helpless situation where they see no future, the life force in some snaps permanently leading to suicide or irreparable mental damage or irrecoverable addiction to drugs/alcohol. But, some like the famous author Victor Frankl of \u2018Man\u2019s Search for Meaning\u2019 survive the auschwitz/ holocaust to live another day and inspire others. ",
