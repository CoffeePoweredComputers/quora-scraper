            "answer_text": "I taught my children human rights are the responsibilities human beings can excercise because they are thinking creating creatures. Animals cannot learn to read or write, or make laws or form governments or build things that make their lives easier. We have a respondsibility to use our energies to create and use our rights for the benefit of ourselves and others. We have to agree on what forms of government we want, business, and education, religion and cultures. Only by exercising our responsibility to create and maintain a way of life we can agree with can anybody have any rights. The most basic right is the right to take care of ourselves and not expect someone else to do that for you. You have to participate in the forming and maintaining your government, businesses, cultures, and religious institutions. Man has grown up to the point where no one wants a king or queen taking from them and living free off their work. Human rights are what people decide they should be, and what they are willing to die to establish and maintain. Death is the only absolute certainty after birth. Make the time you live be of benefit to yourself and at least one other, hopefully more. That is what a human right is, the respondsibility to live respondsibly. ",
