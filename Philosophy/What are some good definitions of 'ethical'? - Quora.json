            "answer_text": "Morality is applied ethics. Ethics involves what is good (what is just) and what is bad. What is good or bad can be defined differently and may have opposite results depending on the ethical perspective (e.g., what's good is what is best for the majority, or what's good is what preserves the rights of the individual). \u201cBest is not the one who exercises his virtue toward himself but the one who exercises it towards another; because this is a difficult task. Justice in this sense, then, is not a part of virtue but the whole of it, and the injustice contrary to it is not a part but the whole of vice.\u201d (Aristotle, 1953/1976, p. 174) There are numerous ethical systems, such as, utilitarianism, ethical formalism, ethics of care, natural law, religious ethics, prudence, pragmatism, contractarianism, normative rationalization, feminist ethics, and relativism. Devising dilemmas that could have differing results with the application of different theories does not seem out of the question. Moreover, cultural ethics evolve, what in the past was considered unacceptable may become common (e.g., abortion). An individual's ethics, in an ideal world, would never vary. Which does not mean that they would never vary from their ideals, but that they would continually strive to meet those ethical ideals knowing that they will probably fall short at times (the basic idea of prudence). But in reality, our egos sometimes demand that we alter our ethics to correspond to our behavior. Kohlberg (1981) identified one level of moral development (a subset of group four of six sequential levels) wherein the individual practices relativism, choosing to be morally guided by what is best for them at the moment. Symbolic interactionism (a type of interpretivism) is a sociological theory indicating that ethical behavior may be dependent on time and place; and, an individual's behavior can be divergent or even conflictual, depending on the setting. The best that can be done is to keep a lid on it by imprisoning offenders (a small percentage of individuals commit a large percentage of the crimes) and paying attention to pre-crime conditions (lack of education, unemployment, etc.).Personally, the ideal of prudence seems the most ethical; maintaining a high ethical expectation, while recognizing that one will at times fall short of the ideal.

            "answer_text": "Ethics are rules that we make up because we like them. Ethical behavior complies with a given set of ethics. You can test for subjectivity of proposed ethical rules using \"why recursion\". If someone asserts particular ethics as unassailable facts, ask 'why?'. \"Why should I accept those ethics as valid moral imperatives?\" Keep asking 'why?' until you reach the root of their position. Is it because the ethics are true? Or is it just because they like them? Morals, in contrast, are rules that dictate right and wrong willed conduct. Morals are logically valid; i.e., provably free of contradictions in their context. I know of only one valid moral imperative, which I present here:Do valid moral imperatives exist?. ",
