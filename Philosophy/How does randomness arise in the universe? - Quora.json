            "answer_text": "Randomness is inducible to an unprepared or unknowing entity that is alive. What is random to one could be considered an action meant to evoke change unto another. The mind fathoms randomness through sheer ignorance. What is incapable of fathoming is incapable of knowing until a surprise undergoes transmogrification through intelligent processes. Then fathoming becomes a pursuit to rationalize a perceivable correlation. Correlations aren\u2019t always rational. Correlations aren\u2019t always true. We are incapable of fathoming the unknown, yet are able to decoct certain phenomena. Randomness in nature curtails it\u2019s presence to other changes happening around where it\u2019s evocation takes place. So the universe could fool itself, as also awareness is dimensionally dependent. Intervention from higher ordered structures could also be randomized in this sense. It is difficult to conceive of higher ordered structures except through philosophizing about change\u2019s presence and whether change itself is randomized always or rarely, though \u2019tis likely not never.
