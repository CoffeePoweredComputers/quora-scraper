            "answer_text": "There is a Biblical statement regarding this issue. In Matthew 5:45, as part of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says this about God the Father: \u201cHe makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust\u201d Another Biblical passage that more or less \u201ctargets only the unjust\u201d can be seen in a number of stories. As soon as Moses had finished saying all this, the ground beneath them split open, Numbers 16:33 They went down alive into Sheol with all they owned. The earth closed over them, and they vanished from the assembly. Numbers 16:49 But those who died from the plague numbered 14,700, in addition to those who had died on account of Korah. We can find more where the precision of focusing in is to punish only the unjust. The \u201cidea of fairness\u201d may be an anthropomorphic grasp about our \u201clower case\u201d mortal lives. In an eternal sense, this world is \u201ctemporary\u201d and is more like a \u201cprojection\u201d of an eternal soul that is not destroyed. So, in an eternal sense, chaos here would be fair, but there would also be \u201clessons\u201d where \u201corder\u201d is included \u201cdown here.\u201d Given that there is a sort of tug of war between chaos/order, it would be nice if order wins out, even in a temporal world. But if we can be seated as Monday Morning quarterbacks, with a celestial audience to stare back in retrospect with a 2020 vision, to probe and judge the world, \u201cchaos\u201d may spread like a disease with no concern from life forms, or it can have those opposed to help spread \u201corder.\u201d The \u201cchaos\u201d itself is neutral, and in that sense \u201cfair.\u201d It is when species, like human beings deal with chaos that we have to face the reality that human beings are not the only game in town.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say fairness is pretty specific to conscious entities that concern themselves with notions of morality. Entropy doesn\u2019t care about being fair, and a lion isn\u2019t eating you because it thinks you deserve to be eaten (it eats you because it is hungry). However if we think in a bit more of a statistical sense I would say chaos could be considered \u201cfair\u201d - it doesn\u2019t really differentiate between outcomes nor does it preference particular trends. Any patterns that do occur in a truly chaotic system are flukes of chance. For example take the hypothetical of a group of people falling into a pool of water, that has multiple conflicting currents running through it. A chaotic swirl that could only be predicted or simulated with a supercomputer and a lot of fine tuning of parameters. The pool of water will treat every person who falls into it in the same fashion - they\u2019ll get tossed about in seemingly random directions, some may get hurt, others may escape unharmed. While other factors might influence the outcome (swimming ability, landing on the edge of the pool vs at the center, etc), the water itself will behave no differently to any particular individual. It merely flows and pushes whatever is in those flows around. Actually, getting tossed into a pool of conflicting currents could be a decent analogy for life, thinking about it. ",
