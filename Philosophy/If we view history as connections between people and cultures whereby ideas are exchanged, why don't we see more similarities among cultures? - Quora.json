            "answer_text": "Cultures have layers, like an onion. The superficial layers are things like clothing, eating habits, music, rituals, heroes and symbols. In the superficial layers we see cultures converging towards similar things. Almost anywhere in the world, these days, you will find people wearing jeans, eating sushi and listening to \u201cThe Girl From Ipanema.\u201d Fifty years ago that was not the case. The core of culture is made of values learned in childhood, when you learn what is considered \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d in your community. This core is harder to change, it takes much longer (centuries). Some things are universal (similar) such as family, respect, competition and interaction; but in each culture the way these notions are expressed is different. When I meet someone from a different culture, I learn from them and they learn from me; but we may not change our behaviours. In some cases, the interaction may cause me to hang on to my original values even more, specially if I see the others\u2019 values as a threat to my identity. It\u2019s quite a paradox: in some cases, interacting with another culture may actually enhance conservative behaviour, as a defence mechanism against the perceived threat of different values\u2026 unless you feel essentially secure about your own identity.

            "answer_text": "I think we do see more similarities than difference, but we tend to focus on the differences more than on what is the same. There are some obvious reasons for that, as follows. One factor involves friction and discomfort and could be illustrated by our awareness of our own bodies. We usually don't focus on our toes for example, unless they are uncomfortable. Pain causes us to pay attention to them. Otherwise the fade into the background in our prioritization of what requires attention. It can be likened to that one student who causes trouble in a class. It is usually that kid that rather unfairly gets the lion's share of the attention. In personal relationship the same thing often happens, where someone does 10 things that are nice and good, but one thing that is unkind or unjust, and it is our tendency to forget all the good stuff and focus in on the bad. Why? Again, because it hurts us in some way and pain is pretty demanding of our attention, tending to shut out all else, at least for some episode of intensity, but then we just remember the intensity, which compounds the relationship problem with another layer. Another factor, however, is perhaps a bit more sinister and systemically contrived. It hinges on the fact that if a group can be differentiated from all others, it becomes a power base for the leaders. Look at large professional associations for example. Maybe the vegetable growers of America becomes a powerful lobby. So within it there develops the Corn Growers of America, the Beat Growers, and so on... But within the Corn Growers of America, the Sweet Corn guys and the Indian Corn guys decide they want to carve out their own power base, so instead of emphasizing their commonalities, they purposefully emphasize their differences in order to hack out a new population of associates over which and from which they can gain and wield authority and power. This is exactly what culture wars are intended to do from a 'national engineering' standpoint. And while culture differences are legitimate and sometimes thorny to bridge, nation builders have found them to be a convenient crux upon which to turn masses of people against one another and foment differences that demarcate us away from each other so they can ride heard on their fiefdom, YOU AND ME!!! This is exactly why we have over 230 different nations now, all fighting about our specific individual cultures, not willing to bend toward a brotherhood of man, but always focused on diversity, which is just a softer word for divisiveness. I respect other people's cultures, and actually enjoy the difference for the most part. But my father would spank me when ever I allowed my own self importance to jeopardize kindness ore reasonableness to the point that it lead me to become the perpetrator of selfish injustice and pig headedness toward others. The leaders of our nations don't have a dad to spank them though, and the slobbering masses are simply too brainwashed and nationalistically indoctrinated by now to recognize what is really going on.
