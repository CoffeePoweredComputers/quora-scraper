            "answer_text": "TRIGGER WARNING \u26a0\ufe0f Child abuse!! Well, when I was growing up my guardian thought homemade truth serum was a thick barbers strap or a limb off of a bush that had thorns. Sometimes it was a fly swatter or bare hand. It was usually administered to my bare bottom until I admitted I had lied or I cried, whichever came first. The only problem was, this wasn\u2019t homemade truth serum. It was humiliation and abuse. Pain and resentment. One day I tried to fight back. Whop! whop! whop! whop! I turned and looked at the woman hitting me and screamed, \u201cI hate you!\u201d Silence. WHOP!!! The homemade truth serum was applied to my mouth instead of my bottom. But the truth serum had done its job that day, because for the first time I gave my inner thoughts a voice and stood up to the woman who would spend 14 years hitting my body, tearing down my self esteem, and destroying me mentally and emotionally. I spoke the truth: I hated her. And, no, I never hit my daughter. I kept a promise that I made to my childhood self: The cycle stopped with me. ",

            "answer_text": "first of all \"truth serums\" arent actually what they seem to be from movies. really they work more like alcohol, they dont actually force them to tell the truth they are just sedating and lower the person's inhibitions so that they are more likely to divulge information. dont try it, you could kill someone with a homemade concotion if you dose it incorrectly not to mention its pretty illegal to drug someone up or force them to drink alcohol like that. youre just going to get yourself into trouble ",
