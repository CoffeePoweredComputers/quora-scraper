            "answer_text": "There are techniques to trick the mind, you use mind to go beyond mind, soudns silly, but it works. You can use everything to skip beyond mind, senses, thoughts also, just need to reverse awareness in right direction. Mind is our tool, we must use tool, not become slaved by it. Noizy mind is like full cloudy sky. When it\u2019s still and silent, sky is clean and our nature can be revealed. When you look at something, you look through your eyes, be aware who is looking through eyes. When you hear sound, you hear through ears, (senses are medium our being use to experience this reality) be aware who listen through your ears. When you think, thought appears\u2026be aware to whom thought appeared. Below is my favourite technique, but you need to be able to keep mind still and silent, otherwise it won\u2019t work. Here you use imagination, for me it works, if you don\u2019t afraid supportless space try this one. Antarakasha dharana:  If one concentrate on the body as a void, even for a moment, with mind free from thought, then one attains thoughtlessness and verily becomes that form of void.  Commentary: The limitations of consciousness trapped in physical body are difficult to transcend. What holds you back from experience of that supreme state is your identification with the body and with the thoughts, which assail you throughout the day, concerning the experiences of the body. If you can concentrate on your body as void or space and transcend all thoughts, even for a moment, your mind will be liberated and will take on the form of that void. It is important to note that you don\u2019t have to concentrate for hours and hours in order to experience this state. Even if you focus the mind for just a moment, it is enough to give you experience of heightened state of awareness.  This sloka describes the practice of antarakasha dharana, concentration on the inner space, in which every part of the body is concieved of as void. At first it may be difficult to percieve the body as space due to our material identifications and associations. However, in time it becomes natural experience, and by developing this form of concentration the mind also takes on that form of void, because the mind and the body are not separate. When we concentrate on anything, the mind take that form, even for a moment. So, if we concentrate on the body, the mind becomes that form of the body. In this way, when we see the body as space, the mind also becomes a space, and thus the vikalpas, or thought constructs are immediately transcended. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the key question of all spirituality. The mind is considered to be the great provider of illusion, the great destroyer of Reality. So much so that many books and spiritual masters say \"you must destroy the destroyer\", or \"you must destroy the mind\". Of course, each doctrine, each sentence, each word of spiritual discourse must be understood both relatively and deeply, and not interpreted superficially. Obviously, if you objectively destroy your mind, you will no longer know your name, where you live, or how to speak. \"Destroying the mind\" therefore cannot mean that. Some spiritual seekers interpret this \"destruction\" as a kind of \"shut up\". According to them, speeches, verbal teachings, books, concepts and words are useless, and even harmful. This interpretation is unfortunately as frequent as it is inappropriate. It\u2019s true: in the silence of meditative state there is no room for words and concepts... but outside of this state, words and concepts return, and it\u2019s crucial to know how to manage them . Anyway, the famous \"shut up\", itself, is nothing but a concept. You should also be aware that the word \"mind\", in books, is often a reductive translation of Vedic or Vedantist concepts which mean \"incessant flow of thoughts\" (and it\u2019s not exactly the same). Anyway, the question is: \u201cHow can we go beyond our mind to reach the true self using the same mind?\u201d. Navnath sampradaya\u2019s Masters, like Nisargadatta, Ranjit, Siddharameswar or Ramakand teach a beautiful formula which answers this question so well: \"the problem comes from the mind, the solution must come from the mind\". And for that, they offer, firstly, a perfect mastery of meditation, and secondly a deep personal reflection about \"what is illusion\". Once the illusion is recognized for what it is, you can no longer remain attached to it, so you let go and it is awakening. From another close perspective, you can see the existence of two mental options: gullible thinking and skeptical thinking. This is what Vedanta calls \"Neti, neti\" (neither this, nor that). According to Vedanta, it\u2019s enough to reject everything that appears, including in meditation, to accept nothing as true. When you have rejected everything, what remains is Reality. I would put it in a more western way to speak, saying that all you have to do is see how much your thought believes in itself. Thought that believes in thought is gullible thought. It\u2019s the source of all our illusions: we believe that our thoughts are reality. We confuse the map and the territory. In order to unmask this gullible thought, a skeptical thought must be cultivated. It\u2019s a work of every second. And it\u2019s an extremely effective way to use the mind to go beyond the mind, because it generates a step back, a witness which will become more and more refined until it disappears itself in favor of true Self.

            "answer_text": "Very good question. We only have the human mind with which to understand the human mind. Everything we are and experience is attached to that process. In terms of Psychosynthesis or Transpersonal Psychology we must link into the higher or metaphysical/spiritual aspects of why we are here and why we wish to investigate our own minds and how the mind brain communication works. (Ken Wilbur takes this into an Integral Level.) We have a higher abstract mind and a lower cognitive one. It is communication with the higher mind via the process of meditation, contemplation and observation which leads to higher transcendental states and alters perception of the way we think and or feel over time. It happens naturally as a child evolves into puberty and adulthood, development unfolds.i was informed by my human spiritual mentor that my brain was not good enough for the higher mind to communicate with the lower. Yet I had always considered that I had some type of working relationship between the two and was already constructing the Rainbow Bridge or developing the right type of spine necessary for the endocrine system to increase its function for service. The Delphic Oracle\u2019s most famous maxim is \u201cKnow Thyself\u201d. Pythagoras, Plato, Socrates, along with many others have used this to create images in language which stimulate the human mind into consideration of what it means to be human, and a God. (Two interconnecting circles symbolically represent the higher divine and lower human aspects: remember the brain is in the body but the mind is the whole of the existence and the mind is connected to other minds whether or not the concrete psychologists want to embrace that fact or not.) Humanists may consider that there is no extraneous influence beyond the human mind and that any inspirational communication or connection stems from that which is in the human \u201cring past not\u201d of their existence. We know that observing experiments changes the outcome of the experiment. I suspect that if we become detached observers of our own responses to inner and outer stimulus and keep our minds open then we will will reach the true self and when the process is mature enough that true self or Soul lighted intelligence will take us beyond the human to the centre of the Source which creates all existence including Alien minds in the Oneness of the Universe, nay Multiverse. Look at the diagram of the Constitution of Man in any of the Bailey books, Look up the twisted string theory of quantum physics, also. Then think about it, or as we say in spiritual speak, ponder on this. ",

            "answer_text": "You are your true soul. The soul that has chosen to come down here once again to use free will to move closer to Spirit (Creator, Source, etc). Your true soul loves you and wants you to move towards \u201cenlightenment\u201d or closer to Spirit. To do this you must overcome your mind/ego. Spirit wants you to evolve to learn acceptance/love/etc. To become a better human thus being a better Soul. No one here is fully \u201cenlightened\u201d. If you were you wouldn\u2019t be here. Your journey on your path would be over. For now, when your mind/ego races with thoughts, say to yourself\u2026 Listen\u2026 the thoughts will stop \u2026 and you will have access to your true Soul. In that stillness, in that peace, we begin. We begin the path of self-actualization. Your true soul is meant to help you be a better human, a better Soul\u2026 your free will must choose the right path. Meditation can help you to see your true self. But you can find your true self in everyday moments. When you choose the right path of action. When you break patterns that stop the evolution of the soul. When you choose love or kindness. It really isn\u2019t hard \u2026 although most fail and that\u2019s okay. We must remember we were once them. Accept the world as it is and not how you want it to be. Listen and you will hear your true self whisper the answers you seek on your path. ",

            "answer_text": "Knowledge of oneself (self- knowledge) is the most beneficial knowledge of all. In the following quran verse, 21 of Surah al-Dhariyat, the Lord says: \u0648\u064e\u0641\u0650\u064a \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0633\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u06da \u0623\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064f\u0628\u0652\u0635\u0650\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u201cAnd in your own souls (too); will you not then see?\u201d(51:21) This verse calls to our attention to the need to look for these signs within ourselves. We are clearly and unambiguously told that there are signs in the external world as well, and these are sources of guidance for us. From these verses it becomes clear to us that Muslims are urged not to focus on their souls to the exclusion of the physical, material world; and conversely, not to think that material affairs are all that matter. In India for instance, there are people who try to strengthen the power of their souls in order to enable themselves to perform certain deeds not ordinarily possible. But in so doing, they loose touch with the everyday life of the planet. That is not what faithful Muslims are commanded to do. Muslims are told the two go hand in hand and are complimentary to each other. When a scientist is working on a project in the laboratory, or a person is performing the most menial of tasks to earn an honourable living, he or she is carrying out one of God's commandments. It is again, one of the most distinct characteristics of Islam that two worlds are never separated. In today's world, in Western societies in particular, we see countless examples of people who are totally alienated from themselves, seeking all in the material life. In more extreme cases, the alienation from the self has progressed to such a degree that being alone becomes painful and undesirable. Why? Because when such a person is alone, in a way he has lost contact with the eternal world, which is all he has. So being alone with his soul and spirit, he has to face a world which has no meaning to him, and matters not to him. In trying to escape the inevitable loneliness, many resort to mind-altering drugs, such as alcohol and narcotics. A person with a healthy spirit can be alone yet not lonely. One who has forsaken a part of himself, his spirit, his consciousness, when alone, seeks to destroy it, rather than facing that which is excruciatingly painful; thus resorting to drugs becomes an easy escape route. This is one reason why some societies use solitary confinement as a method of punishment for hardened criminals who already are serving life sentences and have nothing to lose by further acts of violence. But when a faithful Muslim is alone by himself, he is not lonely. As a matter of fact being alone is prized by faithful Muslims. There is a Hadith from Imam Sajjad (a.s.) in which the Imam is quoted as saying: \u201cIf all between the East and West were to die, I would not feel lonely as long as the Qur'an was with me. Once again we shall turn to the Hadiths to further explore this topic. This invaluable heritage has been left to us by the scholars who instinctively knew the eternal value of observing the speech and deeds of the Noble Prophet and Imams, and recording for posterity this living example of the perfect Muslim and human being. Earlier we discussed a famous Tradition, which has reached us in two similar versions: There is however, no difference in meaning: \u201cHowever knows himself (his soul or spirit) knows [or has known] his Lord \u201c(1) Imam \u2018Ali (a.s.) is also quoted on the subject, stressing the importance of knowledge: \u201cKnowledge of oneself (self- knowledge) is the most beneficial knowledge of all \u201c(2) This again tells us that knowing oneself leads to knowing one's Lord and all that it entails. The second Hadith on the topic from \u2018Ali (a.s.) reads: \u201cI wonder at the person who urgently searches for that which he has lost, but he has lost his soul and is not searching for it \u201c The third Hadith from Imam \u2018Ali (a.s.) on Self-knowledge is: 'I wonder how a person who ignores himself can know his Lord. ' The fourth Hadith from Imam \u2018Ali (a.s.) is: \u201cWhenever the knowledge of a man increases, his attention to his soul also increases and he tries his best to train, and purify' it\u201d Here is yet another Tradition on the subject from Imam \u2018Ali (a.s.): \u201cThe ultimate knowledge of a man is to know himself\u201d Url The Importance of Self-Knowledge ",
