            "answer_text": "Moral values are set of principles guiding us to evaluate what is right or wrong Moral values help shape the character and personality of individuals. Children are taught about it through moral stories. Moral values such as integrity, determination, loyalty, truthfulness, honesty, giving respect to each other etc should be inherited by every individual. As stated earlier moral values help us distinguish between what\u2019s right and wrong, good or bad for you as well as society. So, as a result, your decision making power improves naturally. Respecting each other no matter what age of the person standing in front of you helps you gain good relations at every walks of life, be it family, workplace, or society. It also helps in finding the true purpose of your life. Now if moral values are so fruitful to humans then why is it that there are too many people who don\u2019t follow such a morally right life. Why are there crimes happening in this world? Or disbelief towards each other among citizens on this earth? This world is a tempting place, offering quick fixes to problems we face, which eventually brings us back to the main problem. Following moral values in life takes a lot of patience and sacrifice but it surely helps one to analyze the problem or difficulty one faces in life and find the solution The trick about moral values is that the results of following such a disciplined or determined lifestyle are not at all observable in day-to-day life. But only at the difficult times when people trust you, and keep faith in you, do you realize that your way of living is what made them trust you today. These values will surely help you, but only in the long run, or you can see the actual results in the long run. So to sum it up. A person who is determined to follow a meaningful life patiently follows moral values in his life without the fear of getting judged and hence stands out in the crowd. To find out more on this topic I recommend you to read the following article, which explains it deeply. Moral Values ",

            "answer_text": "Moral Values: We test and consider whether the wrong or the right of an action we\u2019re thinking of doing is beneficial or harmful to ourselves and/or other people that may be involved. If we consider it harmful, then we don\u2019t do it. We introduced the NHS in 1948 because we wanted to ensure that all people had access to proper medical care and that human life is special. We abolished the death penalty in 1964 in Britain. Partly because we considered that killing another person, even if they had, could not be justified. The death penalty also contradicted the sixth of the ten commandments: thou shalt not kill. When I was a young man I went to London to see a film that was allowed screening by the GLC but was banned by the national film censor. It was a pretty tedious film, I remember. I thought that it was odd that a film was forbidden to be shown in a cinema in my home town, but 35 miles away, I could see this film, legally. Censorship has since ended in Britain. Would this film encourage me to go off and molest women? No, why should it? That was the \u201cmoral\u201d objection about the film at the time. My moral values mean that I am opposed to things like payday loan companies that exploit poor people and whose 500% + interest rates make them even poorer. I am opposed to politicians who want to cut social benefits first, but aren\u2019t interested in ensuring that people are paid fairly for the work they do. Mental Health funding is being cut by millions of pounds at the moment because of \u201causterity\u201d. Single Mums and Dads are facing huge price hikes for childcare, which makes it impossible for them to keep working. Why are the taxes for the rich being cut by billions when our poor can\u2019t remain in their jobs? Especially when Britain is the 4th richest country on the planet. I could go on\u2026. but I am sure you can see that I complain about what is \u201clegal\u201d not necessarily being morally right. These are examples, I picked good ones and shameful ones of what I mean by moral values. ",
