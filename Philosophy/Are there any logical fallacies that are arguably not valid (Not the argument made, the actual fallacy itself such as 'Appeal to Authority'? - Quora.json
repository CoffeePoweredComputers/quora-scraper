            "answer_text": "Logical fallacies are categorically invalid, since they would not be logical fallacies otherwise. Presumably you are asking is: \u2018Are there valid methods of reasoning that are alleged to be spurious?\u2019 The answer to which is: \u2018There are methods of reasoning that are not in general truth-preserving but that in special contexts can be truth-preserving and therefore non-fallacious.\u2019 Consider the so-called fallacy of composition, this being the inference from \u2018x parts have a given property\u2019 to \u2018x itself has that property.\u2019 This method of reasoning is obviously spurious in many contexts. For example, \u2018each of x\u2019s limbs weighs less than 5 lbs; therefore x itself weighs less than 5 lbs.\u2019 But it does hold in special contexts. For example, each of x\u2019s parts weighs more than 5 lbs; therefore x itself weighs more than 5 lbs. When a given form of reasoning is described as a \u2018logical fallacy\u2019, what is meant is not that use of it is categorically spurious but is rather that use of it is not categorically non-spurious.
