            "answer_text": "\u201cOverthinking\u201d is just a commonly used popular psychology term and it has little to do with the scientific definition of (crystallized) intelligence. A person with an average or above average IQ would be relatively good at problem solving, seeing patterns and processing information coming from the outside world. An IQ score, on the other hand cannot tell how well that person is coping with his own thoughts, it won\u2019t say anything at all about his mental health condition. A person who \u201coverthinks\u201d is having an anxiety issue, a very common mental hygiene problem. He will not be able to let certain problems go and will obsessively dwell on his own, often completely speculative thoughts, usually about his future or the inner workings of other people, while he will forget to keep an eye on actual reality. He will then get tangled up in these stubborn thoughts, causing himself even more stress and anxiety, exacerbating the problem. It\u2019s a vicious cycle! People with a high IQ are probably more likely to develop certain anxiety-related disorders and obsessive thoughts, but that door is open for everyone who just happens to have the wrong set of genes or went through some fitting psychological trauma. (Yay.) I would say, it is only logical that people who think a lot will more likely \u201coverthink\u201d than those who don\u2019t. (Not thinking at all will probably save you some sleepless nights.) Being a particularly exhausting freetime activity, \u201coverthinking\u201d might take up all your mental energy, making you clumsier, slower and less sharp when it comes to solving real-life problems or making quick decisions. It might make you seem less intelligent, just like not sleeping enough or trying to say something in a new language. But \u201coverthinking\u201d lowering your IQ? No way. ",

            "answer_text": "From a scoring perspective in test-based reasoning measurement, I would say yes. It depends how much thinking you need however, when observing, for example, a logic puzzle. They vary in difficulty, obviously, and if overthinking means that you are able to think through various possible factors at once, that is a positive. However, if you expect or presuppose certain thinking criteria external to the parameters of a problem - a common difficulty for smart creatives - your IQ score may be negatively effected. You may get stuck on a puzzle because your brain is racing to find the key, but you miss it by looking in the wrong manner. I saw this one the other day:  What sequence is the grid suggesting? Now, many people familiar with reasoning, logic and analytical thinking by habit would start looking for angle patterns or trying to link certain features of the centre square to the respective adjoining squares by zone\u2026 something like that. It doesn't mean this is a wrong way to approach these questions, indeed many Mensa questions require this kind of thinking. This turned out to be the answer: It made me snigger a bit\u2026  You might go \u2018'hey that's just silly, what's the point in that, it doesn't look proper as a solution!\u2019 Yea, well that's kind of the point. Maybe it is a bad example, but still, if you overthink it and try to go all \u2018'non-verbal reasoning freak\u201d on it, you will not get the score for it. It is rather difficult in its simplicity. You may have already deduced that I have a rather sceptical attitude toward IQ by my focus on it solely from the test-based perspective. It is not out of failure-spite - I seem to range from 115 to 130 in tests I've done at various ages, with random correlation- but out of an annoyance with the importance given to it by individuals. This probably isn't a popular opinion on Quora but I don't care. Don't we have enough qualifiers in our modern education and career systems? Overthinking the significance of your own IQ probably lowers your IQ, because it's a stupid habit. Many parents actually tutor their kids to do well at these tests for status, by training them to think in certain ways, which is a perversion or an already perverted scoring system. I thought this solution was a funny one that used extrapolation to mock the design of these tests, and the generally accepted \u2018'overthinking\u2019 that comes with it. ",

First lessons are though, you can barely read solf\u00e8ge, you don\u2019t know how to keep your damn hands synchronized and the idea of giving up is always around the corner.  The truth is your brain is always trying to solve problems, whether consciously or subconsciously. It consequently manifests in a temporary lack of order. We humans, like order very much. We need it to function. You might ask: \u201cOk, but why am I constantly overthinking then? Give me a break\u201d Well, you need to find the very answer(s) to your unsolved problem(s). Some are easy to figure out. Others can be a pain. That\u2019s part of the game, though. Take them down on a piece of paper, and start connecting those bloody dots. ",
