            "answer_text": "Viktor T. Toth answers: \u201cNo, it does not. The invariance of the vacuum speed of light follows from Maxwell\u2019s equations, if one assumes that the physical properties of the vacuum (its electric permittivity and magnetic permeability) do not depend on the speed of the observer\u201d. This is not quite true. In his special relativity paper, Einstein proves that c is invariant for all observers. Contrary to popular belief, Maxwell and Lorentz did not postulate that c is invariant for all observers. They postulated that c is constant and does not depend on the speed of its source. Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity is a principle theory, a heuristic system of two principles. First, Einstein generalized the Galilean principle of relativity and adopted the above Maxwellian (Lorentzian) postulate of light: The principle of relativity: The laws of physics are independent, whether these changes of state are referred to the one or the other of two systems of coordinates in uniform motion of translation. The postulate of the velocity of light: Any ray of light moves in the coordinate system K with the definite velocity c, independent of whether the ray is emitted by a moving or a body at rest. Or: The speed of light is constant and does not depend on the speed of its source. Einstein, however, was occupied with the contradiction between the Galilean principle of relativity and the constancy of the velocity of light in Maxwell's theory. In the special theory of relativity Einstein gave up the ether. Having renounced the ether and understanding that the laws of physics are the same with respect to all inertial systems (generalizing the Galilean principle of relativity), Einstein showed that his two principles (generalized principle of relativity and the postulate of the velocity of light) are actually compatible, from which it follows: The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the source. Thus, c is invariant. Neither Maxwell nor Lorentz formulated this principle! Thus, the two principles of Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity can now be formulated in the following form: The laws of nature are the same in all inertial reference frames. (The principle of relativity is valid for all reference frames).The speed of light in vacuum, as measured in any inertial reference frame, is c regardless of the motion of the light source relative to that reference frame.Einstein writes in the relativity paper: For we have not as yet furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity. Einstein, \u201cOn the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\u201d [German], Annalen Der Physik, 1905. Indeed, Einstein obtained the Lorentz transformations and then he proved that any ray of light, measured in one inertial system, is propagated with the velocity c if this is the case in any other system. According to the \"light postulate\" defined above, any ray of light moves in the coordinate system K with the definite velocity c, independent of whether the ray is emitted by a moving or a body at rest. In the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of the electron, this was indeed the case in a system at rest in the stationary ether, which was superfluous in Einstein's theory. Einstein, however, proved that light is also propagated with the definite velocity c as measured in the system k because he renounced the ether. Consider the equation of a spherical wave propagating with the velocity c in system K:  Transforming this equation with the aid of the equations of the Lorentz transformation gives (in the coordinates of the system k):  Einstein concludes his derivation by saying: The wave under consideration is also a spherical wave with velocity of propagation c when it is observed in the moving system. This demonstrates that our two fundamental principles are compatible. Einstein, \u201cOn the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\u201d [German], Annalen Der Physik, 1905. ",

            "answer_text": "The Theory of Relativity does not explain why c is invariant, it merely assumes that and draws out its conclusions from there. However, that assumption is based on two pieces of evidence that show that a RELATIVE speed of light is impossible. Viktor T. Toth is only partially correct in stating that the invariance of the speed of light \u201cfollows\u201d from Maxwell\u2019s equations. Maxwell\u2019s equations show that the speed of light is unaffected by motion of the source, meaning that the speed of light can not be increased or decreased and is not subject to a relative speed of light due to motion of the source. But what is lacking in Viktor\u2019s discussion is that it does not \u201cfollow\u201d from Maxwell\u2019s equations that motion of an observer does not result in a relative speed of light. The motion of an observer ALSO has no effect on the relative speed of light \u201cfollows\u201d from experiments to detect an ether, and more specifically an ether wind, such as the Michelson- Morley experiment. Maxwell\u2019s equations indicate that the electromagnetic radiation moves as a wave, which is indicated by the lack of any relative speed of light due to motion of a source, and is EXACTLY how it works with sound waves. Sound is propagated as a wave, the speed of sound is medium dependent, and sound can not travel any faster or slower through the medium. BUT unlike Einstein\u2019s invariance postulate, with sound, a motion of an OBSERVER relative to sound waves can create a relative speed of sound. So, IF light is a wave, then it requires a medium, therefore, experiments like the Michelson-Morley were an attempt to discover such a medium. According to these experiments, a relative speed of light was not found due to motion of an observer, therefore it was concluded these two basic assumptions: 1) an ether does not exist, and 2) a relative speed of light is not possible due to motion of an observer. Since motion of the source, nor motion of an observer can create a relative speed of light, then the speed of light is never relative and therefore invariant. No one knows why this is the case (and some like me do not think it is true it all) but this is the evidence that leads to the assumption. Based on this assumption, and assuming it is correct, then Einstein realized that since the speed of light is invariant, SOMETHING has to be variant, and in his theory it is TIME and SPACE that are capable of being altered. So in a way, it explains how it affects our notions of TIME and SPACE better than it explains the reason why the speed of light is invariant. Technically, Einstein\u2019s second postulate is in opposition to Quantum because its behavior follows neither a particle (relative speed of light due to motion of source or observer), nor a wave (relative speed due to an observer, not due to a source). At best, it is \u201chalf-wave-like\u201d since motion of the source does not affect the relative speed of light, which is the only characteristic Einstein\u2019s postulate shares with sound. Since, Quantum assumes a wave-particle duality, then this indicates another disagreement between Quantum and Relativity. ",

Light is not special. It is a wave just like any other wave. We blue and red shift it just as the train blue shifts it\u2019s whistle to us. In the case of light we\u2019re the ones moving against or away from its one steady cosmic wide speed. It cares nothing about relativity or frames. But we do. We\u2019re on spaceship Earth. Suppose we paint the peak where we measure blue at 470 nm on the ground. Then we get on a plane and look for blue again. We find it at 470 nm as expected but the peak is not painted now. The painted peak is up in the area of x-rays and the peak we\u2019re looking at now was somewhere down in the red or microwave areas on the ground. So what happened.? Our rates of physical aging, brain, and perception speed have all slowed down inversely to our increased physical speed through the cosmos. The slight increase in velocity by getting on the plane was still something your atoms are sensitive too. It\u2019s the conservation of energy. So when our perception speed slows our brain needs to find the peak that has the wave*length* that fills our evolved need to see blue at 470 nm. As we blue shifted our original peak to be shorter and higher,in frequency our brain was slowing and inversely reversing the Doppler effect that we were causing by moving into light. Our own physical perception speed as well as our clocks and light measuring devices are all affected the same way. We all slide up and down the peaks to find the wave lengths are all tuned to. We all relativistically cancel out Doppler. That\u2019s what happens. A piece of cake. Unfortunately everyone seems to think earth is the benchmark of the cosmos. It is not..! The only benchmark is the outside observer who is sitting perfectly still with everything in the cosmos moving different speeds faster around him. None of the measurements we make of the cosmos mean anything at all without considering the relativistic aspects. But no one has ever done this. Figured in where we are in the ranges of perception, aging, and contraction compared to other objects doing other frames. And it happens even to the level of my fingers moving faster than most of the rest of my body as I type this. Earthlings are not quite as sentient as they think they are. :) Or corpuscles, photons, duality, and light\u2019s magical ability to ignore the laws of physics would never have been somehow seen as reasonable and accepted.. Cause theyre not. They\u2019re make believe. IMHO ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to make a bold statement, based on a couple of years of answering variants of this question . . . It does *not* matter what Einstein said or proved. Masses of people don\u2019t trust it. Note that I said don\u2019t trust, not don\u2019t believe, though there are some of those too. They don\u2019t trust it because they don\u2019t trust the \u201clogical\u201d argument of it. It leaves out too much. People remember having been fooled in the past by similar arguments. They all require some assumption that might be questionable, etc. A second reason has to do with cooperation theory, and reciprocal cooperation games. If experts are trusted, they will take advantage of people. Not saying Einstein did, but he is not now alive defending this, and I think Einstein would likely by now have adopted a quantum field theory explanation. The reason I think that is that he kind of apologized in the London Times in 1919 for not having a constructive theory. Quantum field theory supposes that all excitations in quantum fields travel at the same speed. It does not matter what that speed is. But since the electromagnetic field is one of the quantum fields, it happens to be the speed of light. But it is not necessary to assume it is invariant. It is in fact not invariant if measured from an unchanging reference frame or point. But everything is made from excitations in quantum fields, including clocks and meter sticks. If you make a measurement, you are basing it on the speed things travel in quantum fields. All you can measure is a ratio of the speed you measure to the speed intrinsic to quantum fields. Therefore, no matter how the speed of quantum fields changes at your location (in gravitational fields it gets slow), you always get the same ratio. All you are doing is comparing the distance light travels, to the distance quantum excitations travel through your meter stick and clock, from one state configuration of the clock to another. If you don\u2019t change clocks, or you calibrate any new clock based on the old one, you must therefore get the same value, making local c invariant. QED. ",

            "answer_text": "For Einstein, the \u201capple that fell on his head\u201d was Michelson-Morley\u2019s observation that the speed of light was constant no matter what the relative velocity of motion. That\u2019s what set him thinking, and he had to reason out using \u201cthought experiments\u201d how it could be so, and thus came up with a new theoretical model in physics, along with the accompanying mathematics. In other words, the basic starting premise for Einstein\u2019s relativity was, \u201cLet us assume the speed of light is constant everywhere in the universe.\u201d However, Einstein does not conclusively explain why the speed of light is that universal constant, nor how it is so precisely and universally regulated. We might say, while Einstein objected to quantum mechanics, \u201cThere must be hidden variables; God does not play dice\u201d; he did not go on to explain the \u201chidden variables\u201d in his own relativity theory, either the Special or the General theories. Having raised this challenge, I would venture to offer an explanation as to how and why the speed of light is so regulated and why it is central. Namely, we propose a \u201cphysical vacuum\u201d underlying the quantum level of interaction. While the quantum wave manifests as a particle in the physical realm, the wave itself is not a physical entity, but resides and is coordinated or governed from the metaphysical realm as a rule-abiding system. \u201cTime\u201d itself is among the subjective, causal pillars of the physical realm, while residing in the metaphysical realm along with the natural laws and the physical constants. By definition, the core relational principle of time and space is centered upon the speed of light: The speed of light is defined as a constant of the value c, clocking out a precise period of time in traversing a unit of space, let us call it the \u201cPlanck length.\u201d Then Einstein\u2019s Special Theory of Relativity explains how space is distorted according to relative observers, in order that the lapse of time from one coordinate system appears differently to another, and concomitantly the measure of a unit of space is compressed, with the result that the speed of light is still the same. Likewise General Relativity explains how space is distorted by a gravitational field so that time runs slower while space is compressed. So how does that happen? A mechanism in the subjective, causal realm defines the \u201czero time line of simultaneity\u201d based on the travel geodesic of the photon through space. Then a universal clocking mechanism of absolute precision operating holographically throughout the universe defines the absolute length of a unit of time based on the interval of space covered by a photon. So these three are fundamentally and intimately linked: interval in space-time, the photon as a quantum wave marking space and time, and the universal unit of lapse of time. ",

            "answer_text": "Does Einstein's Theory of relativity explain why c is invariant, or does it just explain how it affects our views of the nature of space and time? Lorentz, Maxwell, Newton. Einstein, Planck and others, all tried to explain the same thing; but what was that thing exactly? Galilei affirmed one thing that got my attention. He said something like this: \u201cThe universe is a book written in mathematics with geometrical symbols. Without using them, it\u2019s impossible to understand the universe\u201d. Let\u2019s see if we can find, with geometric symbols, what scientists try to explain. We will use \u201ctime\u201d as our reference. According to the Big-bang theory: The first \u201cspace volume\u201d appeared as soon as all \u201cactual\u201d existing energy was manifested at the Big-bang\u2019s moment. But we don\u2019t really know what \u201cenergy\u201d is, exactly; all we know is that it results in \u201cwork\u201d being done. Nevertheless, this energy had just attained its \u201cmaximum\u201d, when the Big-bang occurred. This maximum energy resulted in a maximal \u201cwork\u201d being done, meaning that it manifested at the maximal speed, which is \u201clightspeed\u201d. This events constitutes all energy that will ever exist in our universe. It cannot be augmented nor diminished. All it can do is be transformed in another kind of energy. But most importantly, this energy is the exclusive \u201cnature\u201d of the \u201cuniversal space\u201d; in other words: the universe is simply and basically \u201cenergy\u201d. Which means that the three dimensional space is simply and exclusively \u201cenergy\u201d manifesting in all directions. Now, we have to agree that the \u201clogic\u201d, at the very base of the Big-bang notion, needs that everything starts at zero; be it energy, temperature or even time. So let\u2019s use \u201ctime\u201d starting at zero, when energy begins to accumulate until reaching its \u201cmaximum\u201d, which was manifested at the Big-bang\u2019s \u201cfirst instant\u201d, when \u201cspace\u201d appeared (which cannot be at \u201ctime = zero\u201d evidently). All this oblige us to consider the following geometric symbols:  This \u201c10*-43 sec\u201d was the \u201cinstant\u201d of the Big-bang when \u201cspace\u201d appeared. And this is how a geometric symbol describes it: 10*-43 sec after (T = 0) = Big-bang = total existing energy = lightspeed  The first \u201cspace volume\u201d appeared as soon as all actual existing energy was manifested at the Big-bang\u2019s \u201cinstant\u201d. This energy had just attained its maximum, which, naturally, manifested at a maximal speed: lightspeed. Lightspeed, timewise, equals to \u201cone present moment\u201d; and that lightspeed \u201cpresent moment\u201d represents a \u201cdistance\u201d of 10*-35 meter (it takes 10*-43 sec to travel 10*-35 meter at lightspeed). When the next \u201cpresent moment\u201d appeared, that \u201cpresent moment\u201d slid to a \u201cpast moment\u201d, and lightspeed energy, kept manifesting in \u201call directions\u201d producing additional \u201cspace volumes\u201d:  We have, here, already the answer to the question asked: The red arrows represents \u201cc\u201d (lightspeed); and we can see by comparing both drawings that \u201cc\u201d is an \u201cinvariant\u201d since, being surrounded by \u201cnothingness\u201d, it never encounters any \u201cobstruction\u201d to its manifesting \u201cwork\u201d. As for the \u201cspace volume\u201d, they are nothing more than \u201cdistances\u201d of motion in all directions; in other words, they are simply outward oriented \u201cenergy\u201d; which cannot be \u201cmatter\u201d or \u201cmass\u201d since mass-energy provokes an orientation towards a \u201ccenter point of gravity\u201d instead of towards all directions. This also means that \u201cmass-energy\u201d hadn\u2019t appear yet. So, yes, \u201cc\u201d is an invariant. But these \u201cgeometric symbols\u201d of the \u201cuniversal book\u201d, tell us much more than that: 1: It tells us that \u201cspace\u201d doesn\u2019t expand by a factor of \u201c2\u201d, but by a factor of \u201c3\u201d; which makes the metrics of a \u201cgravitational field\u201d a lot greater than expected, and, that the \u201cinverse square law\u201d possesses a factor too \u201csmall\u201d to be applied to a \u201cgravitational field\u201d. This explains why stars having the same \u201corbiting\u201d velocity spread in a larger \u201ccorridor\u201d around the center of a galaxy, without the need of \u201cdark matter\u201d. While the increasing \u201cproduction\u201d of basic space volume, always at the \u201cinvariant\u201d lightspeed, is explained without the need of additional \u201cdark energy\u201d. 2: It also makes us see that, even if the basic space volume of 10*-35 meter represents \u201ctime-wise\u201d, an interval of 10*-43 sec; \u201cspace-wise\u201d it doesn\u2019t. Because, as we see on the drawing, the first \u201cpresent moment\u201d of 10*-43 sec equals ONE basic volume, while the second \u201cinterval\u201d is represented by THREE basic volumes; and the third interval would be represented by NINE basic volumes. Even though, the total universe is always a single \u201cunit\u201d standing at a constant \u201cpresent moment\u201d, because it is animated with \u201clightspeed\u201d that \u201cfreezes\u201d time. 3: Another thing that is shown, is that all basic space volumes are \u201cpunctual points\u201d making each of them, a \u201ccenter point\u201d; which means that \u201cspace\u201d is composed of \u201ccenters\u201d. And that explains why an observer always stands at the center of \u201cuniversal time\u201d (and \u201cspace\u201d) seeing the \u201cpast\u201d all around him whatever the direction he looks. 4: It also explains that when the universe was 13 billion years old, its observable diameter, possible to be \u201cseen\u201d by an observer, was 26 billion years (time), while its total diameter was 78 billion lightyears \u201cspace\u201d. Galileo Galilei really possessed a great scientific mind. ",

            "answer_text": "In a broad sweeping way that glosses over much detail, invariant c is the axiom of SR as no explanation is in it. Then GR comes along next decade and says, well, gravitational fields do more than just keep us on the ground and moons and planets in orbit, they affect the paths of all objects moving in those fields, even light (EMR, photons). So c is not absolutely invariant in that context. There is gravitational red shift, of course, in which the frequency varies depending on vector relative to field center, and there is some support that even c the great invariant, is not absolutely invariant. But more interesting (for me) is the end of your question, how all these descriptions emanating from the general discourse of physics and cosmology, affects our views of the nature of space and time. There seems to be two views to be affected by these descriptions: space and time (spacetime) are tangible \u201cthings\u201d with a flexible malleable geometry, somewhat resembling a chunk of latex rubber under stress forces, and, spacetime is a mathematical device. I might go even further and say that spacetime is a talking point in GR; the field equations do all the heavy lifting, and there\u2019s no \u201cspacetime\u201d in these equations, just spacetime metrics, aka dimensions. There\u2019s a good reason why they are called \u201cfield equations\u201d and not \u201cspacetime equations\u201d. GR explains that mass generates gravitational fields, those fields have energy, that energy exerts a kind of pressure on objects moving in those fields. The effect is on the rate of actions occurring in the field. One action is spatial displacement (motion). The field is strongest at the surface of the agglomeration of mass generating the field. Below the surface and the field gets weaker as there is less and less mass below and more and more mass above. Above the surface, the field weakens by the square of the distance. These differences in the strength of the field is a pressure gradient; a mass object moving in that field has a side which is closer to the center of the field and a side further from the center. The greater the pressure, the slower the rate of action (motion), and it is this difference in time across the solid mass which steers the object into following what GR calls Riemannian geodesics. Geodesics appear curved to us observers because of the manner in which we visualize space, in Euclidean terms of flatness and straightness. It isn\u2019t spacetime which is curved; it\u2019s the paths of object moving in g-fields which are curved, steered by the time differential. Something similar occurs with EMR, but on a vastly different scale because EMR has no mass, only velocity and kinetic energy (momentum). Thus the geometry of the geodesics they follow is different than for mass objects, except perhaps in the extreme conditions of being close to a collapsed neutron star, then, according to what we\u2019ve gleaned about those cosmic entities (so-called \u201cblack holes\u201d) the gravity within the event horizon will make even EMR follow an orbit-like geodesic.

            "answer_text": "Most explanations of SR follow Einstein in giving a top-down derivation that treats the invariance of c as an axiom. But once you have the whole picture, a bottom-up explanation is available as well. It\u2019s basically a combination of two things: To a first approximation, the speed of light is c in every frame SR because by procrustean methods you force it to be c. Every measurement frame in SR is laid out using Einstein synchronisation, which, give or take some interesting fine print, is tantamount to futzing with the synchronization of clocks until the one-way speed of light measured with those clocks comes out to be c. The fine print is that all ES does directly is to make the speed of light equal in any pair of opposite directions, say \u00b1x. So if you try this stunt in a non-relativistic universe and you have an aether frame where light travels at \u00b1c and you were expecting the velocities in a frame moving past at v to be +c-v and -c-v per the Galilean transformation, then ES will give a speed of [math]\\mathrm{avg}(|+c-v|,|-c-v|)[/math]. And I write it that way because there\u2019s a trick: the correct average for speeds is not [math]\\mathrm{avg}(a,b)=(a+b)/2 \\rightarrow (|+c-v|+|-c-v|)/2=((c-v)+(c+v))/2=c[/math]. Rather it\u2019s [math]\\mathrm{avg}(a,b) = 2/(1/a+1/b) \\rightarrow c(1-v^2/c^2)[/math]. That\u2019s because in a round-trip measurement, it\u2019s the different times that add, and the time is in the denominator of the velocity ([math]v=x/t[/math]). Intuitively, if the frame is moving at c, light will take infinite time on the upstream leg, so the average round-trip velocity will be 0. Now - spoiler alert - that [math]1-v^2/c^2[/math] factor is the inverse square of the Lorentz factor, [math]\\gamma(v)=1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}[/math]. That is, if you try this stunt in a non-relativistic universe and a non-aether frame, you can make the two-way speed of light close to c, but you can\u2019t make it exactly c - it will be slower by the LF squared. Actually it will be slower by up to the LF squared, depending on direction. For a transverse round-trip it will be slower by just one LF. And this is what the famous Michelson\u2013Morley experiment - Wikipedia was looking for: it\u2019s basically a comparison of the round-trip times in two arms at right-angles, and was hoping to see the difference between LF and LF^2. Notoriously however it didn\u2019t see anything. So there must be new physics. Lorentz\u2019s suggestion, which Einstein incorporated, is that the apparatus length contracts by LF in the longitudinal direction, cancelling half of the LF^2. And the other LF turns out to go away for both arms because any and all clocks in relativity are time dilated by one LF. (The MM experiment is deliberately insensitive to this, but you can confirm it with other experiments.) So forcing the speed of light to be the same in each direction by futzing with clocks is not as stupid as it sounds at first because Nature supplies the extra physics to mop up the discrepancies that you\u2019d otherwise expect.

            "answer_text": "First, Maxwell recognized from his equations of electrodynamics (which have proved themselves to be consistent with all classical electric, magnetic and electromagnetic wave phenomena) that light is electromagnetic wave that travels with a velocity c =3.00x 10^8 m/s in vacuum. Then, Lorentz discovered that Maxwell\u2019s equations of electrodynamics remain invariant (or, do not change at all) if space and time coordinates are changed in a specific way when described from two different coordinate frames that move with a constant relative velocity v between them. Finally, Einstein was the first to see that Lorentz\u2019s transformation had a deep significance \u2014 it implied that the velocity of light in vacuum, c, must be a constant of nature and that space and time are not independent immutable absolutes but depend on one another. For example, \u2018now\u2019 here is not \u2018now\u2019 everywhere. His (special) theory of relativity is based on two axioms, one, that the laws of physics must look the same (be \u2018covariant\u2019) in all coordinate frames moving with a constant velocity v relative to one another, and two, that the velocity of light in vacuum, c, is a constant independent of the velocity of its (light\u2019s) source. It\u2019s predictions and explanations of physical phenomena have been validated in innumerable experiments without exception (barring gravitation, the domain of the general theory of relativity) since its inception more that a century ago. This is briefly why the constancy of the velocity of light c is both a postulate in the theory of relativity as well as an observed fact that changed our common sense view of the mutually independent and absolute space and time of Newtonian physics and explained their mutual dependency. [The general theory of relativity or gravitation affects this departure of the \u2018common sense\u2019 view of the absolute nature of space and time, even further.] ",

            "answer_text": "The question is, why wouldn\u2019t it be. To quote Einstein from his little book from Princeton University Press, The Meaning of Relativity, \u201cThe speed of light is something we know best about\u201d. Einstein wondered, when looking at Maxwell\u2019s Equations of Electromagnetism; what was the speed of light in these wave equations relative to? Some absolute rest frame? Was there such a thing as an absolutely stationary frame of reference in a void? How would you measure it or determine it with nothing there to compare it\u2019s (or your) motion to? All you could know is whether you are at rest relative to the ground, the earth, or if in a satellite; possibly that of the sun or distant visible stars. That\u2019s not ABSOLUTE rest, it\u2019s still a rest relative to something else. But our solar system too moves relative to the center of our galaxy; or the movement of our galaxy relative to our super cluster or to some vast galactic centre for a collection of neighbouring galaxies\u2026..and so on. There\u2019s no way to pin down some absolute rest frame. It is interesting to note that the Maxwell equations do not obey the old Newtonian or Galilean ideas of relativity; relative motion and absolute passage of time. Lorentz first picked up on this but his ideas, though yielding correct transformation equations between inertial observers, were wrong. Einstein arrived at the same transformation equations just from the constancy of the speed of light and that all observers must agree on the laws of physics; after all, we all occupy the same objective universe. So Einstein stated that such an absolute frame could not exist as it could not be measured. He then, therefore, dispensed immediately with this notion of a luminiferous aether. Why have a \u2018fluid\u2019 that, as Einstein stated, \u201c\u2026acts on but cannot be acted upon..\u201d, this aether demanding itself to be the contender for this \u2018absolute rest\u2019 frame yet it cannot be measured? If it existed, it would have to be at variance with the fundamental ideas of cause and effect or forces and reactions as so splendidly stated by Newton earlier; for it can have only an effect yet no cause; an action yet offer no reaction. Therefore, since light, at least, travels through a vacuum, it cannot have it\u2019s speed measured in relation to some third party; namely an absolute rest frame; only by some party involved in doing the observation on the speed of light at that moment, namely US! So without an absolute rest frame, there\u2019s no frame that the speed \u2018C\u2019 has it\u2019s particular value for over and above any other frame of reference, again - for instance; there\u2019s just US! The right conclusion then MUST BE that the speed of light should be the same for any (or ALL) observers then. I think that is Einstein\u2019s reasoning as best I\u2019ve been able to glean it. This is just a personal reflection though. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, c is not invariant. The theory of relativity doesn't explain why c is invariant. It's built on the postulate that light speed is a constant. Let me give you a simple analogy. Car A is traveling at 50 km/h, while car B is traveling at 60 km/h. Now we can say that in 3 hours, car A travels 150 km and car B travels 180 km. Or, we can say that car A takes 6 hours to travel 300 km and car B takes 5 hours to travel 300 km. Both statements are true. The difference is that in the first example we make time a constant and in the second case we make distance a constant. Note, it doesn't mean that time is constant. It doesn't prove that time is constant. Einstein created a theory involving 3 variables and made one of them a constant. He chose, \u201cthe speed of light\u201d. Personally, I would have made \u201cdistance\u201d a constant and the \u201cspeed of light\u201d relative, but that's just me. Why do things the easy way? If time is relative, it follows that speed is relative. You need a common denominator to calculate distance travelled with non-invariant temporal velocity. Something which is a universal constant. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it does not. The invariance of the vacuum speed of light follows from Maxwell\u2019s equations, if one assumes that the physical properties of the vacuum (its electric permittivity and magnetic permeability) do not depend on the speed of the observer. Special relativity elevates this concept to a postulate, and alters our understanding of space and time as a consequence. In the modern viewpoint, though relativity theory is taken to be extremely thoroughly confirmed through a large variety of experiments and observations (both relativity theory itself and theories derived from, or relying on it) it is not taken for granted that light actually travels at the invariant speed of special relativity, i.e., what we call the vacuum speed of light. There is, after all, a perfectly sensible field theory alternative to Maxwell\u2019s, Proca theory, otherwise known as massive electromagnetism, in which light always travels slower than the invariant speed. So whether or not electromagnetism is truly massless now becomes a question subject to observational verification. This includes both laboratory tests and astrophysical/astronomical observations that place ever more stringent upper limits on what the maximum rest mass of a photon can be. These limits are very small, so it is generally assumed that the photon is truly massless but, as I said, it is not taken for granted.  I thank my generous supporters on Patreon.

The way Einstein formulated his 1905 paper, the invariance of c was stipulated as a postulate: so, an assumption. (That postulate was \u201cinspired\u201d by Maxwell\u2019s equations of electromagnetism [EM].) However, the geometric formulation of Special Relativity (SR), inspired by Minkowski\u2019s reformulation (and General Relativity [GR], since SR is really a special, rigidly flat case of GR) yields an invariant speed, without any postulate beyond the scalar-product with one eigenvalue of the opposite sign of the other three. This matches SR, with only a choice of units bringing this invariant speed to be \u201cc\u201d. From this formulation, it is straightforward to derive a U(1) field that matches EM. (It\u2019s not like this is any sort of \u201crevelation\u201d. Such has been known for a very long time, from SR.) Yes. This is but a reformulation of SR and EM. Nothing truly new.

This was a huge number and Maxwell rightly concluded that it was velocity of light in vacuum. Now the question: Velocity relative to what? It was thought that it is relative to an invisible fluid called Ether which filled space. Many attempts were made to determine the properties of Ether, but were unsuccessful. The most famous experiment was Michelson-Morley experiment, which proved beyond doubt that there was no effect of Ether or rather existence of Ether was not possible. In the explanation of this, Einstein made a simple assumption that c is an absolute constant. Lo and behold, a highly logical theory with rock solid consistency was born. So absolute is this constant, that the addition of velocities v1, v2 in relativity is given by the equation V = v1+v2/(1+ v1v2/c^2) So, if we want to compute relative velocity of two photons, it is c+c/(1+c^2/c^2) = c. Which means, if you could ride a photon trying to chase a photon, you won't catch it. It would run away from you with a velocity of c! (As I am only a layman, there could be gaps, but I hope I haven't made a conceptual mistake) ",

You never will get an answer, any kind of answer, from the entire Mathematical Establishment because Math is not the tool to decode such qualitative issues. The other reason no mathematician coming out of college can answer these types of questions is that they have all gone through the same grinding machine in which everything was simulated with particles. Even their beloved transverse waves imply the vibration of particles. But if particles and/or waves can only travel one-way, what prevents these particles or waves from traveling faster? Why is little c a constant? If, instead, we model light with a twined, rope-like architecture, we can readily visualize why light always \u2018travels\u2019 at the same speed. All we have to do is invoke the wave equation: c = \u0192 \u03bb. If you increase the frequency (\u0192), wavelength (\u03bb) must invariably come down for little c to remain constant.  Now imagine a train that shines its headlights up ahead. Why shouldn\u2019t you add the speed of the train to the speed of light? Under the particle/transverse wave hypothesis, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason not to. This is cannonball physics; straight forward. If the cannon is moving forward and shoots the iron ball, the castle wall will receive the impact of not just the speed of the ball caused by the explosion, but of the movement that the cannon added to it. There should be no discussion on this issue among those in the know. With the Rope Model of light, the atom moves forward and reels in the threads as it expands and contracts (start at 4:40). The speed of torsion is unperturbed by the motion of the atom. The EM rope merely exchanges number of links (frequency) for link length (wavelength). ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum field theory explains it best. Michelson-Morley couldn\u2019t find the luminous aether. The unwitting assumption that caused this result to be so confusing was the assumption that we are stuff in space. Lorenz proposed that the solution was that space was contracting as part of the motion through the aether (why?). Einstein further deduced that time must also be a variable in order for c to be constant for an observer, probably best understood by the analogy of the light clock. QFT helps explain why in more detail. According to QFT, we are the aether AKA field. Stuff is vibrations of the field, either static or in motion. As an object made of the field goes faster within it, the object shrinks, just as the waves of sound get closer and closer together with increasing speed, ultimately becoming flat at the point of reaching the speed of sound. The movement of the object causes it\u2019s observation of time and space to change, whereby c is measured to be a constant. See \u201cFields of color\u201d for more information.   ",

            "answer_text": "Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity started with his Time Dilation which was incomplete and has given the public the wrong idea about time slowing down if you travel fast: Maxwell said that the observed speed of light is the same independent of the speed of the observer. Maxwell was wrong. Newton said that the observed speed of light depends on the speed of the observer. Newton was right. Einstein said: If I make time go slower when you go faster I can fix so that both Maxwell and Newton are right, (as long as observer and light travel in the same direction). Einstein called it Time Dilation. However, he left out the fact that he would have to make time go faster when observer and light travel in opposite directions, etc. Einstein went on to propose spacetime based on his time dilation claiming to explain Gravity in a circular argument. We know today that gravity is caused by net Coulomb force between particles and bodies containing electric charge. Gravity is consequently not a quality of spacetime or space itself. The Standard Model of Physics does not include or endorse Time Dilation, Spacetime, Spacetime gravity, Special Relativity or General Relativity. There are ways to properly use time dilation instead of accounting for the speed of the observer, but there is nothing gained by it. As presently presented to the public time dilation and spacetime is a hoax, and proper use of relativity is of questionable value over conventional methods. ",

This makes it a possible way of unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity. That said the speed of light is 1 Planck length per Planck time. The perception of these mineral units would be relative to the individual observer and thereby explain why c is invariant. In other words, so yeah when digital physics is combined with Special and General Relativity you get a nice natural reason for the invariance of c. ",

They also don\u2019t address the regulating mechanism for the finite speed of light or even the reference frame of light\u2019s motion. Special relativity declared the electromagnetic field its own frame of reference and its own medium of propagation so the speed of light is the same to all observers. This was done in order to explain why there is no faster than light speed. Otherwise two light beams traveling in opposite directions would exceed the speed of light compared to each other and that would be against experimental measurements and a big conceptual and causality problem in physics. We still conceive light moving through vacuum so this self-regulating and self-referenced model of light is necessary even though it is very unscientific. How can something be its own frame of reference and its own regulating mechanism? QFT in the 1950\u2019s provided a much better scientific model, but has been greatly ignored. Sad! ",

In 1910 Vladimir Ignatowski explained why there is an invariant speed in our universe. Ignatowski showed that in any universe in which the concept of constant relative velocity makes sense there exists a unique invariant limiting speed governing such motions, with relative coordinates given uniquely by the Lorentz transformations. To make the L.T.\u2019s unique Ignatowski also required the transformations introduce no inhomogeneity or anisotropy apart from that entailed by the directions of relative motion. The result is purely kinematic: inertia doesn\u2019t come into it, much less the laws of physics. None of Einstein\u2019s postulates were required! The limiting speed might differ between universes: could be infinite (Galilean universe) or even imaginary in some. Nobody at the time seems to have appreciated what Ignatowski had accomplished. ",

Taking this into account, Einstein\u2019t argument shows that all speeds are really just fractions of c, and that c is indeed invariant. c is invariant because it can only be a fraction = 1 of itself.

The Speed of Light marks the refresh rate, and Time is a datapoint on the Control Track. Gravity is an effect of drag of the spinning subatomic particles on the remaining dormant \u201cDark Matter\u201d subatomic particles surrounding it.

Second postulate (invariance of c) As measured in any inertial frame of reference, light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c that is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.
