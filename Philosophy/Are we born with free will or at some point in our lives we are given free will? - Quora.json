            "answer_text": "We are born with free will, but it is not infinite. Our will is limited by physics, our environment, our abilities, etc. I may have the will to defy gravity, but gravity will always win. I may have the will to be an opera star, but if I am tone deaf, I\u2019ll starve. Free will just means we are able to make choices within certain boundaries. Even when we can exercise our free will, we cannot always control the consequences\u2014good or bad\u2014of our choices. I disagree that the existence of an omniscient God negates our free will. It is not true that \u201cwhere there is foreknowledge, there can be no free will.\u201d It could just as easily be argued that \u201cif there are no \u2018do-overs\u2019, there is no free will.\u201d If we are \u201cstuck\u201d with our choices, the future simply becomes the past that hasn\u2019t happened yet! It also doesn\u2019t matter what you \u201cbelieve\u201d. I submit that if free will exists, it exists whether you believe it does or not; conversely, if it doesn\u2019t exist, it doesn\u2019t matter if you believe it does. Regardless, everyone lives as though it does exist! I had an atheist/Objectivist friend once and we were discussing free will. I asked him if the mind was the same as the brain or were they separate. He was adamant that they were the same; to accept a mind apart from a physical brain would be tantamount to admitting that \u201csomething\u201d existed outside the physical realm. Heresy! Ayn Rand would roll over in her grave! So I asked him about our actions, our choices. He said that \u201cevery action is preceded by a thought (except for the autonomous nervous system, of course). If I move my hand, it is because my mind is telling it to move. Signals are being sent from my brain through my nerves down my arm to my hand and it moves.\u201d \u201cAwesome! So what causes the thought?\u201d \u201cA series of neurochemical reactions in the brain; like a chain reaction.\u201d* \u201cSo, it\u2019s like dominoes.\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cSo, your \u2018will\u2019 pushes the \u2018first\u2019 domino?\u201d \u201cUhh\u2026yes\u2026\u201d \u201cThen your \u2018will\u2019 is just another domino. If it\u2019s all a purely physical construct, there are simply an infinite number of dominoes, but your SELF, your WILL doesn\u2019t exist in infinity. Your will must exist outside the physical or it\u2019s just another stage in the neurochemical reaction that \u2018causes\u2019 your choices, which are not really choices because you can\u2019t be causing them. Your like a machine, a computer.\u201d \u201cWell, I guess so\u2026\u201d \u201cThen there is no free will.\u201d The next day, I saw him. He said that he had to change his mind, that he was not just a machine or a computer, but\u2026he would have to think about it before he could come up with a better solution. (\u201cEvery thought you have causes neurochemical changes\u2026\u201d How Your Thoughts Change Your Brain, Cells, And Genes - The Best Brain Possible, my reference, not his. If it is a thought that causes the neurochemical change, then the thought must occur outside that physical process! As to the question, What comes first, the neurochemical event or the thought, the theories are all over the map!) ",

            "answer_text": "There are reasonable arguments to be made that there is no free will at all, so the concept of when we get it seems secondary. I\u2019ve given this much thought, and although I can find no evidence to refute determinism (the idea of no free will), I still believe we have it (just because I can't prove it doesn't mean it\u2019s not true). If we accept that adult humans have free will, at what point do we accept it in other living beings? Do dogs have free will, do ants, do amoebas, do plants? Is an autonomous response free will (I\u2019d say no), but there\u2019s a wide range of varying degrees between a single cell and an adult human. We might try to tie free will to self awareness; I think one could make a reasonable argument for that, but we still end-up on the same slippery slope. Getting back to the question of whether we (humans) are born with free will, my guess would be\u2014yes, we do have free will (of sorts) at birth, but where along the path from conception to birth it is obtained is a much more-difficult question.

            "answer_text": "\u201cFree will\u201d is a narrative, a conceptualisation of a perceived experience that doesn\u2019t really match the phenomena it describes, as it relies on the assumption that our \u201cself\u201d is somehow separate from our physical bodies. As perceived realities go, it\u2019s not a bad analogy, but analogies are only good for basic description and not for argument or seeking deeper truths. A better word to use is \u201cagency\u201d, and yes, we are born with it. When a baby is hungry and cries out for attention, that is an act of agency, even if the baby isn\u2019t fully aware of what it\u2019s doing or what it hopes to achieve in doing so. As the brain develops, a child will naturally become more aware of what actions have what effects, and can therefore experience the sensation of \u201cchoosing\u201d an action to attain a desired result, but at a biological level this is merely a more sophisticated version of the agency already exercised from day one.

            "answer_text": "New born babies are 100% feeling creatures who respond to need, and by and large, mothers are keen to satisfy those needs. But then the baby gets a bit older and eventually learns to crawl, and the first thing it does is to make its way to the wall and rip out the speaker wires that you have so painstakingly nailed to the skirting board. The child then makes it way into your library and proceeds to pull out all of the books from their shelves. Next, it will open the drawers of your desk and remove all the items. If you try to outwit it by securing restraints, the child will do its upmost to circumvent this by pulling on the drawers even harder. Now, some parents are overjoyed with all of this and say things like: \u2018oooh look, our little Johnny\u2019s such a naughty boy,\u2019 and basically let the kid destroy everything in the house. This child undoubtedly has free will. However, other parents are not so forgiving, and they will find ways to curb Junior\u2019s enthusiasm that restricts its movement and freedom of expression, and with it a loss of free will because the child soon learns there are things he mustn\u2019t do. Thus, the process of growing up is the extent to which freedom of expression is inhibited or curtailed \u2013 which I think is a better term than free will, and this applies equally to the things we think as well as what we are permitted to do.

            "answer_text": "\u201cFree will\u201d is an interesting idea, and it depends on what you believe. If you believe in God (the monotheistic kind), there is no free will. The all-powerful being knew everything you would do before it created you. If you believe in a deterministic universe, there is no free will. Everything happens due to processes that occurred before that action was taken. It does have the semblance of free will, such that unless you know the exact state of every particle in the universe exactly as it burst into existence, you can\u2019t know the future 100% (but it is technically possible). If you don\u2019t believe in a deterministic universe, and also don\u2019t believe in an omnipotent god, then you have free will. Things that happened in the past don\u2019t 100% determine the future, so you\u2019re good to go. Hope this helped :) Oh, almost forgot\u2014regardless of your belief, whether or not you have free will does not depend on any action you take, so the answer to your question would be \u201cborn with it\u201d.

Being, consciousness, and love are life ingredients, which, all together, make up our constitution or essence. Life is innocent and free, but \u2018the gods\u2019 instilled a seed of egoity in us so that there could be a performance, a play.

With respect to the Judaeo-Christian God, what does free will mean? It means simply this: do you align your will with God\u2019s or not? What does it mean to align one\u2019s will to God\u2019s? It means to act in a loving way to others; putting other\u2019s needs before your own. That\u2019s all. You\u2019re free to disagree. ",
