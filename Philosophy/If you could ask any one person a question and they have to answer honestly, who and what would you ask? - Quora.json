            "answer_text": "Surely the receiver of this question has to be someone whom you consider to be close or (and) important for you. For me it would me my mother. My mother and father are really good people. He has been working for twenty years, and is still working 1000 km away from his home, in a different country, doing hard physical work to manage the supply of my mother and two of his sons - me and my 1,5 years younger brother with everything we need. Dad has been always wanting us to live decent lives and avoid same fate as he had got - a fate of a worker, lower class, dirty, always tired, with no other choice but breaking a sweat while working. He loves my mother and us with all his big heart. 20 years ago my mother has given up her job to give me and my brother the best care we could get. She was teaching us before we went to school, she was helping to solve our problems, she was cooking the best cookies one could probably taste, she was maintaining the household like a master. She is the best caring mother you can imagine. She sincerely loved and loves my father. They were meeting only for few weeks three times a year, twenty consecutive years, in the vacations times of my father, when he was coming back home, bringing lots of presents. They were trying hard to raise up smart, polite and moral kids. They have sacrificed their family life for us, and I don't know what more can a parent give to a child. My mom sincerely loves me and my brother. I have spent all my childhood with mother, almost not seeing my dad. And the more years of my life were left behind - the more opened eyes I was getting. I started to think that I am the favourite kid. My needs were satisfied prior to the needs of my brother. The things which later would belong to me were chosen more selectively, my issues and supply usually costed more money for my parents than my brother's. Often he would get some of my old clothes as we were growing up, though it was common in the early 2000s in the post-Soviet space. \u201cWe will buy him smth later, he doesn't need to renew his wardrobe now, YOU do\u201d - said my mother, replying to my question. I have asked why was she not looking for anything for him, but solely for me. Once I want to face my mother and look in her eyes, demanding an answer on a question which is an answer for this question. \u201cMom, do you love me more than my brother?\u201d .. \u201cI love you both equally, sonny. There is no inequality between you\u201d - she said to me once. She left me alone immediately after saying these words. I regretfully did not believe her. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d take the liberty of assuming that the person in question here can be mythical/fictional: I\u2019d call upon the spiritual being that people believe to be the creator of our universe, the God himself. Known by many names which separates us humans into different religions each one having its own hubris. I\u2019ll call upon anyone among them : Vishnu- The Preserver, the savior of mankind Lord Jesus Christ, the mighty Sun God Ra, the All-Father Odin or The Seven Gods of Westeros. I know I can ask them a question which can benefit all mankind. Spread the knowledge gained and become the new age Messiah. \u201cHow to achieve peace on Earth?\u201d \u201cIs there another habitable planet for us to leech off of after we are done sucking the life out of this?\u201d \u201cHow many horcruxes have Donald Trump made of himself and where to find them?\u201d But I will choose to ask the one question which unites the humanity like nothing else. The question that has been plaguing us since all eternity: \u201cWhat came first, the egg or the chicken?\u201d And then maybe, just maybe we all can die in peace. ",
