            "answer_text": "Boredom is a term that often gets thrown around a lot. It describes the feeling of not doing anything productive. The opposite of bored is busy. Busy means you\u2019re either doing something at the moment or you need an excuse to not do something else. Boredom is not necessarily a problem although it is not recommended. Boredom can lead to depression and we all know how fun that is. If your feeling bored all the time it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re doing something you don\u2019t enjoy. Or doing the same thing to much times. If you\u2019re bored your entire life it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not called boredom it means you have to change some things around. ",

We as a spieces should\u2019ve been wiser to internal healing and structure but we cared more for external bindings. Try hiking with a big group in a lush national forest, get into exploring the earth on foot WITH PEOPLE for security. It\u2019ll help with the bordem feeling ",
