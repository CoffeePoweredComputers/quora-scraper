            "answer_text": "One reason that both Jean-Paul Sartre and Friedrich Nietzsche are known today as existentialist writers is that their philosophies of how we ought to live our lives share some important characteristics. Both reject the way in traditional morality is founded on rationality, and the way in which it attempts to universalise a code of conduct. They both decry our blind acceptance of social mores, and champion personal choice, subjectivity, and responsibility. I will argue that the concept which unites these similarities is authenticity?the process of taking responsibility for oneself by engaging in a project of self-creation?and that although their moral philosophy starts from this common point, their positions ultimately diverge and the acceptability of their theories of morality ultimately falter. Although Nietzsche called himself an ?immoralist?,[1] his critique of morality is effectively directed to the existence of an universal morality. His argument is that an absolute morality forces values on everyone in a society which advance the interests only of one group of people and which for the remainder are ?life denying?. He holds that the traditional distinction between good and evil has arisen from the perspective of a group he calls the ?slaves?, and insists that, like everything else, morality is ?conditioned by perspective?.[2] He protests against the negative way in which traditional codes of conduct are framed, and the way in which they promote ascetic values like sin, humility, and self-denial. The starting point of Nietzsche?s morality is thus essentially negative?it is based on the errors he thinks have contaminated traditional thinking about morality, and on his diagnosis of the state of European society. Sartre?s morality is also negative in the sense that it is concerned with bad faith, a problem which he sees as arising unavoidably from his ontology. For Sartre, our consciousness gives us the ability to be aware of not only how things are but how they are not, which allows us the freedom to be able to create a world which is different from the one we see before us. This, in turn, gives us absolute responsibility over the choices we make?a responsibility which leads to anguish and which we repeatedly try to avoid by, in ?bad faith?, deceiving ourselves about the extent of our freedom. Both philosophers thus developed at length explanations for how and why we fail to be authentic: Sartre?s ontology is used to explain the appeal of bad faith, while Nietzsche?s genealogy of morals describes how our subscription to ?slave morality? came about and how it has been self-perpetuating. Both of these explanations hinge on the idea that human beings are evading responsibility: for Sartre, the evasion is from absolute freedom which is a necessary state of existence; for Nietzsche, we hide our passions, our will to live and our will to power from ourselves by invoking God and traditional morality.[3] It is thus vital for both philosophers to tell us how it is possible to live an authentic life?bad faith and slave morality must be overcome. It is on this question that the views of the philosophers most clearly diverge; yet, as we will see, in the end their answers suffer very similar problems. Nietzsche?s answer is that the ?highest specimens? should reject slave morality and engage in a project of artistic self-creation. By living our lives as a work of art, embracing the individual and the natural rather than the artificial, and by rejecting the ascetic ideals such as equality sin, guilt, and evil, we can come close to recognising the ideal of Nietzsche?s Ubermensch. Nietzsche calls this approach ?naturalism in morality?,[4] and it involves affirming an ?instinct of life? that has hitherto been inhibited by traditional slave morality. Sartre?s answer is that we can live an authentic life by assuming responsibility for ourselves and acting in full recognition of our freedom. Additionally, because bad faith can involve denying both our facticity and our transcendence, we must simultaneously acknowledge responsibility for what we have done and recognise that we are free to change the pattern.[5] These various aspects of authenticity are best summed up when Sartre writes that we ?must assume the situation with the proud consciousness of being the author of it?.[6] It is clear that both writers place special emphasis on the process of self-creation. They both hold that taking responsibility for our lives is a crucial step on the route to authenticity, and that on the way we must reject the role played by external influences. Some passages in Sartre seem to echo Nietzsche?s declaration that we must invent our own values through a process of independent self-creation: ?This is my way? For the way ? that does not exist?.[7] The fact that Nietzsche?s Ubermensch is a man who actively chooses values in a very Sartrean way is captured perfectly in two remarks made by the character of Roquentin in Sartre?s Nausea. On the same page in the book, he asks, ?What summits would I not reach if my own life were the subject of the melody??, revealing the importance to Sartre of living life as a work of art, and declares ?To live it all over again, in the same circumstances, from beginning to end??a clear allusion to Nietzsche?s eternal return. Sartre would no doubt endorse the Nietzsche?s claim in The Birth of Tragedy that we are ?veiled? by our blind acceptance of social dogma, and that we can only ever be authentic by engaging in a perpetual process of creating our own values and crafting our own perspectives.

Sartre can be simply described by the maxim \u201cexistence precedes essence,\u201d which means there is no absolute destination and that where we ends up is a result of the choices we make. Nietzsche similarly dismisses objective values and transcendence, which is why he is viewed as a nihilist. However, his \u201csuperman\u201d is able to create new morals by how he chooses to will his power. ",

One major difference between Nietzsche and Sartre is that Nietzsche heavily criticized communism as something to be avoided, but Sartre, on the other hand, considered Marxism as an inescapable horizon from which post-modern thought must proceed.
