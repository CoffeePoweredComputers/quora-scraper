            "answer_text": "As an amateur philosopher I am constantly asking people why they believe what they believe and if they have reasons for those beliefs. I want to investigate across history and find parallels. Most people do not look or think deeply about complexities, contradictions and unintended consequences. I am motivated always to do this. It has given me insights that I try to share through my writing, and it often works. Philosophy is like applying logic to history. So beyond the present moment, you find the reasons for different motivations across time. This helps you clearly ask and sometimes answer \u2018what were they thinking?\u2019. These are the first questions that people ask when something goes horribly wrong. Philosophy helps answer that question. ",

On the other hand, however, it helps understand in-depth, the interpretations, the essence of the delicate subjects, including religious texts, etc. like any other subject, philosophy has its limitations.
