            "answer_text": "Part of my job is identifying good history podcasts, so I listen to a LOT and most of the ones I really like are ones that are up and coming, but here are the ones that have kept me listening past the first few episodes: Dan Carlin is amazing, his Hardcore History is definitely a must-listen. The Exploress. It\u2019s women\u2019s history and the host is snarky and amazing. I love her. Her sources are excellent. She is in the middle of her second season right now, and I\u2019ve learned a lot from her. History on Fire is great as well if you can handle the Italian accent. He\u2019s a good friend of Dan Carlin and they work together on this podcast. I\u2019ve only just started listening to it, but I\u2019m very impressed with his work so far and have been binging. History Goes Bump is a good one if you like ghost stories and History. The hosts are engaging and funny, and I\u2019ve enjoyed learning from them. Revolutions is fantastic. I think it\u2019s very well-researched and the delivery is fantastic as well. Shaping Opinion is technically not a straight up history podcast, but it\u2019s excellent and he talks a lot about different people and events who have shaped our world. He has a lot of great guests on there to talk about all kinds of different things. History Unplugged is great as well. Scott has a broad range of knowledge and the style of his show is interesting. He has one episode a week where listeners call in with their questions and he answers them, and then a second episode where he interviews historians or other experts about certain historical topics. History Unfiltered has episode topics all over the place, but they all are fun to listen to. Things from what does Neopolitan Ice Cream have to do with Neopolean? or What Atalantis a real place? All kinds of cool topics. I\u2019ve only listened to a few of theirs, but the ones I\u2019ve listened to I\u2019ve liked. Notorious Narratives is a newer one for me, but I\u2019ve enjoyed listening to it. They find the weird stories and peculiar people that most historians don\u2019t really talk about too much and go in depth with those. I think that they do an excellent job of it and they\u2019re funny too. But my favorite one is History That Doesn\u2019t Suck. It\u2019s American History told using stories and Greg is super engaging and can draw people in really well. He likes working pop culture references into the show when he can, which I appreciate. He makes American History less dry. I have found that most people I talk to find it extremely boring, and I\u2019m even one of those people, but, I started listening to this and I realized that it wasn\u2019t the history that I thought was boring, it was the people who were talking about it weren\u2019t doing it in an engaging way. That\u2019s the list I can think of off the top of my head. I prefer the smaller podcasts to the big ones (with the exception of Dan Carlin) because I feel like they\u2019re more inviting and focus more on the listeners and what they want to hear about, but that isn\u2019t to say that\u2019s the case for all of them, that\u2019s just been my experience when listening.

            "answer_text": "My new favorite history podcast tells the story of a politician in the White House. He is a fresh face, an outsider to national politics.He takes great pleasure in needling the liberal media. The press is a convenient enemy and punching bag.Trashing liberals is his brand. He delights in shutting down hecklers at his campaign rallies.He insists that he is not the one to start a fight. He prides himself on being a counter-puncher. \u201cYou can\u2019t hit my team in the groin and expect me to stand here and smile about it,\u201d he tells reporters.[1]He revels in outrageous, politically incorrect speeches, to the cheers of his ardent fans.Covert and overt racist language is a hallmark of his campaign. \u201cPolacks\u201d and \u201cJaps\u201d roll off his tongue with ease.When his own Justice Department investigates him for fraud, bribery, and corruption, he smears and threatens the prosecutors.He publicly maintains that the criminal investigation into his conduct is nothing more than a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dThis is not 2019. This is the story Richard Nixon\u2019s vice president, Spiro \u201cTed\u201d Agnew.  Agnew and Nixon at the 1968 Republican convention in Miami. Associated Press. https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/spiro-agnew-was-trump-before-trump/2018/09/03/b98ecf88-ad59-11e8-b1da-ff7faa680710_story.html?utm_term=.149756f6b951 Nixon chose Agnew, the governor of Maryland, as his running mate in the 1968 presidential election. \u201cTricky Dick\u201d barely knew the governor, who was only halfway through his four-year term. The podcast, called Bag Man, tracks the 1973 federal investigation into kickbacks Agnew received. The governor used his influence to steer government contracts to his supporters. This continued during his term as vice president; a $10,000 cash payment stuffed in a bag was delivered to him in the White House.[2] The investigation of Vice President Agnew was separate from the already ongoing Watergate probe, but The VP\u2019s prosecutors had to work fast. They did not want Nixon to resign, only to have another criminal occupy the White House. Host Rachel Maddow is of course a committed partisan, but largely sticks to the historical facts of the Agnew case. The prosecutors are stars of the show, with frequent interviews punctuating the drama. The open criminality drew the interest of U.S. Attorneys, many of whom Maddow and Yarvitz interview on the podcast. It\u2019s the clear-eyed recollections of these public servants, the incredible pressure they were under and just how high the stakes were that help make history come alive on Bag Man. Both Maddow and Yarvitz show their admiration for Nixon\u2019s Attorney General Elliot Richardson, a person thrust into a crucible that few have ever faced \u2014 heading up simultaneous investigations that implicated both top executives in the Oval Office. Bag Man showcases a largely unknown story, and is a must for fans of history and politics.
