            "answer_text": "When musicians write music, they put their emotion into it. That emotion transfers through the song, into your ears, and to your heart. Listening to the song, you can feel the same emotion that the musician put into the song. That\u2019s why music is powerful. It can hold an emotion, and relay it, over and over again. It\u2019s kinda amazing, if you think about it. ",
