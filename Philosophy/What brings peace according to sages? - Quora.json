            "answer_text": "Sages, is a distorted English translation of the sanskrit term \u201csanyasi\u201d, \u201csanyasi\u201d can be remotely be said as \u201ccoma\u201d, which means that the person has moved on from a certain facet of life to another facet on life, there is no denouncement ( to give up) but its \u201cmoved on\u201d. Like infants are fed on baby food and when that grows, then the child moves on to another food articles, so it isn\u2019t denouncement of baby food, but realisation that there is more beyond that baby food. Likewise when sanyasi moves on, from aspirations, lust, anxiety, anger, desperation\u2019s its then that nirvana chakra gets activated ( this chakra is placed in between hippocampus, lower thalamus and amygdala) and this chakra gives ecstasy (joyful solace). PS: didn\u2019t use the word peace, as peace is a \u201csituation\u201d based \u201creaction\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Self Realisation i.e. The glimpse of God in the highest stage of meditation brings peace permanently. If you have not attained that or have no desire to attain that , then doing your daily work as perfectly as you can with total involvement in it will bring peace to you . This is also mentioned in Chapter 2 Verse 2 of Bhagwad geeta that O Arjuna! if you do not do your work which is your duty and run away from it, you will not get peace. ",
