            "answer_text": "Your question is so naive I want to help you; in physics, a dimension is a metric, a means to measure certain attributes of physical reality. The first three dimensions are spatial, the 4th is temporal. They are only numbers, not realms, as the word \u201cdimension\u201d is so often used in fiction. The word \u2018reality\u2019 means the condition of being real, or, it exists. Either something you are thinking about exists or it is nothing, not real, does not exist, just your imagination playing tricks on you. A dimension does not \u201cexist\u201d in the way that real things, materials, substances, forces, fields, exist. The word \u2018particle\u2019 is a holdover from when physics knew nothing about the quantum realm. In the description of the quantum realm described by QFT, there are no particles, just quantum excitations of the field. These objects / events do not \u2018pass through\u2019 reality, they are acting in the one and only reality that exists, but from our point of view of these objects / events, they operate at the scale of sub-atomics, like electrons, quarks, gluons. All four dimensions can be used to measure their transient properties. ",

            "answer_text": "Evidence of quantum particles passing through our 4D universe may be dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos and virtual particles. Also, the mysterious weakness of gravity, which is of the fabric of space made of particles, may also indicate quantum particles indirectly and partly interacting in 4D space. Neither of these directly interact with matter or 4D space. ",
