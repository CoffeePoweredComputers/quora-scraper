            "answer_text": " Podcasts are great sources of content. They are like magazines or blog posts for your ears. But wait, there's more, once you subscribe, you are delivered the latest episodes and what\u2019s great is that they are free. Here are popular podcast favorites you can start listening to: ScienceStar Talk Radio - hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson and with guest friends. This podcast is totally devoted to science. What makes this great aside from the brilliant host is the inclusion of celebrity guests who sometimes inject hilarity in what is already a very serious topic. TechnologyEngadget - Hosted by Brian Heater and Steve Stevens. Science nuts like me are likely to be obsessed about gadgets. If you want to know anything about new products, reviews and what not about gadgets, Engadget is the place to go. Productivity Hack the Process - the podcast for taking your plans and making them a reality using sustainable systems. Every episode features guests who are industry and thought leaders with generosity in sharing productivity tips. EntrepreneurshipThe Four Hour Work Week - hosted by the bestselling author of the book with the same title. This podcast is probably ranked as the number 1 business podcast. Guests not only includes businessmen but also celebrities like Edward Norton, Jamie Foxx, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. EntertainmentHow Did This Get Made? - Hosted by Paul Scheer, Jason Mantzoukas, and June Diane Raphael. Have you seen a movie so bad it\u2019s so good? This podcast rips through every bad script, plot holes, bad casting etc. and makes fun of horribly crafted films. Be ready for a blast because comedians Paul, Jason and June plus guest will leave you literally gasping for air cracking up with their silly antics. FoodThe Menu - The guide to the world of food. The podcast sets to interview creative chefs on what\u2019s up and coming and who food influences the world. MoneyThe Rich Dad Radio Show - Hosted by world renowned finance guru and bestselling author Robert Kiyosaki. The author of the number 1 personal finance book Rich Dad Poor Dad put his skills in his own podcast show. ",
