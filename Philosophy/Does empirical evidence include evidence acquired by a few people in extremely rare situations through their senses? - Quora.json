A \"few\" People can be prone to hallucinations. So it might hold if the word \"few\" is replaced by \"most\".. (as per definition)If you stretch few to '1', we have prophets :-) None of their claims that : \"God told them so\" can be accepted as \"empirical evidence\" as per this definition. ",

            "answer_text": "Evidence is more or less valuable based on several factors, including  repeatability -- can other people repeat the observation and get the same result. When evidence is repeatable, it is readily accepted as fact.  Evidence becomes less reliable when it is not repeatable. Consider the recollections of a few eyewitnesses to a crime, or other one-time event. Eyewitness testimony is often unreliable because the witnesses were emotionally involved, stressed, rushed, only caught a glimpse of the event, witnessed an event in an unusual context, and have dynamic memories. This often causes one eyewitness account to conflict with another, even when the witnesses are doing their best to recall what they saw. Therefore eyewitness testimony is evidence, but it is not conclusive. See: Empirical evidenceand: Scientific evidenceand: Anecdotal evidenceand: Eyewitness memory ",
