Here\u2019s the answer you\u2019re looking for: \u201cyou\u2019d have to introduce me to one.\u201d But there\u2019s more I\u2019d need to be really convinced. As it is, we are surrounded by nonhuman intelligences. My cat and dog, and a whole lot of other creatures, would be insulted to be described as lacking any intelligence. Sure, it\u2019s not human intelligence, but it\u2019s a degree of it, and varies greatly from one species to another as we are all aware. Those aliens, then. If they look different from any earthling, why hasn\u2019t someone posted a picture? We all carry smartphones. Perhaps they have disguised themselves as sheep or caterpillars? How then would we be able to tell they\u2019re not the real deal? If they can talk, it presumably won\u2019t be in American accented English. More likely neighs or woofs, to maintain the disguise. There are times I can believe my cat\u2019s an alien. Then how did they get here? The shortest time it could have taken would be 4.5 years, travelling at 300,000 Km/sec. That\u2019s speed is impossible, even for really intelligent aliens, and that\u2019s the nearest possible habitat. There is evidence that there\u2019s no one there anyway. More realistically they would have come from hundreds or even thousands of light years away, meaning a journey of tens of thousands or millions of earth years. And why would they be interested in this little repository of life anyway? If they are so intelligent, there would be plenty to interest them nearer home rather than go all that way to visit a boring little planet whose far less intelligent creatures never got further than their own moon. So, why are they here? What are they doing? Infiltrating the atmosphere with crazy gas, to make people vote for Trump? Setting off tornadoes, fires and floods just to tease us? If they\u2019re so intelligent what\u2019s in it for them? Yes, cover those bases for me and I\u2019ll listen. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\u201d - Carl Sagan Space is huge. Unbelievably huge. Even going at max speed, it takes years\u2014even centuries\u2014to travel between stars. According to our understanding of physics, nothing can go faster than light. To even match that speed requires ridiculous amounts of energy. And at those speeds you need material science the likes of which we don\u2019t even know. Might a xeno civilization have overcome all this? Broken through our understanding of physics, funded an expedition, crossed the unfathomable distance between the stars, escaped detection by a large fraction of humanity \u2026 to carve graffiti in our wheat, put on light shows, crash into the desert, and abduct yokels for interspecies breeding experiments? I mean, maybe. It\u2019s not impossible. But that\u2019s a lot to claim, and it\u2019s unreasonable to accept that without REALLY good evidence. Even eyewitness testimony wouldn\u2019t work. Heck, ESPECIALLY eyewitness testimony wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cI saw something in the sky, and it was like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. Therefore, I can only conclude that it was an unimaginably advanced civilization coming here to make my life more interesting.\u201d There is no basis to conclude that. Bring us some alien alloys. Some weapons. A gol\u2019dern ashtray from the cockpit. Something that can be put in the Smithsonian and looked at carefully. When Europeans came to the Americas, within a generation all native people in the region knew of their presence. Lights in the sky aren\u2019t gonna do it, even if a hundred people saw it. ",
