            "answer_text": "Neoclassical economics generally refers to the mathematical conception of Classical economic ideas like the benefits of free trade and frictionless financial markets. If you had to put a date, neoclassical economics was started in the early 1900s, and elements of it are foundational to modern thought. In fact, most intermediate microeconomics classes are basically classes on neoclassical models, like perfectly competitive firms and utility maximizing consumers. In macroeconomics, a lot of pedagogical models are also neoclassical in that zero regulation is usually the best policy, with competitive prices resulting in the best outcome. New Keynesian economics is one of the dominant macroeconomic modeling paradigms, particularly among central banks. An issue with neoclassical and frictionless models of the economy is that they don't really match empirics very well. In the 1980s/90s, New Keynesian economists introduced ways of implementing frictions in the behavior of prices without falling prey to the same kind of mistakes that old Keynesians made in the 1950s and 1960s that caused them to advocate policies which produced stagflation. As a result, New Keynesian models did a better job of explaining empirical data, and as a corollary, New Keynesian models gave an important role to central banks in keeping the economy healthy. See What is the Neo-keynesian school of economics? for a more detailed history of New Keynesian economics and why it emerged. ",
