            "answer_text": "What are qualia? They are said to be the \u2018objects\u2019 of direct experience (colours, sounds, odours, flavours, and feelings) commonly called \u2018sensations\u2019, theorised to be derived from \u2018sensory inputs\u2019 (light waves, compression waves, scent and flavour molecules, mass and gravity, and physical forms) that are theorised to trigger \u2018electro-chemical impulses\u2019 through the \u2018physical body and brain\u2019, all of which are theorised to exist \u2018outside direct experience\u2019 as \u2018eddies\u2019 or \u2018wavicles\u2019 or \u2018vibrations\u2019 within a \u2018universal quantum field\u2019 that fluctuates according to certain \u2018natural mathematical laws\u2019 - without the need for any Consciousness! However, no one can explain the leap from the theorised causal chain occurring within energy-matter-space-time (including a whole lot of \u2018dark energy-matter\u2019) - to the experiencing of qualia (which have no substance). From the viewpoint of science, it is the quantum field that is real and measurable. On this view, \u2018energy-matter-space-time\u2019 does not require any belief. It just \u2018is\u2019. Under this model of reality, qualia are treated as an \u2018emergent phenomena\u2019 that have to be explained in terms of \u2018energy-matter-space-time\u2019. In fact, the reverse is true of actual experiencing. Qualia are the immediate appearance that requires no theory or belief. Plainly they are apparent. Scientific theories on the other hand, do require \u2018proof\u2019. They are said to reflect \u2018reality\u2019 when they can predict behaviour. All behaviour is only ever \u2018apparent\u2019 as \u2018ever-changing patterns of qualia\u2019. Where are qualia apparent? Plainly, they are apparent in and to Awareness. Awareness of qualia is, by definition, a facet of Consciousness. What else but Consciousness is Aware? As for \u2018bodies\u2019, look straight ahead. Notice the visual field appears like a circle with an indefinite edge. Beyond the edge, is neither \u2018black\u2019 nor \u2018white\u2019\u2026 simply nothing. Now look down. Notice the body appears as a foreshortened image (distorted by the laws of perspective), with only the front of the torso and limbs apparent\u2026 but no head. Where the head should be the whole world appears, or at least that bit perceivable from the perspective of the \u2018me\u2019 that One seems to be :) Instead of Consciousness being inside any \u2018body\u2019, it is plain that every body is an appearance in it. Notice that while the qualia are \u2018real\u2019, what they appear to be is an illusion: appearing to be something when it is really just patterns of sensations. Hold the thumb close to the eye. Notice it appears larger than most other apparent objects that are known to be orders of magnitude larger than it. A thing cannot really be smaller than another thing and also be larger than it. It can only appear so. Such appearance is an illusion. Plainly, every \u2018thing\u2019 in the visual field is an illusion. The relationship between qualia and the scientific theories (\u2018laws\u2019) that predict the behaviour of apparent objects (apparent in and to Awareness), is like the relationship between the images of a \u2018game-world\u2019 apparent on a computer screen, and the software (\u2018laws\u2019) that govern the behaviour of all objects in the game-world In the case of highly realistic computer simulations, the rules may include \u2018ray tracing\u2019 to calculate the path of \u2018light rays\u2019 transmitted from \u2018light sources\u2019 reflected from \u2018objects\u2019 in the game-world. Of course, there are no actual \u2018objects\u2019 on the screen nor in the computer, nor any rays emanating from one set of images on the screen and going to and reflecting off other images on the screen. The software rules (including ray tracing) simply determine what is imaged at any moment\u2026 on the screen. The \u2018game-world\u2019 rules can never explain the nature of the computer and screen on which the images appear, nor the nature of the images themselves. Most significantly, the images on the screen are nothing \u2018like\u2019 the computer and software that generates them. There is no \u2018person\u2019 or \u2018tree\u2019 or \u2018car\u2019 inside the computer. There is only a set of rules that create the images of those things (and everything else) on the screen. It is the same with all scientific theories about the apparent world formed of qualia. \u2018Scientific laws\u2019 can never say anything about the \u2018reality\u2019 in which and to which \u2018qualia\u2019 appear, nor anything about the nature of qualia themselves, nor how they appear and disappear. This is not to say that scientific theories are invalid. Plainly they can predict the behaviour of some apparent objects in some circumstances, eg falling apples or flying planes. But that is all. Look! Notice, there is no Awareness of \u2018light waves\u2019 or any other \u2018sensory input\u2019. Nor any Awareness of the nature of the experience or how it arises. It just appears and disappears in a constantly changing sensory panorama. Plainly, only qualia (colours and other sensations) are apparent. The words \u2018Sensing-sensations\u2019 and \u2018Sensing-qualia\u2019 are referencing the same direct experiencing: Seeing-colours, Hearing-sounds, Smelling-odours, Tasting-flavours and Feeling-feelings. The question could thus be rephrased: can Consciousness exist without sensations? First consider: can any sensation/qualia exist that is not Sensed; can a \u2018feeling\u2019 be that is not Felt? Plainly, it is impossible to conceive a \u2018sensastion\u2019 existing that is not \u2018Sensed\u2019. This introspection has so far only considered the raw nature of qualia as appearances in Awareness, inseparable from the Awareness in which they appear. But experience is also meaningful. The sensory images do not appear as mere \u2018blobs\u2019 of sensation. They appear as things, relations and events in space and time, seen from the perspective of a specific person. Yet how could this be? Is any colour-Seen meaningful? Does any colour-Seen have intrinsic form or discernable substance? Is any colour-Seen a number? What of other sensations? Don\u2019t merely read these sentences. Observe! Notice that in looking, colours are simply Seen. In listening are sounds are simply Heard. In Feeling, feelings are simply Felt. In Smelling, odours are simply Smelled. In Tasting, flavours are simply Tasted. Given no sensation-Sensed has intrinsic number, form or meaning it is impossible for any idea to be learned from sensory experience. Given this is so, where do ideas (number, form and meaning) spring from? Plainly, no idea can exist that is not Known. Plainly, no idea could ever change, for if it did, it would be a different idea and not the idea it is. Plainly, every idea takes its meaning by reference to other ideas that take their meaning from still more ideas that together form a self-referential set of all possible numbers, forms and meanings. From this it is clear that in Knowing one idea, at some level, all ideas must be Known. Plainly, as with Sensing-sensations, Knowing-all-ideas is an inseparable facet of Consciousness. What else but Consciousness can Sense-sensations and Know-ideas? And yet, it is also plain that there is Awareness of only some ideas, and not all ideas. Notice: \u2018cummerbund\u2019. Until this instant was there any awareness of Knowing or not-Knowing the meaning of this word? Plainly, until it is imaged in some way via sensations, there is no Awareness of any idea. Notice however, the meaning is not in the qualia (the pattern of colours forming the apparent word). Were the meaning in the appearance, it would be immediately understood. Yet, from the perspective of an illiterate person, the word has no meaning at all, which indicates no idea is associated with the image in Awareness. Plainly, there is only Awareness of number, form and meaning as the ideas are associated in Awareness with the qualia forming the appearance. Conversely, there are no \u2018things\u2019 in reality beyond the idea of the \u2018thing\u2019, imaged via sensations. There are no \u2018physical objects\u2019 or \u2018light waves\u2019 or \u2018compression waves\u2019 or \u2018scent or flavour molecules, nor planets, suns or galaxies\u2026 except in idea. Which brings us back to the question: Can Consciousness exist without qualia? Plainly, qualia appear to come and go, yet the capacity to Sense-sensations remains unchanged. So, for example, in a room without any light, Seeing still sees. It is just that there are no colours apparent to be Seen. So it may be said that Consciousness may exist without qualia. But qualia cannot exist without Consciousness. And yet, Consciousness without qualia, is not fully Consciousness. Consciousness is Sensing-sensations (colours, sounds, odours, flavours and feelings) and Knowing-ideas (number, form and meaning) with the Power to manifest sensory patterns within its own Awareness that accord with ideas to create the appearance of \u2018my body\u2019 and \u2018my thoughts\u2019 and \u2018my feelings\u2019 and \u2018my surroundings\u2019\u2026 as in a dream. As for science\u2026 Given all \u2018sensory inputs\u2019 (light waves, etc) exist outside direct sensory experience, how are they Known? Plainly all theories about light waves, compression waves, scent and flavour molecules, mass and gravity, and physical forms that all trigger bodily electro-chemical impulses, are Known only as ideas arising in and to Awareness. Scientific discovery is the process of revealing in and to Awareness the depth and breadth, the simplicity and complexity of the uncounted ideas that form the basis for every object, relation and event on every scale throughout all times and places, including all possibities that may ever be. And beyond the realms of science are the infinite worlds of fantasy, all the dream worlds that encompass endlesss possibilities unconstrained by any \u2018behavioral laws\u2019. How wonder full :) ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a fan of the \u201cQ-word\u201d. Because people get all excited and think it\u2019s spooky or the basis for a crushing argument. The \u201cq-word\u201d, as far as I can tell, is a shorthand for a handful of relatively non-spooky phenomena. The ability to classify related things/ideas together. Let\u2019s call this \u201cclassification\u201d.The ability to recognise an instance from this category when we can detect it. Let\u2019s call this \u201crecognition\u201d.The ability to build up associations with the idea, allowing its significance and utility to be attached as meta-data. \u201cassociation\u201dAnd perhaps the ability to represent this category beneath some kind of internal token or symbol or word. We could call this \u201cnaming\u201d.So equipped an agent might step out into the world. Spot patterns based on commonalities, and put them into these mental bins (categories). React to sensory input of familiar patterns when we are able to recognise them again. (recognition). Building up maps of common-ness. As time goes on the categories become more detailed and the cross linking and meta-data become richer. (association) And have the internal name which acts like a lever enabling us to bring up the internal representation and the ability to evoke and manipulate the concept without the need for direct experience. Those abilities seem to be utterly essential in order to have a meaningful interaction with the world. So I would regard these abilities as indispensable for any entity demonstrating awareness and agency. Consciousness seems to be awareness, but from the point of view of the entity doing the awareness. What it feels like to respond, where that response is assigned significance , the triggering of emotional association, the prediction of what this might mean next, the memory of a prior encounter and so forth. I think that is what people mean when they talk about \u201cqualia\u201d. But the \u201cq-word\u201d, should be avoided because it carries with it burdens of pre-fought arguments, which the listener might not share. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course not. To be unaware of stimuli would be to exist as a biological algorithm, our experiences of the physical world erased like volatile random-access memory subject to recurrent power cycles. Would you say a plant that closed its flowers upon negative stimuli exhibits consciousness? A human, on the other hand, who moves away when his/her lover physically hits them - how is this reaction to \"negative stimui\" any different? Well for one, this human has to reassess emotionally stored memories within the limbic system; his/her lover that was once an intimate partner is now potentially an abusive enemy. Beyond the pain of a resounding slap, such a dichotomy of mental labels results in heavy cognitive distress. For a species that is innately wired to be social and curious (as many intelligent/conscious animals are), such distress is a SUBJECTIVELY painful experience as opposed to a conditioned or reflexive reaction to negative stimuli. Check out the neuroscientific studies behind \"pain\" and human responses to pain in the cingulate cortex. I can't do biological or metaphysical justice to this topic here; consciousness is highly researched and is as fundamental to our existence as gravity, yet we know less about it then we do for black holes millions of light years away.

            "answer_text": "The question you\u2019re asking is whether consciousness has an awareness/content structure, or whether it is unitary, such that the content is the awareness. Barry Dainton analyzes this question in detail in Stream of Consciousness: Unity and Continuity in Conscious Experience; it\u2019s the topic of his first chapter after the Introduction. He concludes that it is unitary. There is no separate \u201cawareness\u201d above and beyond the contents. I find his analysis convincing. So there can be no pure awareness devoid of all qualia. ",

            "answer_text": "In an important sense consciousness IS qualia. Experiencing the results of your brains recognition of your senses (consciousness) is both the mental observation and the qualia or value of the observation. In the mind, observing and being observed are the same thing. If you don\u2019t agree with this you are forced into the hypothesis of the homunculus, which is the beginning of an infinite progression, which is nonsense. The mind can only mentally observe by BEING what is observed. Unfortunately our language makes it easy to misunderstand what I write. ",
