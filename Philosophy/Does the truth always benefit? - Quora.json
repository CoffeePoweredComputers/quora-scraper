            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s play a game. 7. In the practice of the use of language (2) one party calls out the words, the other acts on them. In instruction in the language the following process will occur: the learner names the objects; that is, he utters the word when the teacher points to the stone.\u2014And there will be this still simpler exercise: the pupil repeats the words after the teacher\u2014\u2014both of these being processes resembling language. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will some- times speak of a primitive language as a language-game. And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in games like ring-a-ring-a-roses. I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the \"language-game\". Ludwig Wittgenstein - \u2018Philosophical Investigations\u2019 Here is a the cornerstone, I call it \u2018truth\u2019.  This is literally the first object, because it is the very thing which allows the game to be played. Without this foundation there will be no building at all, because there is nothing to build on, in fact. For facts to be assembled referentially in a manner that is consistent (that is, they as things-in-themselves are invariant) there must be truth - the property that ensures a name remains the name as it was given. Now that we have an object that allows ontological action (otherwise no words can be used, since the names we give might otherwise never be the same twice) we may introduce another name: \u2018good\u2019.  Now, the question becomes \u2018is the foundation of the language game to be approved of?\u2019. Is the game real? If the answer is \u2018no\u2019 then the game simply ends. More importantly, it ceases to exist. There can be no game since there are no rules, and games where the rules have infinite degrees of freedom are not infinite games - they are nothing. Nothing has infinite degrees of freedom. There is no truth in nothing. Hence, we can rephrase the question \u2018is truth objectively good?\u2019 as \u2018is something better than nothing?\u2019 because where truth is not in fact good (to be approved or desired) then nothing is in fact better and indeed there is in fact nothing. Do we want to play this game at all? Well, actually, \u2018the proof\u2019s in the question\u2019. We are already playing the game, since without truth then none of the words that comprise these sentences have any meaning. This ostensive teaching of words can be said to establish an association between the word and the thing. But what does this mean? Well, it may mean various things; but one very likely thinks first of all that a picture of the object comes before the child's mind when it hears the word. But now, if this does happen\u2014is it the purpose of the word?\u2014Yes, it may be the purpose.\u2014I can imagine such a use of words (of series of sounds). (Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination.) But in the language of \u00a72 it is not the purpose of the words to evoke images. (It may, of course, be discovered that that helps to attain the actual purpose.) same source Nietzsche says \u2018without music, life would be a mistake\u2019. Similarly, truth in language is the Key to the music of meaning. Notes are not musical - their playing is. However, without pitches ringing true in the subjective sense of sound we have only silence. Even noise can be music when it is named as such. John Cage showed us this over just four minutes and thirty-three seconds. Thus, something must objectively be better than nothing, because \u2018something\u2019 is what makes an object objective. Where truth is not objectively good then there is literally nothing to speak of and we must therefore pass over everything in silence, since everything would be nothing. And yet we speak. We have already made our judgement in doing so.  ",

You might have listened the saying \u201cjis jhooth se kisi ka ghr bsta ho woh jhooth jhooth nhi hota\u201d and I honestly believe it to be true. There comes a time where your truth might hurt someone whereas your lie might save lives. In that situation your lie is greater then truth. Even in corporate world you always have to choose between truth and lie for your betterment. Once my friend who was working in bank told me that his superiors were standing on his head asking for current year reports immediately for which he needed 2 hours to prepare, so what he lied that he had already sent the report and that they should check their e-mail whereas in actual he had sent last year reports which his superiors took 4 hours to figure. He simply apologised by creating some excuse and handed them the current year\u2019s repory for which he was appreciated. I learnt from this story that Sometimes you have to lie for betterment of something as truth may bring loss\u2026. ",

If the consideration begins with a statement some progress can be made. For example. \u201cTruth is good.\u201d The obstacle faced is that \u201cgood\u201d requires definition. Who is responsible for the definition? The person formulating the question can offer a definition, or the person formulating the question can borrow a definition from another source to explore the statement. Also, it is possible that examination leads thought into neutral ground. In other words, even before truth is equated with either good or evil, the neutral position is reached which establishes that, \u201cTruth is.\u201d Shall our question be, \u201cIs Truth?\u201d or shall our question be; \u201cIs Truth Good?\u201d or \u201cIs Truth Bad?\u201d. Where lies responsibility or accountability for the answer to the question? Is the answer to the question what I tell you or what someone else tells you or does the answer lie in what you answer? Is Truth to be understood as only a Good or an Evil, or is truth subject to other identities. What criterion shall we apply to our question? How shall anyone proceed with the statements: \u201cTruth is good.\u201d or \u201cTruth is not good.\u201d or \u201cTruth is Evil.\u201d or \u201cTruth is Indifferent.\u201d or \u201cTruth is nonexistent.\u201d? Is Truth a mental object? Truth is a mental object. Are mental objects real? Some people propose mental objects are real and other people propose mental objects are not real. What is the difference between Metaphysical Realism and Metaphysical Nominalism?  Other questions invite answer. Can any identity be \u201cobjectively\u201d known? Are some identities only known \u201csubjectively\u201d?  What knowledge can we collect by finding answers to the questions? Can we find Good? Is the question a matter of \u201ccan\u201d a Good be found, or whether Some Good can be found to be true? Is this consideration actually an issue about whether or not Truth is \u201cgood\u201d or is it better characterized as to whether or not \u201ctruth\u201d has a utility. Is utility a \u201cgood\u201d? How will you answer the question? Wherein do individuals distinguish between Objectivisms and Subjectivisms?  There can be yet other considerations. For example: Who or what is the questioner? Who or what is the answerer? When is the questioner accountable for answers? ",

            "answer_text": "By definition, yes, but that entirely depends on how you define truth - if your conception of truth is predicated upon a subjective description, perception or evaluation of a concept or proposition, then I would say that the answer would, in fact, be no. This is because, as human subjects, we are fundamentally limited by the inherent constraints of the perspective with which we perceive the world, and the opinion held by an individual or group of individuals about what qualifies as true can always be misinformed or simply mistaken. Nonetheless, as truth is properly defined as \u201cthat which is, as it is, independently of (human) perception, observation or consideration\u201d, it seems very clear - to me, at least - that such a thing as truth cannot ever be \u2018wrong\u2019, and must be eternally irrefutable. The mere fact that what is true can seem false to you, or that you can be wrong about the appropriate implications and conclusions of something which is true serves in no way to validate the proposition that the truth can ever be \u2018wrong\u2019. The truth is transcendent and immutable; it is beyond mere \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019, because it is the foundation upon which the existence of such concepts is predicated. You are human, and as a consequence you are limited and flawed - you may be wrong, and the way you understand the truth may be wrong, but the truth itself could never be such a thing - by definition. Truth is more divine than we could ever hope to be, and if one desires to externalize blame for their own mistakes by projecting it onto Truth itself, then I think such an attitude speaks for itself, and I needn\u2019t continue.

Figure out how you can best support them in making the best decision in a timely manner. Your openness about your own mistakes and fallibility and the limits of your knowledge, and your forthright benevolent engagement, will always have lasting positive impact on those you are close to, though the truth itself may be upsetting. The truth can be a third thing that you both deal with together, even if the truth is a dire mistake of yours. Take the long view. Exceptions can be made for senescent, schizoid, or malicious individuals who do not have the capacity or will to understand you. Further consider that people see the habits you get into and the way they shape your world view. If you often lie to strangers, the opposite sex, or your parents, close friends may question whether you sometimes lie to them. When you boil it down, trust is so valuable, and so fragile, that it\u2019s almost always best to proactively harbor it so that people will be there for you when you need them. And you will need them. So no. But if you\u2019re asking, yes. ",

Plus, a few weeks from now we might get reminded that it was \u201cyesterday\u201d, it was several days before that, so we can\u2019t even be trusted when we were there and \u201csaw it happen\u201d. If the observation is more traumatic (car accident, shooting, fire) we are likely to mess up the \u201ctruth\u201d even more. And if we are asked about \u201cmotives\u201d, almost all bets are off since we just can\u2019t \u201cstep back outside ourselves\u201d and judge those things \u201ctruthfully\u201d. Heck, we often do not really know our own motives\u2026we\u2019re too busy, lost in the \u201cdoing\u201d! So as Pontius Pilate (actually rather honestly) replied to Jesus, \u201cWhat is truth\u201d? Of course Jesus was not here to tell us about rocks rolling down hills, but \u201cspiritual truth\u201d as in the spiritual battle of good vs. evil inside each of us (not that Pilate gave a hoot about those abstractions). So, Yes\u2026.truth is always right but \u201ctotal material truth\u201d is never knowns by any human\u2026.never.
