Initially there may be hesitation but when he will find you trustworthy and supportive he will understand your feelings. If you try to check mobile yourself you might just misunderstand and think in wrong direction.. as you already hve some doubts on whats going on in his mobile and it will just lead to pick linea in between and it wil just spoil relationship. Better keep sharing your views thoghts with your husband and be supportive of whatever problem you feel he might be facing it will build bond between you both.. ",
