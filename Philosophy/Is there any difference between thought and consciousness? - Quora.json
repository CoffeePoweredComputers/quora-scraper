            "answer_text": "By my estimation, thought involves two dimensions of perception, whereas consciousness (to actually be aware of one\u2019s thoughts) involves four. Having the capacity to experience four dimensions of perception at once is what I think allows our experience of consciousness. I am suggesting that awakeness has 0-dimensions of perception (a single point on the \u2018map\u2019 of the mind, that simply establishes one is not asleep),awareness has 1-dimension of perception (a line connecting two points on this mental map, that establishes awareness of self, also known as interoception),thought has 2-dimensions of perception (an area that, like a wave, extends outward in two, perpendicular directions, establishing our awareness of other, also known as exteroception),feeling has 3-dimensions of perception (an immersive environment with contour, warpage and elevation changes, that allows spatial awareness, also known as proprioception), andemotion has 4-dimensions of perception (the patterns that emerge when change in feeling is tracked over time, enabling awareness of sensation, including pain, which is known as nociception.)In other words, in terms of dimensions, feeling (3) + time (1) = emotion (4) I propose that awakeness, awareness, thought & feeling\u2014are static phenomena, whereas emotion is a dynamic phenomenon. If feelings are the pictures, emotion is the movie. Put another way, if the mind was mapped topographically, I am suggesting awareness represents specific locations on the map, thoughts the roads connecting them, feelings the landscapes that describes them, and emotion the route we take through them, including how we perceive the time it takes to reach our destination. Physics has taught us that space and time are inseparable, and must be considered jointly, as \u2018spacetime.\u2019 Similarly, under normal, healthy conditions, I think humans are \u2018wired\u2019 to perceive feeling (which is strictly \u2018spatial\u2019) and emotion (which adds \u2018time\u2019) as inseparable, what I would call \u2018mental spacetime\u2019. (This is I think why people use the terms \u2018feeling\u2019 and \u2018emotion\u2019 interchangeably, when technically they are distinct phenomena. For healthy humans they may be indistinguishable, but for all other life forms\u2014and certain health-challenged humans\u2014I would suggest they are easily distinguishable.) And it is awareness of \u2018mental spacetime\u2019 that I think is synonymous with \u2018consciousness\u2019\u2014that quality of having the distinct sensation of awareness that we are aware of our thoughts and feelings/emotions, and possessing the sense that we are autonomous beings exercising some level of free will. Specifically, to me there seems to be something about human brains that we are \u2018wired\u2019 normally to be unable to perceive space and time separately, and as well to be unable to separate that we are feeling from how we feel about how we are feeling. (Recursivity at its finest, perhaps.) All other forms of life, at least those with nervous systems, I suspect have some level of ability to choose whether to become aware (conscious) of how they are feeling (which includes their thoughts) or not. Just not humans. I don\u2019t think we get to choose\u2014once we get a feeling (presumably because pain reception above a certain threshold has been crossed) by default I think we are \u2018programmed\u2019 to become aware of it, along with all the thoughts and awarenesses that accompany it. Typically only with anesthesia, chemical numbing agents, brain damage or intentional distraction can a person voluntarily tune out (as in forget/block out) an awareness once it has been triggered. Therefore, the experience of consciousness I suspect may be available to all neurology-possessing life forms, however humans I think are the only ones who are neurologically obligated to experience it. I would call this obligate consciousness, meaning humans may be the only life form with no choice to decide in a given moment whether we want to be aware of our thoughts and feelings or not. Obligate consciousness I think somehow forces a movie-type experience of one\u2019s life, rather than a series of still-picture views that can be examined at leisure. Whereas a still-picture view might foster focus on quality, detail and context, a movie-type view emphasizes cause & effect, suspense and intrigue, and encourages prediction. (Hence the human practices of meditation and mindfulness, which I think function to \u2018slow down\u2019 our movie experience to something closer to what non-human life forms experience naturally.) For all these reasons and more, I postulate that human consciousness, as essentially mental spacetime, is subject to the mathematics of Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity. Just like gravity is considered equivalent to acceleration and is the natural result of curvature in physical spacetime, I propose that belief is proportional to gravity, and hence expectation is what we experience according to the warps and curvatures that make up our own, individual \u2018mental spacetime.\u2019 Therefore, understanding the underlying expectations that are guiding our actions is key to understanding how to navigate the landscape of our minds, because of the virtual pitfalls, gravity warps and high-risk zones that literally make up our minds. Just as gravity shapes every facet of our physical lives, expectations shape every facet of our mental/emotional lives. The relationship between emotion and expectation appears to be identical to the relationship between Force and Acceleration, which I am proposing is why we describe things as \u2018mattering\u2019 and the \u2018gravity of our situation.\u2019 (For suggestions on changing one\u2019s underlying expectations by the way, see Sonia Elkes's answer to How do we not let our emotions rule over us?) The above conclusions are a) to the best of my present knowledge, b) a constant work in progress, c) subject to change, and d) may well not even be true. Nevertheless, the remainder of the hypothesis on which they are based can be found here: The Mathematical Origins of Consciousness & Emotion: A Hypothesis (Parts 1\u20134) by Sonia Elkes on Post \u2026with an interesting recent article that underscores the potentially \u2018dimensional\u2019 nature of human perception: The Human Brain Can Create Structures in Up to 11 Dimensions  (Image credit: sciencealert.com, The Human Brain Can Create Structures in Up to 11 Dimensions) ",
