            "answer_text": "No. The way you view yourself is wrong only if you believe it is. Let me explain. Let\u2019s say you think of yourself as not a very confident person. It\u2019s likely that you will lack confidence because you don\u2019t believe you\u2019re confident. Therefore, your view of yourself isn\u2019t wrong. Likewise, if you think you think you\u2019re better looking than everyone you meet, that is your opinion and you are not wrong. Someone else could come to a different conclusion, but it\u2019s your opinion about yourself that matters. Now, we can say that if someone says they have the IQ of a genius but they cannot pass a test to prove it, then they are wrong about that. But, if they\u2019re talking figuratively and believe in their own mind they are a genius and thinking it makes them feel highly intelligent then guess what, they are a genius. Human beings experience reality based on what they believe to be true about themselves, even if they\u2019re facts. Whatever you believe, you will find confirmation for it. If you think your view about yourself is always wrong, then you have a belief your view is wrong, when the view itself may be right. ",

            "answer_text": "No.. Not ALWAYS.., and we must realize that the WHOLE Word of God is relevant and given to us both for correction and instruction on Godliness, so that we can be transformed Into the image of God and HIS righteousness, and therefore no longer controlled purely by the flesh, including fleshly lusts and emotions ans worldly and unGodly ways. The Word of His is also there to be a mirror that reflects back to us the state of our present condition in comparison to what itvis SUPPOSED to be, according to God, as is written in His Word, which also happens to be His perfect and revealed will\u2026although for the time we are still not perfect, but are a work in progress. In my experience, I havd learned the hard way not to throw ths baby out with the bath water when it comes to hearing the disciplines of God. (based on his He sees us) but He never does so because He wants to hurt of harm us, but to mature and enlarge us\u2026and takes out what hinders our growth So then sometimes we hear what we don't like!!! Or see us as we don't want to be seen. Yet it is quite right and we then are meant not to reject it outright and rather to acknowledge it and then work on that area. On the other hand.. It is also true that many people well know they have faults, and then others rub it in, and often they already carry on their shoulders a whole mountain of guilt, and then see themselves as purely imperfect and unworthy as a result. The Bible defines this as condemnation. So then rather than being the good kind of awareness that builds us up, freeing us from the way we are.. It condemns us. That is not in the least helpful because it is basically a dead end road and instead of expanding you through freedom it will result in a LACK of spiritual gruwth, but an increase in awareness of your imperfections as being what defines you. Testimony In my life my biggest area of struggle was my self esteem and thus I had endless trouble with my self worth.. Me always having been told on so many words by my admired and highly educated self made man father that in his opinion I would never amount to much and that I didn't have an opinion worth listening to and had no credibility in academic circles. I Believed him. I did not know or understand or realise that he was using those words to control me.anf bully me, .and that I was bring manipulated through intimidation and devaluation that was sustained and continuous. So then the day that the Pastor's saw through that, they knowing what the WORD says, and they told me, and I listened, and learned a better way, was the same day I began to break free and to grow as a person.. So that God could use me.. Because otherwise I would have remained a very scared an immature spiritual dwarf with no sense of self or self worth. . So by that illustration.. Not we cant always chuck out correction, but it must be constructive .. and corrective.. But not for the sake of condemnation. My old view of myself was WRONG. I was misinformed because I was, through no fault of my own, MISLED and DECEIVED by my father whom I trusted into seeing myself as HE saw me. It took quite something for God to convince me though that all the while I had been wrong and He was right because by then I had lived with that rotten stinking self image for about 60 years.. And literally sat under the Word all over again, for 9 years, renewing my mind according to the Word in order to change my thinking . . ",
