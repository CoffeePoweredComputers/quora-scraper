            "answer_text": "The ideas in play here are 1) definitely not main stream but 2) have been advanced by some heavy hitters (philosophically speaking.) Spinoza, Descartes, Sartre, Russell to name drop a few. While I am firmly in the opposite camp, keeping an open mind (pun noted) is advisable. To do so, requires some knowledge of the alternatives. The source reference for this question leads back to Phillip Goff the author of the book: Consciousness-Fundamental-Reality . An attempt to uncover the fundamental nature of reality, the limited set of facts upon which all other facts depend. Perhaps the most popular theory of fundamental reality in contemporary analytic philosophy is physicalism, the view that the world is fundamentally physical in nature. The first half of this book argues that physicalist views cannot account for the evident reality of conscious experience, and hence that physicalism cannot be true. Unusually for an opponent of physicalism, Goff argues that there are big problems with the most well-known arguments against physicalism Chalmers' zombie conceivability argument and Jackson's knowledge argument and proposes significant modifications. The second half of the book explores and defends a recently rediscovered theory of fundamental reality or perhaps rather a grouping of such theories known as 'Russellian monism.' Russellian monists draw inspiration from a couple of theses defended by Bertrand Russell in The Analysis of Matter in 1927. Panpsychism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) provides an estimable perspective. I urge reading this before taking on Goff or others. Panpsychism, strange as it may sound on first hearing, promises a satisfying account of the human mind within a unified conception of nature. As philosophers we may be interested in finding out what the intrinsic nature of matter is, or at least having our best guess as to what it might be. And if the above line of reasoning is correct, we must look beyond physics for this. The panpsychist has a proposal: the intrinsic nature of matter is, at least in part, consciousness. IMHO, everything can be explained by physics, biology and evolution. Consciousness is a marvelous process we are blessed to enjoy. It is not some \u201cin-dwelling spirit\u201d which deserves a separate ontological category, it is just a product of our brain. I do stand ready to revise this opinion, given substantial additional evidence and reason. ",

            "answer_text": "No. I think the mistake being made is to give too much weight to the conceptions in our mind, and finding our experiences pervasive throughout, rather than acknowledging they are only our impressions. I\u2019d meet the author halfway and agree that existence is pervasive in the universe, but our consciousness is only our own and not reliable at that. Consciousness is just the name we give to how the shadows in Plato\u2019s cave flicker from the unseen candle. You\u2019re Galileo the scientist and I\u2019m Goff the philosopher. You\u2019re able to measure distances between the shadows and we agree on an explanation for what they are doing and how it works. No one even mentions the slight flickering we see all the time because everything looks like that. Suddenly, Goff stands up and demands an explanation for why it all looks flickery like that. It\u2019s hard to relay the point he\u2019s making, or even come up with the word \u201cshadow\u201d, because we\u2019ve all taken it for granted. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is\u201d Galileo says, \u201cwe can\u2019t explain that.\u201d \u201cAh, then it is some separate feature of the universe!\u201d Goff says. No, says Galileo, there is no explanation, this is the world as we see it, there is nothing more to explain.\u201d Galileo\u2019s right, Goff\u2019s wrong, the Hard Problem is not to be solved, or even a problem. It\u2019s not a difference between quality and quantity, both those types of measurements are distorted by the flicker on the walls. The flickering is both a constant feature of everything we experience (there is no knowledge without it) and also just an irrelevant side-effect of imperfect perception. The analogy breaks down a bit because Plato proposed, wrongly IMO, that a good enough philosopher could break from his chains, get outside the cave of human perception, and come to see everything the way it really is. No, Galileo says, we can always only perceive within the limits of our human brains. Plato\u2019s analogy remains true in that, while the source of what we see and the fact that it is always flickering because of the candle ARE features of the real world, the actual nature of the flickering is an impenetrable side-effect of the medium thru which we see the world...that\u2019s the experience of consciousness. The steps between candle and shadow can only be imagined because the candle is always to our backs and we can\u2019t see how it throws its shadows. If we try to be objective about our vision we might make some conclusions about the nature of the shadow-like appearance...how fast it flickers, whether we all see it flickering the same, etc. There are mice in the cave, we have an idea they may be sensitive to the flickering too, but not as aware of it as we are to question it. Going outside the cave means absolute objectivity, the absence of subjective experience. That is not possible. We can experiment with candles inside the cave and try to understand the way the shadows flicker. Neurologists will say the problem\u2019s solved but it will never satisfy someone who wants to explain exactly why his shadows always flicker the way they do. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe universe is a machine for making gods.\u201d (Henri Bergson, \u2018The Two Sources of Morality and Religion\u2019, 1932) In any meaningful way? No. In any meaningless, trivial way? Maybe. The mathematical formalism of physics can be harnessed to describe fields of sentience or insentience. Philosopher Phil Goff, author of the Scientific American article you hotlink, used to be an eliminative materialist \u2013 one of the most remarkable Damascene conversions since Saint Paul. He then critiqued the view he now espouses on the grounds that panpsychism cannot solve the binding problem; why aren\u2019t we just aggregates of Jamesian \u201cmind-dust\u201d rather than unified subjects of experience? Goff now defends a position that, as far as I can tell, is really a form of physicalistic idealism \u2013 which na\u00efvely sounds like an oxymoron (cf. How does the world view of a believer in physicalism differ from one of idealism?). Could an assumption that has underpinned physics since the birth of field theory go the way of luminiferous aether? Perhaps surprisingly, this is an empirical question. If panpsychism or non-materialist physicalism is true, then the world\u2019s fundamental distinction may not be between conscious and non-conscious systems, but between the phenomenally bound and the unbound. Contrary to na\u00efve appearances \u2013 crude neuroscanning suggests we are packs of decohered classical neurons \u2013 the unity of consciousness must have a physical signature in the CNS: If consciousness is fundamental, what predictions does it make?Or else dualism is true. Alternatively, common sense is right. Consciousness is an evolutionary novelty. Fields of insentience can metamorphose into fields of sentience. If so, science faces the Hard Problem, the problem of causal efficacy (i.e. how can the \u201craw feels\u201d of consciousness exert the causal-functional power to provoke discussions of their own existence?) and other seemingly insoluble mysteries. Anyhow, let\u2019s suspend disbelief. As philosopher David Lewis remarked, you can\u2019t refute an incredulous stare. If true, what does the conjecture that consciousness discloses the intrinsic nature of the physical entail? Phil Goff defends cosmopsychism: the universe is one big mega-mind, presumably psychotic. However, even if wavefunction monism is true, i.e. reality consists of one enormous entity, the universal wavefunction, I struggle to make sense of universal mind. The craniopagus Hogan twins may be able partially to \u201cmind-meld\u201d; the rest of us are doomed to metaphysical speculation about each other\u2019s sentience. In contrast to cosmopsychism, what philosophers call constitutive panpsychism or non-materialist physicalism is defensible: the equations are silent. But the conjecture that the universe is consciousness should be distinguished from the conjecture the universe is conscious. Consciousness isn\u2019t universally bound. Perhaps the explanation of phenomenal disunity lies in quantum decoherence. Decoherence is never absolute. Yet for all practical purposes, sentient beings are separate individuals, components of a multi-dimensional wavefunction living in a complex Hilbert space. However, the challenge for a decoherence theory approach to phenomenal (un)binding is to explain how any kind of non-trivial phenomenal unity is feasible, let alone a fanciful cosmic mega-mind. Alternatively, if (as cosmopsychists argue) we are all facets of some cosmological SuperBeing, then the entire conceptual framework of modern science \u2013 my conceptual framework \u2013 is false. This idea feels absurd. Does God have schizophrenia?! Yet one can\u2019t hop outside one\u2019s conceptual scheme to have a look\u2026 \u201cThere was a door And I could not open it. I could not touch the handle. Why could I not walk out of my prison? What is hell? Hell is oneself, Hell is alone, the other figures in it Merely projections. There is nothing to escape from And nothing to Escape to. One is always alone.\u201d (T.S. Eliot, \u2018The Cocktail Party\u2019)  ",

            "answer_text": "It is extremely important to know at the very outset that consciousness is not a thing, but it is a concept. All we humans know and can know are perceptions. Sensations = Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling. Perceptions = Sensations + thinking. This universe is a set of perceptions in our aliveness. We can never know any object out there as a reality that can stand on its own, but all we know is the perception of it. Perceptions are the signs of aliveness. Aliveness is a self luminous, self evident and most unmistakably obvious \u201cfeeling\u201d that does not need any proof or corroboration from anybody. This aliveness is nameless, formless, dimension-less, non-local, non-temporal, very near, dear and intimate and the very core of our BEING or LIFE. It is utterly impossible to prove objective reality of any supposed object out there without bringing in a subject or aliveness. This universe is therefore merely a projection of aliveness which we label as consciousness in common parlance, much like the dream world is the projection of thoughts and memory. The dream world is made of thought and memory. Likewise the wakeful universe is made of consciousness. Consciousness is not everywhere but everywhere is in consciousness. Time, space and causation are all mere projections of consciousness. Without consciousness time, space and causation are naught. Our own deep sleep state is a good evidence of this profound truth. In deep sleep, thee is no time, no space, no creation and nobody but just silence and stillness and BEING or LIFE or ALIVENESS in a state of deep peace and POTENTIAL. This is the ground state of REALITY where nothing is happening! There is no creation! The POTENTIAL of this BEING of the ground state of deep sleep is actualized variously in the different states of existence known namely, wakefulness, dream, swoon, coma, death, NDE, OBE, yogic trances (samadhis) and altered states of consciousness induced by drugs. All of these states are incredibly real in their own right, but since they all come and go they are not real in the absolute sense. BEING or LIFE is the ONE and only REALITY that is stable and constant at all times. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is not currently known, and it may not be possible to know. However, I think the panpsychism postulated by Goff can be refuted. As you probably know, consciousness is inherently subjective. I know beyond any doubt, by the logic of \u201cI think therefore I am\u201d, that I am conscious. However, how I know that anyone else is conscious appears to be purely instinctual. I have no way at all of telling the difference between an unconscious robot that perfectly imitates a conscious person, and an actual conscious person. This has led some to postulate panpsychism, that machines could be conscious, and so on. My argument against panpsychism is two-fold. First, the instinctual notion that others are conscious is part of what might be called \u201cinstinctive intelligence,\u201d also known as \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Because common sense gave rise to both philosophy and science, it obviously is in some sense more powerful than any scientific or philosophical theory. Yet, of course, science has the power to force us to modify our instinctual ways of thinking, e.g by formalizing logic and mathematics, or by abandoning appeals to miracles. So the first part of my argument is that there is no reason to abandon any fundamental part of common sense without a very good reason. I fail to find a good reason to abandon the common-sense belief that other persons are conscious, but inanimate objects are not conscious. In fact, there are today developing arguments based on quantum theory, and ultimately appealing to measurement in quantum theory, that consciousness is private precisely because it is prior to observation. That is, consciousness is a to some extent a quantum state, it is not a purely classical state. If that is the case, then the limited scope of my private consciousness is an element of physical reality, and it would be futile to expect that it extends beyond what I actually experience. That\u2019s the second part of my argument against panpsychism. I myself was always bothered from youth by the thought, \u201cwhy am I not conscious of everything? Why am I only conscious of my own thoughts?\u201d So, I find this notion of consciousness as being rooted in a quantum state that has a limited scope appealing as an answer to this question. ",

I don\u2019t think any of the higher level abstractions of the universe can fake it. Which is why I don\u2019t put much faith in a simulation hypothesis. I mean, if one could create, perhaps it would be as large as a planet, but a computer that was a perfect simulation of a human brain, every neuron and synapse, made of cogs and gears - while I would expect it to respond, perhaps slowly over eons, as a human, I don\u2019t at this time feel that via some woo woo consciousness would have actually have emerged in the thing. So the building blocks of consciousness must preexist in our universe. Not at the layer of mechanical things. Not at the layer of chemistry. Perhaps quantum, but very little of the standard model leaps out and says \u2018consciousness\u2019. Perhaps lower, but not too much, as it would need to interact via brains chemistry at that level. Sometimes I think knowing the answer to this question is also to know the answer to \u2018what is the great filter\u2019. Because this questions answer is, one way or another, the end of hope. ",

The author is saying these behaviors are caused by an innate to physical matter elementary consciousness. As matter becomes life, that innate consciousness linearly grows in complexity. By the time you are talking about humans, our consciousness extends to imagination and symbolic reasoning, but all that is innate to matter, not necessarily exclusive to humans. Fascinating concepts that I am sure many a conservative and/or empirical mind will condemn. This should be entertaining for a bit. ",
