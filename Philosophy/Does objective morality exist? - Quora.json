            "answer_text": "NO. But, . . . that might not mean what you think it means. Thousands of top-notch minds have written on this topic over the centuries. Some progress has been made in understanding the issue, but moral theorists remain deeply divided.   Moral Realists will accuse Moral Anti-Realists and Non-Cognitivists of failing to take morality seriously. And Realists are in turn accused of not taking science seriously. I think these are red-herrings. Realists and non-Realists alike are all interested in supporting a robust moral practice, are often allied on particular moral issues. And both camps are typically respectful of scientific practice and scientific epistemological norms as well.  The controversy is not about which things are right and which things are wrong. It is about how we think about our moral practice, and what we think grounds it. Often in Philosophical debates controversy will persist because we use key terms in different ways.  I suspect very much that that is part of what's going on in this debate. For instance, I think there are at least two main ways for a claim to be \"subjective\". And just because a claim is subjective in one way, that doesn't mean it has to be subjective in the other way. I'll get to that in just a few seconds (depending on how fast you read, of course :)). I want to reiterate: this issue is thorny, and it's difficult to address adequately in even a few thousand words. That said, I will attempt an answer here that's short enough to get one's mind around in one sitting, yet thoughtful enough to convey some of the complexity of the issue.  A thousand questions will remain unaddressed, and we can discuss some of those in the comments. Are there moral facts? Take a claim that is considered objective by most people:   \u201cGravity causes objects to fall near earth\u2019s surface.\u201d Take another claim that is considered merely subjective by most people:   \u201cIce cream is yummy.\u201d Now take a moral claim:   \u201cGenocide is wrong.\u201d Is this claim about genocide subjective or objective?  Is it more like claims about gravity? Or is it more like claims about ice cream? I\u2019ve summarized my position in the following chart. I'll present the chart first, and then I'll explain and defend my choices.   A claim is empirically testable if there is, in principle, a way to set up an experiment that will allow us to confirm or disconfirm the claim based on evidence that comes from our experiment. A claim is universally valid if it holds for all people everywhere, regardless of what they think about the matter. Scientific claims are capable of being both empirically testable and universally valid. Aesthetic preference claims are neither empirically testable nor universally valid. (Note: do not confuse an aesthetic preference claim -- \"Ice cream is yummy\" -- with a report about an aesthetic preference -- \"John thinks ice cream is yummy.\" The first is an aesthetic preference claim. The second is an empirical claim.) Moral Claims (I propose) are like aesthetic preference claims in that they lack empirical testability, but they are like scientific claims in that they can have universal validity.  Moral Claims Lack Empirical Testability Let\u2019s see what it means to say that moral claims are not empirically testable. Suppose someone is about to touch a hot stove. And we say,   \u201cStop. If you touch that stove you\u2019ll burn yourself.\u201d And they say,   \u201cFor you the stove is hot and will burn you. For me it won\u2019t\u201d. What then?  Easy. We just sit back, wait for them to burn themselves, and say \u201cI told you so\u201d. We don't actually HAVE TO do anything. The world itself can confirm the truth of our claim. But suppose we are in a conversation with Hitler, and we say:  \u201cGenocide is wrong\u201d. He replies:  \u201cYou dislike genocide. I like it. It\u2019s wrong for you, but not wrong for me.\u201d We say:  \u201cNo, it\u2019s wrong for you as well.\u201d What then? Can we sit back and expect the \"wrongness of genocide\" to manifest itself to him in some way? Can we say:  \u201cGo ahead Hitler, commit genocide. You\u2019ll see. When you burn yourself, we\u2019ll say we told you so. When the wrongness of genocide performs its effects in the world, you\u2019ll see that we were right all along.\u201d Of course we wouldn't actually take that approach, because allowing him to \u201clearn the hard way\u201d would cost lives.  But, more importantly for the purpose of this discussion, that approach simply wouldn't work anyway. The world does not give feedback about things like the wrongness of genocide. The \"wrongness of genocide\" is not an empirical matter. The \u201cwrongness of genocide\u201d will not produce any effects in the world on its own.  In order for the wrongness of genocide to have any effects in the world, we need people (subjects) who have certain attitudes toward that \"fact\".  It is we who impose the \"wrongness of genocide\" on the social order. Because moral \"facts\" cannot have any effect in the world, unless \"subjects\" embrace them, they are \"subjective\" in this sense. Let's call people who think of moral \"facts\" in this way \"Moral Subjectivists\". Moral Subjectivists also typically believe that moral claims are \"invented\" by subjects who have certain goals and desires. And, setting aside religious views for now, it seems tough to argue against this position. If you take the scientific view of the cosmos seriously, where else would moral opinions come from? Don't they have to arise from the goals, desires, and reasoning of the creatures who are involved in moral dialogue with each other? Now let's say we accept Moral Subjectivism.  Does that also mean we have to be Moral Relativists? No. Moral Claims Can Have Universal Validity Just because putative moral facts lack empirical objectivity, that does not mean they must also lack universal validity. Just because they depend on subjective acceptance for their existence and their efficacy, that does NOT mean they depend on subjective acceptance for their validity.  In other words, we can still apply our moral rules to other people, even when they don't accept those rules. Nothing prevents us physically from saying:   \u201cGenocide is wrong, not only for me, but for everyone, no matter what anyone else thinks about it\u201d. We can go further. We can say that we think it makes sense to feel guilty for committing genocide, or even seriously contemplating it. We can say that it makes sense for us to be outraged when we hear about genocide. We can say that we plan to band together with others who wish to prevent genocide. And we can hope that we might even be willing to risk harm to ourselves to prevent it if necessary. To go further in these ways is to insist that our moral claims have more than parochial validity. It is to say that we think everyone should accept these norms no matter who they are or when they live. Insisting on the universal validity of our most deeply held moral values is necessary if we are to oppose female genital mutilation in cultures that have that practice \u2013 even though some people in those cultures don\u2019t share our attitudes. It\u2019s also what allows us to say that slavery was wrong even long ago, even when some people in those cultures endorsed it. Ah, but a question begs to be asked at this point . . . If There Are No Objective Moral Facts, How Can We Justify Our Universal Moral Claims? OK, so we can insist that our moral claim applies to others, even if they don't think so. But how can we justify this attitude? Well, we can justify it the same way we justify anything. We either have to give reasons we think will appeal to our audience, or we have to just insist that we are right, even though we can't explain why in terms they will accept. (We can also re-think our position, but that will depend to some degree on how reasonable we take the other person to be when they reject our reasons). Suppose we are confronting someone who is intent on committing genocide.  We claim:  \"Stop. Genocide is wrong!\" He looks puzzled and says:   \u201cWhy ever would you say a thing like that?\u201d We must now consider how to justify our claim that genocide is wrong. And we might try something like:   \u201cWell genocide harms others, and harming others is bad. Also, doing harm to others based solely on which group they belong to, when they've done you no harm, is barbaric.\u201d But what if these reasons leave them cold?  Fortunately that's very rare among humans, but it's possible.  And at that point we would be left with little choice. We would have to say something like:   \u201cOK, I guess there\u2019s nothing I can do to persuade you that genocide is wrong.  I think you're woefully wrong, and I will do all that's in my power to prevent you from doing what you plan on doing. I guess I'm just the kind of person who doesn't want to live in a world that permits genocide.\" If that sounds less than fully satisfactory, then consider that we really have no choice. The justification would not go much differently if we assume there are objective moral facts out there in the universe. And it would not go much differently even if there were moral facts out there in the universe -- given that they are causally inert. We would start the same way, trying to appeal to reasons and principles we think they might accept. And then, when we saw that they were unmoved by our justifying considerations, we would have to say something like:  \u201cWell, it\u2019s just a fact. Genocide is wrong. That\u2019s a fact. Harming others for no reason is wrong. That\u2019s a fact. If you're too blind to see that, then I guess I am left with nothing to do but oppose you.\u201d In either case, whether we think there are objective moral facts or not, once we exhaust our attempts to justify our claim in terms the other person will accept, we are reduced to saying some version of \u201cwell I just think you\u2019re wrong\u201d. And this, too, will almost certainly leave them unmoved \u2013 either because they don\u2019t share our subjective attitudes (as a subjectivist might explain it), or because their conscience is broken and they just don\u2019t see the moral facts we can see (as an objectivist might explain it). Unfortunately, this disagreement about genocide is not like the stove touching case. The universe will not help us out here. There's no sitting back, letting them burn themselves, and saying \"I told you so.\" Whether we are subjectivists or objectivists, all we can do is try to give justifications that will resonate with them (contextual justifications). And, if that fails, and the issue is important enough, we must simply insist that we are right and they are wrong (basically browbeating them). Moral practice seems to work the same way either way. So does it matter whether we're Moral Realists, or Ethical Subjectivists?   Perhaps. Consider, . . . Some Pros and Cons of Moral Subjectivism If our moral claims are fundamentally subjective, are we better off facing that fact?  Or should we continue treating them as if they are as objective as scientific facts? Some might claim that we will take our moral obligations more seriously if we think God or Mother Nature backs up these claims. If we view our moral principles as springing from our subjective preferences, then they seem more ephemeral. And it seems that we would feel more free to set them aside when we can gain an advantage by doing so. I don't know whether this fear is well grounded or not. It's an empirical matter.  It might well be that some people will behave better if they think God or Mother Nature demands that they act according to specific moral principles. In that case, perhaps we are better off lying to those people. But it might be that Moral Realism is to be feared as much as or more than Moral Subjectivism.  Suppose our moral views arise solely from some combination of our subjective preferences, and our concern to justify our actions to others.  Then if we encourage people, contrary to these facts, to view their moral principles as being backed by God or Mother Nature, then we enable them to be more forceful and obnoxious about their preferences than we might wish them to be. Perhaps it's better to encourage each other to own our subjective preferences for what they are. If slave owners had to own their preferences for personal gain, and could not evoke the \"will of God\" or the \"dictates of the Natural Order\",  the institution of slavery might not have survived nearly as long as it did. But when they felt free to claim that God instituted slavery, or that it is the Natural Order of things, they were able to maintain moral momentum in the face of a million reasons to stop their practice. I wonder whether an institution like slavery would persist as long in a human society composed mostly of humans who embrace Moral Subjectivism.  It seems to me that, without mental constructs that enable extreme moral over-reach, our natural tendency to object when mistreated, combined with our natural desire to justify our actions to others, would cause us to converge on norms that would overturn the institution within a generation or two. Many people note a march of moral progress over the last few centuries in the industrialized world. We have rid ourselves of slavery, and have given the vote to all adult citizens. We take animal welfare more seriously than ever. And so on. Much still needs improving, but it does seem that we are relentlessly making progress in the right direction. Some might say this is evidence that there are moral facts, and that we are converging on those facts because we have mysterious faculties (our consciences) that can apprehend these facts, even though such \"facts\" are causally inert. But it's just as plausible that we are converging on these views because we are naturally concerned to justify our actions to others.  (See: Jim Stone's answer to Why do humans have a conscience?) And when we set aside the heavy-handed sources of moral authority that have tended to support institutional power, we are left in our process of justification with little to consider beyond the heartfelt objections of fellow human beings who are being mistreated. Closing Thoughts Again there are many relevant considerations I haven't addressed here. This is a complicated issue, involving the way we use some very abstract words. And it's a highly charged issue, which can slow down the pace at which we can think about these matters. Let me just close with the main reason I embrace Ethical Subjectivism: Ethical Subjectivism reminds us that, if we want to create a better world, Mother Nature won't help us.  She doesn't care. We have to care.  We must share our vision of a better world with other human beings. We must work to persuade each other. We must gather like-minded people around us. And, if necessary, we must prepare to do battle with those who oppose our vision of the good.  I even prefer to express my moral views differently these days. Instead of saying \"Genocide is wrong\", it seems just as good to say \"Let's not tolerate genocide.\" Instead of saying \"We have an objective right to a free education\", it seems just as good, if not better, to say, \"Hey, since our society is now wealthy and organized enough, LET'S CREATE a right to a free education.\" Basically, Ethical Subjectivism reminds us that, if we want to work for a better world, we have to stand on our own two feet, and stop hiding behind Mother Nature's pant legs.

            "answer_text": "Morals are, by definition, universal. Is it OK to torture babies for fun? If morals are not universal, then why do all people except a few psychopaths, answer that question with a resounding if nor repulsive \u201cNo!\u201d Can it be that murder is immoral in one location and moral in another? How about rape or other sexual abuse? The list goes on. Once you think morals are subjective, then you must answer, subject to what? The only answers to that are: Subject to you, and 2) subject to society (this was the Nazi defense at Nuremberg) that is, society tells us what is right and wrong. Well, that fails spectacularly. And a moral system you make up is not a moral system, it is virtually, do whatever you want to. It is logical equivalent to no morals at all. As Dostoevsky wrote in The Brothers Karamazov, without God, all things are permissible. Dostoevsky was right. Without a universal standard, we owe an apology to the Nazi who we executed after the war trials. You have no basis for judging anyone\u2019s actions in any manner at all. We should actually stop using the terms right and wrong because nothing is wrong, there is no standard by which to measure it. \u201cTorturing that baby was wrong to you, but not to me, to me it was fun. Who are you to force your moral system on me?\u201d Let\u2019s scale that does a little to the recent examples of girls or groups of girls being held hostage by a man for forces sex. Do you really think that is OK to him, but wrong to everyone else? That is individual moral relativism. Who are we to judge? But we do judge that, and rightly so. Without absolute moral standards, there is no just judgement, no justice. Be mindful here, that means all that is left is violence. Police have policing rights only because they have a gun to enforce it. The Nazi were not wrong, just unpopular. But how could you be popular killing five to six million Jews, three million Soviet prisoners of war, two million Soviet civilians, more than one million Polish civilians, one million plus Yugoslav civilians, around 70,000 men, women and children with mental and physical handicaps, and more than 200,000 gypsies, then unknown numbers of homosexuals, resistance fighters, and Jehovah\u2019s Witness, all because they did not fit the Nazi version of a superior race. But if morals are relative, then so is the atrocity. We can say only that we don\u2019t like it, not that it was wrong. It was unpopular. Is this the kind of world you wish to live in where Mother Teresa and Adolf Hitler are moral equivalents? There can be no responsibility for your actions because there is no standard to measure responsibility by. There are only laws, and violence to enforce them. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a wonder reading some of these answers. Franklin Veaux had it, but used it to mock rather than understand. Objectivity, in the modern sense, means turning people and things into objects. No one can have true objectivity without a complete understanding of ALL facts AND ALL of their context ALSO. The idea that there is a particular action that always means a particular thing is ludicrous. \u201cAppropriate\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d I prefer because it allows for context. \u201cRight\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d are social contracts called morality by some, and within one\u2019s self, called ethics. It depends on context. I speak elsewhere about the difference between morality and ethics, which many people confuse, and I think the questioner is here also: Regis Chapman's answer to Would you agree with the following statement: \"Morality has no meaning except in the context of society\"? Why or why not? Regis Chapman's answer to Do I have to be moral? Regis Chapman's answer to Can collectivist and individualist ethics coexist? Regis Chapman's answer to Do you believe that racists should die? Regis Chapman's answer to Is it better to die for one's own beliefs and morals, like Socrates did, or is it better to change the way you think, and continue to live? Regis Chapman's answer to If morals exist in our minds, then do they really matter? Kahlil Gibran: Laws Then a lawyer said, \u201cBut what of our Laws, master?\u201d And he answered: You delight in laying down laws, Yet you delight more in breaking them. Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter. But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore, And when you destroy them, the ocean laughs with you. Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent. But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers, But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness? What of the cripple who hates dancers? What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things? What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless? And of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters law-breakers? What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun? They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws. And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows? And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth? But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you? You who travel with the wind, what weathervane shall direct your course? What man's law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man's prison door? What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man's iron chains? And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man's path? People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing? Laws create the same illusion of control in a social context that our ego brings to our separate sense of identity in a personal context. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Absolutely. This is provable, too. Consider the statement \u2018objective morality does not exist\u2019. Let us use Oxford dictionary definitions for \u2018objective\u2019, \u2018morality\u2019 and \u2018exist\u2019. They are:    From these definitions, it is evident that \u2018objective\u2019 and \u2018exist\u2019 are interdependent, therefore we must introduce the terms of reference used by the definition for \u2018exist\u2019 - those are \u2018reality\u2019 and \u2018being\u2019.   Here we see a tautology emerge as a result of the definitions of \u2018exist\u2019, \u2018reality\u2019 and \u2018being\u2019. This indicates the necessity of an assumption. Further interogation of these terms in the English language is impossible. Hence, we are faced with an equivalence: existence must be objective, and necessarily so, because all available definitions according to the language in use invoke that equality. What is objective is actual, what exists is objective and being is the existence in reality which is actual. Now, consider again the statement \u2018objective morality does not exist\u2019. Let us assume this statement is true. In order to do so, we must define \u2018true\u2019:  Therefore, \u2018principles regarding the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour have no existence that is in accordance with the state of things as they actually exist in a manner not dependent on the mind\u2019. From this proposition, two disproofs become demonstrable: Firstly, the description of \u2018states of things as they actually exist\u2019 is necessarily dependent upon the presence of a mind. This is simply due to the fact that descriptions are the product of cognition. Without a mind, no states are described and thereby no facts are evident because there is nothing for them to be evident to. Hence, conflations of \u2018objectivity\u2019 with the absence of a personal perspective are necessarily false, because facts are evidently the products of perspectives. This is a superficial but definitive dismissal of \u2018objectivity\u2019 as an argument against morality, because the implication of the use of the term \u2018objective\u2019 in that sense (being independent of personal perspective) is self-contradictory by definition. More important, however, is the absurdity that is produced by the consequence of the statement \u2018objective morality does not exist\u2019 being true. If this statement is true then the presentation of the statement as a fact even if the argument was known to be invalid or unsound would be inconsequential. In simpler terms, if this statement is false then it is not wrong to present it as true even if in actual fact that falsity is known. Hence, where objective morality does not exist it is actually logically equivalent to regard false conclusions as true because no mechanism of judgement exists that might ascribe a greater value to true conclusions in comparison. Therefore, where \u2018objective morality does not exist\u2019 is an objective fact, its own reality eliminates its implications. In such a scenario, the statement \u2018objective morality does exist\u2019 is verified by the consequence of its antithesis demonstrating that objection to the assertion that objective morality exists cannot possibly be right (and treatment of morality as objective cannot possibly be wrong), therefore those objecting to the statement \u2018objective morality exists\u2019 literally and logically have no reason to do so. TL;DR - \u2018objective morality exists absolutely\u2019. Is it wrong to say so? If not, why object? ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. For any sort of moral principles to be objective, they would have to be unchanging and apply to all people in all circumstances. One way to possibly have some sort of objective morality would be to have it imposed from an external source such as a God of some sort, in which case morality becomes whatever that God says to do or not do. Unfortunately, even if you believe in a God of some sort (which I don\u2019t), using a God as the source of objective morality quickly becomes an exercise in futility because: Nobody can agree upon what, exactly, God has said to do and not do, even among members of the same religious communities.Many of the things God supposedly told his children to do and not do thousands of years ago seem to have been tailored specifically for the culture in which his children lived back then [Gee, an \u201cobjective\u201d morality that changes over time, go figure\u2026].God apparently refuses to provide any clarification today to clear up the various misinterpretations regarding his moral principles.Another way to possibly have some sort of objective morality is to claim that there are fundamental laws of nature that somehow dictate what is \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d when it comes to how we treat our fellow man. I know a number of atheists who really try to make this argument, presumably so that they can silence the theists who keep claiming that atheists can\u2019t be moral since they have no basis for objective morality. I\u2019m not swayed by this, however. First of all, I\u2019m not at all swayed by the claim that objective morality is even needed in the first place to be moral. Morality is a set of principles that govern how we act toward one another, and one can follow those principles regardless of whether those principles are based on some \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d standards or laws. Second of all, I\u2019m not convinced that there are any absolute natural laws or principles that determine (or can be used to determine) whether our actions are objectively \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cmoral\u201d. At most, I think that humans have, on the whole, an innate sense of empathy toward each other that tends to make us feel happy when others are happy and sad when others are sad, and that can certainly for the basis of a general principle of \u201ctreat others the way you want to be treated,\u201d but that only goes so far. That innate empathy often only extends to members of our immediate family or tribe, and sometimes doesn\u2019t even go that far. It is also possible to derive some general moral principles from our long experience with civilization and our experimental discovery of what sorts of laws best help a society to run smoothly. Once again, though, I these to call these in any way \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d since so many different societies and cultures throughout recorded history have come up with radically different laws. The closest thing to any sort of \u201cobjective\u201d morality I think we could ever really come up with is the simple realization that all humans are equally deserving of the same respect simply be virtue of being human. Different actions and situations may warrant different treatment, but the underlying principle of respect would remain a constant. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: nobody knows. Morality based on social customs is not and cannot be objective. Morality as we actually practice it is this type of subjective morality based on customs and tradition. There is nothing obligatory in it. Most people in any given society might agree on most moral issues but this in no way demonstrates that those moral rules are objective. They are simply societal constructs that are ingrained in people from young age and they see them as natural and \u201cobvious\u201d in most cases. If we want to base morality on objective foundation, then we need something else than mere custom or personal emotions and intuitions. These might serve society well enough but this is merely a pragmatic argument and has nothing to do with meta-ethics which is the subject matter of this question. People constantly, also here on Quora, confuse meta-ethics and practical ethics. Giving practical arguments for meta-ethical questions does not solve anything. I said that nobody knows whether objective morality exists. This is clearly true and anyone who claims to know this is lying. But the interesting thing about morality is that even if objective morality exists in some way, we have no apparent way to know anything about it. Knowing about objective morality, assuming that it exists, is obviously an epistemological question, not an ontological one. Objectice morality might exist but from practical point of view, it means nothing because we have no way to know whether our actions correspond to this objective morality. So the crucial question is not even \u201cdoes objective morality exist\u201d but rather \u201chow can we know what objective morality actually is\u201d. As far as I can tell, we have no way to know that. We might as well assume that it doesn\u2019t exist. This is what we do in most other cases when we have no evidence of something. Atheists always give this argument when talking about God: we have no evidence of God and no way to know whether God exists so we might as well assume God doesn\u2019t exist. This is reasonable and it makes exactly as much sense in the case of morality. The difference just may be that almost all people have moral intuitions and attitudes and we have a strong need for objective morality because a world with no morality is frightening. In a sense the need for objective morality, and I think almost everyone has that, might be the last one of our \u201cmetaphysical needs\u201d. People have always yearned for something deeper and more certain than the physical world we can immediately perceive. This has changed and now people are less and less religious and less superstitious. People are becoming more and more secular. But this one metaphysical need, even if not explicitly formulated in such a way, still remains: people need to believe in objective morality in some way. And objective morality can only be based on some type of metaphysical foundation, it cannot be found in nature. Nature only contains what is, not what we ought to do. So to summarize: nobody knows whether objective morality exists but we surely have a strong need to believe in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. By \u201cobjective\u201d I am going to assume \u201cprovable by the scientific method\u201d, i.e. theory and experiment. Objective morality is a concept that is forced to evolve into being and forced to persist by one specific thing, and that one thing only. Eternal existence. One of these days, some scientist somewhere is going to build a soul-detector and finally scientifically confirm what we have all known in our guts all along, that we are eternal beings with eternal souls. And two seconds after that happens, scientists are going to look at each other and say \u201cThis is why the concepts of morals and ethics evolved and persisted in human behavior. If we were not fundamentally eternal beings, such concepts would never, ever have appeared. There would have been no need for them.\u201d Here, let me explain all that again, in longer, more easily digestible fashion. You will find in the following both theory and experiment, one possible way of building a soul-detector. (The following is a line of reasoning I have posted before on Quora. All the content, every single word, including the referenced links, is entirely my own work, and it hasn\u2019t been posted anywhere except Quora, unless you count my hard drive. Here is a link to the original source: Jeff Corkern's answer to Is there any hard scientific evidence in support of life after death? ) [EXCERPT] The basic problem you have to consider\u2014-and that scientists have never, ever, considered, not even for a nanosecond\u2014-is the SUPREME threat sentients pose to a Universe. Sentients have the power to blow the Universe COMPLETELY to Hell and gone. Stephen Hawking, bless his little heart, dreamed up an elegantly simple way ONE sentient could do it by pressing a button ONCE. I will lay out the Stephen Hawking Method For Destroying The Entire Universe a little further down. So: Suppose you are a Universe Engineer. You have been handed the problem of designing a Universe that is going to evolve sentients. Sentients who, moreover, have been directly required by the Boss to possess the property of completely, totally free will. It gradually sinks in you have an INCREDIBLE design headache. How in the WORLD are you going to stop all those trillions and trillions and TRILLIONS of sentients, every single one of whom will have the theoretical capacity of destroying the entire Universe, from doing just that? While retaining completely free will? Man, that\u2019s just impossible. Just flat-out impossible. You go back and ask the Boss to let that free-will requirement go. It\u2019s just too dangerous. The Boss says: \u201cNO!\u201d Back to the drawing board. You make your coffee, grumble to yourself about impossible Bosses with their impossible demands, lean back in your chair, and you think. You think, and you think, and you think, and you think. And one day, the solution hits you out of nowhere, a bolt from the blue. You will make every single sentient\u2014-an ETERNAL being. Beings for whom existence has NO limit. This will keep your free-will-sentient-containing Universe safe for a brilliantly simple reason. Nobody sane is going to burn down their house while they are still in it. Right? And even if somebody tried, all the other free-will sentients would QUICKLY exercise their own free will and put a CRASHING halt to it. HA! THAT\u2019S IT! THAT\u2019S IT! So you immediately set up all your laws of physics so that all sentients are eternal beings. And bang, you have set up a Universe that is completely, perfectly safe from its free-will sentients. The, ahem, Boss is gonna be really, really happy with you. Please note that \u201ckeeping the Universe safe from its sentients\u201d is a totally logical, totally SCIENTIFIC, reason for believing in an afterlife. No citing religious texts. No calls for blind faith, no call to \u201cBelie-e-e-ve, brother!\u201d Just calm, clear logic. You now have a totally rational reason to go into the lab and try to build a soul-detector. Here is one possible way of doing that, based on ghost-hunter reports of \u201cbattery drain\u201d. Along with the story of the cat soul who dived through my chest. (Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it. Not just theory with me.) http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... Now, let me repeat all of the above in a more rigorous fashion. And would you like to live in a world where nobody is afraid to die? Where you personally are no longer afraid to die? It\u2019s only a single experiment away. Oh, by the way, the eventual result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls will be the complete and total destruction of all evil on Earth. See my story at the end. Life after death is real, the cold-sober scientific truth, the way the Universe works. Life after death is not a fiction or a fantasy. It is real, something vitally necessary in order for the Universe to be stable, mainly to keep the Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing the Universe the Hell up. On this one thing, the existence of the soul, those silly religious woo-woos are ABSOLUTELY right. Those moonbeam-dancing, ley-line-loving, crystal-worshiping, long-haired-hippie-freak woo-woos are totally dead-bang right. I can prove ALL of this---if you are smart enough to understand it. (Although intelligence really isn\u2019t the main problem, but rather the ability to think clearly and objectively. THAT is rare, even among scientists. THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE. Considered simply as an exercise in logic, the problem of the existence of the soul is entirely trivial.) I can prove it all by the best, most rigorous method the human race has ever found for finding the truth. The scientific method. Observation, hypothesis, and finally confirmation by testing in the lab. By building a soul-detector and detecting souls in the lab. The detecting principle, I suspect, will be rapid changes in Planck\u2019s Constant. You don\u2019t even have to use people. You can use cats. Why cats? Cat-soul dived through my chest once. Also, soul theory indicates the source of emotion is the soul, not the brain, and therefore any animal that shows emotion, in particular love, is an eternal being and has a soul. The observation and hypothesis parts I have solved. I\u2019d get the third one too, if I had the money. Alas, I don\u2019t. It would take a million bucks just to start. I continue to hope some bad-boy millionaire scientist or engineer will trip over my Quora answers one day. (You hearing this, Elon? Would you like to smash the whole damn world? I can show you how.) Let me give you the short version, then the long version. Rigorously objective analysis of human behavior reveals human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence, on quite a number of levels. Since human bodies are certainly not eternal, human beings MUST contain an eternally existing component, i.e. they must have souls. You might object something as weird as souls could only exist if the Universe had some EXTREMELY powerful need for them. You would be correct. There actually is an extremely powerful need for a Universe\u2019s sentients to ALL be eternal beings who have souls. It inhibits the sentients from destroying their Universe. If a Universe\u2019s sentients are NOT eternal beings, then the Universe logically becomes Hell. Because most sentients\u2019 lives are composed mostly of pain, and unless their existence was without limit, their pain, and their lives, would be completely meaningless. Live in Hell, and then die. Sentients would destroy any such Universe in a cosmic heartbeat. It would be the MORAL thing to do. And oh my, yes, all sentients possess the theoretical capacity to destroy the entire Universe, as one aspect of sentients is knowledge of how the Universe works, as in the ability to write down the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws and then use those laws to change the Universe around them as they see fit. Stephen Hawking embodied the entire situation perfectly. If anybody understood the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws, it was Stephen Hawking. If anybody suffered at the hands of the Universe, it was Stephen Hawking. (Return to us quickly, Stephen. We need your mind.) And waddya know, Stephen Hawking found a way to destroy the whole damn Universe. With a flick of his little finger. He has pointed out the Higgs field exists in an excited state, and that the existence of all the Universe\u2019s particles depend on the Higgs field remaining in that excited state. So, because the Higgs field exists in an excited state, the Universe contains a fundamental instability which can be used to destroy it. If the Higgs field ever drops to its ground state in any particular area, all the Universe\u2019s particles in that area will promptly disintegrate. And from that area the drop in energy (and therefore disintegration) will spread, exactly like dropping a spark into gunpowder. And the entire Universe dissolves back into the Chaos it came from. So all we have to do is build a machine that will catalyze the drop of the Higgs field to its ground state. We will only have to use it once. (Note to physicists: The initial estimate for an accelerator large enough to reach Higgs field energies and catalyze the destruction of the Universe was \u201can accelerator the size of the Solar System\u201d. Accelerator technology has rapidly evolved since. Fingernail-size accelerators have recently been constructed. Here: https://www.npr.org/sections/hea... How many of these things would you have to daisy-chain together to reach Higgs field energies, I wonder? You physicists should figure this out. And then ask yourselves why this has NOT happened, why the Universe is still there.) We punch the button\u2014-and poof, no more Universe, at the speed of light. Remember, if we all are not eternal beings, we all live in Hell, and this is the moral thing to do. The odds are pretty good the human race is NOT the first sentient species to evolve in the Universe, but no sentient species has ever actually done this. The Universe is still there. I hereby conclude this Universe\u2019s sentients are eternal beings, and there is a way to detect souls in the laboratory. That\u2019s the short version. Now the long version. Here is an essay which explores this Universe-destruction thing further. This is the rock-bottom of it all. It\u2019s ALL about keeping the Universe in one piece, man. ON THE SENTIENT CONSTRAINTS OF A SENTIENT-CONTAINING UNIVERSE http://www.theninepointfivethese... Now an exploration of the various ways human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence. (This is by no means all the ways.) If human beings possess immortal souls, it should be possibly to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions. It should be possible to show in your own personal actions. It should be possible to show you ACT like you have a soul, even when you think you don\u2019t. THE MURDER ON A BEACH THOUGHT EXPERIMENT http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... It should be possible to demonstrate the rule exists in collective action. It should be possible to demonstrate the assumption of eternal existence exists in the foundation rules of the world\u2019s stable societies, although they may not be aware of it. ON EMOTION DRUGS http://www.theninepointfivethese... The physical purpose of souls is stability. So it should be possible to demonstrate denying or removing the assumption of eternal existence results in extreme personal pain and extremely violent instability. AND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... And now one last stinger. This is for the REALLY smart people out there. The existence of souls is currently perceived as mostly an academic debate. Something that won\u2019t make much difference one way or the other. It is not. The confirmation of the existence of souls will cause the most profound change in human behavior there has ever been. This will be a scientific discovery that will cause a change in humanity\u2019s MORAL behavior, as people will finally understand it is impossible to escape the consequences of your actions. Let me illustrate this with a story. A scientist builds a soul-detector, IMMEDIATELY detects souls\u2014-and smashes the entire world. The total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth begins as the good guys are finally cut loose. Because science has now proven the MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do. AFTER THE AWAKENING https://futurism.media/after-the... This story is the future, what\u2019s about to happen, right around the corner. The Awakening is coming. [EXCERPT] Jeff Corkern -------------------------------------------------- Consider the following as a statement of logic, and rank it as \"True\" or \"False\": \"If people possess immortal souls, it should be possible to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions.\" http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com ",

            "answer_text": "Some very interesting stuff here. I am no philosopher, but I do believe that evolution happens and happened; that we are simply the products of a series of increasingly complex chemical reactions. And I find it difficult to see how such a process might be guided by some kind of morality, however one might care to concieve it. The driving force behing evolution is a series of chemical compounds with the characteristic that they can replicate imperfectly. These \u201cselfish genes\u201d are inanimate and most likely devoid of any kind of consciousness. They have no interest in self perpetuation, instead it happens as a side-effect of their onfiguration. How morality, in any objective sense, can propel random interraction among elementary particles is difficult to imagine. Assume, though, we substitute a home-cooked morality; we somehow decide what\u2019s good for us and everybody else. (Good luck with that, by the way.) But then we have the problem, another which has philosophers and scientists scratching their heads : do we actually possess free will? I have tried to follow some of the reasoning in this debate, but it still seems to be somewhat muddled, based on some rather odd-looking experimental data. Much of the data suggests that what we believe to be our conscious self becomes aware of a decision much later than it is made by an unobservable ( by us ) part of the brain. The decision is made, and then quite sometime later, we become aware of it, and, indeed believe we have made it. Now, I have no reason to believe that the part of us we call our consciousness should of necessity be our controlling agent, but this seems a little different from the assertion that we have no free will. More precisely, whatever free will we exercise may not be something to which what we refer to as conciousness is party. We are, if you like, a lumbering commitee of civil servants, incapable of reaching a decision sufficiently timely to exercise diligent custodianship of our safety, and the brain has evolved to take no notice of us most of the time. We attend meetings, formulate plans among ourselves, we chatter, but have no authority. Our role is to form bonds with others, we are the PR department. This would appear to me to make much sense, we are not, I think, very good at making decisions. Perhaps, because they are all being made for us. We do not, as a race, appear to have much useful experience of senior management. This is probably a Good Thing. Eton college seeks those whose connection with this part of the brain is more intimate. And such people will surely exist. The sort of question they ask young boys of age perhaps eleven, prospective scholars: You are Head of State. A tremendous earthquake has sent a vast tsunami toward your shores, your capital is about to flood. Circumstances are such that if the flood be allowed to proceed, you and your colleagues will almost certainly drown. The capital has an extensive network of underground transportation, protected by flood defences. If these are opened, the floodwaters will fill these tunnels, and your government will be saved. However, about 500,000 people will die. Explain your chosen course of action. I made up the question, and, please, no feasibility analysis, this is not the point. But the real questions are the same in character. And there are no prizes for guessing the answer they are looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "I say 1+1=3. You tell me. \u201cNo. You are wrong!\u201d as in regarding discrete quantities, that's impossible, improbable and inconceivable. But if I committed a crime or declared that no one owes anybody anything. That abortion was okay even if it is murder and that I enjoy telling graduates of prestigious Universities that their great School is legitimate because it is built on the skeletons of dead Indians. Legitimacy is always necessary after a blood bath. Then you'd say \u201cNo!!! You are wrong. You are selfish.\u201d as if it were as equivalent. The central reason why many prefer to have the good opinion of others is: (a) the natural wish to be liked and popular, (b) the social and material advantages which follow from that, (c) the personal pleasure derived from being needed. Morality is a currency of policies as such we have no self but we understand each other based on these things. By seeking the comfort and advantage that follows from being accepted as a normal member of society, the individual is merely striving, at primal level, to have his self-opinion reinforced by others. Morality is a tonic for the weak man, a means of reinforcing the necessity of his unlived life, a wishful jejune abstention from the sins of others, morality can fool man into believing he has found a genuine high price to pay in not being wealthy, getting the promotion and as such this is merely an insurance policy in the past it served as a ticket to heaven but now it means that he/she has the support of the community to fall back on. People bond best over morality like a Stockholm syndrome, a mutual feeling of sympathy. The man who fears accusations of being insufficiently sensitive or sophisticated may be sensitive about his intellect and credentials and by his fear and shame, he is controlled as such a man's moral passions are his weaknesses. Ironically, the attempt to attain a consensus of good opinion simultaneously generates the envy, and therefore, the resentful vindictiveness, of others competing for the same good graces. Man socially advances himself invariably at the expense of others, for the pleasure of feeling superior to others. This is the tonic made for the 99% who need conceptual deception to acquire status. The poor man has a means with which to be haughty towards the king without putting himself on the line, by including all others in his attack, he may be seen as a hero. And those who exalt themselves through the good opinion of their superiors, do so chiefly by deferring to the judgment of same rather than relying upon their own. Good reputation \u2014 or public virtue \u2014 can reasonably be perceived as being rooted in applied flattery, personal vanity and self-interest. There are benefits to having consensus on one's side even wealth and power is created interpersonally but this implies it is not possible to test the limits of morality and get away with it, enjoying perhaps more social inclusion than others. Thus the bottom-line is politeness, false modesty and pretences to the selfish man not virtues. One can do whatever they want under the pretence of justice, to gather consensus is a tactic of all intelligence agencies. The majority of people, rightly or wrongly, regardless of geographical location, believe that we all know instinctively what is the right thing to do in all matters simply by standing back and applying our own decisions to ourselves \u2014 \u2018Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u2019 But Bernard Shaw spotted the flaw in that idealistic argument: \u2018Do not do unto others as you would have them do unto you. You might not share the same tastes.\u2019 And, unfortunately, most people are not positioned to do what they would like to see done to the high and mighty who invariably escape the rigours of the law as though by divine right. Notwithstanding, we continue to believe we know what is cruel or kind, selfish or selfless, fair or unfair, etc. Yet we endlessly struggle to explain \u2014 to ourselves and to others \u2014 why we are in conflict with such behavioural norms. There are differing accents within the moral boundaries of one\u2019s own unavoidably subjective system, whose familiarity makes what we do personally acceptable, particularly if our actions are consciously part of a larger, though expediently veiled, socially dictated pragmatism. Self-conscious good or evil is equally counterfeit. Spontaneity in the enactment of both is the essential mark of purity and distinction. Only self-flattering poseurs claim predominant ownership of good or evil. Without exception we fluctuate between the two, both qualities being regulated mainly by social conditioning. The vibrancy of evil requires the threat of external force for its containment, and the drive to be good requires narcissistic self-interest or delusions of grandeur. The majority of people naturally enjoy the idea of running with the fox. But their heads, their pack instinct and keen sense of self-survival, urge them to ride more safely with the hounds. A self-fulfilling prophecy of immorality belies moral character. Is it not unwieldy to assume that no conditions are testable? Don't take my kindness for weakness is an oxymoron if it is genuine. Goodness implies passivity not drive and enterprise in which case\u2026 Morality and moral superiority is always brought up in context of the big guy and the little guy. Thus it seems negatively correlated with success. The morality of the herd animal is always incomprehensible to a human being. Now, think about what I just said: \"The morality of the herd animal is always incomprehensible to a human being.\" Conversely, the \"lack of morality,\" which means unmasking group fictions, horrifies the herd. A herd animal requires consensus morality because he is not a master\u2014nor can he be satisfied by anyone including himself. The herd animal is different in kind. The danger the herd animal senses when he meets a true individual is real for him and the moralities he requires to contain his neighbor are necessary for him. But remember, necessity is never a virtue. It is common that very often people with an inferiority complex adopt this line of reasoning and related action. They overdevelop a skill, trait or degree of contemptuous reaction to compensate for their actual or imaginary deficiencies in other fields. In extreme cases of upward-spiraling psychotic paranoia, if this blinkered approach flounders and eventually proves to be unsuccessful, the individual will perceive himself as a victim and cast about for scapegoats of his own. The transference of hatred or revenge is usually concentrated upon individuals or established authorities which most symbolize the source of obstruction/frustration initially experienced. In some cases not only the object of hatred can be symbolized or connoted, but also the original target. In other words, instead of persevering in the attempt to achieve what he really desired, an attempt which he subconsciously believed would lead to failure and loss of self-esteem, he perversely sets out to degrade or destroy the object of desire. But the subconscious truth goads him to escalating excesses, by which he vainly hopes to convince himself both superior and impervious to the previous attraction. These people devalue the source of their frustration and envy. They find faults, unattractive features, high costs to pay, immorality in everything they really most desire and aspire to and in everyone who has attained that which they so often can't. They walk amongst us, critical and self-righteous, inflated with a justice of their making and secure in the wisdom of being what they are rather than what they could have been and really wish to be. They make a virtue of jejune abstention, of wishful constipation, of judgemental neutrality, this oxymoron, the favourite of the disabled.\" There are those who idealize the successful and the rich and the lucky. They attribute to them super-human, almost divine, qualities. They think of serendipity as earned, of work as bestowed, of success as deserved and reserved to the deserving. In an effort to justify the agonizing disparities between themselves and others, they humble themselves as they elevate the others. They reduce and diminish their own gifts, they disparage their own achievements, they degrade their own possessions and look with disdain and contempt upon their nearest and dearest, who are unable to discern their fundamental shortcomings. They feel worthy only of abasement and punishment. Besieged by guilt and remorse, voided of self-esteem, self-hating and self-deprecating - this is by far the more dangerous species. For he who derives contentment from his own humiliation cannot but derive happiness from the downfall of others. Indeed, most of them end up driving the objects of their own devotion and adulation to destruction and decrepitude. The truly strong find it inefficient to exploit weak individuals by physical violence. Direct exploitation runs a risk of revolt and a reduction in gross profits. The social contract allows the strong to exploit the weak without fear of their own blood being shed. Blood is too expensive for the strong. Insurance policies are cheaper and more profitable. When physical violence is seen as necessary and the goal is reached, the first act of the victor is to outlaw the use of further physical violence. Like all governments, America was founded on violence and has survived on violence. Yet when individuals act violently to assure their existence they are beaten-up by the system. Then the leaders tell the victims that violence is not a solution to their problems. The social contract allows the development of a class of individuals which act as a protective buffer between the upper and lower classes. This is the middle class. The worst of these is the upper-middle class. This subgroup is intellectual, cowardly and inflated, and prefers lawyers and slight of hand to guns. They use law to steal from each other. They make the weaker minded impotent by using metaphysical concepts such as right and wrong, good and bad, moral and immoral. They use law to commit murder, they use law to steal and they use law to make impotent those who might rise against them. This they call education. What they want is \"more.\" Too much competition is dangerous so they create more laws and regulations making it more difficult to compete with them. Law is the ultimate act of camouflage. The upper-middle class (UMC) label these laws as necessary to protect weaker people from being exploited. This assertion is the bait which most everyone can agree with because everyone from time to time feels weak and dependent. Boiled down, the whole procedure is a \"club\" with various levels of initiation. Culture is nothing more than agreed upon lies. Every conclusion is a lie. (If you sense a contradiction in this statement, note that my conclusion about conclusions is at a different level of abstraction\u2014a meta-level.) When we use such words as \"society,\" \"culture,\" and \"mind\" we believe we are speaking factually and not talking in metaphor. Society, culture and mind do not exist at the same level of concreteness as a swift kick in the ass. They are ideas that are associated with certain weak definitions and \"personal\" feelings. When we speak of society we speak of a set of assertions which are publicly shared. Like waving a flag, spouting assertions gets people moving. A society is really a group of cliches based on selected fictions. In simple language a society is a construction. It does not have the same quality of \"existence\" as the individuals which make it up. Yet we respond to words with more intensity and feeling than we do to the sight of blood. To understand what we call a society we simply have to look at its fictions. But before we study fictions in detail the first fiction we are told is that a particular set of fictions are not fictions. Logic asserts that like cases are alike. This is fine, but in reality there are no \"like cases.\" We only assume like cases for convenience. Logic applies to closed systems that allow us, by a process of elimination, to come up with the one right answer. In open systems logic fails\u2014and rightfully so. The herd animal is terrified\u2014but he is horrifying in his pretense of being human. He can and will do anything to keep his safety\u2014to pay the rent. Secretly he is proud of his cowardice\u2014he believes he can survive at any cost\u2014to you. This is the same behavior as the Nazis. The Nazi in the death camp was an ordinary man who was paying his rent and protecting his family. This fact alone horrifies the middle class since it uncovers who they really are\u2014Nazis in the making. It doesn't take much to turn almost anyone into a Nazi. Morality is nothing more than cocktail glasses clanking at a Christmas party. All \"morality\" is irresponsible and cowardly. It does not require independent thought or action or responsibility. Herd morality is for cowards. The weaker we are the more we require someone to remind us that the present has been built on a logical development of \"divine purposes\" and \"natural consequences.\" Your worth or value is always determined by how you will benefit the herd. Thus, every society and every individual is always discriminating in its best interests\u2014never yours. You will always lose even if the other person thinks they are helping you. In the end you must be responsible for yourself even if you do not know who you are. Do not seek to know yourself because there is no self. If you observe yourself you will find this out. If what I said is true did Socrates lie when he said, 'Wo thy Self?\" Never be fooled by the herd-animal's mysticism or philosophy\u2014they are always serving themselves first, but they are always disguising their interests by stating that they are serving you. Later they will punish you for what they are doing. Most great works go \"unnoticed\" particularly if they threaten the hypocrisy of the upper-middle and middle class parasite. For those who do not understand these parasites let me say that they are the ones who claim to be serving higher principles when in fact they are simply serving themselves. In essence they are cowards who seek power and status through conceptual deception. There is no way of knowing how a disappointment will affect history. The study of Hitler reveals one simple fact: once you study Hitler there is no longer any need to study politics. The Hitler episode is the one and only \"course\" necessary to understand the very complex subject called \"political science.\" Another phrase for political science: overcompensation for an inferiority complex. Most members of the human species are herd animals. Similar to domesticated sheep and cows they contentedly and proudly strut to the market to be slaughtered. Unlike other herd animals, however, humans believe they are individuals with a free-will and a mind of their own. Humans can't tolerate insecurity, disappointment, or frustration very well. Like many others, Hitler knew this fact very well. What was Hitler's regime\u2014The\u2014We Mentality. Security Programs\u2014Identification with a Hero\u2014Guarantees\u2014Someone To Blame for Misfortune\u2014Freedom as Obedience\u2014Enemies\u2014A Sense of Superiority Based on the \"We\"\u2014Sacrifice for the \"We.\" What embarrassed mankind so much about Hitler's existence? He showed them how capable they were. He showed them what an inferior person could do when sufficiently angered. Civilization (pays for) utility and docility. Utility is the ability an individual \"has\" to function \"as\" a service. Docility is simply the payment an individual makes for being allowed to serve as a function. EVERY WEAK MAN MUST BELIEVE IN THE MORAL NECESSITY OF HIS CATEGORIES. THIS IS BASED ON HIS INABILITY TO RELY ON HIS STRENGTH TO ENFORCE HIS OWN DESIRES ON HIMSELF.  This same action is carried out in chess where we imagine a new existence where possible moves are impossible, the very game is a thing of make-believe. We would then like to apply this principle to reality but with little empirical results for our moral superiority. ",

            "answer_text": "I read the other answers and there is something that hasn't been said. What is the foundation of morality? Morality always follows a purpose. If you don't want anything, then there is no good or bad. Lewis Caroll put it very well in his famous book when Alice asks the Chesire cat for help because she is lost in the woods (Disney movie script): A - I only wanted to ask you which way I ought to goC - Well, that depends on where do you want to get toA - Well, it really doesn't matter...C - Then it really doesn't matter, which way you go. When you have a purpose, goods are the objects, situations or decisions that lead you to achieve that purpose. And the things that avoid you from achieving it, become bad. Try to make a mental exercise. All you value as good or bad is following a personal, social or instinctive purpose. Examples are having comfort, security, a stable society, food and most of them are related to keeping the life going, not only yours, since life is never alone. As in every game, when two people share purposes, they share moral values. That is precisely why society happens at all. People realize they could help each other in a win-win situation when they worked together, and achieve things that alone would never be able to. Honesty and communications are clearly necessary for this to happen. Most people say, for religious or secular reasons, that we all have a common purpose, like staying alive, and therefore the morals come straight away equal for every one. That is not true. Even when our nature pushes us all in the same instincts, we are free sentient beings, whose most intrinsic right is to decide what to do and what to love. Therefore, there is no single moral value that can be imposed on everyone. Still, if you don\u2019t share the purposes of a society, there is no point for you to live within it, and therefore such kind of people are rejected in exile, or in death when nowhere else to go. At this point, it would be really interesting to introduce another concept: Obligation. Nobody es ever literally obliged to take any decision, what pushes you to take one decision or another is living in a society and accepting the purposes that sustain that society standing. Most of times, societies have ways to determine the behaviour of their members even when the members have never thought about the needs of the society. That is why most of the people don't understand why they have to do certain things until they grow up. Some never know, they are just sheep that are given purposes and rules. Another very interesting question is where purposes come from, and if they are random or fixed to experience or what.  The topic of consciousness arises tall and sharp. A faint idea that comes to my mind is the \"staying alive\" as the song says, and more than that \"staying\" because not everything is alive. Hope this helps :) Please comment, I would like to be criticized! ",

            "answer_text": "Both the laws of the universe and the laws of morality are inviolable. These laws are not legislated. They are laws in the sense there are no exceptions. The universe is governed by physical laws. Mankind is governed by moral laws.  If the laws of the universe were violated (e.g., killing a baby ended world hunger) morality would be violated. This shows morality is inviolable. Morality is based on the link between cause and effect. The aforementioned thought experiment poses a solution for world hunger which reflects contempt for human well-being. Valid morality is based on our biological nature as human beings. Humans everywhere require food, water and shelter. A theory of morality, once divorced from reality, has no bearing on rational value systems. The fact that people everywhere have an aversion to killing a baby shows there are moral absolutes. Morality collapses when cause and effect are severed. We live in an ordered universe. No human being could live in a world where the thought experiment was valid, nor would she want to. All human actions would yield unpredictable results. Thus any action would be impossible. Action would yield results opposed to the purpose of that action.  Humankind would be helpless without the link between cause and effect. Morality depends on human agency. Thought experiments which severe cause and effect posit a world where evil accomplishes good. In such a world there is no human agency and no morality. In such a world, someone could not make the decision to kill the baby because that person would have no agency. The scenario is perverse. Its premise is a world where actions and consequences are divorced. In such a world, even the most repugnant acts are feasible.  Morality is impossible in a world where the link between cause and effect is severed. A person could no sooner play baseball if the path of a thrown ball could not be predicted. This is the categorical refutation for moral thought experiments which deny cause and effect. Objective morality is based in a world where human agents control their actions and predict the results.

It must, by definition, always be subjective. There is no objective moral relationship between a rock and a river. There is no universal moral field where force carriers of morality--call them \"morons\" if you will--govern the moral interaction between other particles.  Morality is relative to human behavior and human action. What is moral? What is immoral? Harming other people unnecessarily is immoral. I like the way Terry Pratchett summed it up in the book Carpe Jugulum: \u201cAnd that\u2019s what your holy men discuss, is it?\u201d \u201cNot usually. There is a very interesting debate raging at the moment about the nature of sin, for example.\u201d  \u201cAnd what do they think? Against it, are they?\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that.

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a simple way to answer this question. Definition of \u2018objective\u2019: Neutral (bias free), relating to, or based on verifiable evidence or facts instead of on attitude, belief, or opinion. Definition of \u2018morality\u2019: Conformance to a recognized code, doctrine, or system of rules of what is right or wrong and to behave accordingly. Now that we have the definitions, let\u2019s substitute them for the words themselves: Can \u2018morality\u2019 be \u2018objective\u2019? = Can a system, code, or doctrine of rules that is recognized be neutral, free from attitudes, beliefs, or opinions, and verified empirically? The answer is no. Morality, by its very definition, is derived from an outside, subjective force that has seen fit to codify behavior into \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019 columns for a reason. Whether that reason is religious, political, logical, ethical, or economical is besides the point as they all have infusions of attitudes, beliefs, or opinions within them. Morality cannot be empirically proven as being objective yet there are a select group who do attempt to do so: moral absolutists. The absolutists hold that morality has absolute standards against which moral questions can be judged, and that certain actions are either good or evil, regardless of the context of the act. They attempt to prove that morals have a universal hold that cross all barriers and therefore can represent an \u2018objective\u2019 standard with which to answer moral questions. The problem is that this cannot be proven empirically. Example: The Sun is the center of the Solar System.Empirically provable. Fact.Murder is wrong.Cannot be empirically proven. Opinion.A fact is objective, an opinion is subjective. Morality is essentially codified opinion, it cannot possibly be objective in any circumstance. ",

            "answer_text": "The difference between an objective moral and a subjective one, is that an objective moral is always true, in that, there are no scenarios that change its applicability. A subjective moral is one that depends upon the circumstances\u2026essentially requiring judgement to determine right from wrong. So, not killing SOUNDS objective, but, we generally agree its OK for a cop to kill a shooter spraying a crowd with machine gun fire, or a soldier to kill the enemy, etc\u2026making it subjective. Not stealing sounds objective, but, if you are captured and held against your will, and being starved, and steal some bread from your captor\u2026is that morally wrong? And so forth. Its hard to find examples of truly objective morals. \u201cBe Fair\u201d or \u201cBe Kind\u201d might be an objective morals\u2026.but fairness or kindness, for example, are subjective, and so forth. So, for a moral to be able to work without requiring context or judgement, is elusive. and, societies will simply disagree upon what is right and wrong based upon geographical and societal mores. A good example might be asking if its immoral for a grown man to walk around with his genitalia exposed in public, in front of children. If the man is in the Amazon (The Jungle), no one would consider it as even notable let alone wrong to do. If the man is in Amazon (The Store), typically, everyone would consider it to be very wrong, and, typically, he\u2019d be arrested, etc. What is different about his genitals in the Amazon, that kept it from being immoral to allow them to be viewed in public? Nothing\u2026.all that changed was the context. Societal mores in the Amazon are simply different than at Amazon\u2026and the same act is not immoral, or, is immoral, depending upon the context. In the American West, for native americans, stealing horses was about the same as beating someone in a sport\u2026not a moral issue at all. It was simply a thing you did to get horses. When the settlers arrived, stealing a horse was a giant crime, punishable by death (Hanging typically). Stealing a HORSE was very immoral and a killing offense, but, stealing a wagon was not as bad, etc. To the native americans, \u201cstealing\u201d was not how they viewed getting your horse\u2026so when you hang one for doing it, the native americans are freeked out by the hugely disproportional reaction\u2026and cannot even see the two actions as possibly connected. So, taking your horse is mere sport to one, and a grave sin to the other\u2026yet, the act of taking a horse is not changing, just the context. And so forth. :D ",

            "answer_text": "I see morality as just an extended form of \"self\" preservation. Some people, and animals, have a very limited sense of \"self\" that applies only to them. Many people, and animals, have a sense of \"self\" that extends to their family, who they care about as much as themselves. Some people and animals have an even larger sense of \"self\" that extends to the whole tribe/pack/herd. Humans just have a more complex mentality, have a larger understanding of the world around them, and have developed various ways to group themselves, like by race, religion, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, political beliefs, sports teams, etc., etc., etc. Some, though rare, can even extend their sense of \"self\" to all humanity, or even all living things. There\u2019s no sign of objective moral standards. The best thing we\u2019ve got is to try and convince people that our moral standards are better. Because it is based on \u201cself\u201d preservation, it helps to have people consider what they\u2019d like to happen, in certain situations. I don\u2019t want to be randomly killed. You don\u2019t want to be randomly killed. So, with easy ones like this, we can easily come up with a consensus of the vast majority, that randomly killing people is wrong. Then, we make a law against randomly killing people. I\u2019d like to be able to say what I want. You\u2019d like to be able to say what you want. So, we come up with a consensus of the vast majority, making it a right to be able to say what you want. There are numerous things that the vast majority of people in the world will agree on. That still doesn\u2019t make the moral standard objective, because it\u2019s still based on us putting our subjective value against being killed and wanting to speak. We didn\u2019t discover we\u2019re valuable in some science experiment. We just decided we are. It becomes tougher the closer to 50/50 opinion on the matter we get. These are often things we find wrapped up in political parties. Is it immoral to take money away from someone who was successful in acquiring it? Or, is it immoral to let people starve, live on the street, have no education, etc.? Some people are very much individualists. They have the smaller sense of \u201cself\u201d, in my opinion. While I think individual freedoms are quite important, I also think there are some minimums we should do to help others in our society, and even others in the world. Many political debates are individual well being vs group well being. The group minded might point at studies showing that gun control makes society, as a whole, safer. The individual minded might point at someone saving themselves by shooting a bad guy. Even if there are lower rates of gun violence with gun control, they don\u2019t want to be in that small percentage still being attacked, without having a way to defend themselves. Religion can also pit the individual against the group. The group might think they need to weed out anything they consider immoral, while such weeding might not be very good for a lot of individuals. Other groups might find what another group to be doing highly immoral, and vice versa. Sometimes the group is right. Sometimes the individual is right. Sometimes one group is right. Sometimes another group is right. But, of course, that\u2019s my opinion. Even if we can agree on most things, those remaining differences can cause a lot of grief. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Do you believe there is objective morality? Answer: Thank you for the A2A. Let\u2019s start by breaking the word into its two components: Objective: Independent of the Observer or in this case Definer. Opposite of Subjective which is dependent on the Observer/Definer Morality: Principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. (Oxford Dictionary). Often confused with Ethics. Ethics: The rules of conduct recognized in respect to a particular class of human actions or a particular group or culture. Morals are a more individual based set of principles and ethics are a more universal set of rules of conduct. Now add to this the fact that our species are mammals and really just civilized animals and therefore, like all animals, we have certain traits that help define us as a species. We have evolved from a family based unit of wanders to a societal/communal based group. With this our codes of conduct and definition of right and wrong has changed. When the family unit was primary, then any outside force that was unknown could be deemed as a threat and handled. It would not have been considered murder anymore than killing the Tiger that was stalking your family, because we were once in the middle of the food chain, would be considered murder. Then these family groups started bonding together for shared security. Suddenly the perspective changed from an \u201cI\u201d to a \u201cWE\u201d or \u201cUS\u201d. Focus on the survival of the group outweighed the survival of any one individual. With larger groups came changes in what was consider right and wrong. For example: When the population of the tribe was small and life expectancy was not very high, reproduction was a primary focus for the long term survival of the tribe. This translates into 1) a lower acceptable age of consent (not that it was called age of consent back then). In every other species, age of maturity means age of reproductive ability and our earliest ancestors most likely thought the same thing. 2) Non acceptance of unions which would not increase the population of the tribe meaning same gender unions. If we look at the religious texts throughout time we see that 1) age of maturity is considered to be the Puberty and that getting married at this point was acceptable and 2) homophobic gods which detest homosexual activity in the human species but allows it in other animals. So is there such a thing as an Objective Morality. In my opinion the answer is NO. Morally Acceptable Behaviors change over time and are a reflection of the security of the community. Empathy is an evolution trait that permits individuals to live in a group setting and most Morals revolve around Empathy towards others. In today\u2019s world, in small tribes you still see young teens having babies and being married. You still see an acceptance of incest. You still see that outsiders are deemed as a threat to the security of the group and are treated accordingly. In today\u2019s \u201ccivilized\u201d world, we are still Tribal, it is just that our tribes can be counted in the Millions and therefore the survival of our Tribe is not a daily concern. Most of the world does not even think about the possibility of our species no longer existing. If the moral laws of our society are really Objective then they would be Universal. They would not be affect by Time. They would not be affect by the size and strength of the Tribe. There is Group/Tribal Subjective Morality and then there is Individual Subjective Morality. As most of the time these align our species has thrived. They align because they are both based on Empathy, not on some commandments put forth by some super-powerful entity. The idea of Objective Morality only exists because we have invented gods and given them ownership over Life, Death and Morality. Those who feel the need to give a god mastery over morality tend to think that those without a god (Atheists) and those that worship other gods (Heretics and Pagans and such) have no foundation upon which a moral framework can rest. This is absurd of course. I know some Theist that have very low morals because they believe that if the seek forgiveness it will be given so they have a get out of jail free card. Not all Theists think this way so if you are reading this and you are a Theist and you don\u2019t think this way then great but don\u2019t respond by either 1) accusing me of generalizing or 2) telling me I am wrong, that no Theist in your particular group would behave badly because they have a get out of jail free card called Forgiveness. I also know some Theist that have very high moral standards and try their best to live by the codes set up in their scriptures. But guess what you Atheists haters out there\u2026.the same exists for Atheists. There are some who have very low standards and some who have very high standards. The only difference is that the Atheist neither blames a supernatural entity for their bad behavior nor gives praise to a supernatural entity for their good behavior. ",

            "answer_text": "Does objective morality exist? If you mean \u201cobjective\u201d in the sense that science aims to be \u201cobjective\u201d, then no. The idea of objectivity comes out of the development of science, which attempts to create description of the phenomenon independent of any particular person or observer. Objectivity in science is based on the idea that the physical universe (steel beams, quarks, light, combustion, etc.) operates according to universal laws. The \u201chypothetical-deductive\u201d model of science is as follows: The hypothetico-deductive model or method is a proposed description of the scientific method. According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that can be falsifiable, using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. So, to test your hypothetical law, you make a prediction about how a physical process would run, then run an experiment to see if that is indeed what happens. A parallel assumption for human life would be that there are universal human moral laws. Some religions are examples of this assumption, including Islam, Christianity and Buddhism. Others, such as Shinto, Hinduism, Jainism and Judaism make no assumption. Their moral or ritual laws apply only to their own followers. The Law of Karma might be an apparent exception, except that you never really know when an ancient religious teacher was speaking, who they meant, for it was not uncommon for \u201ceverybody\u201d or \u201call humans\u201d to mean \u201call of us\u201d: other tribes and peoples being seen as barbarians or non-humans. But let\u2019s take a universal approach (similar to physics) and assume that there are \u201cobjective\u201d, i.e. universal moral laws. Then we could apply the hypothetico-deductive method was tell us to figure out the law, and then test it via experiment. Many religious laws have consequences if you break them, so we might say: assume there\u2019s a law against adultery, then those who commit adultery must suffer consequences. We track some adulterers and see that this problematic. First, some adulterers will be met with real-world punishment by their community. They might even be put to death. But we also know that other adulterers won\u2019t meet with any punishment, so that\u2019s not a universal consequences. Other religions might say, yes, well, even those that aren\u2019t found out meet with punishments in an afterlife. The problem here is way have no way of observing an afterlife. Well, maybe there are consequences to adultery that are not social and not supernatural, but are \u201cnatural\u201d. For instance, let\u2019s say that adulterers tend to be more anxious or depressed or sad than faithful spouses. In other words, a human psychological law. The problem here is that such psychological laws are always statistical, not absolute. There are always exception, including, for instance, psychopaths, who don\u2019t care about the effects of their actions on other people. They lack empathy. So they can hurt others and feel no hurt themselves. Again: not universal. Jason, one of the other respondents, suggested that \u201cImagine a society where there is no presumption of honesty, where telling the truth wasn't expected. Communication would quickly break down, because we would have no reason to believe anything anyone told us.\u201d I think he\u2019s on the right track, because what he\u2019s suggesting is the sociological or anthropological view that morality is not built in to the structure of reality, but rather created over time by societies to regulate human groups. So, as Jason says, if there are no strictures around truth-telling or honesty, groups might have a hard time functioning. However, it\u2019s a little complicated by the following: Evolutionary theory tells us that groups can do quite well even if 100% of their members don\u2019t follow the rules. Mathematical game-theoretic modelling shows in fact that society a certain level of deviance without falling apart. In fact the modelling shows that there is a certain level of deviance is almost guaranteed, because at low levels, the deviants benefit. If the level of deviance rises above a certain level, then society starts falling apart, and everybody starts suffering the consequences. I once spoke to a Canadian police officer who was doing duty in post-Independence East Timor. I asked him whether he thought that the level of criminality was higher than elsewhere, or lower. He said it was just about the same everywhere: about 4% of the population get up to no good. He further said if that rises to 8%, the place becomes ungovernable. I don\u2019t whether there\u2019s any basis for these exact numbers, but the principle of what he saying accords with the mathematical modelling. So again: not universal. In a socially constructed morality, some people will not follow the rules, and completely get away with it, and the society as a whole will not operate on 100% morality, but tends towards an equilibrium of say 96% morality. Finally, the problem of universality fails on the grounds of \u201cthe same everywhere.\u201d If there was a universal, objective morality, then you would find it everywhere. But we don\u2019t find. Even within a single religion, say Christianity, there is no moral agreement. You can watch these disagreements take place all the time. And if you look between religions, or between societies, or between historical epochs, you see even more moral differences. You might think \u201cDon\u2019t kill\u201d for instance is a good candidate for universality, but the way its interpreted means that it means different things to different people. It can mean: don\u2019t kill at all, or except if they committed a serious crime, or except in case of war, or only don\u2019t kill your own tribe, or kill to prevent more deaths in future, etc. What at first what looks like one moral law, in fact turns out to be many. One way you could maintain the objective morality is like this: The morality of my group is true, everyone else is broken or false. Now there are groups in history which have maintained this position. European colonial powers definitely thought that they were civilised, and most of the rest of the world were savages. Though the UK was likely to say that they where the truly civilised, and the French not so much. And both might agree that the Germans, not at all. Similarly, there are Christian sects in existence who believe that they, and only they and their members, get to heaven, and everybody else is out of luck. But this runs into another important part of scientific objectivity: replication. Replication exists to protect science against bias, error and out-and-out fraud. The idea is that if you run an experiment based on the hypothetic-deductive method, it\u2019s not by itself considered valid. It\u2019s only valid if anyone in the world, carrying out the experiment for themselves, sees the same result. Of course, this ideal is tempered by the fact that you need a certain degree of training and equipment. But it shouldn\u2019t matter whether you are Inuit or Brazilian or Afghanistani\u2014an objective law should work the same for each and every person, independent of culture, belief or bias. No matter who is walking across it, a bridge engineered according to scientific laws should still stand up. People of faith may believe that there are invariant laws of human behaviour, and that these laws are external or independent of humans\u2014either because they are ordained by a divine power, or because they are built into the structure of the universe. But these claims to universal applicability are not objective, because objectivity is a scientific concept, and these claims cannot be scientifically tested. ",

            "answer_text": "Does objective morality exist? Is morality even a thing? There is a very wide gulf between these two suppositions! Morality is relative, but it is not arbitrary. Morality consists of the framework of rules and principles that govern interpersonal and sometimes personal behavior in the socialized individual. It is not, as the less educated often believe, fixed, as in handed down from God. Rather, it is shaped to fit the needs of the society in which the moral principles apply. That means that while certain moral principles can be commonly observed, such as the golden rule principles (do unto others as you would have others do unto you), none of these principles are sacrosanct and in many regards moral systems vary by time and place. Morality is ultimately about what benefits society, and what benefits society is what allows a society to propagate and prosper. If a society\u2019s moral principles harm it, that society is likely to fail and take its moral principles with it. The moral principles of Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan serve as a very clear example of that. Japan\u2019s aggressive behavior would have seemed perfectly normal at one time in history; in those days, the aggressive formation of empire was met with admiration rather than condemnation. But Japan made the mistake of seeking empire when the age of empire was coming to an end. So it is a mistake to think that morality is fixed, but it is equally naive to suppose that it is arbitrary. The moral imperative to shelter travelers was so important in Ancient Greece that the gods were said to punish those who violated it. Today, we have hotels. ",

            "answer_text": "To me it\u2019s not reasonable to assume anything unless you\u2019re willing to test your assumptions and discover for yourself whether there is anything real to them or not. Do you want to assume an objective morality in your mind or discover it through direct experience? The problem most people have in considering objective morality is they try to approach it intellectually or they hold to some ideas they grew up believing with blind faith. Is there some sort of system or code of behavior that could be is applicable to all people in all situations and always leads to the best outcomes? Well no, there is no such morality or ethics at the level of codified behavior that you could learn intellectually that\u2019s sophisticated enough to cover all bases. Every attempt at this has failed or is at the least no longer relevant or helpful. So then either objective morality doesn\u2019t exist or it exists beyond the intellect\u2019s grasp. The latter is proving itself to be true more and more in my experience. And I\u2019m not talking about biological instincts or bodily emotions. There is something deeper within us and you don\u2019t need to be conventionally religious in the slightest to know what I\u2019m talking about. Hasn\u2019t there been a time in your life when you did something, usually for others, that you couldn\u2019t really explain why but afterwards and even during it you felt that there was something deeply right about what you did? Some claim there are biological, evolutionary reasons for these altruistic moments but to me that\u2019s someone with a hammer looking for a nail, or someone attempting to fit the mystery of life into a neat little box. Could there not be a greater order to life beyond what we can perceive with our physical senses and our instruments tied to them? Do you not have an awareness of this? And if there is intelligent life not only in our one world, but in billions of worlds across the galaxy and universe, life so different from us\u2026 how then could a few human ideas constitute a morality that holds true across a whole universe of diverse intelligent life? It becomes like a joke. That is why I see true morality as having a fundamental Source that is beyond this world and beyond the physical universe. You can call it God but if that word bothers you substitute something else. If you truly seek to know if there is objective morality or not, then to my mind you will have to confront your relationship with God, with all Life, beyond the realm of ideas and concepts. I want to share with you an excerpt from what\u2019s called the New Message from God that touches on morality and I believe is very relevant to your question. Again, you don\u2019t have to believe in God to gain benefit from this. And if you do believe, your beliefs about God may be challenged. I think it\u2019s very appropriate that a New Message from God would do so. Here the term Greater Community refers to all intelligent life in the universe and Knowledge refers to the deeper spiritual intelligence, the moral foundation that God has put within all intelligent life (What is God? - The New Message from God): In the Greater Community, God is Knowledge. In the Greater Community, God is experience. In the Greater Community, God is the communication of profound insight and recognition from one to another, permeating all manifest life. This comes into being in the realm of your experience. God seems like different things to different people and to different races of beings in the Greater Community, but the essential experience that ignites the desire for God, the awareness of God and the relationship with God is the same everywhere. This religious impulse, the impulse towards union with God, is universal. Though it seems remarkably absent in some cultures and aberrantly expressed in others, the impulse is the same. What God is must be expressed in terms of your range of experience and your capacity for experience. In the Greater Community, God is so total and complete that any definition would always falter and fail. Therefore, let us say that God is the experience of total relationship. You can experience this for a moment here and there and for longer periods should you prepare in The Way of Knowledge. This is an experience which can both be translated from one world to another and shared and demonstrated from one being to another, bypassing and transcending all divergences of race, culture, temperament and environment. This is God. God for you is God in action. God for you is an experience that is unlike any other experience in life, yet this experience gives meaning to all of your other experiences. In the Greater Community, God is complete. In your world, God is a God of your world, a God of your race, a God of your history, a God of your temperament, a God of your fears and aspirations, a God of your great heroes, a God of your great tragedies, a God that is related to your tribe and your time. But in the Greater Community, God is so much greater, so complete\u2014beyond the definitions of any race, beyond the history of any race, beyond the temperament, fears and aspirations of any race, beyond the grasp of any individual or collective philosophy. And yet, you find God in a pure impulse, in a timeless moment of recognition, in the desire to act beyond the sphere of your own personal interests and motives, in the recognition of another, in the motive to give, in the inexplicable experience of affinity. These are translatable. This is God in action. For you, this is God. You must think of God now in the Greater Community\u2014not a human God, not a God of your written history, not a God of your trials and tribulations, but a God for all time, for all races, for all dimensions, for those who are primitive and for those who are advanced, for those who think like you and for those who think so differently, for those who believe and for those for whom belief is inexplicable. This is God in the Greater Community. And this is where you must begin. To believe in the God of the Greater Community is too great an attempt because you will realize that your race is small and the universe is great. Here you will be focusing on a God not of your world and of your time but a God of all worlds and all times. What kind of theology or philosophy can embody a God of this magnitude? What kind of human speculation and human ethics can encompass a God so complete as this? Yet your theology of God must be the theology of God\u2019s work in this world. And if it is true, accurate and beneficial, it must focus on the experience of Knowledge. Knowledge is the beginning of religion. Knowledge is the completion of religion. Knowledge is the evidence of God and the evidence that you are a part of a greater life beyond the limits of your time, beyond the boundaries of your race and beyond the confines of your present intellectual ability. Here there is no creation story. There are no heroes. There is no end of time. There is only the total experience of relationship, which is the experience of Knowledge and the experience of God. What is a human religion without a creation story, without a hero to worship and without a culmination of human experience? What human religion can focus on a God of this magnitude, whose sole interest is not your world alone, whose sole concern is not your daily experience, whose awareness is so complete and whose beneficence blesses those who are so unlike you? What then is the model for human behavior? What is the basis for ethics or morality in a God of the Greater Community? For this you must venture beyond a childhood religion and a child\u2019s needs. You must venture beyond the need only for rules and regulations and fantastic stories that are barely believable. You must enter into the experience and the Mystery of life, which is the doorway to God, which is at the very heart of your life and contains the very purpose for your coming here that is unique to you but which you share with all life. \u2026 You can read the rest here: What is God? - The New Message from God I hope that helps to answer your question.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Objective morality is the perspective that claims about ones rights and general ideas of humanity are either true or false. For example, someone who believes in objective morality will claim that murdering a child is wrong regardless of the culture, religion, etc. There is a simple reason why this is important: if morality is not objective, in that there is no inherent right or wrong answer to some issues, then our laws are based on nothing but will. In essence, whoever is powerful enough to right the laws can dictate what is and what isn\u2019t moral. In this sense, you cannot actually claim murdering a child is wrong because morals would be subject to the opinions and individual morals of different people. This isn\u2019t to say those who believe in subjective morality are bad people, only that they have no universality to their beliefs. They cannot state that anything is inherently wrong unless there is a law against it. Under this premise, it seems absurd to think that moral cannot be objective. I find it impossible to fathom a world where we accept actions like the holocaust as subjective, whereby our ruling on whether it was just or not is dictated by absolutely nothing but an opinion Simply because we cannot agree on whether something was right or wrong doesn\u2019t mean both sides are right. All it means is that we haven\u2019t figured out the truth of it. Regardless of whether we have sufficient knowledge to determine if something is right or wrong, objective morality does exist. The next step is acquiring the proper knowledge and understanding to make a ruling one way or another. The latter is something we may never sufficiently achieve. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201cDoes objective morality exist?\u201d Yes, certainly. In its most limited sense, objective morality requires us to recognize one another\u2019s humanity, and to accord the same consideration to other people that we require for our own well-being. This is often known as the Golden Rule, and is both objective and fundamental. In a much broader sense, objective morality is provided by religion; but this objectivity is conditional upon our freedom in recognizing religion. That is, no religion can require that its every moral tenet be applicable to every human being. Rather, each person must have the freedom to understand religion in his or her own way (including the right not to recognize any religion). Then, morality is objective but not uniform. When, someday, all people recognize a single religion, then morality will be both objective and uniform. A Greek philosopher living in the days of the youth of Christianity, being full of the Christian element, though not a professing Christian, wrote thus: \u201cIt is my belief that religion is the very foundation of true civilization.\u201d For, unless the moral character of a nation is educated, as well as its brain and its talents, civilization has no sure basis. As religion inculcates morality, it is therefore the truest philosophy, and on it is built the only lasting civilization. As an example of this, he points out the Christians of the time whose morality was on a very high level. The belief of this philosopher conforms to the truth, for the civilization of Christianity was the best and most enlightened in the world. The Christian Teaching was illumined by the Divine Sun of Truth, therefore its followers were taught to love all men as brothers, to fear nothing, not even death! To love their neighbors as themselves, and to forget their own selfish interests in striving for the greater good of humanity. The grand aim of the religion of Christ was to draw the hearts of all men nearer to God\u2019s effulgent Truth. If the followers of the Lord Christ had continued to follow out these principles with steadfast faithfulness, there would have been no need for a renewal of the Christian Message, no necessity for a reawakening of His people, for a great and glorious civilization would now be ruling the world and the Kingdom of Heaven would have come on earth. But instead of this, what has taken place! Men turned away their faces from following the divinely illuminated precepts of their Master, and winter fell upon the hearts of men. For, as the body of man depends for life upon the rays of the sun, so cannot the celestial virtues grow in the soul without the radiance of the Sun of Truth. God leaves not His children comfortless, but, when the darkness of winter overshadows them, then again He sends His Messengers, the Prophets, with a renewal of the blessed spring. The Sun of Truth appears again on the horizon of the world shining into the eyes of those who sleep, awaking them to behold the glory of a new dawn. Then again will the tree of humanity blossom and bring forth the fruit of righteousness for the healing of the nations. Because man has stopped his ears to the Voice of Truth and shut his eyes to the Sacred Light, neglecting the Law of God, for this reason has the darkness of war and tumult, unrest and misery, desolated the earth. I pray that you will all strive to bring each child of God into the radiance of the Sun of Truth, that the darkness may be dissipated by the penetrating rays of its glory, and the winter\u2019s hardness and cold may be melted away by the merciful warmth of its shining. \u2014Paris Talks, talk number 7, given on October 22nd, 1911.

            "answer_text": "Q. Is there such thing as objective morality? - Objective morality is the idea that at least some moral judgments are not just true according to a person's subjective opinion, but factually true.From https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mo... - -In very short answer, objective morals exist according to Theravada Buddhsim. - For example, Q. If evil (bad people) kills good (people), and good (people) does not kill evil (bad People), would the world become entirely evil (bad people)? - -Suppose that the bad people kill all the good people on earth, there will be all the bad people left on earth for that generation. But people of the next generation (of those bad people) will become good people according to Theravada Buddhism. (By the law of Objective Morality) \u00b7 - \u00b7 -Once, Australia, especially Tasmania, was a place to send convicts from British Colony. An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts. A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that Tasmania had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation. - (From Companion to Tasmanian history Between 1803 and 1853 approximately 75,000 convicts served time in Van Diemen's Land. Of these 67,000 were shipped from British and Irish ports and the remainder were either locally convicted, or transported from other British colonies. This represents about 45 percent of all convicts landed in Australia and 15\u201320 percent of all those transported within the British Empire in the period 1615\u20131920.From http://www.utas.edu.au/library/c... ) - (From The story of Australia\u2019s last convicts January 9, 2018The Hougoumont, the last ship to take convicts from the UK to Australia, docked in Fremantle, Western Australia, on January 9, 1868 \u2013 150 years ago. It brought an end to a process which deposited about 168,000 convicted prisoners in Australia after it began in 1788.Convicts had ceased to be sent to New South Wales and Van Diemen\u2019s Land (Tasmania) decades earlier, but Western Australia still wanted convict labour to help with building projects. By the time the Hougoumont landed its shipment of 281 convicts, the Swan River penal colony in Western Australia had been reliant on convict labour for 18 years, and received almost 10,000 male prisoners from Britain.From http://theconversation.com/the-s... ) - (From Stain or badge of honour? Convict heritage inspires mixed feelings June 8, 2015A recent report in Molecular Psychiatry identified a \u201cwarrior gene\u201d connected to criminal behaviour. This inspired renewed speculation that a convict ancestry might make Australians more predisposed to violent crime.This fear of genetic contamination from convict ancestors has existed in Australia since early settlement. Between 1788 and the end of transportation in 1868, around 162,000 convicts were sent to the colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen\u2019s Land and Western Australia.An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts.In 1856, Van Diemen\u2019s Land was renamed Tasmania in an attempt to purge its convict past.And the fear that we might be cursed with a genetic predisposition towards criminal behaviour? A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that, adjusted for population, Tasmania \u2013 with the highest proportion of convict descendants \u2013 had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation.From https://theconversation.com/stai... ) - -So from where do those so-called good and bad behaviors come?? -If all human beings are inherently good, there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently good since young. -If all human beings are inherently bad, there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently bad since young. -So some human beings are inherently good and some human beings are inherently bad because people observe as such. -So what's the cause of inherently good or bad? -It is not genetic because if it is genetic, science will have discovered by now. -It is not genetic because one can observe that both inherently good parents can have inherently bad children. Likewise, both inherently bad parents can have inherently good children. -It is not environment because even the extremely poor parents with extremely bad environment can have inherently good children. Likewise, even the extremely rich family with extremely good environment can have inherently bad children. -But during the individual growth process (after birth), inherently good children are easier to become bad if they meet bad environment and bad influence. Inherently bad children are not easy to become good even if they meet good environment and good influence. -It is easier to become bad during the growth of children because it does not need much effort to do bad things and it needs much effort to do good. -It is harder to become good during the growth of children because it needs much effort to restrain from doing bad. -According to this philosophy, more and more bad people should appear in the world. Nature favors to appear the bad behaviors. If inherently good and inherently bad behaviors appear randomly, people would see inherently good and bad children in one to one ratio (half and half in population) in their childhood before the influence of environment. Or one should see more inherently bad children than good children in their childhood because nature appears to favor bad behaviors. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism (If one accepts Buddhism as truth, not as a religion), human life is hard to get. Those with good behaviors in past life can return to human life if they are not released from cycles of life because human life is one of good destination and one can work hard to release from cycle of life in human life. Those with bad behaviors in past life rarely come back to human life because human life is one of good destination. So if one who has previous life with good behaviors and the other who has previous life with bad behaviors competes for one human life, one who has previous life with good behaviors has more chance to come back to human life again. If he comes back to human life again, he will be inherently good because of previous habits. So according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, people will see more inherently good children than inherently bad ones because human life is one of the good destinations. - Reference from Theravada Buddhism The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta too taking a low seat sat on a side, and said to the Blessed One.\u2018Venerable sir, I have heard this said: The recluse Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges remainderless knowledge and vision in this manner, \u2018while walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and continually knowledge and vision is established, to me\u2019.Venerable sir, those who say, these words, \u2018The recluse Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges remainderless knowledge and vision:while walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and continually.\u2019 Are they saying the words of good Gotama and are they not blaming the Blessed One falsely?Vaccha, those who say, the recluse Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges remainderless knowledge and vision, while walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and continually. They, do not say my words, they blame me falsely.Venerable sir, saying how would it be said, correctly not blaming the Blessed One falsely?\u2018The recluse Gotama knows the three knowledges. Saying it thus they would be saying the right thing, and not blaming me falsely. Vaccha, whenever I desire, I recollect the manifold previous births, such as one birth, two births, with all modes and all details, thus I recall the manifold previous births. Vaccha, when I desire, with the purified heavenly eye beyond human, see beings disappearing and appearing, in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly, in good and bad states,-- I see beings, according their actions. Vaccha, destroying desires, my mind released and released through wisdom, here and now by myself realising I abide. Vaccha, if it is said, the recluse Gotama knows the three knowledges, saying it thus, you would be saying the right thing and not blaming me falsely\u2019.From http://tipitaka.wikia.com/wiki/T... - \u2026\u2026.. \"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings.

            "answer_text": "No. Morality is, by definition, subjective. There are no morals about how you treat rocks or mountains. There are morals about how you act towards other living entities that can fight back. Morals are about your communities - communities of friends, of neutrals, and of enemies. Moralities come from your communities, are monitored and enforced if necessary, by your communities or by members of your communities. Let's take a simple conceptual example. Adam, alone in the garden of Eden. What immoral acts could Adam commit? Which of the commandments could he break? Not one. When God introduced themselves, there was a basic community of two, and now the first two commandments can be broken. The rest cannot be broken until the community of humans grows larger. Which of the seven deadly sins, are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth. Which can Adam sin before the people exist? Pride? Over whom?. Lust? For whom? Envy? Of whom? Gluttony? Possibly, but there is no one to judge. Wrath? Towards whom? And sloth? Who would notice? Can we define gluttony or sloth without an external observer? No. Without community, morals do not exist. With community, they emerge naturally, because they create success. A single living cell has no community, no need for morals. As soon as it reproduces, there are two cells. One could eat the other, but then there would only be one. Cells that don't eat their own kind are more successful. They reproduce more successfully, and eat the cells that have no morals. Cells that have better morals, to cooperate with like cells, will have more success. Cells that cooperate with unlike cells - more opportunities for success. More success means more progeny, passing those traits on, eating cells that are less successful. Individuals can deviate, but the community has more success with a blend of individual, selfish actions and moral cooperative actions. Successful cellular communities form tissues. But the same rules apply at this layer. Tissues with morals, tissues that cooperate, enable more successes. Individuals are looking out for number one - an immoral strategy. But that strategy fails against communities of tissues that cooperate. The layers continue. At each layer, from cells to tissues, to limbs and organs, organ systems, body, mind and spirit - cooperation, morals are required to rise to the next level. Animals form families, and teach them morals. But for a family of animals to evolve requires basic morals to be part of their nature, not taught. It's simply more efficient. Humans live in many communities. Each human lives in many moral - cooperative- communities throughout their lives. We can create communities. We can article morals and enforce them through our communities. Different communities have different morals. Many of us live our lives in multiple communities, some of which have opposing morals. We have evolved the ability to navigate this reality. We, each of us, are still self centered individuals, but we are more successful when we look after our children first, when we respect our elders, and even our enemies.

            "answer_text": "\"Objective Truth\" is not obtainable by humans, whether in Physics or Ethics etc., because any \"truth\" needs to be perceived by the human mind, in other words, be SUBJECT to the thought processes and evaluation of the human mind. Thus, the nature of beliefs being a phenomenon of human minds, necessarily implies all beliefs will always be SUBJECTIVE. Here's a paradox for analogy: \"I know the method to obtaining Objective Truth\". Guess what? That's just his subjective belief. Even if you claim to depend on an infallible GOD for your Objective Truth, you are really depending on your SUBJECTIVE UNDERSTANDING. Sure, you can claim that this GOD placed this Objective Truth into your mind, so this truth that you know is not a product of thought processes subject to your mind. But it's not even possible for you to prove to yourself whether you're just imagining things. This supernatural belief is still essentially a SUBJECTIVE BELIEF of having obtained Objective Truth. Objective Truth can only be perceived by a mind that is truly omniscient. An Objective Truth is an understanding that is perfectly accurate. Needless to say, any Truth (or method of obtaining Truth) spouted by an imperfect mind cannot possibly be relied upon as Objective Truth (or Objectively True method of obtaining Objective Truth). We cannot possibly obtain \"Objective Truth\", but the best we could do is to strive towards obtaining Truths that everyone can Subjectively agree with. Truths form our Knowledge Set, and Knowledge is controlled by the human beings currently alive, and the ones with the greatest power/control over life, essentially have the greatest control over Knowledge. So, Knowledge evolves as the ones in control decide what Knowledge is \"Good\" and worth spreading and passing on to future generations, through the education systems and various media. Therefore, what is \"Good\" is closely linked to what Knowledge/Behaviour allows humans to thrive best, to have the greatest \"Power\" in living and surviving. For Science, the most accurate theories survive as the current set of scientific Truths, that future generations might update/edit. This occurs as the successful scientists gain recognition by providing advances that are valued, allowing humans to thrive/survive, so humans then collectively strive to preserve and pass on this Knowledge to future generations. The extent that such Truths are passed on, depends on the popularity of such Truths, and the collective power of the adherents of these Truths. \"Truths\" with few adherents tend to end up dismissed as nonsense, and Truths held by powerless people will similarly tend to be discarded, as the powerful humans in control of the education systems and mass media do not incorporate these Truths for propagation/preservation. The correct scientific Truths tend to result in increased reputation/power of its originator/adherents, and also tend to garner the most adherents, thus scientific truths evolve to become better and more accurate. For Ethics/Morals/Philosophy, it is similar. As people share Knowledge and Perspectives on how to think better or treat one another better, to individually/collectively achieve the greatest amount of joy/fulfilment, the Moral \"Rules\" appreciated by the most amount of people will tend to be best propagated/preserved. Similarly, the Moral \"Rules\" appreciated by the people in power, would be incorporated into the education systems and mass media for propagation/preservation. The moral outliers \u2013 the \"psychopaths\" tend to face rejection by the society, or even get imprisoned/killed, which tends to prevent their \"bad\" morals from being propagated/preserved. So, although Ethics/Morals are subjective, the Ethics/Morals that are most valued/appreciated, that tend to find adherence among the greatest amount of people, and tend to be incorporated into the education systems and mass media by the adherents in power, these Ethics/Morals would be the \"currently most correct\" for humans, until future updates/edits. And, a good way to advance Ethics/Morals would be somewhat similar to what's being done in science \u2013 to continually discuss and analyse the effects of different moral/ethical principles. Motivational/Behavioural Psychology/Philosophy would be crucial, as these fields provide insights to human joy/fulfilment common to the majority of humans, which we all strive to enhance through our Ethics/Morals. This is how things really work. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets identify our starting premises. There is no moral law giving GodThere is moral law giving GodThat kind of answers the question before one actually answers it. But, since I personally start with premise #2 \u2026 I will add an additional significant point: Morality should not be a cook book for legalism\u2026I.e. \u201cright and wrong\u201d behavior. The purpose of God's morality is to help us maintain that which in Christianity is what God reckons as true righteousness: I.e. faith, and specifically faith in the Gospel. However, maintaining a trust in God's promises rather than trying to please God by living a cookbook Christian lifestyle. Morality than is not the end, but a means to an end\u2026faith= trusting God Addendum: In re-reading what I wrote, I was struck with a blatant and biblical purpose of \u201cmorality\u201d\u2026namely that it reveals our inability to achieve it. In essence, God gave us the \u201ccookbook\u201d (rule book of life) to sbow us what lousy cooks we are without the Master Chef. Furthermore, this was not \u201cPlan B\u201d. We all end up requiring forgiveness and the need to start a new recipe. Let's further run with the analogy\u2026 what we as cooks end up making is a deadly and poisonous recipe which we both eat and feed to others. Jesus Christ fixes all this by His blood and sacrifice on the Cross\u2026 \u201cfoolishness to those who are perishing, but life for us who are being saved, it is the power of God\u201d\u2026 the Recipe of the Cross. Morality \u2026 or the Law\u2026 then convicts us of our sins and sin nature and points us to Christ, the Cross and the Gospel of faith. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Kant, morality comes from reason. Every rational being (in theory not just humans, but every being capable of reason) is subjected to the same moral principles because morality is a dictate of reason. In short, one should only do things that are necessary; that don't entail a contradiction. In his words:  Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction  A simple example is don't make false promises, because that is a contradiction to the concept of promises. If everybody did this, promises would become meaningless. This is known as first formulation of the categorical imperative. An imperative is something that tells us how to act. And it is categorical as opposed to hypothetical. Hypothetical imperatives only tell you how to to act in order to achieve some end; they're not universal. Categorical imperatives tell you how you should always act regardless of what you desire, just because it's your duty. Maybe someone more well-versed on the subject will add an answer as I haven't even finished reading the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, but in a nutshell that is the main argument. Anyway, in the meantime you can look around Wikipedia - Categorical imperative, and you can follow the links throughout the article (moral philosphy, deontology, and so on). ",

            "answer_text": "I was watching a documentary a while ago on a research project; the psychologist was attempting to test and see if infants were inherently disposed to similar moral values that people hold. The researcher's results showed to about an 80% consistency, infants, who were incapable of speaking and were just beginning to recognize the sound of their own name, were predisposed to a similar moral code. The results are not solid enough to prove in a scientific sense, \"true\", however, they certainly do answer a very intriguing question. Another note i would like to attach to this is that earliest forms of communication are far less lingual in nature than actual vocalization.  In this same documentary, the researchers performed a few additional experiments that show the potency of non-verbal communication. A pen was passed around the room, one which they claimed to belong to Hitler, a subject that most would agree on as holding an unfavorable reputation. Amongst people of different spiritual beliefs, to include agnostics, atheists and religiously devout individuals, they observed similar reactions; the first person cringed as if the past ownership of the pen by Hitler had somehow tainted the object. This reaction implies some sort of belief that some portion of a person continues beyond their life cycle. The most interesting detail is that as the pen was passed from one individual to another, how open their expressions of disgust became, as if they were in rapport and exaggerating the intensity of this \"taint\" as each person relinquished possession of the pen to the next.  The point of it all is to say, you can take the social experiment a couple of different ways: 1. people have strong influence through non-verbal communication and can impact your moral code 2. people inherently hold moral values that appear as a result of either some divine influence or by a biological mechanism. There is plenty of evidence that there is a biological mechanism that encourages moral behavior and this is the explanation that seems the most likely to be true. Frankly I don't think the argument that there is divine influence involved is a realistic explanation, but I thought it important to mention because that explanation would be the only means by which objective morality can exist because objectivity in morality would not beinfered by universal acceptance of moral ideas, but rather by an inflexible metaphysical code.

            "answer_text": "Q: Should morals be relative or universal? I have only two points to make, maybe more, we\u2019ll see. There is and there can be no meaningful or effective \u201cshould\u201d about morals. Where there is a \u201cshould\u201d it can only be counterproductive to its own ambitions and to its subjects, even though the results of \u201cshould\u201d and/or belief in the objective reality of morals can appear to produce some kind of moral consistency across a group of subjects. This consistency is, however, its own kind of immorality because it can only demand conformity i.e., it cannot create love. \u201cShould\u201d cannot produce maturity. It cannot produce goodness. It cannot produce freedom. The very word \u201cshould\u201d indicates an external over-riding authority that is anything but one\u2019s own integrated free being - free of self and the need of self preservation. \u201cShould\u201d emanates from authority. Morals indicate essential human compromise, guided behaviour in lieu of personal truly conscious responsibility.\u201cMorals\u201d cannot be universal, however, it is the desire of ideologues of various kinds to make their respective \u201cmorals\u201d universal. Should any particular group of any kind whatsoever succeed in making their \u201cmorals\u201d universal we will have realised hell in our time, space and planet. If you think the clash of moral systems is bad, wait until you experience a regime of universal moral imposition! Governments, religions, university hijackers and all kinds of activists the world over are pursuing such ambitions in order \u201cto do us good\u201d. We can be thankful that such ideologues and power mongers despise each other because that tension at least delays the dawn of imposed uniform sterility in the form of presumptuous \u201cuniversal morality\u201d. God forbid! Please!Conversely, concoctions of \u201cmorality\u201d can only ever be relative and impermanent, even though it appears that many if not most people seem to prefer to bear the condemning, distracting and sensitivity numbing burden of a handbag of moral instructions that tell them what to do and what not to do according to authority not their own. In fact, it seems to be important to them that they do nothing from their own authority and responsibility. This escape from becoming human (from expressing the image of God as intended) is very much like the military defence which says, \u201cI was only following orders,\u201d which, being interpreted means, \u201cI am not at all responsible\u201d.It\u2019s a little like love. Some say \u201cLove!\u201d, as in a verb, i.e., do love. That makes love a \u2018moral choice\u2019 from situation to situation. But when one is love, everything that one does is the doing of love; it cannot be otherwise. In the same way, the mind that references \u2018relative\u2019 or \u2018universal\u2019 \u2018morals\u2019 is a doer or moral principles, depending on the fears or rewards in play in the situation. By contrast, the truly Spiritual consciousness \u201cdiscerns all things\u201d with absolute and immediate pertinence. Absolute and immediate pertinence arises out of the fact of the moment not out of the memory and imposition of \u201cmorals\u201d.The objection that this capacity to discern with clear pertinence is too subjective an idea has some merit to it, but this is largely because it is not needed or expected to be manifested in a world that is populated by consciousnesses that are compromised by \u201cmoralities\u201d. Consciousness and consciences are not enlivened by morals, they are dulled; that is sensitivity is not! Restated, if you breed people to be moral dependents you should expect them to be moral dependents, moral dwarfs, forever infants, i.e., not mature, not responsible, unable to discern, without personal moral authority, without the capacity to feel the deep fact of the situation and without the passionate conviction that gives compassionate courage \u2026 without sustainable conviction \u2026 because it is not of themselves.In summary, the question affirms a nonsense which is that the genre of construct called \u201cmorals\u201d is an absolute given. There is no such absolute genre of thing, being, fact. The assumption that there is such a thing is disastrous for human freedom, and that is why power loves it. Restated, the question gives no indication that the very idea of \u2018morals\u2019 is the the problem; it is the great compromiser of human maturity and of unconscious (i.e., un-calculated) and immediate knowing. Power forbid that you should know for yourself! Morals are matters of conscious consciousness and which indicates a state of distraction, not of awareness, not of discernment.We each need to become human.",

            "answer_text": "There is quite a bit of research now showing that human infants smile at their caregivers first - before the caregiver smiles or gives any positive feedback to the infant. This is an attempt by the completely helpless infant to begin a positive feedback loop, so they will be fed, cared for, and not die.  And this relationship goes on to form the basis for morality in human beings.  A well-supported and reinforced infant/caregiver relationship with lots of mutual smiling, holding and touching will tend to produce very different results in a child than one that does not. And these differences have effects - indeed, seem to determine - core moral behavior in later childhood and adulthood. It would seem that our basic moral behavior is rooted in our bodies, in a complex series of chemical and neurological responses that \"come with the territory\" and are designed to help us thrive. But they are plastic, as is much of our body, and they thrive when supplied with the best environment. When the environment is less than good, or poor, well..... the results are what might be expected. Nonetheless, the moral \"framework\", if you will, is there. This is not woo-woo. This is science, and pretty well-established, at that. A.A. Baird at MIT has written on the Neuroscience of Morality. J.A. Bargh at Oxford, likewise on the Nonconscious Control of Social Behavior. Dr. Sally Severino has just published \"Behold Our Moral Body\", which has 12 pages of scientific references supporting her theses. Personally, I find this thrilling. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s try explaining this a different way. How tall are you? Don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll swing this back around to the question\u2026. When you read that, you thought about it and gave the answer in your mind in some sort of unit, perhaps feet or meters. You used language to convey information about a socially agreed upon standard. A standard that provides utility. That is, it is extremely useful. Let me use myself as an example. I\u2019m 6\u20321\u2033 tall. What if I said I was 7\u2032 tall? Am I wrong? What if I pointed out that the units of measure are subjective systems and therefore are subject to our feelings about them? Would that make my claim valid? Would that mean I'm not really 6'1\" tall? I hope everyone realizes that measurements are determined subjectively, but within the context of the system, I am objectively 6'1\" tall. If I say I'm taller or shorter, even if I use words like feet or inches, I'm whatever the agreed upon standard is even if I don't agree with it. Measurement systems are social systems of great value and are possible because people (most people) share the desire to measure things. We value the utility that measurements give us and have chosen to value the system over any individuals claims or desires. It is the shared social desire to achieve the utility of measurement that makes the measurement system socially possible. It's not hard to see the value of systems of measurement in places like health, commerce, education. Strictly speaking there is nothing objective about any of it. Does the fact that people agree on it make it a good system? No. The fact that people socially agree does not, by itself make it good or bad because to determine that society needs to decide what it is that it wants to accomplish with a system of measurement. What is to be actualized? Only once there is some agreement can the system be evaluated. Now take the US standard system against the metric system. Is one system better than the other? Clearly, the metric system is a better system. How do we know this? Because we can evaluate facts scientifically about the two systems with respect to what people want to accomplish. We can measure the results and come to an answer. Moral systems are no different except what is being measured. Moral systems measure our behavior. People have desires that, at a fundamental level revolve around freedom from pain and suffering. Values arise from those desires and the social system of morality takes shape. The values and morals that are derived from them are subjective, but once the systems are firmly in place one can say that certain actions are objectively wrong with respect to that system. But again, the fact that people agree on a system does not, in itself, make it \"good\". It's ironic what people claim to want and how their actions often fail to realize the goals people set for themselves. Some obvious examples might be burning witches, slavery and human sacrifice, which at one time might have been deemed socially moral. What changed? Someone asked, what is it that we value? How do our actions live up to the values we hold? Information sheds new light and that understanding leads us to hold new values and our moral systems change. So no, morality isn't objective any more than measurements are objective. However, morality, like measurement is exceedingly useful in order to reach our individual and societal goals. Objectivity can only be realized with respect to goals and desires we hold. ",

            "answer_text": "If by \u201cobjective\u201d you mean if you conducted an opinion poll of the entire world\u2019s population they would agree on the ethical choice when you present them with an ethical choice, then \u201cno\u201d there is no objective morality. If you mean there is a rule that exists in some other plane of existence somewhere (say in the mind of God), again \u201cno\u201d. Humans have an evolved ability to and interest in making ethical choices in at least some circumstances. Examination of how and why it evolved are still in their infancy but there is a start. Brain scans allow seeing what brain areas people use when making such choices; other than sociopaths and people with brain injuries or disease there is a general (only general) agreement among humans when faced with ethical choices. By carefully framing the outlines of hypotheticals we can tease out what aspects of a choice influence the outcome. If you look up the \u201cTrolley Hypothetical\u201d on google you can read about various experiments. In sum, we use two brain areas, one a \u201cdisgust\u201d center and one a \u201ccalculating\u201d center; when you choose one of these brain areas has to overcome the other if there is a conflict (of course sometimes they agree). Some people focus more on \u201cdisgust\u201d and some on determining effects of decisions. You can, e.g., show someone a plate of rotting, maggot-covered meat, and people with a strong disgust response end up also being people whom are more likely to view homosexual sex as immoral, so you can see that your DNA/life experiences create brain developments that can affect your moral views. Careful elucidation of what people care about and mean when they are talking about morality can reduce differences during rational discourse; philosophy focuses on this usually. \u201cEvolutionary psychology\u201d and \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d are studying such matters. There are some pretty frequent commonalities across cultures for incest and cannibalism rules suggesting they are \u201cbuilt-in\u201d to us evolutionarily, and there are taboos on killing (obviously not absolute) suggesting respect for others is a human norm. But absolute agreement, no. Careful examination of complicated and robust ethical theories show that they all have defects, impressive as they are. In the Western tradition utilitarianism and natural rights theory (often based on human personality) overlap in interests but have disagreements that cannot be eradicated by logic alone. I.e. you cannot prove an ethical rule to be as required by logic as \u201c1+1=2\u201d is. If you like you can blame what Godel found concerning complicated human logic systems: not all statements can be proved true solely within the confines of such systems, but require importing value statements or axioms from outside in the way that Euclid had to start with some appealing assumptions before deriving logical inferences from them. Humans cannot completely step outside themselves and try to derive ethical commands as they live inside the system in question; some assumptions will always be required, and unlike most of Euclid\u2019s assumptions there is not universal agreement about them.

            "answer_text": "We can objectively say morality exists. We have observed it, even in other animals than humans. It\u2019s a pattern of behavior displayed by many animals. Are the rules of morality objectively defined? No. Bear with me. Why is ISIS evil? Because they make hunderds of thousands of people suffer. Why is it wrong to cause suffering? Because you wouldn\u2019t want someone else to make you suffer. And that\u2019s the crux of the matter. At the heart of morality lies the Golden Rule. That makes it subjective by definition, because it deals with personal experience. The idea of \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d morality has some intuitive appeal because most people more or less agree on what \u201csuffering\u201d means. We\u2019re then tempted to generalize it and claim it is \u201cobjective\u201d. Except it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just a lot of people holding the same subjective opinion. For example, virtually everyone (subjectively) agrees that killing is wrong, because nobody would like to get murdered. That doesn\u2019t make killing objectively wrong, it just means the majority of (subjective) individuals hold the same opinion, to the point of consensus. It\u2019s precisely because such opinions are part of a large consensus that they are often confused for objective facts. That\u2019s also why we can assign \u201cdegrees of wrongness\u201d to actions. It depends on how much we fear someone else would do that to us. Murdering someone is far worse than lying to someone, because I\u2019d rather have someone lie to me than murder me. ",

            "answer_text": "Ethics and morals are not just inter-related but mutually determining and realizing. In other words, without viable moral conversation in which to become so animated or realized, ethical values and standards exist only potentially, as literally Utopian ideals, reflecting possible future conversations. Without a real dialogue, i.e., an ethics so animated, what may appear to be moral conversation may actually reflect the implicit conceptual reduction of conduct to mere behavior, of conversation to mere discourse, of engaged concern about real priorities to disengaged and finally unethical rule-following\u2014the potentially most deadly form practical reasoning can assume\u2014rationalization. Ethics and morality are thus closely interconnected with culture and history but emerge from a stance of reflection upon them. Particular ethical systems and moral rules must be understood as related to their particular historical and cultural contexts. Yet, the reflective dimensions essential to ethical standards and moral rules suggest that rational, dialogical criteria pertaining to a reflective conversation about conduct would apply. Developing such criteria might begin with identifying moments of possibility and choice in the real and enduring structures of our actual lives since conduct is never merely the repetition or reproduction of those structures. Where ethos is made the object of thematic scrutiny, practices we have taken for granted become matters of concern; my conduct and yours become problematic. Morality reflects the ongoing necessity to re-interpret ourselves and our ethical systems in terms of their relevance to the ongoing conversation of life. In developing and re-connecting the ethical and moral in contrast with notions of ethos and mores, rather than feigning \"objectivity\" we can open a broader conversation about conduct, as a function of which, the standards implicit in practices can become conceptualized in our reflective determination of norms. Occasionally at the Readware Institute, we take on conceptual modeling problems. A few years ago, we took on a study in behavioral economics suggesting how thinking about the emic and etic aspects of behavior in economic decisions may lead to the \"good life\". as in the pursuit happiness. See our published study: (Chinese Business Review). This does not mean we go back to Skinner; on the contrary, since this conception emerged from a consideration of conduct as a form of social-cultural behavior, e.g. in behavioral economics, it is not surprising to find that ethnographers have anticipated the central contrast from which we saw it emerge. Ethnographers commonly make a distinction between the etic and emic dimensions of the study of cultural practices, which reflects the difference between the structural and reflective dimensions of meaning. Otherwise, these structures are known only to a few practitioners in any of the concerned fields. The etic/emic distinction is, at its core, a distinction between meaningful things and the usually hidden or implicit structures believed to be essential to their decipherment. While it belongs to linguistics as we reported, this view is quite different than the linguistic view of Saussure and his followers. In fact, we usually call the linguists of Saussure, Harris, and the language games od Wittgenstein: \u201cshallow semantics\u201d for the reason that they ignore these and other deep semantic distinctions altogether. According to Peter Amato in Language, Reflection and the Dimensions of Conduct. (Human Nature Review): Meaningful behavior occurs in a context set by a stable, structured, \u2018grammatical\u2019 system, according to which features capable of conveying and conferring meaning are organized and arranged into meaningful actions and utterances. The study of meaningful activity presents ethnographers with the constant need to recognize the difference between the elements and components of meaning and meanings themselves. The ethnographer anticipates that cultural activity has a \u2018double nature\u2019: When the meaning of institutions, practices, and beliefs is considered independent of the participants\u2019 ideas and beliefs, we say they are considered from an etic perspective. On the other hand, it is necessary to recognize that the institutions, practices, and beliefs of a people are not only an abstract system but real living features of a culture. To this extent, practices are not merely structurally capable of conveying meaning, but they actually mean. This makes them a different kind of object\u2014one whose subjective element is irreducibly present. The ethnographer observes a ritual ceremony and describes the clothing, movements, and expressions of all its participants in detail. From the standpoint typically assumed by the scientific observer, these elements can be sorted out and re-ordered so as to derive a new meaning not given in or by the performance itself or its participants. The meaning of the event intended by the scientific observer will be cast in terms of measured empirical observations, in what that observer might call \u2018neutral,\u2019 \u2018objective\u2019 language. But the etic dimensions of observed behavior are not simply to be identified with the \u2018objective,\u2019 \u2018empirical,\u2019 \u2018causal,\u2019 account that might be given by a typical western scientist. Etic and emic dimensions structure all observed human behavior since it always can be interpreted in terms that are independent of what its participants say. In other words, the etic meaning of an event, as described from the standpoint of a western scientific system of meaning, is, in a non-trivial sense, also really an emic account reflecting a western observer's practice of interpretation. 'Independent of what their practice means to participants,' is a category that belongs to our local system of meaning, which we call the scientific observer's perspective. But, boil the meaningful world down to formal constituents and what one has is formal constituents of meaning. We can utter nothing meaningful about the practice without reconstituting it in our terms, emically. In other words, the etic meaning of an event, as described from the standpoint of a western scientific system of meanings, is, in a non-trivial sense, also really an emic account or a westerner\u2019s practice of interpretation, from a standpoint outside its system of meanings. \u2018Independent of what participants in this practice actually tend to think and say,\u2019 is a category belonging to our local systems of meaning, reflecting the core of the scientific observer\u2019s perspective. But, \u2018as it appears from within the horizon of local interpretations and practices,\u2019 is a category that must also be regarded as applicable to the system of meanings familiar to the scientific observer as to anyone else. The distinction of etic and emic aspects of meaning suggests a parallel that Amato believes 'can assist the re-articulation of ethics and morality in a broader philosophy of conduct: the cultural values and unreflective attitudes with which ethics begins to provide a structural framework in terms of which the reflective expression and conversation carried out as ethical-moral discussion occurs.' In this sense, he believes, a tradition of conversation about conduct facilitates its own continuation by opening itself up to Human reflection; i.e., for the creation out of the \u2018grammar and syntax\u2019 of a structuring past new utterances that make unanticipated sense in present usage. Any cultural world contains etic structural features out of which practices and beliefs endure and structure from one generation to the next. This is the reason, by the way, AI cannot be saved by Natural language; while originally a linguistic distinction, the etic/emic distinction is all but lost in the language under the guise of modernity, But cultural reproduction is not merely the repetition of the speech of the ancestors; warns Amato. Still less could it be a replication of its own objectivity or a formal recreation of the structures that confer meanings without meaning something all along the way. Cultural life is a dynamic between relatively enduring structures and new meaningful utterances formed from them. Culture and ethos are the relatively enduring structures in reflection upon which ethical and moral meanings are instituted with an urgency and originality that is always marked by their real circumstances. So morality and ethics are neither simply synonymous, nor antithetical. The distinction between ethics and ethos was offered above as a starting point toward clarifying how culture and tradition relate to ethics as the ground upon which it reflects. This suggested a view of morality as a conversation about conduct, realizing reflection upon relatively enduring ethical values in which the prevailing morality of a time reflects a consensus about how generally held values should be interpreted and applied under local conditions. But, from a hermeneutical perspective, such conventions reflect merely a moment in an ongoing conversation that must continually re-interpret its own relevance and meaning in relation to new, real contingencies. There is thus a continual interpretive demand understood historically as ethical debate driven by experience and history, as new questions and choices force us to reflect anew on the priorities implicit in our choices. Moral reflection and debate are thus dialectically related to the values they call upon us to instantiate and realize, or overthrow. For example:  In the case of behavioral economics, we can see the types of entities that are instantiated and realized. It is clearly up to the individual to reflect on and overthrow these values as well as adopt their chosen superpower at their own risk (See the paper linked above). This way of thinking about ethics and morals allows us to identify ethical values as historically conditioned and only ever relatively, falsely permanent. If ethical systems of values and ideas of the good exist only in our conversation about what to do, as suggested here, they live and die in the practices and institutions whose results at any given moment they are. This means ethical values are extremely tenuous as well as tenacious and persistent, just like culture. Culture passes from person to person through the most subtle of gestures and carves a niche in each mind of millions through vast and monumental creations. Yet, existing only in the minds, actions, and artifacts of persons, its venue is history, and it thus depends on human choices and actions. It is always open to reflection and critique because without them it has no life. Note also: A careful discussion of the meanings of and controversies about the etic/emic distinction in anthropology can be found in Marvin Harris, Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times, (California: AltaMira Press, 1999), especially chapter 2, pages 31-48. Harris particularly warns against confusing the etic/emic distinction with the commonplace distinction between objectivity and subjectivity, since this identifies objectivity solely with the outsider perspective of the student or scientist of culture. But participants themselves have an idea about how the world is structured independent of themselves and their own subjectivity. This means that the outsider and the insider both have etic and emic meaning-structures. Again, this returns the distinction to its roots in linguistics: the etic should be thought of as a classificatory structuring system or code which confers meaning but does not actually \u2018mean\u2019 itself, like the phonetics of the spoken language. This \u2018objective\u2019 structure transcends and links all competent language users. Yet, all so linked remain speakers, with definite things to say and to mean. The contrast of ethics and morality with ethos and mores shows that the ought is essential to conduct, for it arises upon reflection, in a stance of self-awareness and assessment of practices and of ourselves as actors for whom conduct matters. A commonplace way to say this, Amatto suggests and I concur, is that from an ethical or a moral perspective we consider ourselves responsible for our actions. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it does. Morality is simply a behavior or principle identified as \u201cgood\u201d. Good and bad are defined objectively (rather, they can be\u2026). As an example; various ethnic groups have long histories of high-density living arrangements and have independently developed moral principles involving ritual cleanliness. These include many Asian sub-cultures, many from the Indian sub-continent and Ashkenazi Jews. Serendipitously, we have empirical data on the health outcomes of various immigrant groups that have settled the Lower East Side of Manhattan and East European Jews, in spite of living in the same squalid conditions as preceding groups (the Irish), never experienced a cholera epidemic (unliked the Irish before them\u2026). The Irish never developed a culture of personal hygiene because they were a rural people and aside from the difficulties of maintain personal hygiene in those circumstances, the low population density inherent in rural life, discounted its value. The more interesting question is how we arrive at an objective morality. Those principles that have been proven to be consistently moral (good) for humanity have not been the product of intellectual dialectic (theological or secular\u2026), but a far more ambiguous prescriptive avenues, namely religious and cultural practice. This doesn\u2019t mean that all religious behavior equates to objective morality, but highly-persistent religious and/or cultural practice appears to have been positively reinforced by repeated outcomes over many generations. On the other hand, various intellectually-derived moral systems, particularly those of social utopias, simply did not survive, or in the case of Marxism, actually resulted in incalculable human suffering and death. Be careful with defining objective morality. Arrogance kills. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine a society where there is no presumption of honesty, where telling the truth wasn't expected. Communication would quickly break down, because we would have no reason to believe anything anyone told us. If I asked what time it was, if there was no presumption of honesty, I would have no reason to believe you when you answered. In fact, since I have no reason to believe you, I wouldn't even ask in the first place. Trust, relationships, education, society in general would be impossible. Thus, honesty is objectively good and moral and necessary on its own. Imagine a society where there was no prohibition against murder or violence; if you could kill someone, there would be no repercussions. People would quickly surround themselves with people who agree not to harm each other as a form of self defence, thus creating a smaller society where a prohibition against murder or violence does exist. A prohibition against murder and violence is objectively good and moral, necessary for both survival and society. Morality is part self interest, part empathy. Self interest: I don't want you to hurt me, and you don't want me to hurt you, so we agree not to hurt each other. Empathy: If I were you, I would not want to be harmed. Therefore, I should not harm you. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that term is oxymoronic. Had you asked about objective ethicality, I\u2019d be inclined to say yes in the sense that no society allows murder due to sudden momentary anger of one person towards the victim. Which ultimately has evolved out of universal human respect for the right of every individual (i.e.,already born) human life, to the persistence of that life. This is true even though there is no proof that anyone, ever, chose their own life. Being born is not a choice, but once it happens to you, you are protected from losing it by another\u2019s hand. So therefore, killing somebody is never a sanctioned legal choice, any more than being born is ever a purposeful sentient decision. And that right there, the very heart of that dichotomy, is ethics. Said another way, we all just agree, even without extensive social discourse, that someone walking around breathing air, has the inalienable right to continue doing that - and someone taking that away from you has violated the most basic human right there is, and should be severely punished. That's Law, and it's premise is ethics. Morality says that same thing too, but it also says things like \u201cwives, don't cheat on your husbands\u201d - and while ethics may technically agree with that, the law doesn't give a shit. The law practically mocks morality in ways like that - regardless of the letter of the actual legal code - which shows that laws are built and interpreted upon ethics, and not morality. And the difference is, ethics are clearly malleable where morality obviously is not. Sure, places like Saudi Arabia build laws on the \u201cmorality\u201d of their local religions, but those are isolated instances . Looking at the earth as a whole, considering all 200+ nations, the universal constant of law is quite clearly ethics - and not morality. And most nations find the laws of places that govern upon \u201cmorality\u201d to be detestable violations of human rights. Yes, I\u2019m American, so you could jump to the conclusion that my argument is based on our \u201cseparation of church and state.\u201d But our very currency states \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d - yet our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. So I'm saying that as Americans, we rely on ethics, not morality, to craft our legal code - and so do nearly all nations. So although I would need to much more carefully craft my argument that perhaps there is an objective ethicality, I feel absolutely certain that based on actual past and present human societies and actions and consequences, there is no objective morality. Maybe there is no objective ethicality either, but objective morality as a concept simply feels like a cruel joke to me. It just ain't so. ",

            "answer_text": "Not so long ago, I read of a Filipino single parent who left her two young daughters in the grandmother's charge whilst she went to an Arab country to work in order to lift her family out of poverty. When the grandmother was indisposed, a neighbour came and sexually molested the two pre-pubescent girls. On hearing this, the mother went into a deep depression; her anxiety was intensified in the knowledge that she could not afford the flight home to comfort and protect her children from further violation.  There is a profound question each one of us must ask about this : was this man just \u201cdancing to his DNA?\u201d If so, who can point a finger? After all, if subjective morality does not exist, we each choose our own ethical code. Viva la permissive universe you could say. Besides, the man who raped the children, was he not propagating his evolutionary right to leave his seed and flourish the species? However, maybe, just maybe, when you read of the Filipino woman\u2019s sad plight you were moved with a profound sense of injustice. \u201cInjustice\u201d, this is an interesting way of describing it. Where does that sense of injustice emerge from? It is as mysterious as the laws that govern nature. C. S. Lewis put it this way: \u201cHow could I know injustice if I didn\u2019t know justice; how could I know a straight line if I did not know a crooked line?\u201d In other words, how can we know morality unless there is a standard beyond us? If you say something is wicked, you imply there is good. Where does this moral code have its roots? In truth, subjective morality, like the laws of mathematics and logic is deeply woven into the fabric of the universe. The Bible tells us that they are \u201claws written in our hearts.\u201d After all, objective morality and justice in an atheistic world are arbitrary terms. However, atheists like to have their cake and eat it. Consider a radio interview where Dawkins, a scientist discusses this in the shallowest of terms: JB: But when you make a value judgement don't you immediately step yourself outside of this evolutionary process and say the reason this is good is because it's good, and you don't have any way to stand on that statement? RD: But my value judgement itself could come from my evolutionary past. JB: So, therefore, it's just as random in a sense as any product of evolution. RD: Well, you could say that. But it doesn't in any case - nothing about it makes it more probable that there is anything supernatural. JB: Okay, but ultimately, your belief that rape is wrong is as arbitrary as the fact that we've evolved five fingers rather than six. RD: You could say that, yeah. The interview implies that? Dawkins thinks that raping a child is as arbitrary as evolving five fingers, rather than six. Do you think raping a child is as arbitrary as just\u2026 let\u2019s say, being unfashionable? That\u2019s subjective morality. However, perhaps you agree that our sense of morality and justice comes from a source deeper than human mores. In Nietzsche\u2019s Parable of The Madman, Nietzsche prophesised the end result of rejecting subjective morality: \u201c\u201dThe madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. \"Whither is God?\" he cried; \"I will tell you. We have killed him -- you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us -- for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.\" Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern on the ground, and it broke into pieces and went out. \"I have come too early,\" he said then; \"my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light of the stars requires time; deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than most distant stars -- and yet they have done it themselves.\u201d\u201d  Here Nietzsche confronts the existential reality: a world spun out of control by the abandonment of a higher morality Some argue that our morals come from an evolutionary distilled wisdom that tribal sages have honed over the ages as a survival mechanism-This is confusing survival with an objective preference, not a subjective moral code. But, and it\u2019s a big \u201cbut\u201d, if this were true, we would see great strides of progress as intelligent man syphons out all the unethical dross. However, atheism started to emerge in the 19th Century and lo and behold, the 20th Century was the bloodiest period in modern history (see chart at end). Just look at modern Jerusalem; two groups with opposing world views that have being going on for six thousand years, one group with a world view of unforgiveness. How to you stand in a room and arbitrate two opposing world views like this? Let me put it this way, if heavenly wisdom does not curb evil, what chance does subjective morality have? Yes, you do not need to be a believer to be good, but I still like to lock my doors at night. For the dear Filipino woman, there is a justice; a justice based on the morals of a great lawgiver, \u201cThe religion our God and Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress\u2026\u201d James 1:27  Dawkins on rape Excess deaths caused by modern warfare First World War (1914\u201318): . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 million.

            "answer_text": "wow so few answer and the more upvoted says nothing about if exist or not\u2026 as always start by defining absolute and morality\u2026.cause is kinda tricky \u2026moral seems is not related to simple statments example, is steal moral? if you say nope i say steal from a king that takes heavy taxes of their people make them starve is immoral \u2026if you say yes then take a children candy is good\u2026. Seems that do something moral is more related to do something that make us feel good. I usually like separate ethics of morality thinking that morality is something that is construct the person (knowning or unkowning) about how act in some conditions, or if they think that their action feel good or not. And ethics as something that a society defines for function based in the moral of their members. Now i think absolute is something that is true for all consciences, if were for only humans then theist notions fall(for any theist that don\u2019t agree with it). I use the world absolute as something that is valid for all that could understand the argument, in other words something that is true for all consciences.. if that happen i can guarantee that any new child or culture that born will accept it. With those two definitons exist something absolute (being moral , truth or anything\u2026), that is same as ask exist something that all conscience will accept as truth? my conclusion is not\u2026if exist something like that first should appear natural on consciences that is each person now have it, second all consciences already agreed on it and sadly not all has been agreed as truth. Cause any conscience could say that is false cause he don\u2019t understand it, or don\u2019t want believe is truth. i prefere use terms as social (human ) absolutes as something temporal that all people has aggred on , and that any new member can be indoctrinated in believe it Example maths. But is noticed that actions of humans are too elaborated to think and guarantee that i could make a moral human absolute. But its possible have a Ethic human absolute, example, the humans right that we agree and put as laws for any nation. ",

            "answer_text": "Is there such thing as objective morality? There can be objective morality but the premises we base them off of are subjective. IE what we choose as our basis for morality and what we are trying to achieve is subjective. From that though we can make objective statements built on top of that. Normally when people talk about objective morality they are referring to a religious basis. But even if you believe in a god or gods the morals they\u2019ve defined are objective only because you accept their subjective reasons for moral laws. Personally I don\u2019t care that someone believes in some god. That isn\u2019t a reason for me to think that what you consider moral is some how objective. What we have to do is find a common premise we can agree on then we can see how objective decisions are made. Is killing other person objectively immoral? I don\u2019t think so. In fact I can objectively show, based on well being and a reduction in suffering, how in some cases ending the life of another would be the objectively moral thing to do. But that would rely on 2 or more people agreeing that well being and a reduction in suffering is the goal. Since you\u2019ll never get everyone to agree on what you base morality on you\u2019ll never be able to have objective morality everyone agrees with. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, nothing in the mind of a human being is really objective.  Right and wrong and good and evil exist if what you're talking about is the impact they have.  Humans hurt each other because that's what we tend to do to people we believe are hurting us, and, foolish creatures as we are, we sometimes blame other humans for negative things in our life; things they may or may not be responsible for, and if the former, are not aware are causing harm. This is a thing living things have done forever: fight or flee from things that hurt them.  Humans feel good about helping each other because it's a good trait for a species to have to avoid being wiped out; individual humans who sacrifice themselves for the sake of others may get removed from the gene pool (if they haven't already procreated), but the willingness is a desirable trait. Being hesitant to hurt or kill others of our own species is great for not thinning our own population to the point of endangerment, though we do have a habit of killing each other a lot.  But there's no such thing as objective morality, because all morality, whatever end it has, has to have an end, and what that purpose is is subject to opinion.  ",

            "answer_text": "First, I think it is important not to be too black-and-white.  Think of \"objective\" and \"subjective\" as being at either ends of a spectrum.  Most things will fall somewhere in the middle.  There are certain things that are more subjective or more objective but unless you believe in a particular religion no moral ideas are absolutely objective.   Perhaps the easiest example is murder.  Let's make it even easier and say murdering a helpless child  You'd be hard-pressed to find a society out there that doesn't condemn such an act.  So for all intents and purposes you can say it is objectively, categorically wrong to murder an innocent child.  But is there some law of nature out there commanding this as a rule?  No.  And if some society out there decided that it was okay to murder children could you objectively prove them wrong?  I'm not sure but I lean towards no.   Now let's make things a little more complicated.  The answer above took place in a vacuum.  Now let's apply a real-world idea.  Human beings are a species, and there are certain things that are biologically hard-wired into any species.  For example, the predisposition towards the proliferation of the species.  Basically, all species want to see the continuation of the species.  I'm no scientist but I would bet that is a hard, objective principle.  So apply this idea to the previous example of murdering a child.  Is it objectively wrong in a vacuum? No.  But if a species, group, society, etc. has a hard predisposition to continue existing then murdering your offspring goes directly against that predisposed principle.  So yes, in this world it is objectively wrong to murder an innocent child that poses zero harm, right? Now let's add another twist.  That innocent child has a highly infectious disease that could wipe out the society.  Or maybe a village has ten babies and only enough food to ensure the survival of nine.  Now is it okay to murder a child?  You could make a case for either.   See where I'm going with this?  I think there is an exception to every rule or principle out there.  Even if that exception is so crazy that it only happens once in a thousand years, it is still a small chip in the objectivity of that rule that prevents the rule from being 100% objectively right or wrong.  In the end, I think that some things might be 99.999% objectively right or wrong.  But absolutely, completely, 100%?  I would lean towards saying no.   ",

            "answer_text": "The word \u201cobjective\u201d is problematic for me in this context. The dictionary definition talks of being \u201cnot influenced by personal feelings or opinions\u201d - in relation specifically to facts. 1) Morality is not served by being viewed as any kind of fact 2) It is entirely a feeling . We often forget there are two kinds. Emotions (w/o which enjoyment of any kind is impossible) & intuition (where virtually all wisdom derives). Intuition & its treasures of insight & wisdom are the gateway to understanding our emotions (not just feeling them) & then we can understand what\u2019s moral. \u201cFacts\u201d are artificial little prisons that do not help us quantify & define the feelings that help us understand the truth, of what we feel or whats moral. The calculating part of the conscious mind is not flexible or subtle enough. The unconscious is where we process all our deepest wisdom, genius, intuition etc. Then it hands it over to the conscious for it to process. Its a dance between the two. None of which is unduly pedantic or trivial. W/O our intuitive based wisdom there is no perception or application of morality. How do you take it out of the theoretical & do such a thing? Well let\u2019s look at the the principle at the heart of all psychology: The ability to spot your emotions coming up & deal with them. You are then self aware & not reacting unthinkingly. You are then capable of much more genuine morality as I detail below. Let\u2019s redefine \u201cobjective\u201d first. Truth or truthful works for me. The primary way to arrive at truthful morality is to understand its source. It is nether a social or psychological construct. It is verifiably biological, grounded in our ability to empathize. This is a widely accepted truth. The harm or good being done to another & then felt by the empathizer can thus be felt - & that is principally the basis for all morality. I would add this to truly deepen & extend our understanding of moral action. There was once a documentary that asked a variety of people chosen randomly on the street, mixed in with celebrities: \u201cThe Beatles line, All you need is Love - is it true?\u201d. A variety of answers ensued from yes to no & much in between, but what it took me a long while of pondering to arrive at is - Absolutely nothing we do has any worth whatsoever, unless it has a component of love. What really drives the truth of this home for me is the further realization that many crucial things are substantially composed of Love that had not initially occurred to me - & no doubt others. Integrity, honesty, dedication, true sincerity & courage to name some. The last one, courage is the something crucially soulful that says to the body: \u201cYou may get hurt or even die doing a thing that is nevertheless so crucial to a higher good, it still must be done\u201d. There are different kinds of love, romantic being the most confusing, combining physical, emotional & spiritual in volatile ways, but for our purposes here the spiritual predominates - which is mostly what compassion, dedication, integrity & similar are composed of. Emotions are designed to support the process but they can sometimes have a life of their own i.e. the complications of romantic passion. It isn\u2019t always easy to be moral with absolute purity - but that\u2019s what life lessons are for, to strive nevertheless. If it doesn\u2019t cost you something then how valuable could it possibly be? ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, in philosophy, the claim that moral claims express true or false statements is called moral realism, while moral anti-realism holds that all moral claims are false (made up; constructed). Moral realism (objectivism) states that moral claims can be factually right or wrong, completely independently of what people think or feel.Moral anti-realism (subjectivism) states that moral claims are only expressions of the attitude of the person or society that claims them to be true - they are not true independently.In that sense, anti-realists cannot argue that someone did something \u2018wrong\u2019. They can only say that they or their society considers it wrong. Reductio ad absurdum; a subjectivist thinks that committing genocide is not actually \u2018wrong\u2019, it is just socially unacceptable to most people. Realists can say that genocide is wrong, even if all of society thinks it is acceptable. But the issue is: how do we know which actions are wrong when people disagree? Philosophers have come up with theories such as virtue ethics, deontology, and utilitarianism, which create frameworks for ethical judgements. But philosophers today are surprisingly evenly split between these three main theories. This is a long and old debate and it has created a field within moral philosophy called \u2018metaethics\u2019. In their own way, both main positions seem hard to accept. Philosophy is not done investigating this, but some great work on the topic includes On What Matters (Parfit) and Moral Uncertainty (MacAskill, Bykvist, Ord). To see where most philosophers stand today, see this survey: 56.4% - Accept or lean toward: moral realism27.7% - Accept or lean toward: moral anti-realism15.9% - Other ",

That meant he was happy, liked, etc. Plenty of people called him \u201ca great guy\u201d. You know what he didn't like? The guys that tried to assassinate him. He thought they were wrong, and needed to be punished. So he did. He had them killed. After all, THEY were the enemy. Today, we call those assassins \u201cHeros\u201d because (we say) what they did was right\u2026not wrong. So, what's the answer? Who was absolutely right and who was absolutely wrong? Not sure? It really depends on who you ask, doesn't it? To know right from wrong, we need some rule to follow. I like the one Confucius wrote 2,500 years ago: DON\u2019T do to others what you wouldn't want done to you. To me, that means Hitler shouldn't have killed/slaughtered Jews and he shouldn't have invaded any countries. So, (to me) he was wrong. One very simple rule to follow. Works well. However, I'm guessing Hitler had a different rule to follow; maybe like \u201cWin at any cost\u201d or something like that. He thought--and did things--based on his perspective. I say we should all follow Confucius' rule. It allows for individual perspective while unifying people around core shared principles. ",

I command one of you to stand tall right now. Silence? Is this what is to be so? Silence universal and so made a lie. What silence is made in response to a truth impenetrable? What is this muck stifling our will to make shared - and in sharing more real \u2013 a secret we know but refuse to utter? No one among you? No one will raise their hand? Well if you must remain so softly reluctant let me give you a truth of my own so that you may assess whether your perception of weakness soon allows a feeling of strength. May my standing here and making account of our largest shared lie, give you a sense of who you are in reference to me: humble, kind, chaste and poor. Let my most distasteful and restless thoughts serve you as you conceive your difference to my character. Last night I dreamt of rape. In some hut on some lonely hill I was tied up; shoved about and sexually manipulated at the hands of a small mob dancing around on old wooden floors. I was bound, gagged, immoveable of my own accord, and thrown about by broad-shouldered shapes with broad and strong hands. I awoke before I was beaten which made for more disappointment rather than relief; I felt unfairly ejected from the centre of the dream I was about to make lucid. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had thoughts of rape. I\u2019ve day-dreamed while sitting at dreary everyday-desks on the discomfort of this itch only ever satisfyingly scratched by imagining my utter objectification \u2013its wholly naked form making me the creation of uncontrolled and impulsive drives. Have you fantasised about being so objectified? Are you angry at me for these depraved day-dreams? And if you are then step forth and state it is so! In stepping forth accept too the judgement of others in the fullness of the moral dependencies that you shall use to catalogue your critique. If you are rational, you\u2019ll defend against Hume; if you are religious then against Darwin. What a sickly unwell social edifice that proscribes our moral judgement? What edifice? The one you all so have created through your resentment toward my thought. And to think: I can be no more accountable for my fantasies as responsible for the breathe I now pass; no more the author of my imaginings than the director of my dreams. I do not take up an axe to this dry deadwood because I would prefer my personal acreage to be better kept \u2013 this burn-off foresees the hot and unseasonal conditions that make dry branches and brown leaves fired and deadly. It is for you that I claim higher ground and reject the necessity of all that is humble in search for what might save us from this impending inferno of our minds. For the death of the world that we share together is growing steadily near; and we must set-right the digital records we are now making of our minds so that when our analogue embodiment of life does die (as surely it must soon), something of meaning might survive. Perhaps something sufficiently infused with prosperity that it could make existence justifiable. My old lungs. My broken bones. My aching sense of growing old. If our conversing is to be worth anything at all; be it defined as worthy as a pursuit of katastematic pleasure \u2013 a precedent of Creation; a justification to the singularity at the centre of our experience of sentience \u2013 desire, satisfaction, desire, repeat. Our digital world ascends this dilemma and I point here to that world and its obvious failings so that it can be improved and evolved \u2013 the first answer to the inescapable analogue world awaiting all biological things in the cosmic coil of a cooling universe where time ceases to exist: where photons rest peacefully across the whole galaxy in a state of constancy \u2013 the space where nothing changes; where staticism stops time. Your silence infers my madness. And the truth of my words makes your judgement of such silence more repugnant than my other fantasies: sex with subordinates at work; orgies with my real-life friends who I\u2019ve never known naked. Make your mark in criticism or agreement. But sit silently and be deemed to vote as I must now do: that our digital world of record is built in other cracks inside its flaws. So snap out of it \u2013 this is eternity at stake. I seek someone willing to raise their hand and speak of things thoughts that they would never say. You\u2019re falsely inferred responsibility for fantasies is making our collective consciousness and our digital record of this previously analogue life a fallacy of phallic proportions.

            "answer_text": "With decline in religious belief some people think there are no grounds for moral action other than mere whim. I strongly disagree. A person\u2019s acts will be judged good or bad by their consequences and, if that person wishes the world to be a better place to live in, he will be duty bound to make sure they have good consequences. Any act which satisfies our appetites and achieves our goals makes us happier and is therefore good for us. To expand on that whatever goes some way toward satisfying our appetites and solving our problems, and thereby reducing the amount of conscious mental activity in the normally alert and aware human mind, amplifies the happiness in that mind because that is what happiness is. Such an event is described conventionally as \"good\". However, the question now arises whether or not a \u201cgood\u201d act is always a \u201cmoral\u201d one. \u201cGood\u201d relates to the individual while \u201cmoral\u201d relates to the group of which that individual is a member. (That group is ultimately the human race.) We have been used to thinking about moral concepts as edicts handed down from a superpower which we must blindly obey, when in fact they will turn out to have always been derived pragmatically, for our collective benefit. If we obey generalised, moral rules we will feel happier because such rules have been derived with that outcome in mind. What sets the scene for our discussion is the observation that people who are members of a fully inter-dependent, co-operating group of specialists fare far better in terms of getting their appetites satisfied than individuals acting alone. Imagine having to sow, tend and reap your own crops, herd your own stock animals, make your own clay bricks and build your own house with them, quarry the slates for your roof, not to mention being obliged to design and build your own computer; the list is endless. You would be a jack of- all- trades, master of none. Your life would be one long round of back-breaking drudgery from dawn to dusk - and that just to stay alive. However, being heir to the incalculable advantages of membership of a co-operating, specialising, interdependent group ensures that our lives are not like that. It is for this reason that no effort must be spared and no duty shirked in supporting and sustaining the group. Some groups fare better than others depending in part upon the quality of the contributions of individual members. While analysing the activity of group members in order to discover the best ways of collectively satisfying their appetites, the concept of an ideal group member has evolved quite naturally. The ideal member\u2019s attributes have been defined to become the criteria by which other potential or existing members are measured, urged to conform to and perhaps even selected by. For a group to work well it has been discovered long ago that the ideal group member must not lie, cheat or steal etc. He will be punctual, resourceful and reliable etc. His word will be his bond. The most efficient group members have been found to be mutually trustworthy, each able to rely absolutely on the other's dependability in performing the specialised tasks allotted to them to the best of their ability. In the ideal group (which is the most efficient group), bonds of mutual trust and respect will arise. What each man earns will be guaranteed by all. What each owns will be safeguarded by all. An unwritten contract will have been established which guarantees each participating group member a fair share of the results of his efforts and a fair allocation of the resources of the group, otherwise the incentive to act together would be weakened and ultimately vanish altogether. Over many millennia, and probably through bitter experience, examples of fairly safe generalities defining attributes beneficial to group performance have been derived pragmatically and designated as virtues. In this manner virtues, morals and ultimately a system of enforceable law have been developed. Each situation has been analysed to find the best way to act in order to maximise the happiness of individuals in the group. This is why monogamy has been found to be good for one society, while polygamy is found better for another. What produces most happiness in one set of circumstances has been found not to be suitable in another set. However, there are few exceptions to rules like, \u201cdo not lie, steal or murder.\u201d Individuals will gladly shoulder duties and responsibilities in order to conserve the priceless advantage conferred by group membership. Such an unquestionable advantage in the satisfaction of appetite will give moral (group) considerations absolute precedence over the merely good (individual) ones. Saying that, raises the question of whether the word \u201cgood\u201d has any separate meaning at all. Surely it is true to say that all acts must be moral ones because one can rarely behave in a way that his actions effect himself alone. Most actions are social actions. Such is the enormous value of group membership that in every case, the interest or survival of the group will take precedence over the interest or survival of the individual group member. For it is an incontrovertible fact that by contributing to the specialised, co-operating, interdependent group, the individual can so much more easily achieve his own personal goals and be much happier Considering the social constraints imposed upon us by being moral to be merely a personal whim with no logical support will ensure that the necessary cohesion of our society dissolves - little by little. Moral precepts are common-sense rules which will, if adhered to, reinforce the bonds of the group and maximise everyone\u2019s chance of happiness. The best actions are moral ones. When members of a group forsake virtuous action, the performance of that group will deteriorate until eventually there will be no advantage to be gained from being part of it. Then group members would have to be motivated by fear to carry out their duties. In that sort of nightmare society, such a turn of events would provoke social unrest, then riots and ultimately revolution. ",

If there is no such objective obligation, at best you have is a system of recommendations, devoid of obligatory weight.I have yet to see a coherent notion of objective obligation that can ground an objective moral system.I must therefore conclude that there is no objective morality.Other factors that bring objective morality into question include the following: Can there be an objective system of morality where those considered \"immoral\" if breaking its rules do not have sufficient knowledge and understanding of those rules?Is the tight convergence between the socially constructed emotional dispositions of a group of humans and its choice of moral systems 1) merely coincidental and that there is a legitimate objective moral system that transcends emotional dispositions, or 2) an indication that what they are calling \"morality\" is simply an artifactual rough facade of rules cobbled together to approximate the group's socially constructed emotional disposition? And is this argument not strengthened when we find competing systems of morality in cultures of different emotional dispositions?Would not a coherent moral system provide legitimate and clear answers in all scenarios that those who have adopted the system would classify as moral scenarios? The following are just a few example scenarios:Allowing two starving neighbor children to die to save one of your ownHonoring the wishes of dead relatives by forfeiting the well-being of the livingMandatory organ donation by those killed in accidentsCorporate punishment for children in high-risk contexts where disobedience often leads to deathLying to suicidal or terminally ill individuals so they can die happyGranting mentally ill people the right to marryTaking a job at a harmful company to reduce its harm",

We have not created the gifts of conscience and reason. Morality and good deeds are not enough for salvation; salvation requires obedience and repentance in addition to the good deeds. We should remember that the true religion teachings will not change Feeding the hungry is a virtue as taught by all prophets and it will remain so until heaven and earth pass away Defending the oppressed is a virtue as taught by all prophets and it will remain so until heaven and earth pass away Self-constraints, patience, and resisting temptations are virtues, and will remain so until heaven and earth pass away Homosexuality is a sin as taught by all prophets Premarital sex is a sin as taught by all prophets Sex outside marriage is a sin as taught by all prophets and will remain as a sin until heaven and earth pass away Creation of male and female is one of the signs of God; marriage is the recommended relationship between male and female. Qur\u2019an 30:21 \u2018And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy.

Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance.

There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-... We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God has enabled people to choose their own destinations. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife.

Others place at the top any of the other moral values. However, though many of us can identify our moral standards, we don\u2019t use them. In a dilemma, a situation forcing us to violate one moral value for another, our brains go into an extraordinarily complicated sifting of our moral values until one emerges and trumps the other.

That makes it possible. But the more interesting question is how moral claims could be true. What makes such claims true? Is there a feature of reality, independent of our dispositions, that makes some action right? I think so. Pain is essentially bad. It\u2019s an undeniable feature of reality. Actions that cause the least amount of pain covering the widest scope practical, are right. Of course, not everyone agrees with that criterion, instead opting for rules that disallow certain unenviable consequences of utilitarianism, but I think using pain as the \u201cobjective\u201d grounding for moral claims is the best way to go.

            "answer_text": "Morality is a philosophical category, it is matter of science, not beliefs. It also depends on definition. There are several schools of thoughts in philosophy of ethics. One is particularly interesting. It differentiates moral and ethics. Moral is a set of rules defined by group of people. Different group of people can have different set of rules. Moral is constantly changing. For example \u201cdo not kill\u201d is a moral rule in Christian morality; \u201cobserve Sabbath day\u201d is a moral rule in Jewish morality.Ethics is intrinsic property of humans (some say of any life). Those rules are universal and invariable. For example \u201cDon't do to others what you wouldn't want done to yourself\u201dAnother interesting school of thoughts is intuitionism. If we so not assume that all humans have to have the same intuition (which makes it ethics in item 2 above), then such intuitionism will be subjective. At the end, objective vs subjective is a core question of philosophy, so it really depends on where you stand. ",

For what it's worth, Wikipedia says: Moral realism ... claims: Ethical sentences express propositions.Some such propositions are true.Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of subjective opinion.(emphasis mine) And that: One study found that [twice as many] philosophers accept or lean towards  moral realism as accept or lean towards moral anti-realism.

So it matters who a child's father is.  The same applies to small businesses and craft, with craft skills often being passed down from father to (presumed) son. It's notable that sexual rules are mostly loose among hunter-gatherers, and have broken down now that most of us are wage workers whose status depends on individual skills. ",

Any such rule is called a mor\u00e9, French accented e pronounced \"mor-ay\". The adjective form is moral, and the habit of following mor\u00e9s is morality. Mor\u00e9s are arbitrary: they do not have to be right, only accepted. Another group on the other side of the river might have very different mor\u00e9s. A collection of mor\u00e9s defines a culture.

Their moral values have not only changed dramatically in the last few years, but they are all over the map. ",

Moral in mundane is ambiguous (whether subjective or objective), while moral in horizontal divine is articulated one. We come back again, that is to say that moral in mundane is based on perfection's requirements, while moral in divine is based on goodness requisites. Nhhh, what?

It looks like many claim to do that when they say they believe in evolution, and that it is an objective credulity they engage in, calling it a science although there is no evidence and it cannot be duplicated. The morality lined out in the Bible is objective, rational, and reality based with good life for all as its objective. The best, most beneficial way for humans to interrelate is given in a written format easy for anyone to understand, and following it brings the greatest happinesses of any code of conduct.

All cultures have their own versions, of course, and they vary according to the particulars of those cultures. But there is general agreement among all historical civilizations of the innate moral worth of refraining from murder, theft, and adultery, of showing appropriate honor to one\u2019s parents and to the aged, for kindness rather than cruelty, of showing respect to God or the gods, of showing courage rather than cowardice and loyalty rather than betrayal, and to telling the truth. If you want to explore this further, CS Lewis wrote two books you should read. In \u201cMere Christianity,\u201d the first 1/3 of his book produces an argument for the existence of God based on humanity\u2019s common morality, and he addresses a number of the questions that would arise in this context (like, \u201cHow do we know that our conscience is not just a physical part of ourselves, but refers to something outside of ourselves?\u201d). In \u201cThe Abolition of Man,\u201d he actually lists in the appendix proverbs from ancient cultures that express the same set of common moral precepts. ",

Objective reality is one that is true for every one regardless of one's own opinions, beliefs or values. This is the true reality, which is God and his word. The Supreme Consciousness of creation is the One God. The scriptures alone hold the key to true morals, which are unequivocal and ever-lasting.

But there is no reason we should be satisfied with morality that is inconsistent across political boundaries, any more than we should accept morality that varies from person to person. To reach consensus on difficult ethical questions, we need to derive the answers from simpler principles that are not controversial. Once we agree on the axioms of ethics, we can derive consequences that are unambiguous and universal. Unfortunately, actual systems of law tend to work in the opposite way: by accumulating endless rules as convenient solutions to immediate, isolated problems.

We have no universal reference point from which to assert a universal morality, and no good reason to believe that such a morality exists. After all, if person A has a sheet of paper on which they insist is written the one, true, universal objective morality, and person B likewise has such a sheet of paper, but the content of each paper differs, how would we go about determining which code, if either, was correct?

By what standard should morals be absolute? A moral standard? But then, that standard would itself have to be absolute. Similarly, if morals should be relative, then by what standard should they be relative? A moral standard? But such a standard would need to be absolute, because if it were were relative, then morals themselves would not always be relative, and would sometimes be absolute. In short, morality, like truth, is one of those concepts that are implicitly both universal, and absolute. These are called categorical concepts. The categorical nature of these concepts is why, despite the naturalistic and materialistic bent of contemporary philosophy, the objectivity of morality has not been disproved, although neither has it been proved.
