            "answer_text": "Hi, I think this is the most difficult concept to wrap your head around, assuming anybody can, even fleetingly, before being overwhelmed in the thought attempt. If you don\u2019t ultimately accept an ostensive definition then that means this is the unanswerable. I think some confuse the universe, which I\u2019m given to understand is not the \u2018whole\u2019 thing, with the greater idea of existence. The second is what gives rise to the first, to \u2018every\u2019 -thing else. It\u2019s to my mind the ultimate precursor sine qua non. The universe is what we see and \u2018see\u2019, what the Hawkings of the world think and talk about and describe in numbers etc: This is not the same thing as \u2018all\u2019 of existence. So, Yes, the universe can expand or not or the opposite or something entirely different is going on\u2026 and this is as close as we can get. Walls and shells are out, and the question doesn\u2019t ask about destruction of the universe, but again, we cannot get any closer to (some further grasp of) existence than this. Period. Do you see what I mean? And again, don\u2019t conflate universe with existence, or let anybody else pull that one on you either. And while we\u2019re at it, don\u2019t forget the other direction, the tiny, tiny-er, tiny-est, tiny-est-est, uber-tiny-est-est, etc. And the same rules apply going this way, too. So don\u2019t sweat it\u2026 and maybe this is a jumping off point for some: it\u2019s just that jumping off doesn\u2019t change anything about the \u2018object\u2019 of the effort. ",

            "answer_text": "From a purely mathematical point of view the universe is infinite. However the concept or imagining of infinity is something that our finite minds struggle with comprehending. This is compounded with the notion of the \u201cbig-bang\u201d as many think of it as an explosion with matter radiating from a central point, a rapidly expanding sphere, which if it was like that would have an edge. When we gaze at the universe we see, as Einstein postulated, Space-time, and time, rather than space, is the important aspect of what we are looking at. Everything in the universe is moving through relative time and is rushing towards infinity or perhaps, and this becomes more philosophical, eternity. Movement (gravity) in all matter is seen to be towards where time slows or stops. Even on our planet, time is relatively faster on a mountain top than at sea-level. The centre of the universe is everywhere because time started everywhere. ",

            "answer_text": "If it is finite in size, rather than a wall or shell or other similar \u2018edge\u2019, it could wrap back on itself. Often people describe this with a comparison to the curved 2 dimensional surface of a sphere. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that light could circle back on itself given enough time and ignoring any expansion. It could be that far beyond the edge of our observable universe, say in the opposite \u2018hemisphere\u2019 from the milky way, there exists a \u2018great attractor\u2019 that concentrates the bulk of the mass of the universe in a very large black hole. Light traveling in any direction would be bent such that it would fall into the gravity well of such an object. The edge of our observable universe could be analogous to the event horizon of such an object. ",
