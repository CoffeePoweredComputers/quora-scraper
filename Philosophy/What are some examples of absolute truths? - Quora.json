            "answer_text": "Yes, about death. Death is certain. Nothing - not even the largest galaxies or even the mysterious black holes can escape death. It is the only thing both science and religion agree on without any problems. Its certainty is so guaranteed that even mere mention of it sends a bad vibe. And there exists a truly absolute truth. I\u2019m sure most of us would\u2019ve noticed this aspect of death by the time we are mature enough to grasp its concept. Well, what people fail to notice is that birth too, is an absolute truth - a combination of various physical and chemical aspects of the world that come together to create a self-sustaining reaction, which is life. And there is your second absolute truth. Well, time is there in the third place, with a speed greater than any know entity, living or non-living. You can never catch it, but you can always feel its presence. And this list can go on. But, well this list is not going to help you, is it? I feel that this question is coming from a person who has become a victim of a great betrayal. Well, for you, my fellow human being - life is such. We all go through it at some point in our lives, maybe even at various points. I would not advise you on anything, because I believe we forge our way through life based on our own \u201ccustomized\u201d advice and not upon other people\u2019s advice. But what I would like to say is that our lives are far too negligible in this world where greater things beyond, our greatest imaginations occur often. And it would not be wise to spend our time contemplating the absolute truths of the world when all of our inventions and discoveries are based on what and how we make them to be. After all, \u2018truth\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be \u2018truth\u2019 if it had been coined a \u2018lie\u2019 in the first place, would it? It depends\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "Whether or not there is an absolute anything is a question that philosophers have long struggled with. However, there are some things that we know: Cogito Ergo Sum: It is possible for each person comprehending this sentence (which may or may not just be me) to observe some emergent idea of an individual that they called \u201cI\u201d which may or may not matter in the grand scheme of things. This does not imply that \u201cI\u201d is a unified and separate concept uniquely different from anything else, only that the perception of which is. This is probably best poetically put, \u201cIf this is all a dream, at least something is doing the dreaming\u201d.That the \u201cI\u201d cannot sense anything externally with any certainty. We are all capable of being fooled by illusions and of believing partial-truths. If we could perceive all things with certainty, we would be omniscient, and hence we would not perceive change.I\u2019m assuming that also implies: Beliefs must at least conceptually exist (and can usually share); therefore, there are things that do not exist in the physical reality, existing only as ideas that more than one may share. The whole of mathematics is another great example of this.Because we can (usually) share these concepts between \u201cI\u201ds, some emergent concept called communication must exist, and because communication exists, so must interactions.Interaction requires change; therefore, some notion of the evolution (change of) the perceptible must occur. Hence, there is some notion of before-and-after, which is an order by which the occurrence of events (interactions) must occur locally, even if it\u2019s ultimately cyclic in the grand scheme of things, losing all \u201cprogress\u201d.There must be some notion of local \u201cprogress\u201d, by which we can assign properties to, through our perception, and identify that as \u201ctime\u201d.So far, in summary: You (or at least I) exist(\u201cMany things\u201d) can and do change over time (I tried to put \u201cmany things\u201d there, but I can\u2019t even count or identify a \u201cthing\u201d yet )",
