            "answer_text": "In my case it's the direct cause. The treatment I received from the Christian community was more disgusting then eating a bowl of dog shit. Even if the Christian (Abrahamic) God was proved to be completely real beyond any possible doubts, I'd personally beg to go to Hell. You heard me right \u2014 I'd do literally anything to avoid being held hostage in a place filled with Christians. In my case, I was brutalized and ostracized socially as a child and no one did anything to help, instead they joined in on the fun. I'm now unable to trust social situations, even with my spotter, and can not navigate social situations in my own. Those \u201cGood Christian\u201d values will always make my skin crawl because it was primarily the church groups that decided that biblical punishment was the only way to get me to \u201csee the light and become a good person\u201d with their judgemental attitudes. A few of these punishments included: Attempted crucifixion (I was saved by a drunk driver)Tied to a pole and set on fire (the fire brigade saved me)Tied to a chair and was stoned by hurled rocks and left for deadBeaten with an iron rod until I confessed to heresyBeaten with clubs and batsShunned by everyone in the communitySpat upon every dayReminded constantly that I'll go to Hell (Hell is living with religious zealots \u2014 been there, done that!)Excluded from all community eventsExpelled from school for not agreeing to an exorcismThese are just the tip of the iceberg. If this God person is real, he has a lot of explaining to do about his followers. ",
