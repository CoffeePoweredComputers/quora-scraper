            "answer_text": "Start with the 1st year university classics. I would recommend you begin with epistemology. Epistemology is the theory of knowledge. What can be known and how it can be known. This is an excellent stepping stone into the world of philosophy. No other branch, in my opinion will teach critical thinking applicable to other branches quite so well. Meditations on First Philosophy, Rene Descartes This will give you a solid grasp on epistemology. Cartesian radical doubt is a very important concept which informs much of modern philosophy. The meditations are also an excellent primer to meta-ethics while not touching on the subject directly. Meditation (essentially chapter) three dives into arguments in favour of the existence of God introducing a series of arguments varying in complexity. Very few esteemed philosophical texts are easy reads for a beginner but this is about as close as they come. An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, David Hume Hume\u2019s perspectives are often contrasted with Descartes. Both texts concern what we can know and how we can know it, epistemology. Hume\u2019s analysis relies heavily on experience while descartes considered experience fundamentally unreliable. That being said, this text is perhaps most famous for Hume\u2019s \u201cproblem of induction\u201d. This argument considers whether any empirical knowledge can be anything beyond hypothesis. As a beginner you should find Hume\u2019s terminology well explained and easily understood but it is still advisable to take your time and make sure the concepts are deeply cemented in your mind. These two compliment each other fantastically. There is a reason they are studied so frequently in first semester university courses. They are an excellent introduction to distinct perspectives on epistemology and inform the distinction between rationalists (Descartes) and empiricists (Hume) as well as any two texts can. I would recommend reading these before moving on to more complex works such as\u2026 Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, Immanuel Kant Kant is notoriously difficult to read. That being said Groundwork is a very solid entry to a complex understanding of ethics. Kant marries epistemology and methaphysics to create one of the more well renowned deontological (duty ethics) theories studied today. What this means is your study of Descartes and Hume will lend itself to an understanding of Groundwork. Having the advantage of prior engagement with philosophical texts will also be helpful here. From here study whatever you want. In ethics you may want to examine utilitarianism, this should be an easy read after understanding Kant. Take a look at the works of Jeremy Bentham to understand \u201cact utilitarianism\u201d and the works of John Stuart Mill to understand \u201crule utilitarianism\u201d. If you were intrigued but not fully on board with Kantian ethics there is no philosopher I can recommend more than Schopenhauer. \u201cThe World as Will and Representation\u201d provides some fascinating critiques. It is my opinion that Descartes, Hume and Kant (within the context of the texts I laid out) will provide the best introduction to philosophy for a beginner. Take your time with each book. Read each chapter several times. Look up ideas you don\u2019t fully understand. Once you have a solid foundation in philosophy read whomever interests you the most. Philosophy is not easy to get into but it can be tremendously rewarding. Thanks for reading! Oh and make use of the objections and replies! Most texts include objections from the philosopher\u2019s contemporaries and can be a great way to understand argumentation. ",
