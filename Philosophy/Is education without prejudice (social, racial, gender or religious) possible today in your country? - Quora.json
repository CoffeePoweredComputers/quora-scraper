            "answer_text": "By and large, many of the UK\u2019s schools are church of England, meaning that I spent my entire primary school period, and two years in sixth form, sitting through Christian prayers and bible readings in assembly. My brother caused a bit of a stir as a kid for refusing to say grace before eating; none of us were raised religious, and he couldn\u2019t get his head around the concept. Thankfully they phased that sort of thing out before I started school. Individual schools have individual policies for dealing with religious minorities. I think the way they handled it is they didn\u2019t explicitly require anyone to sing hymns or sit in on prayers, and those kids not interested could stand aside in one of the classrooms. I was going through a hippie Buddhist phase in my teen years, so I took great joy in exploiting that privilege. As to the other protected groups; theoretically everyone was equal in their ability to choose what lessons and education they wanted, with the exception of Physical Education - girls got to do things like netball and trampolining, and not boys things like rugby. PE was sex segregated most of the time, except for swimming lessons and particularly wet days. That said, the school didn\u2019t do very much to avoid boys and girls choosing classes along gender stereotypes: the one girl who took an interest in doing electronics saw she was the only girl in class and switched lessons on her first day. I suspect there is some effort to change that now. Another element is around class and parental income. You want a fancy ski trip to the Alps? You got to pay for it. A lot of kids don\u2019t have parents who can pay for those kinds of school holiday trips, so there is a subtle element of classism at work there, where the school supports the kids from richer families. Some trips are paid for by the school, and they tend to be local. As for the disabled? I don\u2019t recall ever seeing a single paraplegic kid in my school. Children with physical or mental disabilities were rare to the point that I can\u2019t remember any - I think there was one girl with ME, and another who was blind. I\u2019m not sure what to make of that disparity. ",
