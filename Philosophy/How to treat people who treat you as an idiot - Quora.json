            "answer_text": "There are only two reasons the person treats you differently- They only know their way of talking; so for example if someone speaks slightly differently than them, they would not know how to respond. And when I say differently, I am in no way comparing better or worst.. I am just trying to suggest two people coming from different backgrounds and different understandings. The second reason which is more frustrating for the person at the receiving end is the egotistical tendencies of the person talking to you which is to say, the self conceited and boastful attitude which derives satisfaction from letting others down. How the two reasons different; the two reasons are different because of the intent. IN the first reason, the person is trying to make and effort to be understood. Whereas in the second reason the person is being conceited and selfish. THe best way to talk to these people is honesty in first case and courage to stand up; saying out clearly what you don\u2019t appreciate. ",
