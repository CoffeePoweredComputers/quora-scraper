            "answer_text": "I contemplated answering this question for a couple days due to it being such a heavy philosophical topic, but I\u2019ll answer it the best I can in a way that\u2019s objective, true, and honest. Breaking down your question and description, you can ask - What propels your desire to question your existence? Why does your hopelessness for finding love and preventing world suffering inspire you to question your existence? Would you know the purpose of your existence if you found love, and there was no world suffering? You will have experiences in life that are \u201ca priori\u201d - there will be no words to describe the experience, no reasoning or rational deductions to conclude a purpose but you will just \u201cknow\u201d and feel purpose. These are special moments in life that aren\u2019t so easily recreated and enter and leave without notice. Sometimes, they are rare. The point being, the feeling and experience of purpose, fulfillment, and these timeless moments aren\u2019t a product of questioning and logic, but experience that can emerge in many ways. With that, here is a logical deduction to answer your question. The Universe is 14 billion years old, life is believed to have been on earth for 3.5 billion years, humans are believed to have been around for 200,000 years, and progress from every aspect of technology, mathematics, politics, science, etc. can be witnessed throughout time. This inclination to progress is a product of the universe, from Universe, to solar system, to earth, to life, to people, and now people carrying out this progression through thinking, feeling and acting. While there are many \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d things happening in the world(another heavy philosophical topic), ultimately there is progress. The same inspiration that lead you to question your existence is the root of all progress in the universe. Where you find fulfillment and purpose the universe finds progress. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a kid yeah. Wired thoughts and imaginations happened. That is normal. You must grow out of that as you grow older. You have to become wiser than emotional. A deep pit was to love to feel sad, and making own imagination for deep sadness. What\u2019s the point hurting oneself? Questions are good when they are useful and asking meaningful answers. What meaningful and what not are not a matter of judgement or favour but to question own questions and give meaningful answers. Many questions need time - some needed many years. Just don\u2019t forget answer when you question your own questions, when you question your assumptions, others\u2019 assumptions, the established beliefs, the conventions, etc. But you alone cannot answer them. You have to become knowledgeable. You must become well informed. You can inform yourself with whatever you can reach - books, articles, what people say, debate, researches, videos, documentaries\u2026 Read scriptures as well - particularly the most popular ones and try to figure out why something is popular among certain group of people - whether they have knowledge of other religions or not, whether they are generally knowledgeable or not.

But the reason of my existence is what I keep pondering about. And its very hard to emerge out from this type of situation but we HAVE to. Thats the thing about LIFE. We always have two options : To cringe about the mishappenings and curse ourselves or others for not doing the right things .Or to move ahead and plan properly by not repeating the mistakes again that is to have a new perspective towards the situation.I follow the latter option or so I try. Every person is born for a purpose , we have to seek for it, accomplish it and spread the fire of positivity . This I BELIEVE. ",

I have loving friends and family who I have fun with but at the end of the day, I lay back in my bed and think to myself what do all these experiences add up to? A 16 year old child. An insignificant adolescent speck in a world in a galaxy in a supercluster in a universe? All I see when I look around me is mediocrity, and the tedium of others lives further depresses me and sends me into the questioning of what makes them whole, makes them get through everyday without breaking down at the realization that their lives are insignificant milliseconds in the grand scheme of the universe. Then I sit up from my spot in the grass. I look around me, slightly dazed after arising from the land of deep thought. I look around me and see the beautiful blue sky contrasted against a sea of green grass spotted with trees and bushes. The sweet, slightly frigid air tickles at my nostrils and the sun shines lightly on my back, warming the cold within me. A happy thought of complete equality with myself and the universe passes over me. Yes, we are dust specks. But we are magnificent dust specks! \u201cThe proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.\u201d - Jack London First answer on quora, probably not going to get much attention but if you see any mistakes please let me know. I always strive to improve and welcome criticism of any kind. ",

Heading into life, one is really concerned with goals and dreams. You obviously have some -- like finding someone who will love you, or reducing the amount of suffering in the world.
