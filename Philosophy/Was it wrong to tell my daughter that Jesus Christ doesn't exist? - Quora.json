            "answer_text": "I'm really sorry to say so but no matter your personal religious beliefs you showed your intellectual ignorance. Contemporary secular and Jewish sources have attested the existence of Jesus Christ. The first century Roman historian Tacitus and the Jewish historian, Flavius Josephus both mentioned the person of Jesus in their writings. Even modern scholars who claimed to be atheist or agnostic acknowledge the existence of Jesus and some even wrote biographies of Him. The academic world would laugh at them and could no longer take them seriously if they would make denial and illeterate claims such as yours. Saying that Jesus doesn't exist is like saying that Julius Caesar never existed. It's a ridiculous statement. What year are we in? 2020 AD you know right that AD means Anno Dominum (in the year of the Lord) in contrast to BC (before Christ). Jesus is so important that our Gregorian calendar started with His birth. The Bible rightly says that' professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.' (KJV Romans 1:22) The main issue is that humanity blinded by the devil is so far gone that rather than acknowledging that Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour they prefer to flat out deny His very existence that gives eternal life, even to the point of ignoring historical sources. Make no mistake the Bible says that' at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father' (Philippians 2:10\u201311). Jesus is coming soon and He's coming back to judge the earth. People are on the Titanic sinking and they are completely oblivious of their upcoming demise. One day you will bow down before the glorious majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ willingly (I hope) or unwillingly. If only you knew that this Jesus that you despise so much is the door through which you must walk to go to heaven. Salvation is in Christ alone. Anyone who rejects Jesus will spend their eternity in hell once they die because our soul is eternal. I won't be politically correct or sugar-coat the Gospel of Christ because people's eternal salvation is at stake and hell is a real place where people land every day. At this very moment who knows how many millions of people are tormented by demons because they have refused to receive the free gift of salvation in Christ while they were still on earth. But yes, let's send people to hell by telling them that the only person who can save them from eternal damnation doesn't exist. The devil hates humanity, he knows that his time is up and that he'll end up in the lake of fire. Satan's purpose is to hurt God by destroying His creation and bring down to hell as many people as possible with him. By saying that Jesus doesn't exist you basically help the enemy to destroy you, your daughter and all your family. Yes, that's an inside job. The devil is a liar, a deceiver and a murderer. It upsets me to see how easily he deceives and indoctrinates generations after generations through TV, music, the media, the education system, etc making them think that they're better off without God. The world is literally falling apart because we want to do life without our Creator. But here is the Gospel of Jesus Christ for those who have ears to hear and the patience to read this post. God is a loving and marvelous that's why He sent His only begotten Son Jesus to earth to fulfill a mission. Men's fallen, sinful nature disqualified them for heaven but God loves the world so much that He chose to redeem humanity from eternal damnation. God is holy and righteous so He couldn't let sin go unpunished. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3 :23) so Jesus, the Son of living God and the Messiah, became flesh and lived a perfect and sinless life and then died on the cross for our sins. Without shedding of blood there's no forgiveness (Hebrews 9:22) that's why Jesus lay down His life for us so that we don't have to go to hell. If we repent of our sins and put our faith in Jesus who paid the ultimate penalty for our sins on the cross, if we accept Him as our personal Lord and Saviour we will be saved. John 14 :6 Jesus said' I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father but through me'. Jesus is the door, the narrow path that leads to heaven and the Father. May every reader who read this post be saved in Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords \ud83d\ude4f ",

            "answer_text": "Its funny that many parents don\u2019t have a problem telling children that Santa is real or that the Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny and other fictitious characters are real. But when people talk about the real existence of Jesus, people get annoyed. Jesus was a real person. He is noted by many historians as a real figure. Not only that the Holy Bible attests to Jesus, His disciples and His ministry. Jesus didn\u2019t have much to gain. What would be the motive for lying ? Neither Jesus nor His apostles gained wealth or privelage. In fact they all were persecuted and eventually died. The Holy Bible is authoritative. It details Jesus\u2019 life and death. It accounts for His teaching of the gospel and ministry. No other written works comes close to the longevity of the Holy Bible. No other book has been more prevalent and withstood the test of time. The Bible is accurate and its truth. I\u2019m not talking about derivative works that are not canon. Catechisms are not valid, nor are modern Christian writings that claim to be extensions of the Old and New Testament. The Apocrypha is not canon and this much is stated in the Bible. I guess the problem isn\u2019t that Jesus never existed. The real issue is that many people don\u2019t want to believe that He was a real human being. They don\u2019t want God to be real, because if He is real then we have accountability for our sinful actions. From what I\u2019ve experience, most people hate the idea of being judged. They prefer to do as they please and if they avoid taking ownership for their poor decisions, kick the can down the road or blame it someone else. Look we are all sinners, that much is clear based on human history. We are have all sinned and come short. Look at all of the world wars. Look at the atrocities. Look at famous people all over the world, like actors/actresses, political leaders, sports stars etc. They have all sinned. They have all been subject to scandalous behavior. We are imperfect, carnal beings. I\u2019m a saved Christian. And before after after I was saved, I knew that I didn\u2019t measure up. I am not good enough to enter into heaven. I feared hell, and rightly so. But God doesn\u2019t hate us. He loves us. We know this because God made it easy for us to enter into heaven. The only requirement is that we are spiritually sinless. But we cannot be sinless because of our sins. We lie, cheat, steal, lust, hate, and covet. What we need is for all of our sins to be forgiven. When we put our faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior, then all of our sins are forgiven, they are erased. It is as if we never committed any sins. This is how we become eternally, spiritually sinless. Faith in Christ saves. Jesus saves. ",
