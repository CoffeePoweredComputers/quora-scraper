            "answer_text": "Deontology, proper, is the study of what \u2018ought\u2019. Alongside ontology (what \u2018is\u2019) and epistemology (how do I know?), it\u2019s one of the basic components of philosophical thinking. However, it seems to be used often as a shorthand for \u2018deontological ethics\u2019, which is a particular school of moral philosophy aimed at determining rules, as opposed to consequentialism, which focusses on outcomes, and virtue ethics, which are about character. If you are using the term as a shorthand for deontological ethics, then you face the problem that there might be a situation where conscience says \u2018do this\u2019, but your rules say \u2018do that\u2019. Whether such a situation can be constructed is open to discussion, but it can certainly exist in principle. Rule-based frameworks correspond strongly with the way authorities require people to act, whether it be parents giving children rules, or governments making laws, but they easily conflict with our innate moral sense. Ultimately it is the innate moral sense which gives us the notion of morality and makes it compelling. Consequentialism is a philosophy, usually in the form of utilitarianism, which most people flirt with at some point. Consequentialism is better than deontological ethics in situations where good is maximised and harm is minimised beyond what mere application of the rules could produce, but it comes into conflict much more often with our innate sense of morality, especially in the area of injustice. It may promote overall wellbeing to reward a murderer who can unite a nation by making him president, but to the family of the murder victim, this is still unjust. Consequentialism also requires us to be able to know what the consequences of our actions will be. But this information is rarely available, except in the more obvious examples in trolleyology.[1] Virtue ethics are concerned with the perfection of character. These may have little benefit to society as a whole, especially if the virtues adopted are pietistic. What\u2019s more, they are only of interest to people who are interested in being virtuous, whereas rule-based frameworks also work for those who are malicious. Ultimately, all forms of moral philosophy are attempts to make our innate moral sense discussable. I may strongly feel that something is wrong, but if it\u2019s a choice we have to make together and I can\u2019t explain that feeling, then it may be that you will have the opposite feeling, and the result will be that we compromise in a way which we both think is wrong, or else one person\u2019s conscience is left unsatisfied. In those terms, deontological ethics (and deontic logic in general) are helpful if both people agree on them. Where people disagree, it may be worth looking at consequentialist methods. Although consequentialism is not really morality, it can give a workable approximation. Footnotes[1] Trolley problem - Wikipedia",

I think most folks who are deontologists end up: With some version of virtue ethics.Rule utilitarianism. (Or combining utilitarianism and deontology in some way).",
