            "answer_text": "\"Observing\" in science means to measure an outcome. Whether you do this yourself or design a machine or just make note of secondary effects that demonstrate a hard to observe primary interaction, that is all considered \"observing\". You seem to be using the common English meaning of the word. \"Seeing\" with visual senses is not what is meant by the scientific use of the word. In physics, the Observer effect shows that any attempt to know the state of some object or process will affect that state and process. As the Wikipedia article on this states, it is really hard to measure the air pressure in a tire without letting out some of the air. But you go further to ask if this changes the outcome of an experiment. It does not. The amount of change that the observation causes can be anticipated and corrected for in your measurements, thus preventing this from having an adverse effect on your data. ",

            "answer_text": "\"observing\" has no effect, but measuring any phenomenon does have an effect on the quantity. It applies to any kind of measurement, but since being an electronics engineering student, I would start with, When you try to measure voltage across two points, the voltmeter will take some current, so the measured quantity will be different than the actual, this is what we call \"Loading Effect.\" In quantum mechanics, we describe an additional intrinsic uncertainty explained by \"Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\", while observing mass and velocity of a subatomic particle.
