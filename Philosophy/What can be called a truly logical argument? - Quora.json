            "answer_text": "Above all, Philosophy is the search for Tangible Truth. Because That which is true is real, anything else is a type of truth that is not truth. So that philosophy is the search for an understanding of reality. Logic therefore being the philosopher\u2019s tool is that which needs no proof because it is real. If a Tool is not real, there can be no work, including mental work. Such That because the truth is real and does not become real, philosophy is the study of uncovering reality from relative realities with the use of logic. A logical argument therefore is based on Tangibility. Meaning the foundation of logic is a three dimensional reality, then a logical argument must start with that which is known to be real. The Fallacy then is the opposite of The Logic because unlike logic, a Fallacy is a statement that is not always true as in based on that which has not been seen or observed. For instance, Because the love cannot be seen or observed, the love for something or someone can change depending on perception, therefore love is a fallacy. And all statements related to love are conditional statements that are themselves based on relativities that are themselves fallacious. So that the \u201cBecause\u201d of love is never real but a relativity that when gone, the love stops. What is real does not stop, or start and has no beginning or ending. Logic was is and always will be the same. A fallacy then is a Hypotheses based on relativity that is followed by a conclusion. A logic is based on a single reality while a fallacy is based on several related realities that are not the single reality that caused the logical query. A Fallacy then is analogous logic. Analogous logic is a type of logic that is not logic. So that all fallacious statements start with \u201cIF\u201d. Any logical hypothesis that opens with an If-then statement which is a relative truth or a conditional statement is a potential lie. A lie is a made up truth. So that an argument or hypothesis that contains the \u201cIF\u201d clause is analogous to logic and is not a logical argument but a Fallacious argument. Thus A True logical argument opens with a Because-Then statement called an absolute Truth or a certitude of reality. Think of it like this, in order for a potential to jump forward it must step backwards into that which it knows with absolute certitude is real. Otherwise it crashes once in a while when IF = Zero where If = zero is reaching back into a void and not stepping back into a reality. So that IF = Zero is the presumption that there is no prior knowledge. That which is conceived without prior knowledge is haphazard, thus eliminating both the possibility of evolution and that of Intelligent design. The fact that a computer crashes is proof in the reality that nothing can create nothing, and something can create something. So that of nothing can come nothing. The presumption of a god is the assumption of zero prior knowledge. This is an absolute fallacy. The logical Statement that Good can only come of good in terms of logic means reality can only come of reality because to logic, good is real. This in terms of logic Evil is the absence of reality thus nothing can only come if nothing is the logical statement that Evil can only come of Evil. Such that by imposing the notion of a creation, and a creator, we are imposing a fallacious notion of reality because We cannot prove with absolute certainty that creation is real because there is no peer witness to it and it needs proof. And any claim to a creator is a fallacy because existence needs no proof of being. If you must prove it, you are using an analogous logic and therefore what you prove is a fallacy while what is obvious is a reality. \u201cBecause-Then\u201d is the only logical argument that proves reality. So that s Tfue Logical argument starts eith Because ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy is define as the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence. But if you\u2019ve study philosophy at all, you\u2019ll know that most of philosophy has nothing to do with reality and everything to do with society and politics. Which is why philosophy is riddled with subjectivity and bias. Logic is define as reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity. And validity is define as the quality of being logically or factually sound. There is nothing really logical about philosophy at all because there is nothing really objective about philosophy. ",
