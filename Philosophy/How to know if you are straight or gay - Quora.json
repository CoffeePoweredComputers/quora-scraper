            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to take this as a sincere question and try to give a sincere answer. When I was five, I was caught playing \u201cdoctor\u201d in the nude with the kid from across the street. We were in the dog house, figuratively in the dog house once caught, literally in it when caught. We took off our clothes and crawled into a dog house. In our favor, it was a big dog house. We instinctively knew there was something wrong with what we were doing, but were intent on doing it nonetheless. We had been fervently examining each other\u2019s every part for perhaps half an hour when my grandmother reached in and dragged me out. She knew we were in there because we had neatly and conscientiously folded our clothes and placed them just outside the structure. Not in our favor. I remember this not because we were having sex or behaving sexually toward each other. I was five; he was six. We had no idea what sex was. Sexuality was a concept entirely beyond our ken. What I remember was the aching need in my gut for a \u2018special\u2019 friend, a male friend, and we would have great intimacy. Other than that description, I didn\u2019t really know what I needed. I didn\u2019t know how to express it. I wouldn\u2019t figure it out until I was thirteen. I went through puberty at eleven, fifth grade. My mother sat me down with an anatomy reference book and explained \u2018the facts\u2019 to me: hormones, pubic hair, penile growth, erections, sex, sexuality. I didn\u2019t really understand sexuality, but I understood sexual attraction \u2014 to another guy. It arose in me daily. And, that aching need was there with a vengeance. I began to associate the two with each other. I still hadn\u2019t a name or external reference for it. I thought I was the only one. By thirteen, seventh grade, I had a name and a reference. The name was homosexual. The reference was from Leviticus. It was abomination, perversion, and evil. I knew I was one. I had no doubt. I hadn\u2019t the slightest interest in girls, not just sexually but also emotionally and intellectually. I was sexually attracted to guys. I had the erections and day-dreaming fantasies to prove it. I routinely jerked off to the men\u2019s underwear ads in the Sears & Roebuck catalog. I discovered the version of gay porn at the time, men\u2019s athletic posing magazines. And there was that familiar aching need. Only now, it wasn\u2019t content just to occupy my gut. It moved to a point behind my sternum and took up residence. It left a yawning gap where blood and tissue should have been. It smarted and gnawed at my serenity. Now you too have an internal reference for homosexuality. You have me as an example. For an external reference, Wikiwand has an article on homosexuality. Homosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions\" to people of the same sex. If you have experienced not just occasional homosexual conduct, but instead a continuing emotional investment, you\u2019re gay. You may have had no homosexual contact but nonetheless, have that gnawing ache that won\u2019t go away. That is an enduring pattern of emotional/romantic same-sex attraction. That is same-sex sexual orientation. That is gay. If instead you have none of that but have had a couple of homosexual encounters without the ache feasting behind your sternum, your straight and just experimenting. If you\u2019ve had several homosexual and heterosexual encounters, and if you\u2019ve enjoyed them both and want to continue with them, you\u2019re bisexual. It doesn\u2019t much matter whether you\u2019re sexually inexperienced. It doesn\u2019t much matter whether you\u2019re five, thirteen, twenty, or thirty-five. What matters is whether you have that enduring pattern of same-sex emotional/romantic attraction, the ache that won\u2019t be satisfied unless you find a man to empathize with and intimately relate to. If yes, you\u2019re gay. If not, not at all, you\u2019re straight. If something else, you\u2019re bisexual. If you\u2019re worrying about it, stop. Just let things play out as they will. Explore, experiment, and don\u2019t worry about putting a name to it. With time and with the knowledge that comes from experience, you will know for sure whether you\u2019re gay.  Q: How do you know for sure if you are gay? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve answered this question numerous times already, but I suppose there\u2019s still some confusion out there. The only true, 100% foolproof, undeniable factor determining if you are gay or not is if the balls touch. It\u2019s that simple. Have your balls touched another man\u2019s balls? If you answered no, then you are most likely not gay. But if you answered yes, even in the context of \u201cjust one time\u201d or \u201cas a joke\u201d or \u201cby mistake\u201d, then i\u2019m afraid you are gayer than cum on a cowboy\u2019s mustache. There\u2019s no grey area. It\u2019s gay science. Exhibit A: Man-Bro really loves to suck him some dick, but is only \u2018curious\u2019, and in fact when asked about his sexuality is more likely to state firmly that he is straight. The verdict here is that he is not gay, despite the vigor he displays while sucking said cocks, and also despite the number of cocks sucked. He could be giving five (5) blowjobs a day for the better half of a decade and even go as far as installing a home gloryhole, but he\u2019s still \u201ctotally straight you guys\u201d, due to the lack of his scrotum not colliding with another set. Exhibit B: Dude-Guy gets invited into the sexual escapades of a recently married couple looking to spice things up a bit. He\u2019s not gay, but the wife in said equation is too sexy to pass up. He joins the pair mid-coitus as he removes his clothing post haste. She is on top of her husband, riding him with seasoned precision while he lays back and grins. She turns back for a moment, inviting their new playmate to join. Dude-Guy jumps behind the vixen, but in his carelessness slips down, missing his mark. The look on the husbands face says everything needing to be said, mouth wide in horror as he feels his testicles squarely bounce off Dude-Guy\u2019s. It\u2019s only for a moment, but it\u2019s impossible to ignore. The wife cries out, running still naked from the bedroom as her husband (soon to be ex), has now become gayballs. The divorce will be quick and neat, at least there were no kids involved in the proceedings. Dude-Guy gets dressed without a word spoken and leaves, silent the whole drive home as his brain tries to grapple with the severity of what just occurred. How is he supposed to tell his parents that now he too, is gayballs? So yeah, want to know for certain if you\u2019r gay or not? Just count how many times your balls have knocked up against another pair. Easy peasy, wonder no more. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I am a good example - I\u2019m as gay as they come, but I am what the queer community often calls \u201cstraight acting\u201d - my most comfortable modes of appearance and behaviors are pretty heteronormative. I am a big guy, I grow my beard out, I\u2019m physically strong, I dress masculine, etc. etc.. This doesn\u2019t make any statements about my being better or worse, of course, than a more effeminate gay man! It\u2019s just who I am. Being gay and being effeminate are two different things that, ultimately, have little to do with one another other than subcultural norms. Check out this infographic for a little helpful context:  What a person\u2019s outward appearance and behaviors that you\u2019re asking about when you say \u201cstraight-looking\u201d are what we call \u201cGender Expression\u201d: how a person chooses to and is comfortable dressing and acting with regards to traditionally masculine and feminine modes. This can be any degree along either concept, or a combination of the two, OR vary from day to day or moment to moment. While these might signal different things socially as a form of non-verbal communication, they are not actually tied to sexual or romantic orientation (attraction). So, a biological male might have a feminine gender, be sexually attracted to males but romantically attracted to neither gender (aka, wants sex, but not a relationship), and oscillate between masculine dress and behaviors and feminine ones from day to day. Or any other combination thereof. Wibbly-wobbly humany-wumany: There\u2019s lots of ways of being human. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes it takes a while. When I was eighteen, I went to university. This was the first time I\u2019d been away from home and in an environment where other young people were actively interested in sex. In my first year, I was in a hall of residence - and I never found the right girl. (Found out several years later that at least one had been dropping pretty big hints, and I had been utterly oblivious\u2026) I did, however, get rather distracted by surfer dude Brian and by Paul, who was quite happy after his shower to hang around the kitchen in just a towel. Second year, I moved off campus. I was very lonely. The urge to find a girlfriend grew stronger but I still couldn\u2019t find \u201cthe one\u201d. And then that summer, aged twenty, I did something I\u2019d never done before. I got some prescription sunglasses. No more squinting in the sunlight. One of the hidden bonuses of sunglasses is that you can check out everyone that walks by without worrying that they\u2019ll notice. I was young, horny and desperate, so I took advantage of this. And I suddenly realised that I wasn\u2019t looking at the girls. I was drawn to the guys, showing off those muscular legs in their short shorts and often going entirely topless. Oh dear. My life had turned complicated. But not so much. I joined the university LGBT group, largely on the grounds that they could maybe tell me for sure. They introduced me to various bars, a gay youth group\u2026 and eventually I came to terms with it all. Still took me a while to find a boyfriend, but that was largely due to social clumsiness. How do you know? Put on some sunglasses, walk down the street, and watch what your eyes are doing. ",

Can you see yourself doing this? Yes? You probably like women. You may be straight. You may not be. Can you not see yourself doing this? You probably don't like women. You may not be straight. Now, imagine you're making out with a hot guy. Imagine getting on one knee, asking him to marry you. Imagine going through the struggles to get a marriage certificate, to make your love for one another valid. Imagine trying to adopt a child, because you know that together, you'll parent the shit out of your kids. Imagine sitting next to your husband, with the same love you have the day you met him. Can you see yourself doing this, and the same with a woman? You're probably bisexual. Or maybe you aren't. Can you see yourself only doing this? You probably like men. You might be gay. You might not be. Finding out you're gay or straight isn't a test you can take. It isn't something anyone else can figure out for you. It is a realization you need to make yourself. (Notice that I said realization and not choice because sexuality is not a choice.) ",

Earlier this year I went to my first pride parade, together with a straight friend of mine.Take a look at my profile picture. I\u2019m a short guy with long hair, a goatee, wear black clothing, and generally dress in a way that makes people immediately place me as \u2018metalhead\u2019 (which is indeed true). Now that day, I went to some lengths to make sure I looked attractive, putting on a shirt that shows off what I pretend is an attractive, muscular body, paying extra attention to my shave and hair, etc. My friend habitually has a very clean shave, spends significant amounts of time styling his hair for those occasions, and generally likes to dress to look good. During the parade he was flirted with by several guys, and constantly had to decline with the words \u201cSorry, I\u2019m straight. He\u2019s bisexual though.\u201d (referring to me). It was generally met with variations of \u201cWhat, really?\u201d. People kept pinning him as the gay one, and me as the straight friend who came along, when it was actually the other way round. He is apparently often thought of as gay; both another friend of his and his current girlfriend at first thought he was gay. People don\u2019t \u201clook gay\u201d or \u201clook straight\u201d. The only reliable method of finding out someone\u2019s sexuality is by asking them politely. ",

In my experience, gay people don't grow extra limbs, or glow funny colours. I know a bloke who's over six and a half feet tall, covered in tattoos, keen on skulls, mohawk, built like a brick privy, winner of a prize for belicose, drunken vomiting at a Pagan camp. I was stunned when he came out, but glad that he felt able to express himself, even though he lost some \u201cfriends\u201d as a result. I also know a teacher, speaking as a heterosexual man, she was a joy to behold, still is, she came out and I felt an idiotic pang of disappointment, as if a woman like that would be interested in a face-ache like me! In both cases, there were no outward signs of their sexual orientation. Conversely, I've been told that I'm gay, had people demand that I admit it, because I hate sport and, until recently, had long hair. I find other men physically repulsive, especially in a sexual way, so it's hardly surprising that my response was initially hilarity, graduating to anger and leaving the conversation before I resorted to violence, which apparently proved the idiot\u2019s point. You can't tell a person's sexuality from their appearance. ",

            "answer_text": "Those aren\u2019t the only options and that can make answering this question for yourself pretty difficult. Most people think of sexuality as a spectrum ranging (at least) from gay to straight. So, you can be mostly straight and a little gay. Or one could be perfectly bisexual where you\u2019re equally \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cstraight.\u201d I knew I was gay because I am a man who is primarily interested in other men for sex and romance. This doesn\u2019t mean I never find women attractive nor that I\u2019ve never considered having sex with women. But, really, I am mostly and most consistently attracted to men. So, I\u2019m gay. If I\u2019m being perfectly frank with you, though, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s absolutely necessary to answer this question for one\u2019s self. It\u2019s handy and convenient to have a label that tells you what\u2019s expected of you, but if you find yourself in a situation where your emotions contradict that label, it can create some difficulties. For example, if you\u2019re convinced you\u2019re gay, but then you meet someone of the other gender who pushes your buttons, you\u2019re forced to ask yourself what that means for your personal identity. I think that\u2019s actually one of the reasons why it can be difficult to come out of the closet. If I were to imagine an ideal society for people, I wouldn\u2019t make this an issue at all. People would just accept the fact that they\u2019re attracted to other people without feeling a need to build their whole identity around that attraction. They could be with men or women based on who they and their partners are. But we don\u2019t live in an imaginary world and I know that people want to be able to figure out which boxes they fit in. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay so.. Talking from own experience here. I identified as bisexual when i got a crush on my female best friend. It happened, i made us 'close close' best friends by copying the stuff american best friends do. (I'm dutch) so.. Kisses on the cheek and hugs! (Ca-ching!) Then she moved to her father's house and i never saw her again. (After we had a huge fight.) And then i continued to have 'heterosexual' relationships simply because i was lonely. That is for another story. So, in 2018, in March. I had just stopped 'dating' a guy and fell into the LGBTQ+ community. I started to follow LGBTQ+ instagrams and everything. So in May/June i was surrounded by it.. And the confusion hit. I was completely confused surrounding my sexuality for 6+ months! I did get about 3 rainbow shirts 2 pair rainbow socks and other rainbow things. (Ssh. This was kinda a hint.) Then at around december i started going to a LGBTQ+ Hangout. Mostly for teens, but everyone is welcome. It was great. And this is gonna sound really stupid for most people who are weirded out by this; but they recommended me to watch porn. NO not the bad kind you find under 15+ virusses. Not the kind that is just terrible. But the kind from Leren, amuseren en fantaseren over sex (Lottelust) (it's dutch. Sorry) They contain women-friendly porn. Might sound full of *** too most, but it also includes 'sexy stories' including gay ones. And i can tell you, owh my.. I'm gay. And demisexual. But also very gay. Until some weeks ago i was still doubting about it, but i honestly get nauscious when i think about dating a male. Even though i do find people who identify as non-binary incredibly interesting and at times attractive, i prefer to call my self gay. Even though i'm still getting used to it, i know it's the right thing to do. *do note that there are MANY sexualities, you can also be queer.. Meaning you belong to the lgbtq+ community but just don't want a specific label. You can also be biromantic and homosexual. It's all okay. Have a nice day! ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, let me make something very clear. That flamboyant guy who is so tooootally gay you see on the TV all the time, or the butch lesbian you see fixing cars and watching football whilst drinking a cold one with the boys. Yeah, those are stereotypes. Sexuality in itself has absolutely no effect on such behavior whatsoever. Of course, most people assume these stereotypes as the majority, as these are usually very extroverted personalities, thus, they are the most visible, and when it\u2019s associated with homosexuality, that tends to be the only part of the community that\u2019s seen. So there is some truth to the stereotype, but that\u2019s far from all gay people, if even most, if even a significant percentage. A good amount of gay people, you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to deduct their sexuality as easily as the stereotyped personality - in other words, a good amount of gay people, if not most gay people, act mostly like straight people, you just don\u2019t know it, because they\u2019re not making a huge show if effeminacy or masculinity that isn\u2019t typical for their gender identity. ( Which isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s anything wrong with acting that way, the problem simply lies in the fact that it\u2019s a stereotype, and not a very healthy one for people outside of the LGBTQ+ community to be grouping all gay people in ) I myself am gay, and I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m mostly straight-passing. While I\u2019m certainly not the most masculine macho-man on the face of the Earth, and do have a few minor feminine-oriented tendencies, I don\u2019t really outwardly do much that adheres to the stereotypes of my sexuality, nor is the fact that I\u2019m gay terribly obvious to most people in general. Most of my other gay friends are the same way, though some others are closer to the stereotype. Regardless, the point is just like straight people, gay people are diverse in personality, their sexuality has no direct effect on that, period. ",

For example at my workplace there was a guy who has now left the company and he is gay. And by looking at him you won\u2019t think even in your wildest of imagination that he is gay because he doesn't tick any of the typical gay stereotypes in the gay checklist. I mean there are certain gay stereotypes and being flamboyant is one of the major ones among them. But the guy I\u2019m writing about is at the opposite end of flamboyancy. He is a perfectly straight acting gay guy. Masculine and a ladies man. He pretends good to be straight and many slutty type women were also secretly wished him to be their boyfriend. In fact one girl was totally infatuated by his looks and typical male characteristics. They were seen so much together that people thought they were going to marry. But ah the unlucky girl got infatuated after a guy who is gay. The girl was totally infatuated with the good looking gay guy and the gay guy was totally head over heels for another guy. Yes the gay guy totally and madly fell in love with another guy at the work place. But my point here is its very hard to tell if someone is gay by the way they look. You can be sometimes right sometimes not. ",

And they always had an answer; maybe the way someone walked, a hair style, something about wardrobe, or something about the way the target looked at others. Its a science, I yell ya! And while their internal radars made me a more keen observer of those around me, I never was able to achieve the same \u201cvibe\u201d my friends seemed to have. But I can tell you what it ain\u2019t. The limp wrist, effeminate mannerisms, etc.? Not reliable measures. Possible indicators, yes. But not a positive ID. My suspicion is that people who prefer others of their gender will tend to back me up, on this. How do they do it? I dunno. Hope that helps. ",

You two hit it off, go on a few more dates, then you go with him back to his house one night. Now imagine scenario #2 You were approached by a woman that was interested in going out to dinner with you tomorrow night. You say that you'd pick her up at 7 to take her out. You two hit it off, go on a few more dates, then she invites you in for a drink when you take her home. It is now time for you to think about which scenario you could see yourself acting out.

            "answer_text": "The general consensus is if you are attracted to men exclusively and are a man, then you are gay. If you are a man who is attracted exclusively to women, you are straight. Plot twist: if you are attracted to either men or women within the binary (and this includes trans people because trans men are men and trans women are women), you are bisexual. If you are attracted to a person regardless of gender including intersex, etc. (i.e., you don\u2019t give a shit what gender they identify as), then you\u2019re pansexual. The reality is that pansexual and bisexual often intersect and overlap. The individual is allowed to define it as they see fit. Epilogue: Only you can answer this question for yourself. No one has the right to dictate your sexuality to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. It's really simple, but first I should point out how those aren't the only two sexual orientations. It's not one or the other. But since you narrowed it down to those two, we\u2019ll deal with them. You're going to need two decent people, one of the same sex and one of the opposite. Date each of them for three months. Take note of how you feel about them sexually, emotionally, and physically. Especially make sure to focus more on how their gender affects your attraction. Break up with them after the time period. Think of who you really felt into. Think if you were extremely reluctant or even repulsed from doing with them. There are a lot of factors that impact your attraction. Their personality might skewer the results, however you might notice that you prefer one personality over the other. If you don't want to do that, then you take the very simple way: going through life. Usually in your 20\u2019s you have a good idea of who you're into. Sexual orientation isn't something you should test. It's very fluid and you can be a variety of things you thought you never were. ",

If you also get aroused by a person of the opposite sex, perhaps you are bi. Doesnt matter what the world \u2018labels' you as, its what turns u on.

Unless they are being very obvious about it, none of these are easily answered with quick interactions. The amount of time required would correlate very well with the amount of effort a person is putting into not putting out signals. For example, it would be easier to determine if someone is indeed into you sexually at a bar than at a board meeting; the signals are more obvious (and acceptable) in one location over the other. Similarly, some folk are better at picking up signals, or are just simply more observant - a guy might not realise he\u2019s being blatantly scoped out by another guy because that simply doesn\u2019t enter his mind-space that another guy would do that, whereas a woman might be used to constantly getting attention, even the most subtle of cues, from men, that when she doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s completely obvious to her.

Ok let\u2019s assume you mean people who are not like the ones you have seen in Bollywood movies those clumsy hand movements and all. And my entire answer will be based on this assumption though masculinity and femininity is a very deep subject on it s own if you wish I would recommend you to read some gender text. Any ways coming back to your question. I am an example of the person what you will call a straight looking gay man. I am masculine, independent and strong. The first time I told my friend that I am gaY. His reaction was like no way may be you just needed an easy hole or something on that terms.People in my office and College assumed that I am kind of a player as i am always on my phone. Little did they know I am struggling with my life. In my batch I was famous or infamous as a stud.I am not very good looking or something on that terms but I get hit on regularly by girls may be because of sense of humour or the way I carry myself. Unfortunately I gay guys don\u2019t hit that much on me.4. last in community, there are all spectrum people from masculine to effeminate . So get your head out of the Bollywood shit and think. But lastly I would say being a masculine gay is easy than the effeminate in our society but both of them are sides of the same coin. thanks for the patience. ",

In fact, prejudice against effeminate gay men is unfortunately common in the gay male community. Bottom line: You usually can\u2019t tell whether someone is gay just by looking at them. ",

It\u2019s an absolutely obsolete thought that gay equals to effeminate behaviour. Gay is about feeling and emotions and not about if you\u2019re straight acting or not. Let\u2019s not connect these two things and focus on what\u2019s important. So, coming back to your question, yet, a straight acting and straight looking person can be gay, and an effeminate guy can be straight. I hope I answer your question. ",
