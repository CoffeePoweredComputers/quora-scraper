            "answer_text": "For that period of time yes. What Schopenhauer didn't like was that Hegel wasn't idealist enough; Hegel's didn't believe in any of the transcendental things, he was an Aristotlean and thought that everything is immanent, even ideas themselves. Hence, it was easy for Marx to build his materialism atop of that. Idealism these days is pretty much dead due to largely advancements in science so Hegel's was kind of right. Schopenhauer is interesting in a way since he was definitely a pinnacle of idealism, but today, idealism is mostly obsolete. ",
