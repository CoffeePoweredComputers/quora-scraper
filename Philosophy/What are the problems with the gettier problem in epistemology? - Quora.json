            "answer_text": "In epistemology, knowledge is often defined as justified true belief (JTB). Gettier showed that there could be cases where someone held a JTB that was indeed justified, but that it was true because of justifications not know by the believer (in other words, they thought it was justified but their justification was wrong, even though the belief was true). Because it was a justified and true belief, it should qualify as knowledge, but clearly it\u2019s not because while the conclusion was correct the justification wasn\u2019t. In my mind the issue is really due to mixed logic. Deductive logic is effective at describing abstractions, wherein the results of a construct are definite. Inductive logic describes evidentiary-based constructs and can\u2019t come to absolute answers, only probabilistic ones. The formation of knowledge =JTB is trying to use deductive logic, but the analysis of knowledge (which is based on evidence/observation) is an inductive activity. The whole argument about justified true belief seems shaky at best. It tries to assert that a belief must meet some hazy definition of \u201cjustified truth\u201d to be defined as knowledge, otherwise it\u2019s\u2026just belief? But aren\u2019t all beliefs held to be justified and true by the person holding them? If not then the person wouldn\u2019t believe them. Falling into a semantic black hole\u2026aaaaahhhhhhh! The reality is that beliefs are not all or nothing. In fact, they\u2019re all probabilistic. While I think that many of my beliefs are 100% true, I know that they\u2019re really 99%+ and that if I was faced with contradictory evidence it would reduce that percentage. Because we are sensory animals with limited brains, in every case any discrete piece of knowledge is a subset of the available information, so the degree of certainty that a person can have about anything must be less than 100%. But the human brain evolved to make decisions in light of perpetual uncertainty, and feelings around belief/certainty/uncertainty play a key role in our ability to quickly make decisions to effectively navigate our environments.
