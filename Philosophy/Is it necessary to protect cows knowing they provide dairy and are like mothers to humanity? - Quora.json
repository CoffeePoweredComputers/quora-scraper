            "answer_text": "I've answered something like this before. And it hinged on culture and or religion. In some countries cows are protected. Not in the U.S.A. and not on much of the rest of the planet. So as I asked of the last time I've heard this. Cows should be protected because they provide dairy? Lots of animals provide us with things. Meat, wool, milk, work, leather. We offer protection to very few if any animals. But dairy is the Holy grail that earns protection? News flash. Humans don't need dairy to survive. In fact as I've said before, the entire human race might be healthier if we didn't have dairy. Now don't get me wrong. I like dairy. Almost every dairy product is good with me. And I would miss it, but I'm not gonna die without it. And cows are mother's to humanity? Last I checked weren't the scientists saying that monkeys were the start of humanity. Now your telling we came from cows? Save the nasty comments. I know, you weren't saying we came from cows. But like wise I don't and will never believe we receive life from cows any more than any of the other animals we exploit. ",

            "answer_text": "It is necessary to stop exploiting them. To stop eating them. To stop using their skins for clothing. To stop artificially inseminating them so they can give birth and lactate. To stop stealing their calves\u2019 milk for our own benefit. (Hell, it isn\u2019t even healthy!) To stop violently removing their children from them. Cows experience pain. They experience fear. They love their families. They love their children. And they want to be free. Humans should take a lesson from cows and other animals. Maybe we\u2019d be a bit more compassionate then. ",
