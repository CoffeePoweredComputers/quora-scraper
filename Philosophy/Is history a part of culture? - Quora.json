            "answer_text": "Is history culture? When two or more people live in the same area they have to adopt some rules about who does what to whom. Any such rule is called a mor\u00e9, French accented e pronounced \"mor-ay\". The adjective form is moral, and the habit of following mor\u00e9s is morality. Mor\u00e9s are arbitrary: they do not have to be right, only accepted. Another group on the other side of the river might have very different mor\u00e9s. A collection of mor\u00e9s defines a culture. If a culture lasts a while then we call that \u201chistory\u201d. ",
