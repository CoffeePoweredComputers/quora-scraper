            "answer_text": "Thank you for your question Harry, I think it is an important one. It requires, I think, a rather long answer. Prior to the conquests that are the source (materially) of \u201cwestern civilization\u201d (i.e., of its wealth), people all over the world lived in rich Civilizations that were, really, spiritually based. By this I mean that they recognized that \u201cwealth\u201d had a spiritual base. For example, agriculture evolved as people learned to \u201cplant by the stars\u201d: when to plant, when to harvest, etc. These peoples paid homage to \u201cthe Gods\u201d/\u201dThe Great Creator\u201d/\u201dThe Sun\u201d/\u201dYawheh[for whom no word can be spoken].\u201d These \u201cspiritually-based\u201d civilizations existed throughout the world: North and South America, China, Africa, Europe. Some covered large land masses (e.g., Incas, Aztecs, China), some tribal cultures (e.g., Celts, North American Indians), Some were maritime (e.g., Troy) trading with other maritime cultures. The Hebrews were, from time to time, nomadic. Some were hunters and gatherers (e.g., M\u2019buti, Amazonian tribes). Never forget we evolved from animals \u2014 very aware of our environment, very aware of our connection to that environment \u2013 that their \u201cknowledge\u201d of their place in the world was passed on to us in our genetic make-up. That deep knowledge of the great goodness of our environment is lost in fear-based societies (e.g., western civilization). BUT, the people actually living under the control of material greed, can and often do maintain a spiritual foundation (e.g., African-American slaves, and their children and grandchildren, Americans who hold on to their deep cultural roots in goodness and honorability.) The archeological remains of Mesopotamia (evidence of the power, the violence, the wealth of the conquering powers) was for a long time, our oldest evidence of the horror of un-leashed human greed. [Today, our awareness of the vast collection of gold hidden in the tombs of the Altaic Gold Mountains prove that violent conquest had been advancing prior to the overthrow of agrarian cultures in the Fertile Crescent.] With their increasing wealth (based, as it was, on the work of human beings living under the control of taxation, conscription, rape, fear etc.), the conquering power of western civilization advanced along the coast of the Mediterranean, eventually conquering Greece and then Rome. Documentation: read the Iliad and the Odyssey with the recognition that the Homeric poems were for multiple generations stories passed on from peoples who actually saw the historically terrible sack of Troy and the sickness underlying our reverence for that mad-man (cruel conqueror) Ulysses. So, the greatness of Athens, its democracy, its elegance, was founded on the Greek civilization that Socrates was raised to know/honor \u2014 that Classical civilization guided his very being. At the same time, Socrates was living in the Athens that was increasingly dominated by the materialism that has no concept of that honorabililty. Socrates was honored by most people in Athens but posed a threat to those, \u201cin power,\u201d who sentenced him to death. Plato and Aristotle of course knew that Socrates had been put to death for his \u201cteachings\u201d (in quotes because Socrates never saw himself as a teacher but rather as a seeker of wisdom). We can\u2019t know much of Platonic and/or Aristotelian teaching (i.e., philosophy) was influenced by fear of the \u201cpowers-that-be.\u201d Nonetheless, Aristotelian philosophy is known for being logic (intellect)-based, as is all subsequent western philosophy. Intellectual argument that has no basis in external truth is a word-game \u2014 interesting perhaps but without the power to move humanity towards our greatest self. You might be interested in my response to Lawson\u2019s question which was just downloaded a few moments ago. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition \u201cclassic\u201d means; something to be very typical of its kind \u2026! There where thinker's before Socrates, but they weren't called philosophers! The terminology \u201cphilosopher\u201d is related to Socrates, he is the father of philosophy. Is basically the love or the desire for knowledge. This is where all the philosophy of Socrates is based, in love for knowledge. Socrates believed that \u201cgood\u201d was related with knowledge and \u201cbad\u201d was related to ignorance, so he created this morality among thinkers and changed for all times, In such manner that everyone after him was considered philosopher ( Plato, Aristotle, and so on \u2026) Before Socrates they where called \u201cWise\u201d, \u201cSage\u201d or presocratics, just to give you an example of some of them; Thales of miletus, empdecloes, herakliti, and other's. So Socrates is the biggest milestone. Philosophy starts with him, he is the father, nevertheless there where thinker's before him. I am not a big fan of Socrates tell you the truth, I consider his philosophy to be quite not my taste. But that doesn't matter, the truth is that he camed like vulcano and he changed the world forever, he also gived his life for his ideas, he become a Martyr. ",

In the same way, Thales and Pythagoras are considered to be \u201cancient\" or \u201carchaic\u201d greek philosophers because they lived during the archaic period. Epictetus and Antiochus of Ascalon are Hellenistic Greek Philosophers. Although some who write during the Roman Period are also considered to be Hellenistic, for example Iamblichus and Plotinus. Some historians call the era between 30 BC and AD 330 the Roman Period of Greek History, but some call everything between 330 BC and AD 330 Hellenistic. ",
