            "answer_text": "Donald is not a vulgar pig. There is nothing vulgar in the words he uses. But he not fit to be the President of the US or any other country for that matter. This is a very serious job & business which affects democracy, freedom of the press & speech, constitution of the US, economy of the world and Billions of people. Today the world is interdependent on each other for jobs, growth, living & life of each person. He says he knows it all & everybody knows it. He is a show man, a fake, a cheat & a dummy to be a President. Sooner we get rid of him as president the better off everybody in the world. Move over DJT, our world does not need you. Go to Malenia & ask for a Lolly Pop & stay put in Trump Tower. ",

            "answer_text": "No - biologically speaking, he\u2019s a specimen of Homo sapiens sapiens, just like you and me. The domestic pig is Sus scrofa domesticus. Donald Trump\u2019s behaviour might sometimes aptly be described as \u2018vulgar\u2019, but the same could be said of most male specimens of Homo sapiens sapiens. It could certainly be said of me, and I guess you also behave in a vulgar fashion from time to time. Why anyone would knowingly insult the innocent domestic pig by comparing him/her to an ugly, arrogant, narcissistic, sexist, racist, ignorant, unscrupulous trickster, abuser and bully such as Donald Trump is beyond me. What has the poor pig done to anyone? ",
