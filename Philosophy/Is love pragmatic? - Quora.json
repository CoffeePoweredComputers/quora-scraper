            "answer_text": "Very much so. For all the poetry and mystique surrounding love, let\u2019s step back and evaluate it from a more rational mindset. Love is an emotion, some combination of attraction and attachment and affection. If you accept that love is a emotion, the next question is, what purpose, if any, does it serve? From an evolutionary perspective, love plays a very significant role in ensuring one\u2019s survival and reproduction. A mother\u2019s love for her newborn baby? It may be magical and indescribable, sure, but it\u2019s essentially a flood of hormones that facilitate bonding between parents and offspring. This intense emotional attachment usually translates into physical investment of time and resources, significantly increasing the offspring\u2019s ability to survive into adulthood. Romantic love? Same thing. Sexual attraction is enough to produce offspring, but pair-bonding ensures the father\u2019s continued involvement in child-rearing. Once again, love equals more resources for offspring, which equals an increased probability of reproduction, which equals the continuity of the genetic lineage.

Love is generally defined as \u201ca strong feeling of affection (and perhaps also sexual attraction) for someone\u201d. love - definition of love in English | Oxford Dictionaries Pragmatism is generally defined as the ability to solve problems in a sensible way that suits the conditions that really exist now, rather than obeying fixed theories, ideas, or rules. pragmatic Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary Taking into account that love generally blinds us to the realities and practical aspects presented by a romantic situation, and that such feelings usually lead us to overrule the practical aspects of a situation in favour of a more idealistic point of view, I would assert that love is the antithesis of pragmatic. Notwithstanding that, beware the pragmatist who falls in love, for he (or she) will pragmatise (?) and analyse the crap out of whichever impossible love situation he finds himself in, break it down into smaller, easier to deal with units and methodically and unstoppably overcome any obstacles in his way, defeating all foes attempting to prevent him to reach the object of his love no matter what it takes.
