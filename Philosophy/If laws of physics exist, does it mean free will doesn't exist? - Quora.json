            "answer_text": "That is a very good question and one that physicists, philosophers, and theologians have discussed since Newton (and probably before). In Newtonian mechanics each event causes the next one and so forth. With the discovery of atoms however we realized the large objects are actually made up of small parts that do NOT follow these laws. When you average together the behavior of enough atoms you get the expected result plus or minus a small amount of uncertainty. Einstein greatly improved our understanding of this with is work on the Photoelectric Effect for which he won a Nobel Prize. (Most people think he won a Nobel Prize for Relativity, but that\u2019s incorrect.) Einstein\u2019s work showed that individually atoms act like dice, BUT Einstein vehemently opposed the idea that \u201cGod plays with dice.\u201d I personally believe that humans have souls, but even without that we must consider the complex chemistry of the brain and how decisions are made. The brain uses many complex chemical reactions and combines them together, BUT it does NOT average them. If you have a large piece of aluminum and hit it with something, you can predict with nearly infinite certainty what the block as whole will do. You can predict what each atom at the point of collision is most likely to do, but not what it will actually do. Human decisions are made from chemicals in the brain that act like those atoms at the collision point on the aluminum, not like the whole block. Your statement about atoms indicates a common misconception. The movement of atoms is actually only probabilistic \u2014 they will probably go in a particular direction but they are NOT Newtonian objects. We can not say that they \u201cchoose\u201d which way to go \u2014 but they are not deterministic the way we often think they are. Many students incorrectly believe that this uncertainty in the motion of atoms is the result of an inability to measure the atoms rather than a property of the atoms themselves, but this is incorrect. It is true that measuring devices have limits, but the atoms themselves have limits. We can say that they themselves \u201cdo not know\u201d their own speed and position \u201cexactly\u201d and this is an actual, physical property of atoms. This is as much a \u201cLAW\u201d as f=ma and the Newtonian \u201claws\u201d that supposedly make the future \u201cpredetermined.\u201d So yes, in short, we do have \u201cfree will.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "An interesting problem which dates back to the idea of the \u201cclockwork universe\u201d which followed Newton\u2019s theories. The thinking goes that if the universe is truly deterministic and started from a particular point then surely all it\u2019s future actions, including those of any people, were pre-determined. At best, we\u2019d just have an illusion of free will, but in reality our decisions are pre-determined. At the time of Newton this didn\u2019t cause to much of a controversy as, to the religious minded (or at least those from Abrahamic faiths), the essence of the person was not determined by mere physical phenomenon. Freewill was god-given and part of their spirit and hence not part of the corporeal world. It was therefore not governed by physical laws. However, as the influence of religion faded then this issue came back to haunt, especially those who didn\u2019t believe in a deity. With the emergence of Quantum Mechanics, physicists realised that in a very fundamental way the universe is not deterministic. It is, really, based on probability and uncertainty woven into the whole structure. In addition, chaos theory tells us that the outcome of even the simplest non-linear systems can produce wildly unpredictable outcomes unless we know the starting conditions of a system absolutely perfectly (which QM tells us we can\u2019t). QM would therefore appear to get us out of this \u201cclockwork universe\u201d catch and open a gap for free will to emerge. However, even this doesn\u2019t appear quite true. It just allows for a probabilistic outcome of a decision, not the controlled one that true free will would appear to require. There is, perhaps, a bit of evidence that much of our free-will is a really an illusion. Experiments have demonstrated that we often appear to make decisions. Neuroscientists can now observe behaviour in the brain at the time of decision making and it has become clear that some are made before we become consciously aware of a phenomenon. It is, in effect, our sub-conscious activities making the decision for us. We see this in sports of course - no tennis player could hit a ball correctly if he/she had to think consciously about exactly where the ball was going to be. However, there\u2019s also evidence that our subconscious also makes value judgements. There is plenty of experimental evidence our reaction to, say, race, is often not conscious. Indeed what the conscious mind often appears to do is censor our unconscious reactions. On another point, Roger Penrose in his book The Emperor\u2019s New Mind claims that the behaviour of the brain (and hence consciousness) cannot be modelled mathematically, including as that of a quantum mechanical system as we currently know it. He claims to have proved that there is no way that consciousness can emerge from such a system. He has further elaborated this by claiming that there is an enormous gap between the quantum (non-deterministic) word and that of the classical (deterministic) world. His position is that there is a massive gap in our physical explanation of the world when something transitions from this quantum state to the classical one (the same sort of space occupied by Schrodinger\u2019s cat) and that it is in this new, unexplained, non-computational part of physics wherein will lie the solution to the enigma of consciousness and, by implication, free will. Naturally Penrose\u2019s position is highly controversial, especially in the area of Artificial Intelligence and the physics is speculative indeed (although he\u2019s \u201conly\u201d claiming a gap).

            "answer_text": "The answer is no. I argue that the laws of science preclude a deterministic or wholly deterministic universe. One of the reasons for this is that emergent properties break the cause effect chains. For example, a car designer can design a car to perform on asphalt roads and can predict the measurable specifications desired: top speed, gas mileage, etc. But an emergent property of roads and cars is \u2026 traffic. The parameters used to establish the abilities of cars do not predict the existence of traffic. There are many phenomena that aren\u2019t seemingly deterministic, is another reason: radioactive decay rates are probabilistic and quantum phenomena are far from deterministic. I also use the example of a large poker tournament, say the word Series of Poker. Is anyone going to argue that the hands being played are all determined by physical causes. I saw one of the world\u2019s best players throw away a winning hand and later he stated that he didn\u2019t see the flush he had. What determined that result? Decision after decision is made in such a tournament, often on whims, guesses, personal theories, mistakes, and probabilities wrongly calculated. Coming up with a deterministic explanation for all of the choices made in such a set of circumstances seems impossible. The issue I have with most arguments is that free will advocates insist upon it being conscious free will. If we make a decision subconsciously, it is claimed that this is some sort of robotic, deterministic, controlled decision. Now that we know that our subconscious minds use the exact same brain structures as our conscious minds use, I don\u2019t see how this is defensible. ",

Objectively, in a fashion in which puts a sole human alone on a moon kind of objectivism, perhaps Camus\u2019 crowd are right, there is no inherent purpose in life, no objective direction towards which we are headed, but this approach is idiotic like trying to discern and break head figuring out the meaning of a lemon on a kitchen counter. Perhaps Camus\u2019 grandmother should have tapped his head and fed him chilled glass of lemon juice. Our meaning in life, our purpose comes from the subjectivity we share with life. Our perceptions, our upbringing, all individually combine to form our world view, our likes and dislikes, which dictates then the set of choices we are biased towards. Free will is an idiotic conception, because it devoids the very aspect of life that contextualizes our freedom, and then asks we are free or not when it comes to making choices. \u201cWe're all made of atoms, we all have to obey the same rule too, we can't move freely, or otherwise, we break the law.\u201d You\u2019re making an error.

In fact, you have to, otherwise all discussion in psychology and sociology, and all human verbal interaction, grinds to a halt. But, at the level of classical physics, and chemistry and biology, there is just determinism.

Those events will - must - influence our reactions and may present few choices. All choices are determined by the event, the character of the person, the degree of self-interest in his character, and his emotional state of mind. This makes it virtually impossible for any person to know for certain what he/she might do in any given circumstances. Instant reaction is automatic, allowing time only for built-in controls to act, almost without conscious thought. That action is pre-determined. When time is available, even if only a few seconds, conscious thought allows choices. Again, actions will reflect an individual's make-up. As these reactions are variable they can be determined by the individual. Even though they amount to little real choice - mayhap no choice! - the reaction is one of freewill. ",

What do you mean by free will? It is usually an ill-posed question. If you mean, given a choice, can you make it, the answer is clearly yes, and this has nothing to do with determinism. If determinism is at play, how can you possibly test your hypothesis? We can\u2019t go back in time and collect evidence that your choice would be different given exactly the same conditions. And, if we did do that and you did choose different at least once, why? If the conditions were exactly the same and you chose differently, isn\u2019t your method of choice randomness? How is randomness free will? Randomness is a lack of choosing, like rolling the dice and letting \u201cfate\u201d decide. So, you either make decisions based on circumstances, knowledge, and logic or you are governed by randomness.

For this last group the proper contrast is not with causal determinism but with constraint. If I am tied to the chair I am not free to move around but if I am not I am free. If I am under a psychological compulsion to steal then I am not free. ",

Would it really be better is what you want is partially determined by chance? Does that really make you any more free? I think most people who wants free will to exist, is not just that it should not be predetermined, but they do not want it to be governed by any rules at all, deterministic or not. They want to desire themselves what they want. This is of course circular and impossible. So, free will cannot exist, ever. ",
