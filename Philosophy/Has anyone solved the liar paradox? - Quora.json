            "answer_text": "The Liar Paradox is not a riddle that is in search of a solution. Early in the history of philosophical thought, the Greeks began to investigate the natures of language and of truth. They came to the conclusion that only propositions of the form \"A is B\" could be ascribed truth or falsehood, in contrast with commands, and other parts of speech. In logic this rule is called the Law of Excluded Middle, (LEM) I.e., propositions must be either true or false, there is no middle ground, there is no third choice, in Latin, tertium non datur. Then a Cretan came from the island of Crete, and said, \"All Cretans are liars\" !!! The Liar Paradox was born! Yes, it is a self-referential sentence, but that does not make it an invalid proposition. After all, there are many self-referential statements that are not controversial at all, such as \"Everything I state is true.\"!! Is the Liar Paradox True or False? Either choice leads to a contradiction. This was unacceptable. It did not fit in with the LEM. It was a terrible shock. Philosophers have been trying to deal with this and many other Paradoxes for millennia. They have jumped through all kinds of hoops, invented all kinds of imaginary languages and tried their best to ignore the problem, but there is a valid solution to the problem. The solution is to discard the LEM. That means that there are not just two truth values, but at least three truth values, True, False and Neither true nor false (nTnF). Tertium Datur! This realization has now resulted in a whole new world of logical laws. Laws that have led to technology that deals with the gray areas in our environment. The LEM is not how the world works, and it is the Logical Paradoxes that have so effectively demonstrated that. ",

            "answer_text": "I never saw this as a paradox ever since I first heard it decades ago. So you could say I had solved it decades ago, because the two premises of the paradox are not self consistent. The \u201cparadox\u201d: Assume there\u2019s a land of only knights and knaves where knights only told the truth and knaves only told lies.Assume you run into one of them who said, \u201cI am lying\u201dThis is what seems to create the paradox because if he\u2019s a knight then they can\u2019t be lying and if he\u2019s a knave then saying that phrase would be telling the truth which they can\u2019t do. The solution lies in contradictory premises that must be invalid when taken together. Another words you can assume premise 1 or you can assume premise 2 but it\u2019s invalid to assume both premises could be true when taken together. Otherwise the person who is presenting the riddle is the one that must be lying. If you need it more simply put: If premise 1 is true then nobody would ever say \u201cI am lying\u201d so premise 2 must not be valid.If premise 2 is true then the person who said \u201cI am lying\u201d cannot be either a knight or a knave and he could say what ever he wanted so premise 1 must not be valid.I told my grade school teacher this solution but at the time, he just brushed it off as my being a smart alec.

            "answer_text": "Yes. The solution is simple. The paradox occurs because of a false premise. This is the \u2018I am\u2019 statement. The speaker of the liar paradox identifies himself as the standard of reference for the truth of the statement. In Epimenides version \u2018I am a Cretan\u2019 may well be a lie and we cannot know either way because there is no comparator available. This makes the statement simply undecidable. The same goes for \u2018this sentence is false\u2019. \u2018This sentence\u2019 is all we have to work with, so no verification is possible except by using a closed logical loop. Epimenides paradox reveals a problem with self-referentiality. I played a little game along these lines using \u2018Truth\u2019 as an object in my answer to Is truth false? \u2018I am the object that defines objectivity\u2019. This doesn\u2019t really work, does it? Hence, the liar paradox is solved by the imposition of context. No sentence has jurisdiction over itself such that it may sentence itself. The only entity capable of such logical completeness in language is G.O.D.  See G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, according to my general solution to paradoxes the problem is uncertain truth may be certainly false and the solution is that certain falsehoods can be ambiguously true. It is possible to define ambiguity or create superposition. This is of the variety of \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wrong\u2019 similar to the fallacy of inference. If you knew you were wrong, how could you know you are wrong? Similarly, if you were really lying, how could you verify that you are lying? You might know you are lying, you might verify you are lying, but you might still be lying. The answer is you have to refer to something different than verification if you want to verify. If verifying is a lie, it is not verification, instead it is dishonesty or irony. The idea that you are lying about lying is impossible if you are lying, so the liar paradox is ambiguous or ironic. But neither irony nor ambiguity have to be a paradox. Another more general answer is that it\u2019s a paradox so we should decide whether it is a problem or a solution, and if we are solving for false or true. If we solve for true, it is a negativity paradox, if we solve for false, it is a verification paradox: but in either case it is not further reducible. If it is both positive and negative it is not a paradox, it is irony (standard rule). The biggest trouble is that the statement of the problem is more complex than in most paradoxes, and it may take more than one iteration to understand the solution even using the solution formula correctly.

We can\u2019t work out whether the liar statement is true or false, so there is a question about its meaningfulness. Statements whose meaning cannot be determined can\u2019t really be a move in any real language game - we are insulated from them by their absurdity. (2) Any language which can ask questions about the truth or meaning of its own statements must have a grammar that allows liar paradoxes (and their relations) to be constructed. Very general questions about the nature of truth and the scope of truth-claims must be possible if we are to do philosophy, and so we can construct the liar \u2026 So, in a peculiar way, they are necessary and harmless.

            "answer_text": "A paradox cannot exist in reality, but only in a logical context. A paradox is when 2 seemingly contradicting events happen in a process. A paradox thus shows that our understanding of the process is incorrect or that the process cannot be realized. It points to a misunderstanding of how the process works or an error in the assumed premises. The liar paradox is a logical construct and cannot happen in reality. As an example I take the following form of the liar paradox: all persons in a town always lie or always say the trutha person from this town says \u201cI always lie\u201dClearly all persons that always say the truth would not say this and all persons that always lie would not say this. Because clearly it is possible to say the sentence \u201cI always lie\u201d, there is no problem with statement 2, so the problem is with statement 1. The problem here is that we assume that a statement is always true or false, it can however also be meaningless. If you have a person that says \u201cI always lie\u201d, you know there is at least 1 person in town that can say meaningless things. This person can \u201cnot lie\u201d and \u201cnot speak the truth\u201d at the same time. The problem is that our language is not compatible with 2-valued logic (true/false), it is only compatible with 3-valued logic: Three-valued logic - Wikipedia ",

The key of the answer is in these observations: The liar paradox pops up where a statement claims to have truth-content when it hasn\u2019t.To have truth-content, a statement needs to be saying something about the \u201creal world out there\u201d.The paradoxical statements are devoid of truth-content. They may look like \u201creal\u201d statements but they\u2019re not about some verifiable real-world fact.",

The most that any paradox can show us is that language doesn\u2019t always work perfectly in specific situations. But that only comes as a surprise to people who expect it to. Language is a tool, not a model. It works most of the time for most important things. If it doesn\u2019t work in some important situation, then we tinker around with it until it does. Paradoxes simply indicate that the situation being described is so unimportant that nobody\u2019s bothered to fix the language we use in talking about it. ",
