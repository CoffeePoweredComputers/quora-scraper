            "answer_text": "Universal moral principles would be something like: a set of values that apply to (and ought to be applied to and by) every individual, group, and society alike, where those values always have the same hierarchical standing relative to all other values. It\u2019s a mouthful, yes, but fairly accurate. You don\u2019t just want people to have the value, it must have the same place in their constellation of values. Also, you have to account for the fact that people fail to live up to their own values - thus \u201cought\u201d rather than a mere \u201cdo.\u201d Generally, people like to place claims like \u201chuman rights\u201d in this category - including staples, like no murder, no rape, etc. Normally, people use the phrase intending to mean a moral value that cannot be rationally denied, but that\u2019s a bad bet. For one thing, history teaches us that every set of values has been denied - to some extent - by some civilization. For another, once you start asking why something ought to be a moral value, you quickly come to the realization that all such claims rest on some starting set of assumptions. Sometimes, it appears as simple as the Golden Rule, but in reality, it\u2019s always a core part of our interpretation of the world itself. For example, if you make the assumption that the Universe (by whatever means) is a place where justice is ultimately done (dead or alive), then the Golden Rule makes sense. But if you make the assumption that the Universe is not a place where justice is ultimately done, and that the whole shebang is might makes right, then the whole Golden Rule bit starts to look like a bad idea. In this sense, there is no universal moral principles - because there is no single, universally agreed-upon way to interpret the world (see: continued draw of astrology). In a different sense, we can talk about moral standards that are universally valuable for individual and social flourishing. In such a case, we are engaging in historical, sociological, psychological, and philosophical work, trying to figure out what kinds of principles either promote - or at least don\u2019t stymie - the flourishing. Case in point, equality of opportunity has been at the core of the continued success of every major empire on the planet. No surprise there: by allowing the widest possible scope of potential experts to compete, develop and hone their skills, and become the best, the empire gains from that expertise in a way that other approaches simply lack. For great reference, see the Mongol recruiting and promotion/demotion practices. That said, the idea of universally valuable moral standards does have a sense of Teleology tied to it, and that can be an issue for some people. That said, the notion of Telos is perfectly functional from a Darwinian perspective - so long as you don\u2019t have an inherent anti-religious bias (not that the idea of telos needs to be religious, but it often causes a knee-jerk reaction from some secular circles). From the Darwinian perspective, the entirety of the living spectrum has the general telos aimed at survival, replication, etc. Thus, behaviors (and attitudes that drive them) that are counterproductive to that basic mission are either \u201cwrong,\u201d or they will wipe out your species. However, you should also note that there are no human rights that you can establish on that basis - only general guidelines. ",

            "answer_text": "There are no universal moral principles. Morality is inherently subjective which means that it varies from individual to individual and from viewpoint to viewpoint. Objectivity itself is an ideal, not an achievable reference point. What people mistake for objectivity is commonality. Commonality in rules and morality is usually called Ethics or ethical agreement and will have a specific context in which it is applicable. As soon as you leave the context, the ethical rules will no longer apply. People like to make the assumption that we all live in the same overarching context and that the rules we live by can be made \u201cuniversal\u201d. Our reality is that everything is subject to change as context changes. Human beings dislike change as a matter of biology and thus strive for universality so that we only have to learn things a single way. Morality is no different. The problem is that when two cultures with two different moralities and ethical rules interact, they both assume that they have \u201cthe\u201d single morality. This will never be true as long as we have a multi-cultural and multi-governmental world. As such, the human race lives in a state of constant reconciliation of both individual and group values and rules. ",
