            "answer_text": "That happens to just about everybody all the time. There is a case study about a man who was deathly afraid of water. It came back to a time when he was a child and he was mad at his father for some discipline at the beach. He wanted his father to die he was so mad, which is common for little kids. His father went swimming and he wanted him to drown. His father did not, but this boy had the stress of that, and it came out later as a phobia. He recognized that, and was fine. I don\u2019t remember if he called his father and apologized and said he loved him or not, but would not be surprised. Recognizing those thoughts are common is a step to limiting their hold on you.

            "answer_text": "The Bible tells us that we have two natures within all of us, one is the desire to do good and the other to do evil. There is a reason for this, in that to serve God we choose to do rightly, and to do wrong we choose what the Bible calls worldliness or sin. Good choices bring about good results and of course bad choices their \u201cfruit\u201d. The resistance to do good comes from the fallen nature in the form of desires or emotions, that are of the contrary part. This is not \u201creligion\u201d, but established choices that can bring us a contented life or one filled with regret, weather Christian or not. ",
