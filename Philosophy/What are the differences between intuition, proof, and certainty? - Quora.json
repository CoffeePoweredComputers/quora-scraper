            "answer_text": "This is a bit of a mundane question, but I\u2019ll attempt to provide as interesting an answer as possible. I am addressing this in the context of evaluating physical claims (as opposed to, say, conceptual claims like those found in math). Also, I\u2019m ignoring the trivial cases where you are certain of something because it is factually known (as in, first hand experience). Intuition is an active process, a byproduct of allowing our brain to subconsciously process information rather than attempt a conscious evaluation. We employ this technique far more than most people realize, and it tends to generate false positives because we generally rely on it more to sense things like hidden dangers. Proof is the collection of evidence regarding the claim under evaluation. Proof almost always favors false negatives, since reserving judgement (i.e. a healthy skepticism) is more sensible than accepting false beliefs. Certainty is the measurement that gauges the degree to which the available evidence satisfies the burden of proof. Functional certainty is a matter of rationally concluding that the claim has fully satisfied the burden of proof. ",

            "answer_text": "Intuition, sometimes called a \u201cgut feeling,\u201d is a sense that something is true or false, right or wrong, safe or dangerous, etc., based on a subconscious balance of experiences and desires. Proof is logical deduction, ideally based on factual data or extensive objective observation, that \u201csomething is true or false,\u201d etc. \u201cProof\u201d always relies on certain unprovable assumptions \u2014 such as the \u201cultimate\u201d reliability of data, knowledge of all relevant factors, etc. Certainty is based on the consistency, over time, of things observed or proven. For example, long before we \u201cproved\u201d gravity, we were certain that apples that broke from the tree would fall to the earth. ",
