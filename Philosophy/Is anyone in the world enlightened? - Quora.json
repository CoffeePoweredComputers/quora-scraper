            "answer_text": "No \"person\" in the world is enlightened. People don't get enlightened. The self-concept dissolves, this unveils Truth. But what awakens to the remembrance of Truth isn't the \"person,\" but rather Truth itself. Truth recognizes itself. A Course in Miracles says Enlightenment is not a change, but a recognition.  The self-concept, or separate self identity is the seeming problem all along. In REALITY, there are no people. Everything is a concretized thought, including the sense of \"me.\" People are thoughts and thoughts do not become enlightened. A path into Self inquiry will lead us to the discovery that what we are has no definition. That is why, in Truth, we're eternal. Nonetheless, there IS a paradox. There seems to be \"people\" who have an inside look at Truth. Eckhart Tolle, Ramana Maharshi and many others...however, it is the absence of their self concept for which their body serves as a clear communication vessel for Truth. So in one way, we can say they are enlightened, as we do with Buddha and Jesus...but in Reality, everything and everyone is acting out on behalf of Truth, puppets of a shared mind that is destined to awaken, as part of the script...or sometimes called \"God's Will.\" There will always be people who say this person or that person is enlightened. And that's fine, but what goes without recognition is that THAT judgement only serves to define THEM as unenlightened people. Judgements never define something that is \"outside\" us, but rather serves to define US as a person. The mechanism for which holds the self-concept in place, is VERY tricky. Be weary of anyone who says that they are enlightened. Truth is whole, without perception of fragmented parts or differences. Who or what would claim enlightenment but a self-concept? If there's a perception that \"I'm separate from you\" and \"I have something that you don't,\" then it's ego at play, perhaps a spiritual self-concept, but nonetheless a separate self identity. Buddha and Jesus didn't go around saying \"I'm enlightened\"...they appeared where there was an invitation and spoke Truth through parables and pointed everyone back to their true nature. Humbleness is a quality of love (truth). Lastly, there are many people who have spiritual experiences. And experiences can be GREAT. Be it blissful states, deep reverence, out of body experiences etc. but none of it, however, is enlightenment. Experiences come and go, Truth does not waver.  I think Buddha describes enlightenment best, it is the end of suffering...nothing more and nothing less. ",

            "answer_text": " In this era many masters claim that they are enlightned. They claim that they have enlightened hundreds of their followers. Yet, they don\u2019t dare to defined what Enlightenment is. We live in Kali Yuga the era of ignorance.  Can an ignorant man become the master of space? No. Then why is this era called the era of ignorance.  Whenver, we do something we must check the compatibility of the activity with all other activities of life. However, in this era we check the compatibility with just a few other activities and even that is just a pretence.  Ideally every new idea should be seen in the light of all other ideas / activities of our life. If the idea appears to be compatible with all other ideas of our life, then only the idea should be allowed to become an action.  The Hindu sages of the Rig Vedic period studied how all ideas of our life can be converted into actions in such a way that they are eternally correct and we need not have to repent later. They realized that the idea must be processed in many stages.  In the Puranic period it was realized that realized that there is a seven stage muscle tone based thinking that automatically detects and solves all problems of life.  They added two more dimensions to the seven stage thinking mechanism.  Any one who has the knowledge of the seven stage mechanism in the default semi automatic, automatic and manual modes was supposed to be enlightened. Thus, becoming enlighened is a next to impossible task, with practically 0% success rate. Everyone just understood a part of it.  In the Puranic period, when worship of the manifestations of Brahman became popular Enlightenment became a thing of the past. However, it remained the dream of everyone.  Enlightenment has become the dream of people of this era whose life is devastated completely. In this era there are a large number of such people. No doubt enabling people to become enlightened has become a very lucrative business.  Like buyers of mobile phones, people who want to become enlighened are considered as consumers. Consumer satisfaction is of utmost importance in any business and Enlightenment is no exception to it.  Techniques of becoming Enlightened are made disgustingly farcical.  Becoming enlighetened is supposed to be like accidentally switching on light in a dark room. It is supposed that no knowledge or effort is need for this. Paradoxically, this brand of Enlightenment makes them ignorant. However, here ignorance is considered as a bliss. Even after becoming enlightened they continue to use Reasoning and keep solving their problems manually. No doubt, there are a large number of so called enlightened people, each of whom have helped a large number of followers to become enlightened. According to them Enlightenment is something based on their whims and fancies and not on universal and eternal laws of human behavior.  Yes, there are a large number of people who claim that they are enlightened. However, none of them have the faintest idea of what Enlighenment is. ",
