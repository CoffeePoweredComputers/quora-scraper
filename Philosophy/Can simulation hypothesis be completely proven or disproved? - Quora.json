            "answer_text": "It cannot be disproven, but it could be proven to a certain extent which might be considered beyond a reasonable doubt from a legal point of view. The universe is what it is, so there really isn\u2019t any test that can be done from inside the universe to prove that there is something outside creating the universe. Once 100 percent of the universe is understood, and people realize that everything is carefully designed using technology down near the Planck scale which has been evolving since the first instant of the big bang, then at that point there is not much room left for doubt. Call it whatever you want, no words could describe it, the fundamental question is not much different than that posed by most religions. Is there an intelligent creator above this reality or not? I say yes, and I do believe that in the end there will be proof that will be accepted by even the most sceptical athiests. ",

            "answer_text": "There has been one serious attempt at proving this. Scientists used a laser interferometer to try to measure a length to the smallest degree. The theory was that if we lived in a simulation then our reality would be made of pixels wgixh would be the smallest unit of length/ volume. The experiment was a flop. Most people who seriously believe in simulation theory, as I do, believe that it would be self correcting so even if we did find proof the simulation would tho back and rewrite itself removing the proof in the process.

            "answer_text": "There is nothing to proof either way, as the idea of reality as a simulation is not something one can compare to the case of unsimulated reality, in both cases reality is at is is or appears to be. There is no observation that can distinguish these two cases. But for that reason, there is nothing that could form an argument why reality would have to be a simulation, but there is much against it, as it makes unneccesary and unprovable assumptions. ",

It\u2019s a meaningless verbal construct. Simulation hypotheses which contain testable content are easily refutable; so people who find it pleasing to engage in metaphysical fantasies always make sure there is no content in theirs. Are we \u2018living in a simulation\u2019? Who cares? ",
