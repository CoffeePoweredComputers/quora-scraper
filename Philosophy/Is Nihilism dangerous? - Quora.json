            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it is exactly, though like many things, people can react to nihilism positively or negatively for reasons that are counter to nihilism itself. There are of course people who are tied to materialism, substance, explanations. To them, it is wrong to be nihilist. We can say they\u2019re right or they\u2019re wrong - we can assume that they\u2019re well-intentioned, bad-intentioned, or apathetic about others. We can also take their mirrors, those who say they are nihilist in reaction to the above people or to what they see as \u201csociety\u201d or conventional wisdom or religion. To them, it is wrong not to be nihilist. I have found that pursuit of some things is not a pursuit at all. When we have our positions based on others\u2019 positions, including books, music - positive or negative - we only exist strongly in relation to those things. It\u2019s the letting go of those things - letting go of all those rules - that works here. Not against a rule, against a past, but no longer being wedded to it. We love labels - but true nihilism is an absence of labels. We love certainty, but true nihilism is more about \u201cI have no idea what happens when I die\u201d, not, \u201cI know that nothing happens when we die\u201d. We cannot assume we create truth by what we say or think anymore than we think that truth exists by someone else doing the same. These are opinion-claims, all of them. and whatever your personal reasons are for them, your personal reasons are tangible, not free, not nihilistic. That is not to say that any of us are subject to any purity tests. It\u2019s worth looking on Wikipedia or similar and noting that there\u2019s dozens of \u201ckinds\u201d of nihilism. Again, we love labels. But when we do, we\u2019ve become slaves to those labels. It\u2019s almost a cliche to say that if you call yourself a nihilist you aren\u2019t one - it is at least something to ponder. And then, if you get mad at that thought, it indicates that you have more work (or absence of work) needed in your life, because now you have shown that you are tied to still another thing. I myself have no problem associating all kinds of things with nihilism. There are no qualities to it, and so, half-in or as illumination the thought or desire or direction I feel is quite helpful. But we are such slaves to lists of qualifications, about what things \u201cmean\u201d\u2026 maybe that\u2019s human, or evolutionary remnants, or cultural upbringing, it would seem to me that those are the opposite of it. People do a lot of things for a lot of reasons. The degree to which our spectrum goes from comments aside to complete dedication are all parts of being tied to reasons. How much those are about other people and your \u201coffense\u201d at them says where and why you object to nihilism, or object to those who are not nihilistic. It can be all the same, and I would say as regards nihilism, is all the opposite. ",

            "answer_text": "Bad is subjective, but as nihilists often hold positions that human values are baseless, that life is meaningless, that knowledge is impossible. Given these attitudes, I don't think that they tend to be a lot of fun at parties. Values are based on our evolutionary predilections and what seems to work best to keep civilization functional. Values DO have a basis, but it's our choice to choose to find this basis worthy. Now, I think that nihilists are partially correct in saying that life has no meaning outside of ourselves. The point here is that our minds are separate entities from the universe and that we can never be 'outside of ourselves.' Our minds can never escape its existence in its meat, electrical, and chemically induced prison. In other words, while it's true that the universe doesn't give a shit about us, we have no reason to give a shit about the universe, either. You are the one who's living your life. You are the only one that can choose to provide it with meaning. So do what makes it meaningful for you. The universe has no say in the matter. And knowledge is certainly not impossible. Indeed, we can't be certain that our understanding is correct beyond all possible doubt, but that includes unreasonable doubt, and the thing about unreasonable doubt is that it's, well, unreasonable. Absolute certainty of knowledge might not be possible, but that doesn't mean that we're wrong. Although we could be living in some matrix-induced coma and the earth doesn't really go around the sun in the 'real' world, we have no evidence that we are in that coma. And it seems unlikely to me and non-evidential that we live in a matrix or that we exist in a coma. So we're almost certainly right about what we DO think we know beyond a reasonable doubt. The only thing we lack is the ability to get rid of that world 'almost.' Almost is good enough for me. Besides, I'm old enough to know that I've been wrong about almost everything at one time or another. We just have to learn from our mistakes and take on the attitude that being wrong about something is exciting because we get one step closer to knowing what is really true. So, I don't think nihilism is 'bad' per se. I just see it as needlessly pessimistic and self-defeating. If nihilism makes you happy, go for it. But I also think that if nihilism makes you happy, you're probably doing it wrong. ",
