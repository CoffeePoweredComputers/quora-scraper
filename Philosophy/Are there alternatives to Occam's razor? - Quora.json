            "answer_text": "There are no good alternatives to using Occam\u2019s Razor as a FIRST STEP in evaluating an idea. The alternative is falling into the trap of any of several cognitive biases. Occam\u2019s Razor is best understood as the scientific equivalent of the \u201cYou must be this tall\u201d sign at the amusement park. It is a sieve to winnow the wheat from the chaff of ideas. While the original phrasing of Occam\u2019s Razor can be confusing, the most accurate modern phrasing is: \u201dThe simplest answer, which takes into account all available evidence, tends to be the correct one.\u201d This means that you must look at ALL the facts and evidence, no cherry-picking of data to fit your favorite theory. Also many people emphasize \u201csimplest answer\u201d but ignore the vital point of \u201call available evidence\u201d. Simple is worthless without being accurate and comprehensive. An excellent example is Continental Drift. For centuries, various theories were proposed to explain mountain formation, volcanism, sea floor spreading along mid ocean rifts, deep ocean trenches, and the apparent way that the outlines of distant continents seemed to fit like a jigsaw puzzle. The idea that huge chunks of land and ocean floor were floating on a vast sea of molten magma seemed laughable to most people and scientists at first. However, over time, the overwhelming evidence that the slow, inexorable movement and collision of these continental plates provided a simple, yet comprehensive, explanation to geophysical reality. Other theories that couldn\u2019t explain all the data fell by the wayside and were abandoned. That is how Occam\u2019s Razor is applied. ",
