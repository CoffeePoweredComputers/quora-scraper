            "answer_text": "It was in 2010 when we had bought a new car and had a small party at home to celebrate, we had guests at home. My dad's friend, his wife and his 2 sons were home for dinner for the first time. The food was ready, we were sitting on the dining table and the food was being served. I am a girl who laughs weirdly loudly and people laugh at the way I laugh most of the times. While the food was being served, someone said something really funny and I burst out laughing as usual. I was laughing so hard that I leaned on the back of the chair totally unknowingly and the dining table chair leaned backwards and fell flat on the ground. I was lying on the ground with my back on the back of the chair that lied on the ground and my legs up on the sitting part of the chair, still laughing hard over the joke and the position I fell in. It was pretty embarrassing for me since my brother had to help me get up from that position as I couldn't move on my own. That was probably the worst first impression I had infront of the guests we had for the first time, which I can never forget. I still run away from facing those people whenever I have to. ",
