            "answer_text": "It's good and bad; just like it's both normal and not normal. The reason why it's good is because you are exceedingly grateful! To not expect or desire anything in particular; means that you appreciate what you already have and you are thankful of small things. If everybody were like that, there would be no such thing as thievery and greed. But it's bad because depression, harsh insults, and continuous failure leads to lack of hope; which can trigger a person to not want anything out of life! It is never productive to wallow in sadness and self pity. Get up and try to accomplish something in life and enjoy the finer things that life has to offer! ",

There are over 7 billion shades of normal inhabiting this planet, who can possibly say if you have got it right or wrong. The only criteria you should be guided by is\u2026 Is it right for YOU? Not what society thinks is right, not what your friends is right and certainly not what I or anyone else answering this question thinks is right, as it is all just opinion. ",
