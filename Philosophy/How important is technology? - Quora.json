            "answer_text": "Technology serves a variety of purposes and means different things to different people. In today\u2019s world technology can be found at every corner. From the local convenience store to your local deli shop, technology makes the world function more efficiently. While some are reluctant to embrace new technological advancements, most of us have some form of technology in our household. The smartphone and home computer are probably the two pieces of technology most households have. There\u2019s no debating that technology has become integral in our daily lives, for better and maybe for worse. Here\u2019s how: Education Technology fuels most of the educational system testing. Now with computers and iPads in just about every classroom, technology has advanced the testing options available to most school systems. Technology makes it more efficient for teachers to handle report cards and grading papers, thus cutting down working hours that usually go well beyond the school day. Communication Whether in business or personal life, technology has improved communication. With apps like Voxer, Skype and other communication apps you can easily improve communication on a business level. These apps also do well when trying to stay connected to family members that live far away. Security Technology can make any family or business feel safer. There are many security devices and software available to secure your financial data, protect your home when you are away and much more. Technology is important because it makes you feel more secure with every area in life for both personal and business reasons. Supplies With technology advancing more people are able to have access to supplies such as fresh water and food because technology can help deliver those items to people that otherwise couldn\u2019t get it. With apps that allow you to order out or the robust technology driven devices that provide water to towns, there are more supplies available due to technology. Space Without technology we would have not have advanced so far in the space industry. NASA utilizes technology to find new planets, monitor space and much more. Technology is important in learning more about the galaxy that surrounds us so that perhaps we can uncover the hidden mysteries of our world. As you can see, technology is a vital part of life as we know it. Eventually we will all have to embrace the technological advancements in society and learn how to function with more tech driven devices. From local restaurant kiosks to downtown grocery stores with self-check-out lanes, technology is here and it is here to stay. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, let\u2019s define what actually the word technology means. The definition of technology is science or knowledge put into practical use to solve problems or invent useful tools. Whenever we use our scientific knowledge to achieve some specific purpose, we're using technology. Well, there is slightly more to it than that. Technology usually involves a specific piece of equipment, but that equipment can be incredibly simple or dazzlingly complex. It can be anything from the discovery of the wheel, all the way up to computers and MP3 players. What are the types of Technology? Since technology can be so simple or so complex, there are many types of technology. One type is mechanical technology, which includes wheels, cams, levers, gears, belts, and and engines. Things that turn, or allow motion in one direction to cause a different kind of motion, are mechanical.  Perhaps the type of technology that we're most familiar with in modern life is electronic technology, usually just called electronics, which is a complex form of technology that uses electric circuits to achieve a goal.  Industrial and manufacturing technology is technology with the goal of either producing a product on a large scale, or performing another large-scale function where customers are not directly present. Transportation Technology:Developing and using devices and systems to move people and cargo from an origin point to a destination.  Information Technology : Information Technology is a set of hardware and software tools used to store, transfer and process information. Information technology tools help in providing the right people with the right information at the right time.  And the list goes onn\u2026\u2026.. Now what are the Importance of technologies ? Why do we need technology?  Technology is always evolving, with new software constantly emerging to solve problems and inefficiencies that companies may not even be aware of yet. Business leaders can sometimes feel overwhelmed in the face of so much change \u2013 there\u2019s often a desire to stick with current technology and processes rather than rocking the boat. Here are five areas new technology brings advantages to the workplace: 1. Speed, Efficiency, and Agility The goal for any new office technology is to speed up workflow processes, giving your employees the ultimate resource \u2013 more time \u2013 to focus on the important work. Businesses best their competitors by being able to respond to data, adapt to changes, and make informed decisions quickly \u2013 new technology and analytics give them the tools to do so. Your business simply can\u2019t afford to move at a 1998 or 2008 pace in 2018. 2. Storage and Sharing Employees should never have to waste time looking for files, documents or information, yet studies show that nearly 20% of the workweek is wasted searching for information \u2013 a major inefficiency that costs businesses money. Technology that streamlines information storage and sharing is vital not only for efficiency, but also for security. Outdated technology puts your company\u2019s confidential information at risk, and sets you up for an expensive data breach \u2013 considering that the average cost of a data breach is $3.62 million. 3. Mobility and Remote Connectivity With the growth of the freelancer economy \u2013 freelancers are expected to become the majority of the U.S. workforce by 2027 \u2013 and many companies adopting flexible work-from-anywhere policies, employees need to be able to access technology systems remotely. Implementing the newest technology allows organizations to connect with the best talent, all over the world, instantly. 4. Automation Another advantage of new technology is that it allows companies to automate functions that previously required employees. Tasks like data entry and analytics, bookkeeping, and contact management can be partially or completely automated, which allows businesses to work more efficiently without the risk of human error. Those cost savings can be invested in human capital that show the biggest ROI \u2013 higher-level employees that innovate and drive the company forward. 5. Communication There\u2019s a reason that computers replaced typewriters, emails replaced paper mail and faxes, Slack has replaced (some) emails: Communication is king. Companies are constantly looking to improve and accelerate communication, and new technology is built with that need in mind. Investing in new systems will help to streamline both internal and external communication \u2013 with clients and vendors \u2013 so that everyone is always in the loop. Hope this will help !!! Thank you :) ~ Manuel Mathew John ",

            "answer_text": "The use of technology is more of a preference to people as it certainly makes things easy but at the same time abstracts out multiple things that might have needed an attention. When things become easy, there are two things which are likely to happen to happen to human beings : first, the simplicity brought about by the technology can make them way too lazy or second, the abstraction brought about by the technology can make them way too ambitious. It is quite obvious to tell the difference between them two - the lazy group of people are the ones who remain as consumers of technology while the ambitious group of people are those who become developers of them. It quite depends of which side you are on to have a say about the importance of technology in our lives. If you are a consumer, it is likely that you will be facing an acute withdrawal syndrome once technology is drawn away from you as you know how you can make a technology work. The sheer reliance of these products gets them lazy and they cannot even imagine a life without these. Also due to the fact that technologies hide certain details about what task is performed in the backdrop, these users will not be able to get started with their solutions also. It would be a really bad situation to be in. In comparison to that, technology is double edged sword for the developers who prefer the simplicity but not the way they hide things. These are the people who pay attention to the details and know how technology works. Knowing these details of the backdrop comes to great help as they would not be as helpless as the consumers would be when these are withdrawn away from them. With the knowledge that they have garnered with the extensive use of technology, they themselves can build it from scratch. Cheers! ",

However, for some other people, such as the armish people, technology is not that important to them, they prefer to live without using modern technology. Technology excites me, from Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink to Facebook\u2019s collaboration with Rayban to digital business cards. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time in researching digital business cards lately and I would like to share my research results with as many people as possible. I\u2019d like to point out that only one or two apps in the app store that does digital business cards right. The one\u2019s I\u2019ve tested has many downfalls. Some of them requires the recipient to submit their personal information to the app website before they can get the sender\u2019s contact information. Some apps requires the sender and the receiver to install the same app and the common inconvenience to those apps is that the receiver would need to copy and paste information from app websites to their contacts book. A well engineered digital business card app should be embedding vcards in their QR code instead of urls. Vcard embedded QR codes would allow the receivers to use their native phone camera to receive the sender\u2019s contact information and the recipient wouldn\u2019t need to type anything. ",

            "answer_text": "What are the importance of technology, you say? Here is Ted. Ted is a local trader and a transporter in the country, but lives in a village which he needs to walk for 30 hours to reach the country. His animals and men used to get tired quickly due to they carried so much of things for trading and transport. When he reached the country he saw lot of varieties of people and things. But he was all stuck with the thought, how he could improve his transportation and then he saw potter making pots while rotating a circular stone. And then he got an Idea. \u201cWhat if I use these to carry my carts instead of my men and maybe it will be easy for my horses too, I would save lot of money.\u201d Thus, Wheels were invented. Now he transports 5 times more and completes his journey in less than 10 hours than he used to. His men were happy and his animals were too. And time to time he traded his invention in the country. All over the place people were using his invention. It made him rich. King came to notice about him and called him. King gifted him with lots of gold and told him to be his guest for a day in the castle and go for hunting in the night. Ted agreed. At night when they were hunting, the men had fire torches. Suddenly there was a storm. All the fire torches were blown out and were wet, they couldn\u2019t lit it again or could have a bonfire. It was pitch black. King\u2019s men were scared as they believed in ghosts and witches, and could here wolves hauling. Luckily the storm didn\u2019t lasted for long and there was a beautiful full moon, which helped them to go back to the castle safely. Ted stared thinking, there must be many people who would have been in this situation. In worst case scenario, people would have lost their lives. Again he went to to the trading market next day to find a solution. After 2 weeks he still could\u2019t find. He was frustrated with that thought. Willing to give up but thought how scary it was and he continued. Then, he finds a very small store. It was a local drug store. Ted just visited there even if he knew it was not worth the search. He talked to the owner for long hours and came to know he was a making a device that would help people. He definitely got interested and saw it. It was the very thing he was looking for. For years he worked with him and failed 1000 times. Finally they made it, it was the very light bulb. And soon Ted sold it to the trading market and soon the country was bright as light in the night. Ted then made many inventions. He made telephones so he could trade directly from his village to his country and others. He made engines so there would be faster travel. He made internet which just changed everything and this is how you could question in Quora. Ted was all those inventors, innovators and researchers who changed the world and made a better place to live for people. ANS: Technologies have changed the world and made a better place to live. In every field, in every place. So could imagine the importance of it. Cheers! :)RS  This story is made up by me! Events are not true in real life. Things to learn in the story: Problems are everywhere, find a solution for it rather than complaining!No matter how hard it is, if you believe you can change it, Don\u2019t give up. You never know how close you are.If you have some improvements in the post, feel free to help me make it better. If you fell you have learned some thing let me know. ",

However, even everyday items like door locks, floor panels, and furniture are technologies that people now take for granted and they seem less impressive than self-driving cars or 3D printing. And, yet, what exactly do we consider to be technologies and what types of technology are there? What does the word technology mean? Simply put, we are always utilizing technology when we use scientific knowledge to achieve a specific goal, whether in industry or in our daily lives. What are the existing types of technology? Basic technologies - they are the basis of our industry. They have not only been tested in theory and in the lab but have also been put to use for years. Basic technologies include combustion engines, for instance, as well as transistors and the power grid. Key technologies - they are the key to the future development of a specific technology sector. Key technologies are in the center of scientific research. The examples of key technologies can be bioinformatics, image recognition and robotics, as well as solar power and hybrid technologies. Pacemaking technologies - technologies that are not yet ready for employment but are more than just visions for the future.They already have a practical application and might be developed further into key technologies. Nanotechnology can be an example of pacemaking technologies. Future technologies - appearing technologies that are still in the research stage. Key, pacemaking and future technologies are called new technologies. They are significant for the uninterrupted development of society and to the competitiveness of businesses.  ",

The doctor recommends you work out till your heart rate goes to 2x your resting bpm, 2000 calories taken per day and 8 hours of sleep. How do you maintain all this? Now, you could do it the hard way, work out outdoors and check your heartbeat by noting how many beats per minute, read labels to see how many calories each product has and use an alarm clock. Or, you could use a smartwatch paired to your smartphone. That allows you to see your bpm at a moments notice, and a plethora of other real time information such as steps taken, kilometers walked and calories burnt, which aid you in your goal of getting healthy. You can put an alarm on your phone and check what diets add up to 2000 calories from the internet. Without the advances of technology since the dawn of the iPhone, we would not be able to do something that we consider part of life now. ",
