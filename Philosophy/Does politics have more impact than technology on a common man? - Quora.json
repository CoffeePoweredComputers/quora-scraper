            "answer_text": "Yes. One part is that, we understand politics better than technology. At least, we like to think so. Second reason is how politics/policies/governance sells against technology/science. If I want to sell my solution, I need to convince the problem. Now, in this case people are convinced about inflation/onion prices/roads. So, they always want it hear solutions for it. Third could be because people believe that Politics is everywhere, in pants shirts etc. (Pun intended). ",
