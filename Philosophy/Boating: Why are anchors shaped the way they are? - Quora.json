            "answer_text": "Contrary to what many people assume, it is not the ANCHOR that stops a vessel moving, but in fact the cable connecting the two. Due to it's length and weight, it forms a natural 'catenary' (curve), which acts as a 'spring' to absorb shocks. A portion of the cable lies on the sea bottom, & it is the friction of this that ultimately stops the vessel moving ( another reason why the lower part of the anchor rode should be chain, even if the rest is 'rope' ). The metalwork we call the 'anchor' is intended to keep one end of the chain static, in one place. After that, it is just a matter of selecting the best one for the type of 'bottom' you encounter. Different anchors are best suited to different ground. [ I should say that here in UK terminology is different: 'Fluke' = 'Danforth' ( flat, soft mud, with no rocks or weeds ). 'Plow' {Plough} = 'CQR' ( Sand etc, maybe a small rock or two.) 'Claw' = 'Bruce', same as CQR, but better at 'digging in'. The 'fisherman' is common, & best suited to rocky bottoms, rather than mud,clay or sand] The 'mushroom' is a more specialised type, since once it is in, it ain't comin' out again easy. It is meant for a permanent mooring, buried deep in the mud. On the East Coast of England, an old engine block is often preferred! Always remember to rig a 'tripping line' with a small bouy, in case the anchor fouls, or you need to slip it for any other reason. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many types of anchors used for different reasons depending on the vessel and needs. They vary in shape, size and weight. I'm no expert but I have a 23' Four Winns that I enjoy. Some anchors are best for soft bottom areas where they can easily dig into the sand and set... like the Plough or Fluke anchor. There are Deadweight anchors that are very heavy and used for helping control a boat in rough waters or holding it in place, but not actually anchored down into sediment. Mushroom anchors are shaped just like that (a mushroom)  and use their shape and massive weight to settle into the bottom of soft sediment and suction themselves into place.  I use a fluke anchor when in sandy soft bottom areas where it will dig in. And I use a grapnel anchor (I always called it a rock anchor though) for when I'm in rocky bottom areas... relying more in its weight and thicker, broad flanges to grab onto a rock. If I used the grapnel anchor in the sand I'd probably just keep drifting along slowly, depending on the current. If I tried using the fluke anchor in a rocky area it might not ever catch.  So it's about having the right tool for the right job and situation/conditions. Thanks, Dan ",

            "answer_text": "They are designed to dig into soft seabottom, exerting a greater holding power than their weight and friction alone would provide.A traditional fisherman's anchor has two flukes to dig in to the bottom, and a stock at the other end to turn the anchor around so that one of the flukes will catch. A stockless anchor is designed so that the flukes will swivel into the bottom. See e.g. Anchor on wikipedia.The rode (chain or rope) is attached to the end of the shaft, which is long so that leverage on it will turn the flukes at right angles to the rode so as to optimally engage the bottom and resist the pull on the rode.Often, there is a second attachment point at the other end near the flukes, where a trip  line can be secured to break out the anchor from difficult ground. Mushroom anchors are designed for permanent moorings in soft bottom, so they will settle into the bottom and resist pull from different directions as the tide changes, without breaking out and re-setting with each change.
