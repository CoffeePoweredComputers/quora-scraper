No matter what religion you are, we are all alive for a reason, a purpose. I personally think we are all here for a reason, to help, to serve others etc. Iy doesn't have to be big, by just showing love to another, teaching a child something. We have so many things to look forward to in life, whether it kids, holidays, pets, jobs, love, family. I can't tell you what will happen if you die, maybe no one will notice, maybe people will. You are on this Earth for a purpose, and you will fulfill that purpose till your last breath. ",
