            "answer_text": "Yes; think of it like this: The universe began as a point of infinite energy which began dissolving into static mass and continuously unfolding new time and space. From our perspective within the universe it\u2019s infinitely big, but consider a theoretical observer viewing our universe from the outside - they would only detect a singularity (an infinitesimally small dimensionless point) because they are outside of and not part of our spacetime continuum.

            "answer_text": "Of course not!!! The universe has a size: 46.5 billion light-years in radius. What it has NOT is boundaries. As the straight lines curve with gravity, you cannot go \u201coutside\u201d the universe: the mass of the universe bends what for you are straight lines so, no matter how far you travel, you end always inside it. So, you live in a Universe with a certain size (93 billion light years) but boundless (it has no borders). Besides, if the Universe had boundaries, it would be already empty: cats would be throwing everything out of it with their tiny, malevolent paws. Darn cats!!!! ",
