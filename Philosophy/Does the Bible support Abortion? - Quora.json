            "answer_text": "There are some grey areas in the Bible that are not clear cut. Things like length of hair, and type of clothing, even on the extreme, is left up to each individual. It is even not a clear area as to whether man should eat some flesh foods and animal products. Although it seems that God would have us eat as healthy as we can. But then there is the case where God left no doubt as to how we should live. And in God\u2019s 10 commandments, God has definitely told us that we should not kill. Let me point you to a special point which I would like to introduce before we tackle what would come next. Please look at Acts chapter 4: 1\u201320. And Acts chapter 5: 17\u201329. Now to make a long story short, the disciples basically told the then spiritual leaders of the Jewish nation, that it doesn\u2019t matter what laws are placed over the people, that is it still most important to \u201cobey God rather than man\u201d. Now today, it is quite natural for individuals to consider and even abort a baby. And to an extent the government has given the green light that it is alright by mans law. But Christians must be concerned to consider a greater law. That is God\u2019s law. God told us, \u201cAnd fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\u201d Matthew 10:28. Even in the old testament Daniel and his fellow believers knew that they neede to obey God and not man. Please read Daniel 3: 1\u201318. (now all of the chapter gives us some awe inspiring examples of God\u2019s deliverance). But to paint a quick picture. King got full of himself one day and built a grand statue of a man. (an idea he got from a dream he had earlier). But then this king got the idea to make this statue a tribute to himself and decided to order everyone that when the ceremony honoring this statue began, that everyone was to bow down to this figure. Well there were three Jewish consultants that had been placed on the staff of the king when they were taken prisoner in Israel. And these followers of the true God, knew that the commandments of God told God\u2019s people never to bow down to any thing or anyone else but God. So these followers of the true God, when the time came, did not bow down to the image. Or the fake god. And when this detail had been made known to the king, he became very angry. And he had the followers of the true God, brought to him and told them that he was going to give the followers of the true God, another chance. But that if the followers of the true God did not bow down to his image that they would be tossed into a burning hot furnace. But the followers of the true God, right there and then told the king that they didn\u2019t need another chance. That they knew that God could deliver them from death if He wanted to. But that they would never do as the king asked and bow down to his image. Well, needless to say the full of himself king became even more incest and, well read the rest of the story. Suffice it to mean, that even when threatened with death God does not want us to bend or break from obeying His commandments. One reason why is when we bend or break, we don\u2019t give God the opportunity to show us that He is God. It may be to help us not to bend or break. And at times He shows His power to save us from situations. But when ever we do not bend or break, even if we live or die, we are giving a testimony to others for God and allowing Him to touch the hearts of those witnessing the circumstances. And it also allows those who will not give their hearts to God an opportunity to change their hearts. Or it further cements their decision to refuse God the opportunity to save them. Well all of this is to say, that even if the government says that something is ok. If it is contrary to what God has said, then a follower of the true God, will not bend or break from doing what God has asked from us. All of the book of Daniel, is full of God\u2019s miraculous leading\u2019s. Take some time and read it. It will be a blessing. Especially look at Daniel Chapter 6. Daniel obey God rather than the king man also. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible never mentions abortion, not at all.  The closest verse is one on miscarriage:  Exodus 21:22  \"When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined what the woman\u2019s husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine. If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.That would imply that killing the fetus is not considered equal to killing a person. Causing a miscarriage carries a financial penalty. Causing bodily harm to the woman carries a personal penalty (perhaps even their life). The Biblical theme seems to be that life begins with breath.  Genesis 2:7 \u201cthen the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.\u201dJob 33:4 \u201cThe spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life\u201dEzekiel 37:5-6 \u201cThus says the Lord God to these bones:I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. I will lay sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live.\u201dActs 17:24 \"nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things.\"Revelation 11:11 But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and those who saw them were terrified.\"Breath and spirit are both one word both in Hebrew and Greek. They are constantly brought together in Scripture as analogous. According to the Bible, life begins when the first breath is drawn. If a man hurts a woman, causing her to miscarry, the punishment is not the same as if a man murders another man. The punishment for murder is much different than the punishment for causing a miscarriage in the Bible.  Note that the Bible places no financial value on infants less than one month old. Leviticus 27:2-7 When a person makes an explicit vow to the Lord concerning the equivalent for a human being, the equivalent for a male shall be: from twenty to sixty years of age the equivalent shall be fifty shekels of silver by the sanctuary shekel. If the person is a female, the equivalent is thirty shekels. If the age is from five to twenty years of age, the equivalent is twenty shekels for a male and ten shekels for a female. If the age is from one month to five years, the equivalent for a male is five shekels of silver, and for a female the equivalent is three shekels of silver. And if the person is sixty years old or over, then the equivalent for a male is fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.\"The verses used to argue that the fetus is human are almost entirely poetic verses that describe God\u2019s knowledge and actions, not the soul or life of a fetus.  Jeremiah 1:5 \u201cBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.\u201dPsalms 139: \"For it was you who formed my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb...My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes beheld my unformed substance. In your book were written all the days that were formed for me, when none of them as yet existed.\"Note that these are poems, e.g., \u201cknitted together: \u201cwoven in the depths of the earth.\" They also talk about God knowing them BEFORE they were formed in the womb - before conception. Were they human before they were even conceived? No. These are poems about God\u2019s knowledge and actions. I am afraid that there is no clear Biblical argument that abortion is murder. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s only one direct mention of abortion in the Bible: the ordeal of the bitter water, from Numbers 5:11\u201331. You can read it for yourself, but the basic idea is if a husband suspects his wife of infidelity, he can make her undergo a bizarre ritual which, if she was unfaithful, will result in a magic abortion. There\u2019s a lot more that can be said on this topic, of course. One consistent theme in the Old Testament is that a fetus simply does not have the same value as a live human. For example, pregnant women were executed (e.g. Tamar in Genesis 38), and miscarriage is mentioned as a punishment (e.g. Hosea 9:14). But I\u2019d like to talk for a moment about one of the most telling passages, which is this one: When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined what the woman\u2019s husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine. Exodus 21:22 (NRSV) That\u2019s possibly the clearest statement that under Old Testament law, a crime which causes a miscarriage is punished less harshly than one that kills a live person. It doesn\u2019t get any more obvious than this. It\u2019s so obvious, in fact, that some people in the United States, who want desperately to prove that abortion is the worst of all possible sins, have taken to rewriting the text of the Bible to make it mean something else for their own political ends. The weird thing is that it\u2019s Protestants who seem to want to do this. One would think that rewriting the text of the Bible is the worst of all sins for Protestants, but apparently not when there are higher cynical political values at stake. All American Evangelical Protestant translations of the Bible produced in the United States since the late 70s (only American ones and only Evangelical Protestant ones; even the standard Catholic translation, the New Jerusalem Bible, is not affected by this revisionism) translate this as \u201cgive birth prematurely\u201d and relegate \u201cmiscarriage\u201d to a footnote. There\u2019s one exception: the latest Southern Baptist translation, the CSB, keeps the historically incorrect reading and drops the footnote. The New Testament says essentially nothing, which makes sense because unlike the Mosaic law, the New Testament is not the legal code of a nation. Christianity was not designed to be \u201cin charge\u201d, so is far less prescriptive on anything except personal holiness. So to answer your question: The Bible explicitly provides for (and gives a recipe for) abortion in one instance. Elsewhere, it doesn\u2019t say much, but to the extent that there is a clear and consistent message, it\u2019s that a fetus is important and valued, but is not legally or morally the same as a live human. To quote Norman Geisler\u2019s Ethics: Alternatives and Issues (circa 1975, before American Evangelicalism was infected by post-Watergate politics), \u201cabortion is less serious than murder\u201d and \u201cabortion is more serious than birth control\u201d. For a Christian moral philosopher, that\u2019s the source material, but obviously in the light of modern medical science it doesn\u2019t stop there. Those are the principles from which to come to a conclusion. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have already pointed out the Bible doesn't specifically address abortion. But it speaks a great deal about human life and as Stephen Frantz points out even places various monetary values on people of different ages and genders. Some how I think that was done because of the hardness of the hearts of man. The Gospel of Jesus Christ gives us a much deeper insight on Just how much God values us. So much so that He gave up divine privilege so He could walk among us and call us friends, Paul says He bankrupted Heaven when he presented Himself a living sacrifice and all of that so He could save us and redeem us back to Himself. Even the Law itself was designed for us, Jesus testifying that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. Can we also say that, thou shalt not kill has this same quality.  So then the question is when does a human life begin? The writer of Hebrews says that Isaac was in the loins of Abraham and so paid tithes to Melchizedek years before Isaac was born. Can we look at that and say that even I was in the loins of Adam or Noah. And that the premature death of anyone at all also cuts off future generations. Perhaps; but I am not sure I want to take such a stand.  I will take this stand however; for I believe that God takes a role and personal interest in the development of every fetus. Jeremiah stating that God knew him in the womb and called him to be a prophet. Paul saying that He was set apart even in his mother womb, John the Baptist leaping at the News of Jesus conception in the womb of Elizabeth at six months pregnant, and certainly the miracle of Jesus conception Himself are indicators that God regards the womb a holy place, and the lives in them as viable.

It only says that God knew who we were before we existed; it says nothing about when life begins. The argument over abortion is a relatively recent one. The Catholic Church has opposed abortion since the 17th century, in an effort to ensure that Catholics would outnumber Protestants. In the U.S., few Protestants opposed abortion until the late 1970s, when agitators like Jerry Falwell began using legal abortion and gay rights as rallying points in the \u201cculture war.\u201d Until then, it wasn\u2019t unusual for a Republican like George H.W. Bush to be pro-choice, or a conservative Democrat like Al Gore Jr. to be pro-life. Today, the abortion debate is almost unanimously polarized between the two parties. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: \u201cDoes the Bible support abortion?\u201d Yes. Absolutely. First commandment out of the box: \u201cI am the Lord, thy God and you shall have no other gods before me.\u201d Taking the body of work of the Bible as a whole, God and possibly those prohibited or subordinated lower-case gods are distinguished from humanity by both omniscience about the future and capacity to influence, to morph future events beyond all our efforts at comprehension of rules of causation. God does miracles. God makes choices that mess with human plans beyond their understanding. Minor gods may dabble in this, too. Whether this little tidbit is truth is still a little sketchy. The point is, human trespass into the business of God, and maybe lesser gods, saints and angels, is elevation of the human into god-turf. Action above pay grade. Way over pay grade. Given that we cannot know God\u2019s will in advance, we cannot comprehend it until it smites or saves us, it follows that: Any and all Human presumption of the future is an audacious trespass and violation of the very first sentence etched on Moses\u2019s tablets. Prenatal gestation is a perilous time for male-dominated societies. In the Bronze Age, the most fragile interval for a monarch, or anyone with any power or stored wealth, was when their significant woman was \u201cwith child\u201d. Any time after birth, Regicide can be thwarted. Loyal guards can be posted. Plots rooted out and foiled. Bad actors, beheaded or exiled. Not so, when the queen is with child. Yet the human condition is not that of the gods. We are of the animals. We make babies in a woman\u2019s womb. To understand the anti-abortion argument, we must recognize both the rejection of our actual humanity: a mammal that relies on live birth after gestation in a woman\u2019s womb; and, rejection of the very first commandment. Trespass of anyone on the individual integrity of body of another, with purpose to subordinate that other person to one\u2019s wishes and hopes which are ultimately beyond one\u2019s control and knowledge is to act as a god ahead of, and before \u201cThe\u201d God contrary to the first commandment. Most of recorded history and the subordination of women, the shunting of them into the broad category of property can be explained as desperate grasps at control of that which is beyond control. Prohibiting or even impeding abortion is telling God you know the future. You know His will. It is placing oneself or the State above God, in sorting out the eventuality. Commandments be damned. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible does not directly address abortion, but it does speak directly regarding God's view of human life, including life within the womb. From these references we can develop a clear Christian worldview regarding the modern issue of abortion. The Bible says humans are made in the image of God: \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.' . . . So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them\" (Genesis 1:26-27). All human life is considered sacred and created by God. During the time of Moses, God gave laws for how Israel was to be governed. Some of those laws specified penalties for different crimes. In Exodus 21:22-25, the penalty for causing the death of an unborn child was \"life for life.\" In other words, God saw killing a child in the womb as murder. These verses support the view that preborn infants are humans equal in importance to other people. Psalm 139:13-16 is a poetic description of life in the womb: \"For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.\" Here again, life in the womb is described as God's creation and therefore of tremendous worth. In Jeremiah 1:5 God says, \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.\" Even before Jeremiah's birth, God had formed the prophet on purpose, for a purpose. Life in the womb is also affirmed in the story of Jesus' nativity. Mary the mother of Jesus traveled to visit her relative Elizabeth, who was also pregnant. \"When Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed with a loud cry, 'Blessed are you among women! . . . Behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy'\" (Luke 1:41-44). The Greek word translated \"baby\" in reference to the child inside Elizabeth's womb is the same word used for an infant outside of the womb. The preborn Jesus is also referred to as a \"baby,\" a living human being. This is more than an emotional outburst from Elizabeth; she was \"filled with the Holy Spirit\" when she made the statement. The consensus of Scripture is that a baby in the womb is a unique human life. Therefore, children in the womb should be respected and protected. The Bible has much to say about defending the cause of the weak, especially those who have no voice. \"Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute\" (Proverbs 31:8; see also Psalm 82:3). We bear the responsibility to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, including children in the womb. Abortion - What does the Bible have to say?Another insightful passage from the Old Testament is found in Exodus 21:22-25. This passage describes what action is to be taken in a case of accidental injury to a pregnant woman: If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no lasting harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman\u2019s husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any lasting harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe (NKJV). This passage has been mistranslated in some versions. For example, some versions use the word \u201cmiscarriage\u201d instead of translating the Hebrew phrase literally\u2014\u201cso that her children come out.\u201d The text is envisioning a situation in which two brawling men accidentally injure a pregnant bystander. The injury causes the woman to go into early labor, resulting in a premature birth of her child. If neither the woman nor the child is harmed, then the Law of Moses levied a fine against the one who caused the premature birth. But if injury or even death resulted from the brawl, then the law imposed a parallel punishment: if the premature baby died, the one who caused the premature birth was to be executed\u2014life for life. This passage clearly considers the pre-born infant to be a human being, and to cause a pre-born infant\u2019s death was homicide under the Old Testament\u2014homicide punishable by death. Notice that this regulation under the Law of Moses had to do with injury inflicted accidentally. Abortion is a deliberate, purposeful termination of a child\u2019s life. If God dealt severely with the accidental death of a pre-born infant, how do you suppose He feels about the deliberate murder of the unborn by an abortion doctor? The Bible states explicitly how He feels: \u201c[D]o not kill the innocent and righteous. For I will not justify the wicked\u201d (Exodus 23:7). As a matter of fact, one of the things that God hates is \u201chands that shed innocent blood\u201d (Proverbs 6:17). Abortion and the BibleLeviticus 27:2-7  In order for people to free themselves or their family from a vow of service to God they were required to give to the sanctuary what amounts to a redemption price based on a person's gender and age. The value is not based on sex or age discrimination, as is sometimes thought, but on a person's physical strength. In other words, the valuation is not tied to a person's dignity or worth. The highest value is on a male aged between twenty and sixty. A female in the same bracket is judged to be of less value in terms of the work she could do, such as lifting the heavy carcasses of animals slain in sacrifice and disposing of their remains. It is a factor recognized in the athletic and sporting world that a man is, generally speaking, stronger than a woman. For this reason men and women do not compete against each other, otherwise the men would have an unfair advantage. People over sixty and children under five are also valued at a lower rate and males and females between the ages of five and twenty are also considered separately. The Factory Acts that came about in Britain in the wake of the Evangelical Revival of the eighteenth century sought in some way to recognize the different strengths and powers of the sexes, as well as of old people and children. For instance, they legislated against women and children labouring in the coalmines and other such places of work. Buying oneself out of the commitment was a costly business, for it is estimated that on average a person only earned about one shekel a month. It would therefore cost nearly a whole year's wages to redeem a male in the prime of life. For those who were too poor to pay such a valuation, the priest was given the power to set a value according to the person's ability to pay. It is assumed that the valuations were deliberately set high to discourage rash vows involving people. Philip H.

            "answer_text": "Actually it's a matter of retrofitting the scriptures to the current beliefs of the religion. Every religion has this problem, because every religion morphs over time, making its scriptures progressively more and more anachronistic. A lot just gets swept under the rug, such as the Christian Bible's support for polygamy. Other things--such as abortion--become the recipients of truly impressive mental gymnastics that would have astonished the people who wrote and read the Bible originally. The things the writers of the Bible wanted to prescribe and proscribe, it prescribed and proscribed. It didn't leave it up to the reader to winkle out heretofore hidden meanings. The Bible--like most religions' sacred scriptures--isn't obscurantist or arcane. Religious scriptures tell you what to do and what to not do, based on the religious authority of those scriptures.  They don't beat around the bush.  But they do say what they mean and mean what they say in the language of the day and the context of the times.  Which were radically different 2,000 years ago.  Stephen Frantz's answer politely dissects the arguments made to try to bridge the chasm between what was said and thought then vs. what is said and thought now on this topic. Note that the now-t0-them-obvious opposition to abortion in the Bible was invisible to most Protestants until the 1970's. It had also been invisible to the Catholics until some 19th century Pope, responding to the scientific findings of the day, took it into his head to think that abortion was wrong. This belief got proselytized to Protestants in America in the 1970s under the direction of Republican operatives, who saw abortion as a wedge issue they could use to pry socially conservative Democrats away from that party to the GOP--which turned out to be true.  The Not-So-Lofty Origins of the Evangelical Pro-Life Movement One of the best circumstantial proofs of this is the fact that those who seek to criminalize abortion never try to make it a crime for the woman to get an abortion--only for the doctor to perform it. But if abortion is murder, the primary criminal is the person soliciting it; the doctor is only her hireling. Yet anti-abortion fanatics never stalk and gun down women who get abortions--only the doctors. This is sexist--and a sign of how fundamentally political the movement is, rather than principled. So anti-abortionism is at its essence political Christianity, based on ideas foreign to the authors and readers of the Bible 2,000 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Not to repeat the information provided by Mr. Frantz I would like correct the notion that there is no clear Scriptural evidence that abortion is murder in the eyes of God. So the word used in New Testament Greek the word \"pharmakeia\" is used to refer to the creation of potions and the like that were often used to carry out abortions. Verses of Scripture that reference this are:  Galatians 5:19-21 - Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery [pharmakeia], enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\" Revelation 9:21 - \"...nor did they repent of their murders or their sorceries [pharmakeia] or their immorality or their thefts.\" Revelation 18:23 - \"and the light of a lamp shall shine in thee no more; and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard in thee no more; for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, and all nations were deceived by thy sorcery [pharmakeia].\" Revelation 21:8 - \"But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, as for murderers, fornicators, sorcerers [pharmakon], idolaters, and all liars, their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death.\" Revelation 22:15- \"Outside are the dogs and sorcerers [pharmakeus] and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and every one who loves and practices falsehood.\" From this we see that it is pretty clear that \"pharmakeia\" is a mortal sin and in full Scriptural context, willful abortion is equated to murder. Extrabiblical evidence also exists in chapter 2 of the Diadache (The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, AD 90):  \"The second commandment in the Teaching means: Commit no murder, adultery, sodomy, fornication, or theft. Practice no magic, sorcery, abortion, or infanticide.\" That's all I got for now. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if you take your Bible literally, apparently it\u2019s OK to cause a miscarriage if your wife has been unfaithful to you. Just have the priest give her a special potion, and if she has been unfaithful then the fetus will spontaneously abort. If she has not been unfaithful, then the fetus will not be be aborted. Numbers 5: 12 - 28 12. Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'If a man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him 13. so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act), 14. and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure--or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure-- 15. then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing. 16. The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the LORD. 17. Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water. 18. After the priest has had the woman stand before the LORD, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse. 19. Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, \"If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. 20. But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband\"-- 21. here the priest is to put the woman under this curse--\"may the LORD cause you to become a curse among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell. 22. May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.\" Then the woman is to say, \"Amen. So be it.\" 23. The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water. 24. He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. 25. The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the LORD and bring it to the altar. 26. The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water. 27. If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse. 28. If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children. But that\u2019s the plain language of what the Bible actually says, mind you. I\u2019m sure you can find plenty of people who will explain in great detail why what it actually says isn\u2019t actually what it means, especially if you take into account the cultural context in which it was written, the socio-economic situation at the time, various scholarly dissertations on the alternate meanings of certain Hebrew words, etc., etc., etc. Oh, but that bit about stoning to death a man who lies with another man? Only one possible meaning for that, sorry. After all \u2014 it\u2019s the clear language of the Bible! ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible does not mention abortion per se but does mention the duty owed to other human beings. I would therefore rephrase this question to whether or not the Bible regards the human fetus as a human person. The Bible refers to human life in the womb on numerous occasions. \u2022 In Genesis 25:21-22, we see that Rebekah's \"children jostled each other in the womb.\" The Bible refers to the twin boys developing in Rebekah's womb as children. The Lord heard his entreaty, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. But the children jostled each other in the womb so much that she exclaimed, \u201cIf it is like this, why go on living!\u201d (Gen. 25:21\u201322, Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 25:21-22 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) \u2022 In Tobit 4:3\u20134, Tobit gives his son Tobiah the following advice: Son, when I die, give me a decent burial. Honor your mother, and do not abandon her as long as she lives. Do whatever pleases her, and do not grieve her spirit in any way. Remember, son, how she went through many dangers for you while you were in her womb. When she dies, bury her in the same grave with me. (Tob. 4:3\u20135, Bible Gateway passage: Tobit 4:3-5 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) Tobit refers to his son \"while you were in her womb,\" which does not make sense unless Tobit's humanity began in the womb. \u2022 In 2 Maccabees 7:22\u201323, a mother tells her sons: I do not know how you came to be in my womb; it was not I who gave you breath and life, nor was it I who arranged the elements you are made of. Therefore, since it is the Creator of the universe who shaped the beginning of humankind and brought about the origin of everything, he, in his mercy, will give you back both breath and life, because you now disregard yourselves for the sake of his law. (2 Mac. 7:22\u201323, Bible Gateway passage: 2 Maccabees 7 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) \u2022 God fashions human life in the womb, according to 2 Maccabees, and also Job 31:15: Did not he who made me in the belly make him? Did not the same One fashion us in the womb? (Jb. 31:15, Bible Gateway passage: Job 31:15 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) \u2022 Isaiah concurs: For now the Lord has spoken who formed me as his servant from the womb\u2026 (Is. 49:5, Bible Gateway passage: Isaiah 49:5 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) \u2022 And God Himself tells the prophet Jeremiah: Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I dedicated you, a prophet to the nations I appointed you. (Jer. 1:5, Bible Gateway passage: Jeremiah 1:5 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) \u2022 We turn to the New Testament and find that John the Baptist was \u201cfilled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother\u2019s womb.\u201d (Luke 1:15): He will be filled with the holy Spirit even from his mother\u2019s womb, and he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. (Lk. 1:15\u201316, Bible Gateway passage: Luke 1:15-16 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) \u2022 Also in Luke, Elizabeth, pregnant with John the Baptist, declares to Mary, who is pregnant with Jesus: And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. (Lk. 1:43\u201344, Bible Gateway passage: Luke 1:43-45 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) The Bible in these and other places refer to God creating human life in the womb, and in several places refers to the human fetus as a person (\"child,\" \"infant,\" \"you,\" \"me\", etc.) So the question is not whether or not the Bible mentions abortion, but whether the Bible refers to the human fetus as a human being. The answer is, yes it does. What is the duty owed to other human beings according to the Bible? \"You shall not kill.\" (Cf. Exodus 20:13) You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, \u2018You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.\u2019 (Matthew 5:21, Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 5:21 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) And, Do to others as you would have them do to you. (Lk. 6:31, Bible Gateway passage: Luke 6:31 - New American Bible (Revised Edition)) ",

Abortion is murder of a human being inside of a human. The other thing is when an abortion occurs due to some health problems or other body failure due to the body bioshield forcibly activated: a pregnant woman without knowing this goes to take a bath in extreme high temperatures or when she hits with her belly of something which causes injuries to her belly, an accident - such is unexpected cause of an abortion and such is not considered as a criminal offense. If a man hits a pregnant woman over her belly and she loses her baby because of this - that man is murderer because he willfully murdered a human being inside of a human. A pregnant woman must avoid extremely high temperatures as this may harm her pregnancy and even her own life. ",

The Law makes it clear that the penalty for causing a miscarriage is not the same as murder of a post natal individual, thereby suggesting that the fetus was regarded as something less than a full person. Additionally, the consequences for infidelity is drinking a potion that would cause an abortion. Jesus Christ had nothing whatsoever to say about the matter. Perhaps instead of getting all in a dither about abortion, we should focus on the quality of life we provide or allow for the children who are born. ",

The Bible doesn't say anything about abortion but \u201cI know what it meant, it means it's wrong\u201d.The Bible doesn't say anything about abortion, surely it would if it were wrong.Given that both agree that the Bible doesn't say anything about abortion, and given there are specific, unambiguous prohibitions in the Bible include boiling kids in their mother\u2019s milk, muzzling oxen threshing grain and wearing garment without tassels or made of mixed fabrics, it seems reasonable to conclude that the god portrayed in the Bible cares more about the aforementioned than it does about abortion. To argue otherwise is like arguing the Bible prohibits masturbation. The Bible does not prohibit masturbation, but some people would like it to for a variety of reasons like: They are sexually repressed.If you control what a person does with their body then you've got control of their mind too.Similarly opposition to abortion has nothing to do with Biblical prohibition, but more to do with controlling people, specifically women.

            "answer_text": "The current methods of abortion did not exist in Bible times. However, we can consider various passages. Psalm 139 13 For it was you who created my inward parts;you knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb.14 I will praise youbecause I have been remarkably and wondrously made.Your works are wondrous,and I know this very well.15 My bones were not hidden from youwhen I was made in secret,when I was formed in the depths of the earth.16 Your eyes saw me when I was formless;all my days were written in your book and plannedbefore a single one of them began. Notice that King David, who wrote Psalm 139, said \u201cyou knit me,\u201d not \u201cyou knit something that later became me.\u201d Exodus 21:22\u201323 deals with the matter of a man hitting a pregnant woman so that her children come out. He\u2019s to be fined if there\u2019s no further injury. Some Bible scholars think this means that if there\u2019s only a miscarriage, the man is fined, but that if the woman has lasting damage, he receives equivalent lasting damage. I, along with many, many others, think that the passage is talking about premature live birth (the man is fined if the baby is OK) and a disabled baby or a miscarriage (the man is wounded or executed). You can look it up here: Bible Gateway passage: Exodus 21 - Christian Standard Bible Job 1010 Did you not pour me out like milkand curdle me like cheese? Note also the ten commandments, including \u201cYou shall not murder.\u201d I pray that you will conclude that every life is precious. See also Jeremiah 7:6, Deuteronomy 30:19, and Psalm 127:3. ",

If that proves existence of god, then hurray - by the same logic Spiderman is real too! There is bunch of books about him so he is more real than god.

How vast is the sum of them! If I would count them, they are more than the sand. I awake, and I am still with you.\" ",
