            "answer_text": "That really depends on a few things, including your level of intelligence, your commitment to doing hard academic work, your interest in these subjects,and where you are going to attend school. The rigor and demands of the college work can vary from one college to another. Attending a small state college will likely be less rigorous (but not always) that someplace like Harvard. If you have some knowledge of the CJ system and philosophy already, this too can make things easier for you. The study of CJ includes all the major aspects of the CJ system (policing, probation/parole, law and courts, etc) as well as criminal theory. Philosophy will examine various world belief and thought systems. If you do major in CJ, you might want to consider a more marketable minor like Spanish, especially if you want to work in urban areas. You can also consider doing a double major with CJ. This way, if you don\u2019t find a job in CJ you can get a job in another field that interests you, like business. ",
