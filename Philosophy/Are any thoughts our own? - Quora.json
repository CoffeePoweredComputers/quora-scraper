            "answer_text": "All thoughts erupting in your mind are your own. They may attract other thoughts of same kind under the law of attraction, like attracts like, but only by your conscious willingness and acceptance.Thoughts erupt out of your own deep memories and conscious beliefs as smoke rises from hot water or mist of your breathe is caused upon glass.You create them for a reason without your conscious awareness.Your consciousness has tendency to appear in external physical world and thus creates physical experience and reality through your conscious beliefs, emotions, thoughts and your expectations.Therefore, be very careful about each moment of your life what you believe and what you are thanking at present, because that will be materialized as your physical reality and experience to face in external world.

Cut out various pieces (people, cars, buildings, food items, etc\u2026) Now, make a picture, any picture you want, by gluing the magazine cut outs onto a sheet of paper.  I guarantee you, nobody else thought of the picture you make. However, your collage will contain other people\u2019s work.  Your thoughts contain elements from other people\u2019s work, but you get to re-arrange them. Your thoughts are like a collage made from magazine cut outs. It\u2019s a very black and white world to say \u201cmy thoughts are purely from other people\u201d or \u201cmy thoughts are 100% original.\u201d The world is painted in shades of grey. Your thoughts contain both original elements and unoriginal elements. ",

            "answer_text": "Thinking is the act of recollection. Our memory is a collection of concepts and sensual experiences. When we think we find realtionships between the contents of our memory and express them as our opinion. To \u201cexpress\u201d does not necessarily require talking or writing, it can be non-verbal internal reflexion too. Since thinking requires memory, we can say that most of our thoughts are linked to past experiences or to acquired knowledge. But seldomly we are capable to form totally new ideas from our memory content. In such a case we have reached the level of creative thinking and our thought are personal as well as original. ",

The body is a constantly changing process. Every 7 years the body is completely different from what existed before. Where is a fixed identity in the body? Are you the personality that goes with the body? What exactly is the personality? Thoughts are self luminous and self evident and they must logically arise from memory. Memory is a huge information bank and the building blocks of memory are habit patterns. Long standing habits become character or personality. The memory bank can be influenced by the environment and so it is also a constantly changing process. So there is no fixed identity in the personality either! What exactly is \u201cyou\u201d then? You are a robot on auto pilot! There is an ALIVENESS in the background that is INTELLIGENT and it is an impersonal SPIRIT that is causeless and it is untouched by time and space. This ALIVENESS is the very source of this cosmos. This cosmos is merely a set of sensations in ALIVENESS. You are also merely a set of sensations in ALIVENESS. So there are no persons with free will or volition but all there is, is ALIVENESS! ",
