            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define \u201cfree\u201d. If it means we are not forced to do something by an external agent, then yes, even a slave is free to have his own thoughts, though not necessarily to exercise free will. If \u201cfree\u201d means our thoughts are not determined by our brain or anything else, then the only way to have free thoughts would be if they popped up randomly, and the only way to have free will would be to act in a random and purposeless manner. But this definition of \u201cfree\u201d is not what most people have in mind, unless perhaps they are amateur philosophers on Quora discussing free will. ",
