            "answer_text": "If you had a genuine true-or-false situation, where some proposition P was known to be either false or true, and you knew it wasn\u2019t true, then yes, P would be false by definition. However. Such situations are rarer than one might think in reality. More things are a matter of perspective, rather than absolute truth or falsity, than we tend to believe. Even ignoring Cartesian doubt and other such philosophical matters, which note that we can\u2019t be certain the world we experience is real at all, we rarely have all relevant details about a situation. Let\u2019s stick with the true-false theme, for a moment, and consider the case where I tell you P is the case, when you know something that implies \u00acP. What I have told you is not the truth. Does it follow that I am lying? No, it does not, because \u201clying\u201d doesn\u2019t actually mean \u201cspeaking something contrary to absolute truth\u201d but \u201cspeaking something contrary to the truth that the speaker understands\u201d, so if I genuinely believe that P, I\u2019m not lying. The law of the excluded middle is useful, but you need to bear in mind that we deal with at least two types of \u201cnot true\u201d in reality, and the law applies to only one of them. There\u2019s \u201cnot true\u201d as in \u201cwe know this statement to be false\u201d, and there\u2019s \u201cnot true\u201d as in \u201cwe cannot prove this to be true so we can\u2019t derive anything from its being true\u201d. The law of the excluded middle applies to the former, but even there it is necessary to be careful: \u00acP is not the everyday sense of the opposite of P, but simply \u201cP is false\u201d. If P is \u201cthe sky is green\u201d, \u00acP doesn\u2019t automatically mean the sky is the-opposite-of-yellow (so, arguably, magenta), it means the sky is not yellow. This may sound obvious but it\u2019s a trap that people fall into all the time. ",

            "answer_text": "An example would help, but any situation is composed of a multitude of often very disparate facts, each and all of which may be true or false. It is not the situation which is true or false but a specific representation of that situation, which may be be partially true and partially false. We generally discriminate between competing representations not by totaling the number of truths or falsities they contain, but by how well they accurately isolate,represent and explain relevant detail. In this regard negative facts may be as relevant as positive ones, for example the fact that the dog didn\u2019t bark in the night-time. Then, as you rightly say, we are left with a shortlist of explanations ranging from the likely to the unlikely. We eliminate these one by one, based on our own verification of fact and our own assessment of how relevant these facts are, until we reach our conclusion (however improbable). A similar process takes place in the adjudication of scientific theories. (Only contradictions are false by definition). ",
