            "answer_text": "Despite I don't want to be arrogant, how come Japan and Korea could compete and counterbalance China, they both influenced by China as sinosphere. if it refers to several wars (not including after the west came to Eastern Asia) that Japanese tried to invade mainland, those were not really chaos, which couldn't challenge tributary system. Vietnam had wars with China too. the real competing and counterbalancing was between Eastern Asia and Inner Asia. the former one was Han Chinese sphere based on agriculture, the latter one was sphere based on nomadic, hunting or mixture of hunting and agriculture. these two have never stopped interacting with each other until western industrial civilization came. China, Korea, Japan all were influenced by confucianism which pursued harmony, which means they all pursued order. however, their Confucius values that they concerned were different. as we know, Confucius values included these: \u4ec1\uff08benevolence)\uff0c\u4e49(justice)\uff0c\u793c(curtsy)\uff0c\u667a(wise)\uff0c\u4fe1(credit)\uff0c\u5b5d(filial)\uff0c\u608c(brotherhood)\uff0c\u5fe0(loyalty)\uff0c\u6055(tolerance)\uff0c\u52c7(bravery)\u3002Chinese concerned benevolence, justice, filial, Japanese selected loyalty, I know Korean selected their own, but I couldn't remember which ones. anyone could tell me if you know it.

            "answer_text": "No, I think this is a gross oversimplification. It feels like you are trying to force a metaphor onto reality. There are at least four thousand years in the history of China. Japan as a nation barely shows up in Asian history until 600~700 CE when they started copying things from China. Japan was pretty much irrelevant to China until ~1880? Japan\u2019s significant interactions (warfare) with its neighbors are Hideyoshi\u2019s Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598) - Wikipedia, and then the annexation of Korea after a complicated period from ~1880 onward until 1945. As for China, there was the First Sino-Japanese War (25 July 1894 \u2013 17 April 1895) Then the invasion of China 1937\u20131945. The history of Korea is very complicated, it has at times been a kingdom or many kingdoms, and at times a province or protectorate of China. ",

            "answer_text": "no This is an example of wrong use of Yin-Yang philosophy. Yin and Yang refer to two forces that exist in the same entity and cannot be used in two different entities. You can only say that there are two forces Order and Chaos in China (or Japan). But you cannot say that China is Order and Japan is Chaos. ",
