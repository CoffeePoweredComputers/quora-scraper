            "answer_text": "Is \"progressivism\" a political philosophy or just a life philosophy? Progressivism is neither a political philosophy or a life philosophy but more of an attitude which is the opposite of conservativism. Progressivism is a proto-philosophy because there is no system of believes. The two form a dichotomy of attitudes or a duality of opposite principles. Progressives are anti-conservatives. Conservatives are anti-progressives. Good luck America. ",
