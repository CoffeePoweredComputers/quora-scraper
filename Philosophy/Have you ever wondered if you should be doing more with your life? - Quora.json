            "answer_text": " When I was in high school life was very simple to me, I had a nice group of friends, my teachers liked me, and I had good grades. In my senior year, I thought I had it all figured out. You can imagine how naive a 17 year old can be. How hard can real life be if school is easy? With this thinking in mind I decided to study engineering, a popular discipline that I thought will make it easy for me to work and get that bread. I decided to go to uni in Manchester, im from Lebanon so it was quite a big step to do so. When I arrived I was full of energy and excited about a new chapter, again I thought it would all be simple and figure itself out. It wasn\u2019t longer than 2\u20133 months when I realised how much I hated my course and that engineering was not for me or at least that\u2019s what I thought. I spent the next 2 and a half years feeling chronically bad and unmotivated, I felt off, I needed to do something else with my life but engineering was taking up most of my time (mostly due to poor time management). Don\u2019t get me wrong, I didn\u2019t struggle with the course itself, it just lacked enjoyment. One day I had just gotten enough, I took out a pen and paper and imagined how my perfect life would be. What I would be doing? What my hobbies would be? Where would I live? Every little detail I could imagine, even my kitchen\u2019s door frame. I had created a little world of my own. After 3\u20134 hours of emphatic writing I took a halt, \u201cEureka Eureka!\u201d. I had figured out what\u2019s missing or rather what\u2019s not missing. This whole time I was looking for joy to be found in my life, and as I was writing I realised that the truth of the matter was that I was passionate about many things. But I wasn\u2019t struggling because of them, in fact I never took the initiative to follow any of my passions so how could I feel like I\u2019m missing out? I did not need to change my course or start more things, I just needed to be more alive about what I do. I needed to understand the extent of my involvement. I\u2019m still on the same engineering degree 2 years later and about to graduate soon. I started to take the extra mile in my classes, to research the topics more, to watch YouTube videos. I saw what kind of impact renewable engineers had on the environment and people\u2019s life. As a consequence, I managed my time better and was more active following my passions and dreams. In fact my involvement also improved my relationship with my peers, friends and family. Did I ever wonder if I should be doing more with my life? Absolutely yes Did I need to transform my life to do that? Absolutely not, I just became more involved ",
