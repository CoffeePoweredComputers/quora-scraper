            "answer_text": "Moral values eh? To be perfectly honest, my moral values are not really something that you should live by. Or rather, the age-old phrase of \u201cDo as I say, not as I do\u201d comes to mind. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do tend to follow my morals a majority of the time, but I view my morals as something that are merely a guiding light in life, not the bedrock of my being.  \u201cFuck it, its not like I was a nice guy anyway\u201d - Me, c. 5 minutes ago I\u2019ve long ago reasoned with myself as I cry myself to sleep that my morals do not have to be stuck to 100% of the time, and that given the right circumstances I can and will override them, because I am the boss and no one is the boss of me, not even myself.  \u201cThis is the last time you demand anything of me, vile being!\u201d I do have moral values that I do try to follow (and rather successfully, if I may say so myself) at least 90% of the time, such as treating others with decency, being polite, saying please and thank you, slapping children, holding doors for women like the chavunistic male pig that I am, telling my parents I love them, watching porn\u2026. I think I\u2019m a little off topic here. But yes, my moral values really are my moral values. But at the same time, I do not hold any grandiose delusions about how nice of a person I am. I know I am not a Saint yet, but neither am I down to the level of Hitler, Stalin or even worse, Fortnite players. I am realistic. Given the right circumstances, like I said earlier, I will go against them. For example, the idea of being nice to people that you meet/talk to, including online? Well, if we are in a game and you are being excessively toxic like a lead bucket of cyanide, then I throw that out the window and crack down on you like the scum you are. I\u2019m sure you get the picture now. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking as a person, I will never be stubborn or stupid enough to follow something as subjective as morality down to the core. The thing about morals is that they are not actually what is right and wrong but what people think is right and wrong. Meaning that moral is created by people and not the truth. Since people are imperfect, it would be stupid to assume that something they create can be perfect. And knowing that morals are not perfect, why the hell would you follow moral as though it is perfect? It just doesn\u2019t make sense. I follow my moral when it conjures beneficial results. If my moral cause more harm than good, I forsake them and take a different route to reach a better conclusion. If life is as simple as just following some stupid rules then we\u2019d have world peace by now. ",
