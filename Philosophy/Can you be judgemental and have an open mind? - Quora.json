            "answer_text": "Yes, you can.  Cross-culturally, being non-judgemental has come to occupy the high-ground of sophistication. Very often, we get to know of people being criticised for being too judgemental. At this stage of cultural evolution, hasn\u2019t it become necessary to ask ourselves whether anything of any constructive value has ever been created without forming a set of judgements in the first place? Film-criticism comes to the fore of my memory when I think about the attack on being judgemental. When all other aspects conspicuously fall perfectly in place, it is then that that film runs a great risk of being labelled as preachy or judgemental. Being opinionated is treated like a sin, unfortunately, in a profession which is in many ways only a portrayal of opinions.  Now someone told me being judgemental hasn\u2019t got anything about making judgements, it is about criticising people too quickly. The way I see it, I see people being disapproved of for being judgemental per se, without a heed being paid to the opinion they took and why and how they took it. The way things stand then, isn\u2019t being anti-judgemental being judgemental too? All of us should be free to do whatever they want as long as it doesn't hinder other people's essential freedom, and other people should be similarly free to judge whatever they want to judge. Of course, as an invariant, people should be thoughtful about why they're forming any opinion, but once they do form an opinion and are convinced of their rationale (and only they need to be convinced of their rationale, not you. If you insist otherwise, you're judgemental in the same way you don't want others to be), they are free to have it. The onus is upon all of us to decide for ourselves which judgements we see merit in, and which we couldn't care less about. ",

            "answer_text": "Judgement is a tricky word. You will have opinions about things and opinions come from having made a judgement. I think the word judgmental tends to have a negative connotation. But bottom line we do make judgements every day about everything. That is how we decided who we are, what we like etc... But I think you can still have an open mind as long as you do not believe that your judgements are the one and only way to think and no other way will suffice. As long as you are always willing to hear and consider and potentially change your decision and accept other options, you can be both. If you have decided that your judgements are right and everyone else's are wrong, period! Then, no. ",
