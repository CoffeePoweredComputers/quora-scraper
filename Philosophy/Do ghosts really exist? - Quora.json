            "answer_text": "Yes. I have had many many experiences with the afterlife\u2026but I will share a few with one. I must preface this by saying that while I have always been spiritual, I was not one to subscribe to the more \u2018fantastical\u2019 figures of Christianity. Specifically, Angels; the Angel of Death, Archangel, Michael. Angels with wings flying around the ethers, coming down to earth to bring comfort to the suffering. Angels in general seemed to cross the line from religion into fantasy for me. I remember as a small girl visiting an elderly women who was friends with my grandmother. She collected angel figurines, and while beautiful, I remember thinking, \u2018this crazy lady actually believes in Angels, weird.\u2019 A few years later; I was about 9/10 years old, I woke up very early that morning. The sun hadn\u2019t fully ascended the sky, but there was a soft blue glow outside my window\u2026enough light to see clearly, but still quite dark. While normally I would have just fallen back to sleep and waited for my mom to wake me for breakfast, I started to feel a sense of unease, a sense of a presence drawing my attention back to the window. So, I turned my head to face the window again and saw a figure standing just behind it. A tall, very dark figure who appeared cloaked in a black robe. I knew who he was right away as a sense, as a knowing. While he didn\u2019t frighten me, I was a pretty fearless child, I sensed his presence to be ominous and foreboding. The next day sometime in the early afternoon, we got a call that my step-fathers dad had passed away early that morning from a heart attack. I never said a word about what I had seen to anyone. Skip forward about 13 years. I was just rounding the corner near my house, driving home from a very late shift. At this point in my life I was working two jobs to make ends meet. In the evenings I worked as a cocktail waitress at an upscale nightclub so I would not make it home normally until after 3 am. Needless to say after a 16 hour work day, I was quite tired. I remember being deep in thought as I passed the stop sign, now only a block away from home. I was yawning and dreading my day as I knew my son would be up soon and his dad would be leaving for work at 6. As I reached my driveway, I began to feel a familiar sense of dread. The image of \u2018Death\u2019 popped into my head as I put on my blinker and began to to turn right into my driveway. As soon as I hit the gravel and gazed ahead I saw him, standing about 5 feet ahead of my parking space. I put my car in park and as of in a trance, I stared ahead. It was the exact same figure from years before. My headlights were on, yet instead of passing through the figure or illuminating it, the being seemed to absorb the light coming from my headlights. It sucked the light into it and the light simply disappeared. I gave myself a couple of pinches to make sure I was fully awake. I was. He just stood there in stillness and silence. 30 seconds later he simply faded away. Being tired, I decided to just go check on the baby and his dad and as long as they were okay, I didn't care what the being was there for. I went inside. The baby and his dad were fine, still sound asleep. I walked to the couch and plopped down on it and quickly fell fast asleep. A few hours later, I woke to the sound of my son crying and his dad talking hushed but panicked on the phone. I called out, \u2018bring me the, baby.\u2019 My sons dad shut the door, ignoring me. I knew something serious was happening, I knew someone had died. That someone was my sons paternal grandfather. Skip ahead now 5 years. My boyfriend and I had just been out to dinner. On our way home we decided to stop for some wine at the local convenient store just down the street from my house. I ran inside quickly and saw standing at the counter a very sick looking clerk. When it was my turn to pay, I asked her if she was feeling okay, she put her hand over her left ear and grimaced. I was a regular at this store and this clerk was usually very jovial and talkative, I was surprised to see her in such poor spirits. I said, \u2018do you have a toothache?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, I\u2019ve had this earache for weeks now. The doctors keep prescribing me antibiotics, but they aren\u2019t taking care of it.\u2019 I started to feel a very oppressive feeling of dread, same feeling as twice before, wash over me. I looked into her eyes and I knew, her eyes looked flat to me, lifeless. I grabbed her hand and kneeled myself over the counter top, \u2018leave right now and go to the ER, please, I will wait for someone to get here\u2026you need to go now.\u2019 She refused, she said that she planned to go as soon as her shift was over in a couple hours. I insisted, but it did nothing to sway her. I wished her well and reluctantly started walking towards the doors. I felt as though I was walking threw mud as I walked back to the car. I literally felt the sensation of walking through mud. I got into the car and looked worriedly at my boyfriend. I didn't say a word though as I started the car and began to back out of the parking space. I reversed from the space then stopped to put the car in drive and as I looked ahead\u2026there he was, standing beside the dumpster can outside the convenient store. I grabbed my boyfriends arm, \u2018Do you see him?\u2019 He looked ahead. \u2018Who?\u2019 he said as he looked around the parking lot. \u2018Beside the trash can?!\u2019 I said. He looked at me and laughed uncomfortably, \u2018No, I don't see anyone, was it a homeless dude?\u2019 I stayed there for a good half minute, the figure didn\u2019t fade\u2026I watched him as I began to drive off. When I turned out of the parking lot and onto the street I gazed into my rear view mirror and watched as the cloaked figure over 7ft tall turned its head in my direction and pointed a long Smokey arm towards the store\u2026\u2026 \u2018She is going to die,\u2019 I said. \u2018Who?\u2019 My boyfriend said in a concerned tone. \u2018The clerk.\u2019 I said. We drove in silence all the way back to the house and I parked. \u2018Who did you see by the trash can?\u2019 \u2026\u2019Death, I saw the Angel of Death.\u2019 A couple days later, I went into the store and asked the clerk there how the young woman was doing. He said, \u2018who?\u2019 \u2018I think her name is, Melissa? She was working Saturday night and had an earache.\u2019 He looked at me with a sad expression, \u2018Melissa died Sunday morning. Yeah, it\u2019s crazy\u2026she had an ear infection that spread to her brain. She went home after work and woke up speaking nonsense and her family rushed her to the hospital, but it was to late to save her.\u2019 Are ghosts real? Yes, they are, I\u2019ve seen my fair share of them in my lifetime. I don\u2019t know if Death is a ghost, or an Angel, but there are things on this earth that are hard to understand or explain\u2026but they are real. I think it may be interesting here to add that at some point in my late teens my father told me a few stories about my grandmother. My grandparents were Irish. They were Catholics, but believed in folklore; fairies and the like as some Irishman do. Apparently on several occasions my grandmother saw the Angel of Death. Once she was doing dishes after dinner and looked outside the kitchen window and saw the figure of Death. She turned to my grandfather and said, \u2018I knew it, your brother is dead.\u2019 She went for a walk one evening and returned home in time to run to the phone as it started ringing. Just before she picked it up, she said \u2018that\u2019s aunt (so-in-so), my cousin has passed.\u2019 Later that evening when my grandfather asked how she knew, she said, \u2018I saw that bastard on my walk, I don\u2019t care for the likes of him.\u2019 Maybe this is an inherited trait? Who knows! ***Sorry for poor editing. I typed this on my phone which is about to die and I don\u2019t have time to revise. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer that question, we have to leave the realm of the hard sciences and enter the muddy waters of theory, speculation, and (oftentimes) faith. At this point, there's no definitive way to scientifically prove ghosts are real, just as there's no way to prove God, angels, Satan, and demons are real. But just because something cannot be scientifically verified doesn't mean it isn't real. I can't go into a lab and perform a series of controlled experiments to show God exists -- and yet I still believe in Him.  Ghost hunting, therefore, must be classified as a pseudo-science. To answer your question, I'll delve into the theories that are generally held among paranormal investigators.  There are five basic kinds of hauntings: intelligent, residual, poltergeist, time warp, and demonic. The first three involve human energy, the fourth involves astrophysics, and the last...the last is just plain scary as hell. Literally.  1) Intelligent: A human (or sometimes an animal) dies, but their soul/energy doesn't move on to the afterlife (heaven, hell, purgatory, wherever their destination lies). There are many reasons as to why this might happen: a) The person doesn't know that they've died and they're just trying to live their lives as they've always done; b) The person died in a strange or violent manner and they're just pissed or unsatisfied or sad about what happened to them, hanging around until they feel vindicated; c) The person is frightened about moving on, usually because their final destination is hell; d) The person chooses to stay around to watch over family members or a location that's important to them, or they're attached to an object; e) The person just plain got STUCK, for lack of a better word. They don't want to be here at all, but they don't know how to move on. Intelligent hauntings can have patterns that they repeat, but they're not eternally wedded to those patterns. If their energy is strong enough, they can be seen in varying levels of transparent and opaque forms, they can move objects, or speak. Hunters theorize that spirits can drain energy from the atmosphere around them (creating the tell-tale temperature drop), from living humans, or from electrical equipment (hunters ALWAYS have extra batteries with them, since a ghost can take a new battery and drain it dead in a matter of minutes). 2) Residual: The soul of the dead human isn't actually there. Their energy was \"recorded\" in a certain location and, every so often, certain actions are replayed. Maybe they died violently, releasing strong energy into the area. Maybe they performed a task so many times that they've left a permanent impression, like a crevasse on an old mattress. Maybe the materials around them are good at soaking up energies -- paranormal theory states that different substances, like stone or quartz, are better at holding those energies. Residual hauntings also explain why several places can be haunted by the same person; they're not actually there. It's just a faint leftover of the person that's remained. 3) Poltergeists: Hunters can be split on these. Some say they're actual spirits, others contend that all poltergeist activity is unknowingly caused by a human being with untapped telekinetic abilities (usually a child or adolescent who's under great amounts of stress). These hauntings are often very frightening. Objects get thrown or destroyed. People are attacked. Eerie sounds are heard. The sounds are what give this haunting its name: \"poltergeist\" is German for \"noisy spirit\".  4) Time Warp: It's just a jump to the left... (Sorry, I couldn't resist.) The time warp hypothesis theorizes (to paraphrase Doctor Who) that time isn't a strict progression of cause and effect, but rather a \"ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey...stuff\". In time warp hauntings, a window has formed in the fourth dimension, and what you're seeing isn't a ghost -- it's a living person, in their own time, doing whatever they're doing. Heck, maybe they can see you, too. Maybe they think YOU'RE the ghost! 5) Demonic: These are the \"drop everything and call a priest NOW\" hauntings. The spirits aren't human, and they've never BEEN human. They're dark, harmful beings who wish to cause as much trauma as possible, through oppression, splitting families apart, etc., up to and sometimes including influencing humans to harm/kill others or taking full possession of a human. These forces involve a realm that we will never fully understand and that we reaaaalllly should NOT be messing with. Do NOT invite a spirit to use your energy. Do NOT mess with Ouija or spirit boards. Do NOT participate in seances. Oftentimes (if contact is made), a demon will masquerade as a friendly spirit, and use the connection that's made as a conduit into our realm. (I point to the haunted doll Annabelle: although in \"The Conjuring\" and in her own film, the doll was very scary-looking, in reality, she's a harmless-looking Raggedy Ann doll. Ed and Lorraine Warren really did investigate this case and made the call that the so-called \"ghost\" that called itself Annabelle was actually a demonic spirit that was using the doll as a conduit to get at the human owners. Annabelle, to this day, resides in the Warren's macabre museum of haunted or cursed objects, locked away in a blessed glass case that bears a sign that reads, \"Do not open ever\", or something to that effect.) Don't mess with demons. You can't get rid of them with your own plucky willpower. They respond to holy authority and fear God.  So...that was the long answer to a very short question. A crash course in ghosts, if you will! I hope I was helpful and not too long-winded... ",
