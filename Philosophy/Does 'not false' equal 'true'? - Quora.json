            "answer_text": "A2A - Does \"not false\" equal \"true\"? Only in a true/false dichotomy. (Where those are the only choices.) Reality is not a true/false dichotomy. In such cases as statements without a truth value (Think of nonsense or incomplete statements.) or statements that form contradictions or paradoxes, or subjective truths.  Examples:3+7 (provides no truth value, it's incomplete)I be brought drink eight banana symphony. (provides no truth value, it's nonsense)This statement is not true. (if it is true, then it can't be true, a paradox)Vincent Van Gogh is the greatest artist. (It's not true for everyone, but it could be true for someone.) ",

            "answer_text": "No. Allow me to explain by example.  2 + 2 = red This statement is not true, but it is also not false; it is simply nonsense. For a statement to be false, it needs to fall within logical restrictions. Red is completely unrelated to the summation of 2 and 2, so the equation can only be characterized as absurd. Below are two examples of false statements. 2 + 2 = 3 red = blue These statements are both not true and false, because their structures are logically coherent, that is to say, each comprised part is of the same related form. If you want an axiomatic defense of this, I would reference the following: Two things that are entirely unrelated to one another cannot be said to be the cause of either. ",
