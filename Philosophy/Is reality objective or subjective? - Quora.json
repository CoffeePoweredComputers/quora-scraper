            "answer_text": "It mainly depends on what you mean by the word reality. People often lead themselves into confusion when they use their ordinary loose definition of reality to analyze philosophical questions which require more precision. Here is a first clue : The notion of objective reality did not always exist. Below is a rough sketch of the order of events leading to objective truth : Brains evolve and begin to model the world (objective-reality)Animals eventually learn to model themselves as part of the world (subjective-reality)Humans gradually realize they can make mistakes (the human brain models itself modeling the world).The notion of truth emerges as one of the objects modeled by the brain.By comparing notes with other people, in an effort to reduce mistaken beliefs, humans gradually create the concept of objective-truth.By trial and error scientific methods refine the concept of objective-truth.Here is a more detailed answer : At first the question seems difficult because of the tension between the 3 keywords that make up the question. Sometimes reality gets confused with truth and the same goes for the word objective. But with the help of an example, the meanings of the terms objective-reality and subjective-reality can be sorted out properly. Objective-reality is that which can be reliably shared among many minds. Objective truth means that you rigorously test if the fact can be repeated and always comes out the same for many different observers. By doing that, you are removing the subjectivity from the observation in order to obtain a rule of thumb that works reliably for anyone (that is, anyone able to apply the rule properly). Example: Stare at an inverted-color flag for 20 seconds and then stare at a blank wall. You will see the flag in complementary colors. Although you know its an optical illusion, you are nonetheless seeing an object, but nobody else can see that object (its an after-image). So in this case, the meaning of subjective-reality is clear.  But what is happening when you view the actual flag with the inverted colors ? Are you then seeing objective-reality ? If you answer yes, you are confusing the map with the territory. In both cases, there are brain processes that represent a flag which causes you to see a flag at a specific location in the world. In the case of the actual flag, objective-reality is constantly reinforcing the subjective-reality you perceive. In the case of an after-image, objective-reality does not reinforce the after-image (the flag appears blurry and its existence is not confirmed by others). You can never directly engage with objective reality. You always engage reality via a map (actually a model represented in your brain processes). You never get to compare notes directly with the territory (objective-reality) to see if the map is accurate. However, the methods of science are the most reliable ways of correcting errors in your map. Objective truth is constructed by rigorously combining subjective truths. ",

            "answer_text": "Which reality? The egocentric story we create for ourselves, or the one we are subject to the whims of? Obviously one of these is subjective, the other objective. What is not obvious is the difference between the two. The ego is \u201cme\u201d. It tells a very convincing story. How can I decide whether it's true, or not? I can do it scientifically of course, by looking for evidence that contradicts the story. The ego encourages us to seek only positive evidence. We miss out on critical facts that might change our minds about reality. Is the reality we perceive in accordance with the evidence presented? The ego weaves a tangled tale around it. When the evidence discredits our stories we must understand why. We cannot ignore the counterexamples. Observing objective reality objectively can be painful because it exposes all the dire mistakes we have made, and continue to make. The ego feels threatened when its mistakes are exposed, and rebels against this with all it has. The resulting anger or confusion is a sign that something is amiss. Following the anger to the bottom of the issue, instead of running away from it, is important. The anger is a clue to where we have gone wrong. It points to the fact that we are putting ourselves in danger. Confusion points to lies perpetrated upon us because we are susceptible. We have to understand these things to avoid going astray in the future. Document everything and analyze it objectively, without expectations. Allowing the ego to weave a new story around facts is the easiest thing to do. Some \u201ctruth\u201d needs to be discarded and replaced with an alternate explanation. The ego is skilled at this and will come up with something reasonable if asked. Unfortunately, the only truth is that any explanation still could be wrong. It does not serve us well to cling too tightly to anything we want to believe. Tightly held beliefs will blind you to the truth. Whether our theories about life are true or not is completely irrelevant in the moment we act on them. The outcome of our actions can never be predicted with 100% accuracy from what we know or could possibly know. Allowing the ego to decide our actions makes this even less likely. We must allow the facts to decide our actions. When we let the ego convince us to deny certain facts, life gets more complicated for a reason \u2014 because our subjective reality is no longer the truth. We have to act from here and now, without assumptions, to create the best possible outcome. Aligning subjective reality to what we can objectively observe is a worthy pursuit and simplifies your life immensely. It is not easy to do. ",
