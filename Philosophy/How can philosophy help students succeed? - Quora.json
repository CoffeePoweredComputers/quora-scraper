I can tell you that I saw people (including me) growing thanks to philosophy. Philosophy gives you the tools to put exact words on your thoughts, to develop your way of thinking. Not everyone is sensitive to this, but personaly I grew up so much this year thanks to this ! Philosophy no only help students, it help people as a whole to grow up as human beings. ",
