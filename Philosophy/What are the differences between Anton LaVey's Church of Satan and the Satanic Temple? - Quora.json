            "answer_text": "The two organizations are very different in a number of ways. Panos Shady's answer is horribly misinformed about \u201ctheir ideas aligning definitely\u201d so I\u2019ll attempt to clarify exactly how the two differ. First, their common ground. Both the Church of Satan (CoS) and The Satanic Temple (TST) are atheist religions, meaning they don\u2019t believe in, let alone worship, a literal Satan. The Church of Satan: The CoS was created in the late 1960s when Anton LaVey wrote The Satanic Bible, the main corpus of text for the group. Philosophically, the group embraces hedonism and ethical egoism, and draws on writings like Ayn Rand, Might is Right by Ragnar Redbeard, and some readings of Nietzsche. While not believing in a literal Satan, the CoS does believe in the supernatural, as the Satanic Bible teaches a range of magical rituals and their supposed effects.I would argue that the CoS to a large extent defines itself in contrast to the Christian church and sees itself as a kind of anti-Christianity. See for instance The Nine Satanic Statements - \u201cSatan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek\u201d etc. The CoS sees Christianity as something that hinders man in achieving his true potential, and sees Satan as a sort of \u2018antidote\u2019 to this. The Satanic Temple: The Satanic Temple was created in 2014, and does not have one single central written work, but a canon depicting their view of Satan as a narrative construct of rebellion against dogmatic thought. This canon includes works by Milton, Blake, Anatole France etc. Philosophically, TST emphasizes rationalism, personal freedom, and compassion. You can go and read their Central Tenets to learn more, but here are some relevant excerpts: \u201cOne should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason\u201d, \u201cOne\u2019s body is inviolable, subject to one\u2019s own will alone\u201d, \u201cBeliefs should conform to our best scientific understanding of the world\u201d.TST values highly secularism and personal freedom, and often picks a fight when either is threatened, especially if by the Christian church, which according to TST holds an inappropriate position of power in general, and in the US in particular. TST sees Satan as the picture of rebellion against power exerted by dominant, dogmatic thought, and uses this in concrete political campaigns e.g. for reproductive rights for women or against violent punishment to schoolchildren. The differences: Hopefully, some differences are already quite clear by now. As an organization, the CoS is much older, although the canon of TST extends way back to the 17th century, and some of their imagery, such as the Baphomet or black masses, are much older. The CoS believes in magic, whereas TST rejects any supernatural beliefs, as those don\u2019t conform to our best scientific understanding of the world cf. their central tenets. Ethically, the CoS preaches selfishness/ethical egoism, whereas TST values compassion and explicitly rejects the ethical viewpoints of the CoS.What mainly grinds my gears about the CoS is the blatant sexism in The Satanic Bible, in which Lavey recommends for instance using a table for rituals only if one does not a naked woman to play the role of the table handy. He also, in all seriousness, uses stereotypes like \u201cwoman is nature\u2019s passive receiver.\u201d Compare with TST which is fighting for gender equality and even includes a \u201csatanic feminism\u201d logo in their newsletters:  ",

            "answer_text": "In answer to your question let me first say that the two previous answers are crap. The Church of Satan was the first legally recognized institution of true Satanic thought and practice. Founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey the Church of Satan embraces such core principles such as self deification instead of spiritual slavery and indulgence of life here and now rather than wishful thinking of something better later. The Satanic Temple is an institute founded upon more humanistic rather than Satanic beliefs, beliefs like compassion and equality for all. They try to use Satan as the rebellious character who ironically rebels against the very things that make up true Satanism such as inequality, self preservation, and undefiled wisdom. The Church of Satan encourages it's members to live their lives to the fullest and to avoid complaining about things that they need not subject themselves whereas the Satanic Temple is about changing the world through blown out campaigns bound for media attention. True Satanism is about rationalism and realism and no matter how much hype one throws in front of a camera no amount of campaigning or protesting is going to change the world to the will of the Satanist, especially considering that Satanism is about individuality and not all Satanists think alike or agree on every topic. So while others who parade themselves as Satanists are out trying to make the world a better more equally justified place for all I will be out living and enjoying the part of the world that affects me and me alone.
