            "answer_text": "I knew the answer to this in a split-second. I\u2019d give it to my little brother. Now, lets assume that the serum will last 1 hour. I get my parents, give the serum to my little brother, and get him to confess all the stupid, annoying, and bad stuff that he did to me on purpose and all the rules he broke that ended up getting me in trouble because he didn\u2019t want the punishment and I couldn\u2019t defend myself. If you are wondering why I would give it to my brother to make him confess this stuff, he lies constantly to give others punishments for what he did. On top of that, he will break rules, ignore common sense, and completely disrespect and ignore others to get what he wants. Especially if it gets him out of trouble scratch-free. His thought is \u201cEye for an Eye, but if I did it first you can\u2019t do it to me\u201d. On top of that, my parents don\u2019t let me speak to defend myself. I really hope my dad sees this and shares it with my mom, as apparently the only wrong my brother does in their eyes would be stuff that could hurt or kill someone. I\u2019m sick of his lying BS and getting into trouble because of him. ",

And, prior to the event, I would encourage him to arrange for his own people, people that he trusted to be in the studio and film right along side the ones that I would have there. And, wth, someone to film the filmers. There would be no way that he could them say that the film etc. wasn\u2019t an accurate portrayal of the interview. He probably would anyway, but it would be pretty hard to deny\u2026 ",
