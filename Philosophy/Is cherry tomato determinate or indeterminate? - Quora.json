            "answer_text": "Cherry tomatoes are most often indeterminate plants. However, there are some determinate cherry tomato varieties. Seed companies often won\u2019t explicitly label a cherry tomato variety as determinate/indeterminate because there is a general assumption that they are indeterminate plants. If a cherry tomato is a determinate plant, then that will usually be explicitly noted in the growing information. So if the growing information doesn\u2019t specify the type, then most often you can assume that a cherry tomato plant is indeterminate. But if you know the variety name, you can usually search it online, and get much more detailed information than the seed providers give you in their catalogs or on their packets. ",
