            "answer_text": "Non-moral actions are whatever you do alone or consensually with someone else, it\u2019s a matter of freedom. Morality is negative, it is always a restriction against some actions, leaving you free to do everything else. So immoral actions are stealing, murdering, etc. You can do anything but these actions. Then there is the \u201cpositive\u201d morality, like you should pay taxes or you will go to jail, or you must believe in a certain kind of God, or you will go to Hell. That is a fake, corrupt morality. It is impossible to prove logically, because it never applies to everyone. If it applied to everyone, you could just tax the government people right back and keep your money. Yes, there are virtuous actions that are highly desirable, but they are not moral, which means, you cannot be punished for not donating to charity, not helping others, etc. These must stay as a part of freedom to be better if you want to.

            "answer_text": "A non-moral action would be something like a snowfall or an earthquake or an eclipse of the moon or a snake eating a rat. Morality does not apply to an entity that does not survive by a code of morality. Man must create and live by a code of morality, therefore every action an individual man takes is either in support of his goals (moral) or against them (immoral). Now, you might ask, is a bank robber acting morally on the grounds that acquiring a large amount of money will improve his life? No because he will have to hide out for the rest of his life, avoiding capture and imprisonment. That\u2019s not going to benefit his life. Robbing a bank (or any action that harms others) is immoral, because those harmed people are going to seek retribution!
