            "answer_text": "Monitoring and evaluation are part of the control process. So, to have successful monitoring and evaluation you first need to define a reference value, or standard value that is used as a benchmark. Afterwards, you need to define allowed deviation (usually in percentages) or the allowed marginal values above and below the benchmark. When your results are above or below standard value it means that you are performing differently than expected or that there are anomalies in the system. ",
