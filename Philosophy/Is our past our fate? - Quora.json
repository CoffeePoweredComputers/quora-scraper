            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a really cool question. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with determinism, I recommend you read into it. It\u2019s some really interesting stuff. I think that who we are as people is shaped by our experiences (our past). And who we are as people determines how we act in the present. So I suppose our past is our fate, because our future is determined by how we act. ",

            "answer_text": "Fate refers to an explanation for our current experiences in life. There are usually three explanations for this: 1 It was so determined/written by God right at the beginning of time. It is known as kismet , taqdeer , talai-ezhuttu, que-sera-sera, etc. in other languages. 2 It is the result of what we did in the past: As you sow, so you rep. 3. It is the consequence of what we did in a previous incarnation/birth/janma. Pick whatever seems convincing to you. What matters, however, is how you behave now, no matter what landed you here.
