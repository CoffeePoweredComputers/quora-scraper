            "answer_text": "Given how this word consciousness is being used in every day discourse, it seems it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing to define it as simply as one can: Consciousness is a vital function performed by a vital organ, the brain. It is as prosaic as liver chemistry; they both work to keep the body alive and intact for as long as possible. This view of consciousness should be self evident but it is obscured by the forceful effect of civilization on this cognitive function which affects our thinking about it. Consciousness is basically the act of scanning for signals and then focusing the attention on those relevant to survival. This primordial function has been profoundly affected by the drastic changes in our natural environment. In addition to the advent of civilization and technology and their effect on what our consciousness focuses on, we have learned how to repurpose our survival oriented original consciousness for the entertainment value in it. Ingesting certain chemicals, prolonged drumming, chanting, swaying, complicated repetitive ritualistic motions with odd postures, dance, enduring ordeals, and the trick we learned from the days when we were hunters, sitting absolutely still for extended periods of time and how sometimes the interior of the mind falls silent and the whole world appears to light up from within\u2026 Originally and still to some extent, consciousness is a vigilant sentinel, a watchful lookout on behalf of the body with the brain that performs this task. But we have drugged ourselves, one way or another, into a very strange state of mind, and now we are lost in our thought streams, filled with words, images, memories, moods and fantasies. Now we think consciousness is this wondrous, marvelous, miraculous, unique phenomenon when it is just another body function, an evolved adaptation to being forced to navigate a hostile and sometimes opportunity rich environment.

            "answer_text": "I suspect that my existence is a series of layers of consciousness. I estimate that I have about 23,000 layers of consciousness. Each day that I wake up from the unconsciousness of sleep I have a flood of memories from previous consciousnesses. In addition to those there have been a few episodes of unconsciousness resulting from trauma or illness. I remember some but quite obviously not all of the previous layers of consciousness stretching back to about age 5 but I have absolutely no memories of any consciousnesses prior to my birth. ",
