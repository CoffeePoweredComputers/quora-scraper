            "answer_text": "If you are referring to spiritual truth and purity, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m ill-suited to answer your question since I am an agnostic.  Spiritual truth has more to do with faith rather than verifiable facts.  That does not mean that spiritual truth cannot also be scientific truth.  Spiritual purity is freedom from immorality. If you are referring to more substantial truth and purity, I must respond scientifically.  In this regard, truth is often taken to be something that is in accord to fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard.  It may also refer to \u201ctruth to self\u201d, or authenticity.  According to the dictionary, purity is freedom from contamination or adulteration (the addition of something inferior to something else). ",
