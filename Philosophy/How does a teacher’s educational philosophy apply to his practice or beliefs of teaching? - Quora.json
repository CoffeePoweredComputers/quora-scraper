            "answer_text": "How does it not? Educational philosophy and practice blur into each other. I'm sure for many teachers they are the same thing. So many of the people in the US school system are socialist are progressive. You can call that a philosophy but every second of the day, such teachers will be mixing socialism with practice. If a system or a philosophy is accepting, many teachers will be full-time socialists on the job. People think this is the norm. Unfortunately, it has become the norm in many of our colleges and other schools.* Thing get more interesting, and clearer, when the teacher\u2019s practice seems to be at variance with the philosophy. Then you can clearly see what's what. (*Something very revealing just happened at Princeton in the last week. The president had made a big push against what he called \"systemic racism.\" He said that Princeton was full of this. You see, he thought this was normal speech. Liberals think they can just chatter along because all good liberals assume the same truths and premises. Did you see the problem yet? What do you think happened? Well, it was big enough to gain national coverage. The Secretary of Education announced that Princeton was guilty of systemic racism, by confession of the president, and Princeton was therefore lying when its marketing materials claimed there was no racism, and when Princeton applied to the government for grants based on not having any racism! We're talking about millions of dollars here. All this because the president got sloppy. I've been critical of this president because he is too eager to jump on various bandwagons. I think a great university should stand back from, and above, the current fads, slogans, sophistries, and marketing clich\u00e9s. I wish he had, for his own good, and the good of Princeton. Probably everybody on the planet has got some racism in their heart. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. Could we eliminate all that racism if we tried? What some call racism, others call self-pride or national pride. These questions are not simple. A great university can live with complexity. That's how you know you're a real intellectual.) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cPhilosophy\u201d is too broad a subject to produce a simple product. Montessori or Dewey really believed in a philosophy, which really impacted the very meaning of teaching, but that\u2019s been lost in the last few decades. Now, most \u201cphilosophy\u201d of education reflects rants like standardized tests, hours per subject, seat time or libraries or laboratories. All those rants defer, delay, or deny the purpose of education which is more \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d than \u201cwhat\u201d is the answer. And that \u201clack of philosophy\u201d itself obscures those far more consequential questions ignored by the tests-of-today or the class-time structure of our schools as they now are. Fortunately, the pandemic is undermining that ignorance with a resource far richer than most educators can imagine. \u201cVirtual\u201d classrooms are no less \u201creal\u201d than kids in rows for hours of listening. And teacher and student complaints ignore the underlying \u201cphilosophy\u201d that teaching is the same as distributing information, because it never really was that simple. Real teaching is inspiring new knowledge in new places about new ideas. The failure of most schools and colleges to recognize how simple - if not easy - those \u201csolutions\u201d could be underscores the failure of the \u201cinnovations\u201d of the 1960\u2019s when we \u201cdiscovered\u201d computer-based testing could produce data - even if those data were useless for anything other than answers to multiple choice questions. That failure was obscured by greedy testing companies, and naive teacher unions, and displaced the essays and projects that once marked the productivity of thinking new ideas in new ways and applying new techniques to \u201csolve\u201d problems often obscured by loads of tradition. Focusing \u201cinstruction\u201d on \u201cmemory\u201d ignores the really obvious fact that computers have better memories than people, and people create more than imitate knowledge. ",
