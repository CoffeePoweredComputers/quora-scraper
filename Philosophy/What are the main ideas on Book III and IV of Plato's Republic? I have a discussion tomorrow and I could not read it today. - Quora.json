            "answer_text": "Translated from Greek\u2026 but i wonder how you are going to mage to speak about that if you dont know about the books before them\u2026 In the first part (books 2-4) Socrates answers by attempting an analogy between the righteous soul and the righteous state. It initially constitutes the ideal state, in which it distinguishes three social classes: on the one hand those who are engaged in economic activities and on the other the guards of the city, which are ultimately divided into the class of warriors and the class of rulers-the pre-eminent guards. The warrior class must possess Valor, the Lords wisdom, and the happiness of the state is based on the Concord/prudence that prevails among the three classes when the productive class and the Warriors accept the authority of the Lords. On this very basis justice is defined as the preoccupation of each class with its own occupations, without seeking to interfere in the work of the other classes. Returning to the human soul, Socrates also distinguishes in it three parts, the desirous, the thymic, and the rational. The virtue of the rational part is wisdom, of the thymic courage, and mental unity is based on the recognition of the power of the rational. Thus the analogy with the city is established, and, correspondingly, justice is attained when each part of the soul does its proper work without interfering with the works of others. Righteous deeds are simply a consequence of this harmony. ... to be engaged in one's own business and not to meddle in many things is justice. (433a) Having identified Justice, Socrates intends, according to his original plan, to contrast injustice in the soul and the city (Book 5). However, the interlocutors involved setting two demands: on the one hand, of seeking to insist on the issues of organization of the fair state which was present in the original description (412b-427c), and in particular on innovative posts on the commonality between the guards, the abolition of the institution of the family and equal participation of women in martial pursuits and the governance of the city-a request which Socrates meets on the following pages (451c-471b). On the other hand, the question arises as to the feasibility of the planned state. Socrates replies with the ground-breaking position that the ideal state is attainable as long as philosophers rule or political rulers become philosophers (473d). If philosophers do not become kings in cities, or those who are now called Kings and oppressors, they do not philosophize as much as is necessary, in a way that coincides with the same person and power and philosophy ... it is impossible, My Friend Glaucon, that evil should cease in the cities and throughout, I think, the human race, nor that it should spring up so long as it is possible and see the light of the sun and this state which we have now laid out its plan. (473c-e) The rest of the book and 6-7 books are devoted to supporting and developing this position, where Socrates shows why philosophers will govern well and it is feasible to rule (473c-502c), as well as how guardians should be trained and exercised to rule as philosophers (502c-541b). Thus, he clarifies how he means the philosopher, clarifying both the object of knowledge, and the cognitive process. It contrasts in the changing world of the senses the real objects of knowledge, the immutable ideas (475e-480a, 523a-525c). It presents the idea of good as the highest object of philosophical knowledge, using images that culminate in the Allegory of the cave (514a-517c), where the relationship of human beings with the idea of good is likened to the relationship of chained people facing the bottom of a cave with the sun shining outside. Access to the idea of good is the culmination of a long-term education of the guards, where their initial musical and gymnastic education (which has already been presented in the original books: 375b-412b) is framed with arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, harmonics and continues with dialectics .
