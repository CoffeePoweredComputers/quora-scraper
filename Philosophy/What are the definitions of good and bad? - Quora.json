            "answer_text": "Good and bad, wrong and right, and all other ways of setting one thing above another are the result of our moral brain. Clearly all the rules are not yet installed when we are born, so the culture we grow up in will determine how we categorize things in good or bad, wrong or right, tasteful or tasteless,\u2026 The main moral centers in our brain are fairness, empathy/caring, honor/status and moral order. The clearest definitions of good and bad are provided by our fairness system and this is developed at very early age (9 year old). The justice system focuses mainly on fairness, because retribution or restitution are concepts of fairness. Philosophers try to create a moral system that is ethical and that maximizes well-being. Some of these philosophers focus so much on a small part of our morality that they create a subset that we call an ideology. It is the amplification of some essential facets of our morality to lift them above all other aspects. Things that are considered good in one ideology can therefor be considered bad in another one. Politics will have to find a balance between these ideas. Religion tries to claim morality, but the result is mostly very unethical (Judaism, Islam,\u2026). A lot of effort has been made by Christian Theologians to incorporate as much wisdom as possible from the Greek Philosophers, but also here, the result is quite mixed and on some points blatantly unethical. Religion build very strongly on the moral order system, thereby putting god above man, man above woman, hetero above gay, religious above atheist, man above nature, \u2026 This is why religion incites intolerance and why theocracies have punishment for things that are related to moral order. We could say religion is bad, because it kills individual rights and obstructs the creation of the civilized ethics the world really needs. ",
