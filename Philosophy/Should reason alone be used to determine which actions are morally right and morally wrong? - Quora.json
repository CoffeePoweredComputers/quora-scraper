            "answer_text": "We must refer to a higher standard such as natural law that is universal, objective, and timeless. What was wrong is wrong and always will be wrong everywhere for everyone! Morals are not found by reason or by verdict or vote but by appealing to the same Judge or God. If there is no God, than morals cannot be made universal and are merely relative and moral relativism rules. Dostoevsky said, \u201cIf there is no God, all things are permissible.\u201d Kant said that God must exist for ethics to be possible. God has designed man with a conscience to be sensitive to moral issues (cf. Rom. 2:14\u201315). ",
