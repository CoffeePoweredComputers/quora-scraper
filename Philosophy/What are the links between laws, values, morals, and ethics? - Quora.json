            "answer_text": "First, we should define each term. Law is the official body of written legislation that permits, enables, protects, or restricts some behavior or activity, or provides formal procedure under certain events and conditions. Values are ways of prioritizing certain directives or goals over others. Morality is what individuals feel to be right or wrong, just or unjust. Ethics is where our morality meets, and it is not personal but universal. We use our values to define our morality. Our morality is refined and forms the basis of ethics. Ethics is the foundation of law. So law represents all three things, but it represents ethics before morality, and morality before values. Individuals have values and moral codes that differ from one another that the law does not necessarily protect or interfere with. Some things it does - for example, keeping the peace is a value we all desire, but is it unethical to be noisy? Some may not believe that is it, yet most municipalities enforce noise ordinances. Is it ethically correct to give someone a ticket if they committed an infraction? Sure. However, it is not mandatory to give tickets. Officers and judges are given discretion to throw out tickets if they feel that it is the morally correct thing to do, such as in cases where the violator is struggling with money and the ticket is something that is difficult for them to afford, or if they feel the violator has already learned the value of obeying the law. Typically, however, law only deals with ethics, and seeks to establish order and provide justice in cases of wrongdoing. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is surprisingly simple: The basics of a society are the moral values. Define the moral values of what makes a society. All laws should be in line with these moral values. However, if two conflicting moral values are the basis of a society, then every thing becomes a mess. This is simply explained as follows: laws and rules will be conflicting as well because they refer to conflicting moral values. Conflicts takes energy out of a society, and lead to a waste of energy, and even destruction. Therefore in order to have a society which is able to reach the highest level of wealth and happiness (since wealth is a requirement for happiness), the moral values should not be in conflict . This is exactly the problem with all Western democracies: there are two sets of conflicting moral values: one one hand every person has the right to its own body, its own life and the fruits of his own labor. On the other side every person is slave of the State or people who rule the state: a state can take the life, the body and any property of every person at any moment (the condition is that a law is declared). This conflict is engraved in the so -called Universal Declaration of Human Rights. ",
