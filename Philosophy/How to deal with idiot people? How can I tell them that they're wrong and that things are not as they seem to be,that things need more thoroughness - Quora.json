            "answer_text": "Question: How can I deal with idiot people? How can I tell them that they're wrong and that things are not as they seem to be,that things need more thoroughness? Question Details: People are just so irrational and they don\u2019t see that. They never look for the validity of things. I feel so bad since no one understands me. Also, what kills me is that people are so confident and fiery about their stupid arguments, making me look like I\u2019m the stupid one. I\u2019m going to say something that you might not want to hear. You ready? Okay. How you are feeling about other people is how many of those so-called \u2018stupid\u2019 people feel about you. I am not joking. Everybody over-estimates or over-states his/her own importance. You can read more on this here: Dunning\u2013Kruger effect - Wikipedia. According to Wikipedia, the Dunning-Kruger effect is: \u201c. . . a cognitive bias in which low-ability individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability as much higher than it really is.\u201d Now, I am not trying to condemn you or anyone else. I am merely highlighting that this is how everybody, or at least most people (you, me, and most people you will ever interact with) think on their own abilities. And we experience it all the time. \u201cMy religion is true because I observed it so much that I know,\u201d \u201cMy sports team is the correct one,\u201d \u201cMy football skills are the best,\u201d \u201cI am the best reader,\u201d \u201cMy thinking is the most critical,\u201d and I can go on more and more. Your question proves this point, where you typed \u201c. . . people are so confident and fiery about their stupid arguments, making me look like I\u2019m the stupid one.\u201d Do you not see the hypocrisy in typing this in your details? Their arguments are stupid, but yours are totally rational? Try being honest with yourself. Are your arguments really that rational? Have you never once used the strawman fallacy, where you misrepresent somebody\u2019s argument or misinterpret what is written to fight against rather than the actual argument? Or what about the ad hominem, where you insult somebody\u2019s characteristics that are not part of the discussion? If you\u2019re religious, then how about the God of the Gaps, where you claim that something we are ignorant upon must be responsible for that thing we are ignorant upon? This is also part of the argument from ignorance, a fallacy where someone claims something about something we are ignorant upon that has very little or no evidence for it. Have you ever told anyone anything in a debate that you had no way to substantiating? Congratulations, you committed a logical fallacy and are not as logical as you see yourself as! My point in this is to address your statement about how you are more logical than others when, in fact, you might just be over-stating your own importance. Now, to perhaps help you on the matter of convincing others to think like you, many books have been written on this matter. However, the best way to convince others, for me at least, is the usage of basic logic in a debate. Does it work? Not all the time, but I avoid discussions with people I consider irrational due to the use of many fallacious arguments in a debate. Hence, I recommend, in order to help you debate others, to obtain a basic knowledge of basic logic and perhaps a greater knowledge in philosophy since most arguments you are in will probably be philosophical.

            "answer_text": "Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz shares with his students a strategy for successfully defending cases. If the facts are on your side, Dershowitz says, pound the facts into the table. If the law is on your side, pound the law into the table. If neither the facts nor the law are on your side, pound the table. In the case of argument, emphasize on facts or logics or both, bcoz these two are very effective tools to slap people in their face if they have neither but still insist that they are right. In other case, it may be that you have the facts or logics but the way you express your ideas is unclear or inefficient that others may think that you are just making stuff up. But if you have no such problem as mentioned above, then the real question is, who is pounding the table? You? Or the people you argue with? If you are not the one pounding the table but yet the people you argue with are being stubbron, just ignore them, I doubt you would gain anything out of the argument, don't waste your time. Hope I kind of answer your question ",
