            "answer_text": "Yes. A truth makes you free only if you accept it. The freedom comes with acceptation of any truth or reality you are involved in. In the acceptance of the truth you are no more ignorance and you are free. Think in this terms: you love playing with fire, you love to feel its heat around you but you get burnt all the time. You feel pain but you are so involved emotionally with the fire that you do not understand that the fire is the thing which make you suffer. You are blind. Recognizing and accepting that the fire is the bringer of pleasure and pain both makes you free, because now it is your choice, now you know. Your suffering is no more blind and you have control over it. Then you choose. The will was not free, was blind wanting the fire without knowing the fire. Now the will is free, it is a choice. ",

That's all that the null hypothesis helps us do.Revelation is someone's story.  Convinced maybe, but a story, still. Language only works in the real world if it has the capacity for ambiguity, otherwise it would freeze like ice. So where would we get to if we unpacked your question in terms of what the words mean? My take:'truth' = dictum = dogma; a policy commitment'accept' = commit to?/ act as if real'free' = untroubled?   I've been told that 'grass' has a similar impact.   <3  ^  ^ ",

I'd much rather think in terms of how precise and complete your image of something is and if you see it in the right perspective or not. If you manage to do that well, you can be said to be close to the truth. In that case, working to better something or to stop something bad from happening, you will not be automatically successful but at least you will not be hindered by a wrong image of things. ",
