            "answer_text": "As said i would define him as a false prophet. Either that or God is just plain stupid\u2026 No Good God makes a religion, send a prophet (this is from a muslim point of view) to bring peace to the world, to teach Gods Word of peace, just to 600 years later send another prophet to start 73 wars durings his lifetime only\u2026 No Good God would say to David: You can not build My temple. You have blood on your hands. Build a temple on blood and IT Will always share blood in war - just to 1500 years later (or something like that) say: Oh Go ahead! Leta kill some people and build an entire new religion on IT. No good God would give the warning signs in the bible of the false prophet, just to let a true one do everything that the bible says is the signs of the false prophet. Even IF the bible was corrupted, God would choose another way to present the scripture to Muhammad. (See Gal 1:6\u20139 for example) If Muhammad had accually read the injeel, and not listens so Much on gnostic preachers, he would never had Done the things he did. He was not stupid, he would have understod that this would not make people believe in him. That is Why he needed to get violent i believe because the frustration of the jews and christians not believing in him. I do see his confusion though. Living in that age, with preachers everywhere in the Market places, preaching different stories depending on your \u201c\"faith-group\u201d, and we all know what power can do to a man who wants IT but doesnt get IT\u2026 ",

That is the only way to know you truly believe in Christianity. I am a Christion but do not agree whole heartly with any denomination. I study and with the help of the Holy Spitit Make my own decision. God did not intend for us to follow any man or woman without questioning them. ",

There are so many prophets talked about now a days and most preachers and such on television and in churches are teaching false doctrines ! Unless you need to study the about prophets for school or something then your best bet is to read the - King James version of the bible or a study bible and it will tell you what you need to know ! The only opinion that really matters in the end is yours ! Good luck ! Thanks ",
