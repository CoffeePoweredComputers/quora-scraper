            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll be a little cynical, and wager that Prof. Peter Schuller has imbibed entirely too much Derrida. Who is always better in the original, albeit just as obscure. While the intimate details of the philosophies of these three thinkers are often difficult to nail down, we can set out some general ideas. Socrates was a mendicant (voluntarily poor) philosopher (469\u2013399 BC) who was known to wander around Athens and ask people about things they thought they knew about. (He apparently does receive a kind of pension for his service in an earlier war, though.) So he asks a priest about piety, Cephalus and Polemarchus about justice, etc. According to the best analyses I know, when Socrates is asking about these ideas, he is not defending the \u201ctheory of Forms\u201d that Plato later developed, but is simply looking for \u201ctrue definitions\u201d, i.e. definitions that will exactly and precisely delimit the reach of a particular concept, without leaving anything out or including anything that is clearly not part of what we think about when we think of that idea. So, in the Republic, he is said to ask whether \u201cpaying what one owes and returning what has been left with one\u201d was just, and when told it was, he asks whether \u201cgiving a prospective murderer his sword back\u201d was also just. When Cephalus admits it would not be, Socrates believes has discovered that the traditional concept of justice has holes in it. In the dialogues that Plato wrote, Socrates is usually seen as a rather jovial figure, who nobody could not like, but apparently he was an atheist in a day when that was punishable with death (although he apparently believed in at least one \u201cgod\u201d or \u201cdaimon\u201d, which spoke to him and him alone). He was, if we are to believe Meletus, the prosecutor at his trial, highly insistent in teaching the young people that followed him around that they should also disbelieve in the traditional gods of Athens. He called himself a \u201cgadfly\u201d, apparently referring to his tendency to bite painfully, and the Assembly of Athens thought he was enough of a pain in the ass to decree his death. Plato was one of the young men who sat at the feet of Socrates and imbibed his ideas. However, he took things a step further, seeing \u201ctrue definitions\u201d as pointing to things that are eternal and unchanging (for being blue is always being blue: you can change the words but the things they refer to will always be what they are). Here Plato is apparently responding to Parmenides, an earlier philosopher who taught that change is illusory and being (roughly \u201cisness\u201d) is one, immobile and eternal. Plato thought he could keep the immobility (unchanging) and eternal aspects of being by saying that the things that really are (the things that really \u201cis\u201d, \u201chave isness\u201d) are the Forms, which are roughly the definitions of Socrates but hypostasized (turned into actual things), and which are beyond time and space, in a certain sense not even really \u201cexisting\u201d but just \u201cbeing\u201d (if that sounds obscure, it is, but Plato\u2019s metaphysics isn\u2019t easy to understand when you first encounter it). We know a fair amount about Plato, thanks to later writings and his own letters. For instance, we know that in around 387 BC he founded a school called the \u201cAcademy\u201d, which would survive hundreds of years until it was closed by the Christian Roman emperor Justinian in 529 AD. Despite having written so many dialogues, he is known to have held that you cannot really transmit truth via writing, and that it can only be communicated in the context of a community of thinkers who work together to pursue truth together. He also writes about his trip to Syracuse in Sicily, where he attempted to turn the nephew of Dion (the local \u201ctyrant\u201d) into a \u201cphilosopher king\u201d, a task he failed at. Turning to Aristotle, we know he studied at Plato\u2019s Academy, but left to pursue his own studies, and eventually founded his own school, called the Peripatetics, after Aristotle\u2019s habit of walking as he talked (peripatein). While the points of similarity and difference with Plato are numerous, the biggest concerns Aristotle\u2019s attitude towards Plato\u2019s theory of Forms, which he considered mistaken, but not necessarily in an obvious way. For A. agrees that what is cannot cease to be what it is, else it never truly was to begin with, i.e. at its origin it contained both being and non-being (again, this metaphysical jargon is difficult, but it is hard to communicate Aristotle\u2019s ideas without using them). Aristotle\u2019s solution is not totally clear, although we can make a general outline that a large majority of scholars would agree on. He discusses the issue extensively in the book we now call the Metaphysics (which is a later name, apparently stuck on it because it came \u201cafter\u201d/\u201dmeta\u201d the Physics in a bookshelf), a strange, poorly coherent book that talks about a bewildering variety of topics. It is likely that the book was never written to be a single volume, but later editors put a number of separate writings together. The general theme of the book is \u201cbeing\u201d (to on) and the science that studies it (\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d or \u201cwisdom\u201d), and culminates in Book VII, which explores what it is that can most properly be said \u201cto be\u201d (later books deal with subordinate issues, like the existence of God). This book cannot be fully understood, partly because Aristotle writes it in a \u201cwondering\u201d tone; he is not setting out doctrine, but performing a genuine inquiry that does not conclude firmly with anything, merely a solution that \u201cseems\u201d to work. People who tell you they can read the seventh book of the Metaphysics without being at least partially confused are lying; there always remain aspects that resist all analysis. However, after trying out a number of unsuccessful solutions, he finally comes a solution he is willing to at least tentatively support: that \u201cwhat is\u201d is primarily said of \u201csubstances\u201d (\u201cousiai\u201d), which are a unity of matter and form. This theory of being has been enormously influential all down through the ages. And Aristotle believes that his solution is better than Plato\u2019s, because he is able to preserve the axiom that what is cannot cease to be what it is, a trait he associates with \u201cform\u201d, which is like Plato\u2019s Forms, but able to be multiple: there can be many forms of frog, because each individual \u201cform\u201d becomes an individual substance (a real, existing being) because it is somehow \u201cimposed\u201d upon matter. See my answer to What was Aristotle's reason for believing matter could be split indefinitely? for an explanation of matter. To Aristotle, his solution makes a lot more sense, because Plato was unable to explain how many beings could exist despite there being only a single Form for all of them (this is the doctrine of \u201cparticipation\u201d, an idea Aristotle dismantles in an earlier chapter of the Metaphysics). While for Plato material beings are only partly real, Aristotle associates \u201cbeing\u201d with real, existing things in the world. That means that for A., unlike P., rabbits, houses and trees are the really real things, not Ideas or Forms somewhere beyond the real world. Aristotle was different from Plato in many other ways, but perhaps the most important was that A. was a true \u201cproto-scientist\u201d who studied the empirical world and tried to build theories that would explain why the plants and animals of the world are as they are and act as they do. Although they are often ignored by scholars who prefer metaphysics, the books On the Motion of Animals, On the Generation of Animals, the Parts of Animals and On Plants are amazing works that were never equalled until the Islamic Golden Age. Plato never had much interest in the natural world; he preferred to live amongst his Forms and disdaining anything that could move and change. So if you want a one sentence summary, you might say \u201cSocrates sought definitions, Plato sought the Forms, Aristotle sought matter and form\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets just throwback on the timelines and a little background of them. Socrates was born in 470 BC and died in 399 BC. Plato was a disciple of Socrates and later went on to establish his own academy of philosophy. Plato died in 348 BC. Aristotle was a student of Plato in his academy. All of them belonged to same school of thought which started more or less from Socrates. Lets understand their philosophy briefly one by one: Socrates & Plato: The problem with Socrates is he did not have any specific philosophy of his own, neither did he dictate anything to anyone. The most essential contribution of Socrates is his dialectic method of inquiry, which became the foundation stone for the western philosophy. Almost every progress done in the field of sciences is based on the Socratic method. The method is nothing but asking a series of questions with logic and dissecting each hypothesis one by one. Most of the times he discussed about ethics, virtue and justice using this method. Whatever we know about Socrates is through the works of his disciples \u201cPlato\u201d and \u201cXenophon\u201d. Although most of the historians and philosophers agree with the works of Plato to best depict Socrates. Plato was as good at literature as philosophy. He depicts the Philosophy of Socrates through his writings and extrapolates it at many occasions to include his own flavor. Hence its very difficult to separate the two.We can fairly distinguish between Plato and Aristotle based on Plato\u2019s \u201cTheory of forms\u201d. Plato Plato was an Idealist (Platonic Idealism). According to him, each object has an essence attached to it (e.g. quality, property, characteristic). He calls this essence as Form. For example, a Table is an object, and we can call its essence as tableness. Tableness is basically something which can be served as a table. He claims that this form and the object (matter) are completely independent and the Form is the ultimate truth and eternal. The material world is mere an illusion of this truth. Hence, Tableness is the true reality and the object table is just the copy or illusion of the tableness. So his philosophy disregards the physical world as a copy and concentrates mostly on higher truths searching for ethics, virtues, justice. He hardly worked on the studies related to Physics, mathematics etc. Aristotle Aristotle was a disciple of Plato in his academy. Although Aristotle agrees with Plato saying that objects have forms associated with them and the forms are eternal, but he disregards Plato\u2019s claims that Forms are independent of matter (objects). Aristotle argues, How can a form exist without the object? According to him, Forms and matter coexist and can not be separated from each other. In those times, there were \u201cAtomists\u201d (Philosopher Democritus being the pioneer), can also be called as pure materialists, according to whom, matter is the ultimate reality and there is no such thing as Form. Aristotle does not agree with them as well. You see, Plato and Atomists are kind of two extremes and Aristotle tries to compromise between the two and find the middle. He argues, the material world is as important as the forms, and hence its worth studying it. That\u2019s why we find most of the works of Aristotle are the studies related to things (living, non-living), laying the foundations for Biology and Physics. The famous painting \u201cThe school of Athens\u201d by renaissance era painter Raphael best describes the influence of these two.  You can see these figureheads at the center of the gallery. Plato on left and Aristotle on right. If you look closely, Plato is pointing his hand upwards (other worlds of ideals), while Aristotle pointing earthwards (reality). Such fine details to strike the differences between the two. To summarize, Plato\u2019s works are in search of higher truths as he found the material world an illusion. He was an Idealist, where as Aristotle was more of a Realist. Aristotle was the first scientist in true sense. He studied this world, while Plato studied the other world. And Socrates? He was the one who laid out the methodology based on which all these philosophies emerged and left it all to us saying \u201cAll I know is that I know nothing\u201d. The whole western civilization is influenced directly by these two great minds. Their philosophies compliment each other. Plato went on to become the guiding spirit of western idealism and religion while Aristotle of science and common sense. Almost all the philosophers after these two are found to be siding with either of them. Idealism vs Empiricism. Religion vs Science. Mysticism vs Common sense.
