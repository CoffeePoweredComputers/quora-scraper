Life to be tragedy basis's on the way we try to cube out the mess even if those mess may be extra ordinary primary to just handle any how but could end making life hard and make it easy to loose life . We sometimes cause such to life , by following the feelings , I desire to be this , IAM ahuman rights fighter and so on and so forth . Unknowingly that wot we cause or jump into affects and leads to life's tragedy. On the other hand , life is never a tragedy where one may plan for the future and dies when he knows all are well for the family and the his soul too . ",
