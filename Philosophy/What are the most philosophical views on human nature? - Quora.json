            "answer_text": "Most philosophical? I\u2019m not intending to offend, but I\u2019m not sure this makes a whole lotta sense. I guess, technically, all views on human nature are philosophic, even the scientific understandings because they require some bit of philosophical understanding to come up with. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just making all this more confusing lol. There\u2019s all sorts of understandings on human nature though. There\u2019s the Christian view, and Buddhist, and the Materialist, and so on. And you can probably even break these higher categories up themselves as not all materialists might agree with one another. What exactly were you looking for though here? ",
