            "answer_text": "You won't. Don't try. I, like many, have had some success, but I was lucky and it took a long time to get there. I wrote an answer that became somewhat popular detailing a fictitious war. (Jon Davis's answer to If every state of the USA declared war against each other, which would win?) A little less than two years later, I was contacted by Emmy Award winning producer Josh C. Kline. From there we signed an agreement that didn't exactly break the bank that gave Kline permission to take the story to production companies in hopes that it would be made into a Short Run TV show or movie. There wasn't a lot of money in that first transaction and the most valuable item I recieved for my efforts was an epic framed still from my favorite movie, 300. If nothing else comes from that project, which is usually the case, I am still stoked about the framed still hanging in my living room. And that is what you should expect in working hard for the benefit of a company that shares content you create. You are \"competing\" against millions of other content creators to \"produce\" content that captures attention. I used to try very hard to compete in this way. (Jon Davis's answer to What does a good answer on Quora look like? What does it mean to \"be helpful\"?) Now, having grown a bit, I don't attempt to game the system anymore. Sometimes, I will invest in writing an answer well, and still utilize some practical writing tips to the get traffic so that people will see what I've produced. If I worked hard on something, I am going to try to get you to see it. Basically, though, I will only do that if there is something I wish every single person on the site would see, rather than just the person asking the question. That, in my opinion is how someone on this site finds success. Note that I didn't say \"gets rich\". I say \"finds success\". They are very different things. I have found success here by putting in a great deal of effort into a few answers that I feel are extremely important, or entertaining, and that I feel few people are equipped to answer as I am. I also have found experience by adding to those few noteworthy answers with another thousand or so small answers. These answers have added value to those followers who are genuinely interested in topics I write in, but that aren't worth a 3,000 word essay. Nearly three years after my first answer, I still try to continuing doing just that, add value to others by sharing what I know. In doing so, I have met countless people who have shared with me their support, appreciation, and encouragement. These people have let me know how my reflections, knowledge, and points of view have taught them, changed their way of thinking on the military and veterans, and sometimes even grew them in ways I could not have predicted. Some of them, such as Scott Lowe, Nick Layon, Ariel Williams, Dan Holliday, Graeme Shimmin, Tracey Bryan and Robert Frost, as well as far too many others, I've connected with and who mean more to me than just another clever person on this site providing me interesting content. Many of them have pushed me on to do greater things and continue to improve the content I put out. By putting myself out there, I have met people. By meeting people I have had opportunities given to me, and by following those opportunities, I have gained success. In the last six months, I have been invited to several opportunities mostly, like I said, because of the relationships I have made by being a contributor at Quora. I have been asked to write at a few different online outlets catering to military and veteran communities, have appeared in my first official byline at Newsweek (that's not been through the Quora partnership program by the way), have appeared on the podcast for the website Art of Charm, written my first non fiction novella and am knee deep in my full length novel based off one of my favorite Quora answers yet that I hope to start releasing soon. All of these successes have happened outside of Quora, but none would have happened if not for the relationships built inside of it. I also know of others who have had their own success stories. Oliver Emberton apparently got a book deal from one of his answers and others like David S. Rose have written very successful books based off their works on Quora. Anecdotally, I am sure that there are many successful stories from these halls, but I would honestly doubt that even these content creators would say their time spent on Quora was a good investment for the money's sake. If you've noticed closely, none of these activities actually translates into financial wealth or even security. They gain you a lot of influence, but don't fix a leaky roof. Quora isn't going to help you fix the roof. I am happy that there are websites out there that can, though. I have gained some funding through the website Patreon. Patreon allows contributors to submit their creative works for the public and your fans and followers, \"patrons\", to donate every time you put out a piece of content with no obligations on either end. If you really want to write and share, as well as try to recoup some of the time lost, this is definitely a great tool to do so which I highly recommend to anyone serious about their writing. It is also a great way to connect with your greatest fans and followers, those dedicated enough to ensuring you keep on creating content they appreciate. If you have followed me before, you've probably noticed my little banner at the bottom of most of my large answers (like this one) that point to Patreon. It's a nice way to let people know how they can show their appreciation for work I've given them. Don't think this will get you rich either. On a good month, I might make a few pieces that are up to snuff enough to feel that I should submit it for money from my followers. If you do go this way, expect to be spending a lot of time shamelessly marketing yourself with little return for many months. By the way, did I mention that everything I write for all of you is completely free? Wouldn't it be nice to say \"good job for all that work\" at least in the same way you tip the barista who gave you your coffee? Here's that link again: Support Jon Davis creating Short Stories and Articles in Military, Sci-Fi and Life. All kidding aside and having said all that, besides networking opportunities and utilizing other sites, Quora doesn't help make people money. That isn't what they do. They don't pay contributors. They don't give stock to the people who generate their traffic. It just isn't part of the model of social media like this one. You're not going to make money just by writing well on Quora, and when I say that you can't make money from Quora, know that I know what I am talking about. I am a top 200 writer on a site with tens of millions of users, 3 time Quora Top Writer and I even used to work there. Once, I was the office manage for Quora and, at that time, I made a lot of money. I learned everything there was to know about Quora: how their traffic worked, patterns behind user behavior, how to use the system, how to get seen, how to growth hack, and had intimate relationships with the builders of the website. I learned about social media from the people who built sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google. I even worked directly under Marc Bodnick. But that wasn't a successful way to make money either. The truth was, I didn't possess the skillset for that role, nor the ambition to deal with the challenges that came with it. More so than that, in seeing the path ahead of me, I'm not sure the destination I was moving toward was the one I wanted. In hindsight, while I enjoyed working for people like Marc and was daily floored by the brilliance of the engineers who built the site, my heart wasn't in the work I did and I eventually failed. I made many great friends there, and left on good terms, but working at Quora just wasn't for me. I just wanted to write. Now, I've found balance and truly enjoy what I do. I've become a teacher (now I actually make money, very little of it) and in the few hours I have left to myself, write answers like what you see here, as well as stories, posts, essays, and other contributions throughout the web. I suppose teaching, the sharing of knowledge, is what drove me to contributing to Quora in the first place, but the point is, it is still my day job. Writing, in its many forms, is what I do on the side. It's what I enjoy. It's what I have to do and simply can't stop. After three years and an adventure impossible to imagine, I've enjoyed some opportunities that many would consider successful. Maybe another three years from now, I will luck out and become successful by other people's standards. As of now, I still measure success in the number of people who see what I have to say, even if, because of many of the limitations in Quora, that now takes place outside of the site. What writers on Quora need to do is to focus on communicating a message you want others to learn from. It's great if this act entertains you and adds value to your life while adding value to others', as well. If your priority is money, though, trust someone who has invested countless hours and three years to writing, mostly right here, Quora is not the place to invest your time or your talent for that goal.

            "answer_text": "Okay straight up. Let me lay it out there on how you can actually use Quora to make money. My credentials? I\u2019ve been making money online for a few years now. I considered myself a writer more than anything, but because I do it online, I\u2019m by default a blogger, internet marketer and entrepreneur. There\u2019s a shit ton of information out there on how to make money online in general, so I hope to make it super simple and easy to understand here. Let\u2019s go! The practical stuff- . Building a list In internet marketing/online businesses/being an entrepreneur online, the MOST fundamental and legit way to conduct your business is to build a list. What is a list? It\u2019s an email list. It\u2019s your subscribers base. You know how some websites ask for your name and email so you can sign up for their newsletter? Yup. A list is your database. And database is always an asset. Hence, this is why it\u2019s the most legit way to conduct your business. You fucking own it! And here\u2019s a little fruit for thought: Asking people to sign up for your newsletter is by far the fucking lousiest incentive in the world. It sucks ass. It\u2019s stupid. A mere newsletter is garbage. You gotta offer them something juicier. I have a free book right here: 12 Things Happy People Don\u2019t Give a Fuck About! This is called a dedicated squeeze page, meaning you have only ONE thing to do on that page and that is to sign up for my free book. This is to break free from distractions. Most companies\u2019 websites have a shit ton of clutter and only offer a shitty newsletter, that is why their sign-up rate is horrible. . Making money with your list So after you build your list, you make money off it by sending them shit to buy. You can do this with affiliate products (in which you sell other people\u2019s shit and make a commission), your own products you create or offer them a service. That\u2019s it! Build list- Send them shit- Make money It\u2019s that simple. An email list is always and always will be the highest converting method to making money online. Why? Because everybody says so. I mean it. Google it and you will know. From experience, I can also vouch for that. And as said, a list is your database, your asset. You own it. Every business needs an asset. . How you use Quora to make money How do you use Quora to make money then? How does all of this link to Quora? Quora is a huge ass network that boasts a lot of viewers. By using Quora, you\u2019re hence leveraging on them. So you come here, create an account, answer questions, link back to your free incentive (like my free book, again), build that list, and then send them shit to buy. That\u2019s it. Simple. That\u2019s how you ultimately make money with Quora as a legit business for the long-term. The mindset stuff- This is obviously a lot easier said than done Look man, learning how to make money online is extremely easy. In today\u2019s day and age, you can read shit up online easily. But doing it is fucking hard. Taking action will always be hard. And unfortunately, I dare say that most people today are being preyed upon. There\u2019re many businesses out there wherein their business is to teach people how to create a business. It\u2019s not as simple as that. Think about it, if it works so well, why the hell would you teach? Why would they teach you ONLY? They\u2019re making off you, that\u2019s why. That\u2019s all they care about. That is why you need to build your mindset in order to know how to make money online, or with Quora. Here\u2019s my take on this: . You need balls From what I\u2019ve been observing, a lot of people on Quora are very against the idea of using Quora to make money. They argue that self-promotion is bad, is selling, is trolling, is whatever. But well, newsflash, a lot of people are also not rich, not entrepreneurs and not making money with a business. If you want to stand out, it\u2019s time to gather your balls, ignore the haters and bravely do shit to further your ambitions. I\u2019ve been told that I am an aggressive marketer on Quora. I probably am. ALL my answers will link back to my free book. And like duh, I am fucking profane as fuck. That\u2019s how I stand out. But I really don\u2019t give a fuck if you hate it. Your hate is not my problem. It\u2019s yours. So do you want to like everybody? Or do you want to stand out with your fucking awesome ambitions and rewards? . You need consistency to eliminate the newbie effect The problem with the ease and accessibility to learn shit online is that it makes you THINK that you can do the same. But that is a lie. It\u2019s extremely to read this answer of mine now and think \u201cWow! Okay. Let me try what Alden is saying. Since it works for him, it should therefore work for me.\u201d That\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s the newbie in you making you think that way. That is why so many people today think that online marketing is just a matter of \u201cDo this shit and it will work.\u201d Think about it\u2026 how many people have said: \u201cInstagram? Yeah! Let me just post pretty pictures everyday and I will create a following easily!\u201d \u201cFacebook page? Yeah! Let me just update it everyday with pictures, funny links and shit and I will get more likes!\u201d \u201cBlog? Let me just write some list post and it should go viral, just like that other website which keeps going viral.\u201d \u201cQuora? It\u2019s only a matter of answering random questions and linking back to my squeeze page!\u201d Nah. What you need is CONSISTENCY. Work EVERYDAY. Be consistent. Do it because you know it\u2019s important. If you\u2019re passionate, it\u2019s that easier because you love it that much more. Be consistent, and eventually you will get there. I personally write here on Quora everyday. Heck, I am on holiday now and I writing this shit out in my hotel room. . You need to add real value In which you give out content to truly help people. Look at my answers. Love it or hate it, I write them from the heart and I know it helps people. Value, art and quality are all subjective indeed. You need not care what others think of your work, especially if they\u2019re haters, but as said, you need to be consistent. You need to be honest. You SHOULD be passionate too. A newbie doesn\u2019t add real value. The newbie effect is always making them think like, \u201cI am just applying this because I read about it online. The results should come too because I read that it works.\u201d And when it doesn\u2019t work, they give up. That\u2019s the thing about business. Heck, that the\u2019s thing about life: If you are just working to expect some tangible result, you\u2019re in for a huge disappointment. The successful people in life have insane clarity of who they are and what they want. That drives the shit out of them to do work with passion, honesty and consistency. That is how you don\u2019t give up. . You SHOULD have passion I decided to create a point on passion. Noticed I said SHOULD have passion. I will not say you must have passion, like a bunch of people out there like to advocate. Straight up man, passion is a fucking overrated idea today. Passion is not the magical fart from a unicorn\u2019s ass that is going to solve all your damn problems. Passion is, at its essence, a feeling. And feelings fade. You\u2019re bound to feel tired and shit. If you always feeling \u2018high\u2019 everyday supposedly from passion, I suspect that you\u2019re on drugs then. But passion is that awesome because it\u2019s a fundamental aspect of you, your life and your business. It can drive you over the long-term. It lets you, be you. It\u2019s hence best to create a business based on your passion, but don\u2019t expect it to be an inspirational ride where you\u2019re happy everyday. I use Quora as a way of marketing because I fucking love to write. So many people have told me like, dude you should be on YouTube or Instagram. That\u2019s so popular today and it\u2019s trendy! I don\u2019t give a fuck how popular it is. I am not a picture or video guy. To do that would make me create crappy content and people will see through it. If I give out shit, then there\u2019s no way I will stand out, much less succeed in business. So that\u2019s it! How do you make money on Quora? Come here. Write real, valuable shit. Link back to your free book or whatever. Build that database/asset. Send them cool shit to buy. Sounds easy. But not done easily. Consistency man. Consistency! Good luck. And of course, here\u2019s me doing the work right here baby: Get my free book, 12 Things Happy People Don\u2019t Give a Fuck About! ",
