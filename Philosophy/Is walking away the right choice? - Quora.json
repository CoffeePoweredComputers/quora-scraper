            "answer_text": "It really depends on the situation at hand. Sometimes it might be the right choice, other times it might have negative and unwanted results. The situation must be seen holistically (as a whole) and analysed in depth from an impartial and pragmatic point of view. The reasons why you want to walk away are important so ask yourself why you\u2019d want to walk away. You need to understand if you want to walk away as the result of fear, tiredness or lack of strength, or if the situation itself requieres you to do walk away or do something completely different. All in all you need to find the necessary clarity to see the situation as it is and then act accordingly. ",
