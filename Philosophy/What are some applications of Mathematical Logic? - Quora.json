            "answer_text": "Mathematical logic is that version of logical reasoning, which is typical of modern times. Its specific difference is the use of a symbolic language and of an algebraic system of calculation to examine the expressions of a deductive discourse. These expressions, whose validity is merely formal, are reduced to wff\u2019s (well-formed-formulas, or well-formed-formulae). Thus, deductive reasoning can be conceived as the manipulation of graphic objects that can be combined with each other (syntax) or that can be considered in relation to their meaning (semantics). The syntactic analysis is called \u201clogical calculus\u201d, whereas the semantic study has to do with the interpretations of the formula that can be derived through the calculus. Despite some anticipations with Hobbes, Leibniz and Boole, the great development of mathematical logic occurred between the 19th and 20th century and was caused by the attempt to define a formal system for the whole building of mathematics and to demonstrate its completeness and consistency, using only logical tools. The basic idea was that the certainty of maths had to have a logical foundation and had to avoid confusions or bewilderments such as those produced by the formulation of geometries alternative to the Euclid\u2019s one, or also by the complete legitimization of the negative square roots and other \u201cobjects\u201d. Maths was supposed to be the realm of certainty: 2+2=4, the internal angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, there is no number whose square is -1, and so on. Since all these truths could be challenged at the end of the 19th century, it was necessary to guarantee that maths was still reliable. To restore mathematics, the latter had to be conceived as a formal language and it had to recover the certainty it had when Euclid's Elements ruled, even if it was impossible to ignore the new acquisitions of Bolyai, Lobachevsky, Hamilton, Cantor etc. Therefore, it was necessary to set all mathematics on logical notions, starting from the set of natural numbers and the arithmetic operations. Which, incidentally, is not at all simple, because, just to give an example, if it is true that the operator VEL defines a logical sum and that the number 1 stands for \"true\" in terms of classical truth values, it is not however undeniable that 1+1 is 2, since \u201ctrue or true\u201d is once again only true... Id est: 1+1=1. With the advent of electronic computers, many themes of mathematical logic developed in connection with the basic themes of computer science. The most relevant current applications of mathematical logic are indeed in this field and specifically in the domain of AI, for example as the attempt to automatize the process of \u201cfinding\u201d good demonstrations.

            "answer_text": "You will have watched Perry Mason or some other fictional legal eagle arguing a case in court. Arguments are made in natural language which we use freely in normal conversation but you will have heard two people arguing furiously, both saying the same thing in different ways and not realising it. Natural language is riddled with nuances, implications and misinterpretations. Logic enables simple statements of facts to take part in a systematic argument which obeys a simple set of mathematically obvious rules to reach valid conclusions. There are five logical relationships with inclusion and exclusion laws making ten propositional calculus rules altogether. Then add a universal law using the, \"upside down A,\" symbol to mean, \"For All,\" and the, \"backwards E,\" symbol to mean, \"There Exists,\" to complete the twelve rules of, \"predicate calculus.\" Predicate calculus helps to form the basis of any system where simple conditions combine to come to a complex conclusion. These include: artificial intelligence, data analysis, computer programming, game theory and planning, mathematics, physics, law and any other field where decisions are made. ",
