            "answer_text": "There cannot be energy without a body, a body cannot be \u201cspace/time\u201d, as that\u2019s an abstraction of the actually existing body. All bodies have a deterministic quiddity. Spinoza called \u201cspace/time\u201d the sum of the Natura Naturan plus all actually existing Natura Naturata. This sum is the whole Cosmos considered as a solid Substance Monism and the Unified Field of all possible and actually existing quantum particles. Space/time is our human mental objective idea for the infinite, indivisible, eternal, and almighty Radiant Quantum Materialistic Monism which has logically the energy of the said body. ",

            "answer_text": "spacetime is a flow, it is a mixture of 3-dimensional space and time (relative) at that particular point. Its flow varies with gravity, the flow of spacetime is slow around the bodies with higher gravitational fields and vice-versa. ",
