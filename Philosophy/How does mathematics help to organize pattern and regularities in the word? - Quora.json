Fibonacci numbers are found in almost any flowers. Sunflowers have the seeds in perfect Fibonacci order. 1 seed then 2 seeds 3 seeds 6 seeds 12 seeds 24 seeds and so on in the flowers. This arrangement ensures maximum sunlight to each litte seed in the flower. If You take the number of petals in a flower, they all follow a mathemathical order. A river flowing through a landscape has Pi in it. The straight distance from start to end relates with Pi (I've forgot the exact relation) if You measure the actual distance. The big pyramids have Pi in them. The Egyptians didn't know Pi, but learned from experience. The formula is the height mulitplied with 2xPi. Divide the result with 4 -that's the length of the sides. It gives the base You need to build as high as You can on a solid base with the given angle. The light of speed is a constant. If You send a signal and get a returnsignal, You measure the time from sending to recieving the signal again. Knowing the speed of light You can calculate the distance. The principal behind RADAR. The ears of an owl works like RADAR. Their faces and ears are slightly assymmetrical. It's an adoption to being able to locate the direction of the sound. The tiny difference in time a sound hits the ears makes it possible to pinpoint the direction and distance and predict the movement of the pray. An owl can hit very precisely in almost total darkness having predicted the point of interception. Insurance is ruled by math. You can predict accidents, breakdowns, health. Almost anything can be calculated. They use it to offer You an insurance, You think is worth it, while they stil make money. Lottery is pure math, and some psychology. If You scratch the numbers and win excactly what You just spent, most of us don't count our losses and tink we're lucky getting a new lottery ticket because it's free. The mind plays tricks on us. We like order and try to see a known patch. That's why we can recognize a tootstick man. We simply catalog it in a known box. Maybe that's the fascinating thing about math. Many things in our Universe is pretty predictable, asking the right questions holds the answers. It's observing, determening what You see, asking questions about it. Gaining knowledge by finding an explanation, testing if You're right or wrong. Always being right is proof of not trying hard enough. How to do science, is a science in it's own right. At university You spend a good part of the first year learning how to learn, there's a scientific approach/method in how to do science. You can't really understand science, if You don't understand the basics. It can be very intersubjective, only recognized by Your peers. If You can explain a scientific problem to an eight year old, You probably understood it Yourself. I know there's a lot more to it, I'm barely scratching the surface. I'm the first to admit, I don't know it all. That's the good thing about getting older. I just like to turn another stone to see what's hiding underneath. You might just be so lucky to be proven wrong and learn from it. Google is pure math. The search engine is based on an algorithm. That's why companies buys data. They want to be even more precise in targeting You with adds. From Your search patterns, they can predict, what Your income and intersts are. Even down to Your temper and personality. It gives clues to the segment You belong to. In fact You don't have to interrogate people to know who they really are. You can just look at Facebook and Google, there's a good chance they know You better - than You do Yourself! If You know what phone people use, what computer they use and what search engine they use. You can begin to say something very specific about the persons You're trying to figure out. In the end by math and cross references. If You use Bing and Safari as a browser, You're most likely not a frontrunner, but accepts the given choice. Just as an example. The number of difficult words You type, says something about Your education. You can probably predict the nationality, even when everything is written in English. Edit: Thank you for sharing. Feel free to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, I absolutely love this question because it gets to the reasoning behind why I chose to pursue mathematics! (Other than the fact that it is the laziest profession and thus suits my personality so well, of course.) Simply put, mathematics is so beautiful because it helps to take complicated processes that naturally occur in the world around us and represent them utilizing logic to make predictions. Let\u2019s look at a fairly common example that almost everyone deals with at some point in their life. Money! Say you really want that new phone. It\u2019s beautiful, excellent screen space with matching pixel ratio, superb battery life, latest processor, and the camera is finally advanced enough to take selfies worthy of your beauty. But it\u2019s $1000, and you\u2019ve only got $150 to spare at the moment. Woe always me! What\u2019s a person to do?!? Math to the rescue! Being the resourceful little guy or gal you are, you have a job making $15/hr. That means we can make a function. Without diving into details, you can see a linear relationship here. Your rate of change is 15, and you began with 150. Let\u2019s look at a graph to see when you\u2019ll hit that $1000 mark.  Tada! You can see that at 56 hours you still won\u2019t have quite enough, but after 57 hours, you\u2019ll have enough to get that phone! This was a fairly simple real-world example of the applications of just a linear equation or two. We could have used inequalities to model the situation better as any amount over $1000 would do. You wouldn\u2019t complain about having some extra after such a large purchase would you? Math is all about discovering methods to help model such situations. Trigonometry, Statistics, Calculus, and even more abstract classes all focus on different aspects of life to make predictions based on an observable pattern. Much more complicated processes that require more variables may have tolerances, or error ranges, that must also be calculated to help others see the likelihood of future occurrences. Depending on the area that you are interested in, you specialize in order to focus on the models unique to that study so you have multiple tools ready. As mentioned in another answer, mathematicians in any field do not \u201ccreate\u201d the way that things work. No one could make 2 + 2 = 4. Instead, someone recognized that having 2 quantities of anything and combining them with 2 more quantities resulted in 4 quantities. On the most basic level, we have something called groups and rings that rely on some kind of system followed by one or two operations. For example, our number system follows a ring utilizing the real numbers and the operations addition and multiplication. What about subtraction and division, you ask? We cover those with something called inverses. Subtraction is the same as adding a negative. For example, 5\u20133 is the same as 5+-3. Similarly, we never need to divide when we can just as easily multiply by a fraction. (Dividing by two is the same as taking half of a number.) And even at this advanced level, no mathematician created these ideas. Instead, they discovered patterns and proved mathematically that we can rely on those patterns and specific methods to solve other problems. Math allows us to create more advanced technology every day that make discoveries in medicine, architecture, and even space travel possible. Modeling these areas allows for their respective scientists to plan for the future by learning from the past to ensure the present is always moving forward. ",

PATTERN | definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary a particular way in which something is done or organized, or in which something happens The first and primary definition in this dictionary is what comes to my mind, when I say \u201cMathematics is the language of pattern.\u201d[1] Every mathematical discipline is built on definitions, axioms, synbols, and inferencing rules. These form the pattern for which a mathematician may have one or more conceptual models. Sometimes, special cases match observations of the real world; mathematics provides more general patterns that are not limitted by real world measurements.  Because mathematics describes all patterns, any pattern observed[2] or conceived can be communicated by mathematics. Since mathematics is abstract, the only topic which mathematics conveys is that of pattern!

Whether counting cars, people, hours or ideas, it does not matter, it\u2019s all counting. It turns out, many practical problems, when abstractified, boil down to the same. So, you only need to solve the abstract problem once, and that can give you the solution to a huge number of practical problems. Mathematics is a good language for such abstract problems. Many abstract problems can be reduced to elementary mathematical concepts such as sets, relations, functions, vector spaces, graphs, integrals, differentials, random variables,\u2026 Sadly, it\u2019s not easy to learn how to abstractify a general practical problem. In fact, it\u2019s even harder than the mathematics itself. ",
