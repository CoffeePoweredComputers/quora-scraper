            "answer_text": "Well, straight after the fell of Constantinople. Hey, not that fall of Constantinople, at 1453, but the previous one at 1204! Seriously, Theodoros Laskaris who secured the throne of the \u201cEmpire of Nicaea\u201d right after 1204 was the first emperor to define himself as a Greek after a really really long time an actual ruler defined himself as a Greek. Nevertheless, the people never forgot that their language was Greek, but they did define themselves in religious terms, as Romans meaning Christians for centuries, except for some intellectuals who weren\u2019t that much religious, but were in the minority until the creation of the empire of Nicaea. There is also a gap of a couple of centuries when nobody defined himself as a Greek - in the extant texts of their time, which were not that many - but it is safe to assume that the Greek identity was supplanted by the Christian identity for almost a thousand years, and then thrived in the west during the Ottoman era but not in Greece itself. The general idea that the Greek people were still \u201cRomioi\u201d was prevalent well after the Greek war of liberation at 1821, although by that time the Greek ethnogenesis was gaining ground rapidly, and overshadowed the Christian identity without to erase it altogether, just as the Christian identity ultimately failed to eliminate the Greek identity even though it tried hard, to the point of banning the name \u201cHellenas\u201d as someone of the Pagan faith when Christianity dominated the Roman empire.

            "answer_text": "I have read that the Greeks continued to call themselves Rh\u014dma\u00eeoi (\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9, \"Romans,\u201d meaning citizens of the Roman Empire), a term which in the Greek language had become synonymous with Christian Greeks even after the Byzantine Empire had fallen. It had a political rather than national connotation, as from the year 212 Caracalla\u2019s decree had granted Roman citizenship to all free-born men of the Empire. The Latinising term Graiko\u00ed (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af, \"Greeks\") was also used but not commonly and is not found in official Byzantine political correspondence, prior to the Fourth Crusade (1204). Evidence of the use of the term Graikos can be found in the works of Prisucs, a historian of the 5th century AD. The Arabs continued to call the Greeks ar-Rum and the term R\u00fbm is applied to the Antiochian Orthodox Christians and the Melkite or R\u00fbm Catholics (not to be confused with Roman Catholics of the western church of Rome in Italy) of Syria, Lebanon, Northern Israel, occupied Palestine and the Hatay Pronvince in Southern Turkey whose liturgy is still based on Koine Greek. Millet-i R\u00fbm, or \"Roman Nation\", was the name of the Eastern Orthodox Christian community in the Ottoman Empire. In today's Turkey, Rum are the Turkish citizens of Greek ethnicity. Another name for Greeks, derived from \u201cIonian,\u201d is Yunan, used in current Persian, Arabic (\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a), Azeri, Turkish, Hindi (\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093e\u0928), Indonesian and Malay. \"Roman\" was long used in various languages around the Balkans to refer to the lands of that empire. The region is known by Bosnian: Rumelija, Greek: \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1, Romyl\u00eda, or \u03a1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7, Ro\u00fameli; Albanian: Rumelia; Serbian and Macedonian: \u0420\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0430, Rumelija and Bulgarian: \u0420\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f, Rumeliya. In old Latin Genoese documents it is known as Romania, the common name for the Byzantine Empire in the Middle Ages. The neologism \"Byzantine Empire\" was coined only in 1557 by the German historian Hieronymus Wolf, in his Corpus Histori\u00e6 Byzantin\u00e6. Another reason why the Greeks preferred the term \u201cRomans\u201d is because the name \u201cHellene\u201d signifies \u201cpagan\u201d in the New Testament, so it was not used by Greek Christians until a later time when paganism had died out. From the 11th century onward (from Anna Komnena, Michael Psellos, John III Vatatzes, George Pletho Gemistos et alii) the term Hellene is found as an alternative term for names like Graekos and Romios. The term Hellene was chosen by the Greek philosopher Giorgios Gemistos Plethon in the 15th century as part of his endeavour to replace Christianity by the \u201cReligion of the Hellenes\u201d. It was revived a second time by the Greek nationalist movement in the 19th century. That was the time of the battle of the names: Hellenes, Greeks and Romans. The concept of Hellene for a person of Greek origin was already well established from the late Middle Ages. Most of the population, especially those living in rural areas, continued to identify themselves as Romans, descendants of the empire of Romania. Greek (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) was the least popular of the three names. The decisive factor in the choice of the national nomenclature was determined by the proponents and leaders of the Greek War of Independence through their repetition of the name in their speeches and calls to battle. The anonymous author of The Hellenic Realm of Law, published in 1806 in Pavia, Italy, speaks of Hellenes: \"The time has come, O Hellenes, to liberate our home!\" Ypsilantis declared in his Proclamation: \"Fight for Faith and Fatherland! The time has come, O Hellenes.\u201d The famous General Theodoros Kolokotronis always wore a helmet of ancient Greek style and invariably addressed his troops as Hellenes. Today, the country which is called Greece in English is officially named \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, Hellenic Republic, and the Greeks are \u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, Hellenes.

Actually it is the same term but with the term \u2018\u0395llenes being the more accurate one (it is similar with that of the people of Israel, where you can call them Israelis, Hebrews or Jews and at the same time you are referring to the same people but with minor differences). Greek is the term that wrongfully prevailed due to the wide spread Roman language to the West, North-west part of Europe and sometimes it was used to describe the \u2018\u0395llenes in a diminishing way. \u2018\u0395llenes were the people that used to live in the \u2018\u0395llenic peninsula, the coast of the Mediterranean/Black Sea through the ancient times. When the \u2018\u0395llenic peninsula was captured by the Romans these people became part of the Roman Empire. As the Roman Empire started decaying and especially after the western part fell, the Empire started to become \u2018\u0395llenic as the inhabitants of the Empire were mostly speaking \u2018\u0395llenic (Greek) and they started searching out their roots, as the most prominent scholars of the time were wondering \u201cwhat did the Romans offered to philosophy/arts/education that was more important to that of the Greeks had already offered ?\u201d. So to answer your question, after Constantinople fell and the captivity by the Ottomans followed for approximate 400 years the \u2018\u0395llenes never lost their identity, on the contrary they were more bonded together through their common identity/customs/language/religion which eventually resulted to the Revolution of 1821 and the liberation of the \u2018\u0395llenic people.

            "answer_text": "To transfer this affair in modern terms, it is a matter of nationality and ethnicity. Greeks have always felt they belong to the Greek nation. During the ancient period of Greece, they would call themselves Greeks( ethnicity ), citizens of Sparta, Athens, etc ( nationality ). When the Roman Empire conquered the greek peninsula, they were Greeks ( ethnicity ), citizens of the Roman Empire ( nationality ). Byzantium is, as you know, an artificial name. There was no state under this name. The so-called Byzantium is the Roman Empire in the Medieval period, so our guys still called themselves Greeks and Romans for the same reason. Under the Ottoman rule, they used both Greek and Roman ( \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af in greek ). So, they were always considering themselves as Greeks. It is the same in the modern USA, they are a lot of American citizens ( American nationality ) who define themselves as Italian ( Italian ethnicity ) or Chinese ( Chinese ethnicity ). Of course, the inhabitants of modern Greece are Greeks ( ethnicity ) and\u2026 Greeks ( nationality ). Thanks for asking Labin! ",

            "answer_text": "There is a misconception here. The term roman was mostly used to describe citizenship and religion, not ethnicity. The eastern roman empire had roman (and by roman i mean latin speaking) populations, but this culture never prevailed in the east - in the big cities of the roman empire, like antioch, alexandria, constantinople, smyrna, thessaloniki etc it was always the greek element that prevailed. The term \u201cgreek\u201d started to mean \u201cpagan\u201d after the establishment of chriatianity as official religion of the state, while \u201croman\u201d ment christian and constantinople was considered to be the continuation of rome after the fall of the west part of the empire. The greeks had stopped calling themselves romans since before the fall of constantinople, because of the Charlemagne founding the Holy Roman Empire, the schism between the catholic (roman) church in 1054 and the rivalry with the west and off course the crussades during which constantinople was conquered. As everybody was christian by then and due to loss of non greek speaking provinces, the term greek (rather hellen) started being used again, a couple of centuries before the fall in 1453. The ottomans though kept calling use romans as thats the name that we used when they invaded around 1071. ",

And in the Ottoman Empire the term Roman was used as a proper term for all Christian subjects. Hellene or Greek was used to refer to the Greek language but mostly not to the people (though it depended on context). And remember that not all Ottoman Romans were Greek-speaking; many of those ended up in Greece). When the Greek (Roman) independence movement got underway in the 19th century, the movement leaders rebranded their cause as liberating the Hellenes, in part to gain western support. From that point on the Roman Christians gradually changed how they called themselves. ",
