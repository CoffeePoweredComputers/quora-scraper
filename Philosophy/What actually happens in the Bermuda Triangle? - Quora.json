            "answer_text": "Just in case you are trying to understand what Bermuda Triangle actually is... It is a strange triangular area on the Atlantic ocean where many ships sailing through it or planes passing over it have disappeared without a trace or met with fatal accidents. And such incidents have been happening since centuries without a proper explanation.  So looking for the facts behind the mystery of Bermuda Triangle? More than 1000 ships and planes have disappeared in the triangle area over the past five centuries and continue to do so. And all these happen when apparently there are no human errors, equipment failures or even natural disasters. Strangely, the ships and aircraft just vanish when everything seems to be okay. Many believe that Devil is at play here and therefore call the area also as Devil's Triangle.   The facts however are quite far from what is generally known or believed to be true. There are many stories and myths created through sheer imagination by writers who have used them rampantly to draw publicity to their books. In many cases, the facts got blurred. But one thing which is beyond doubt is, far too many incidents have taken place in this area for it to be ignored casually or interpreted to be just another normal ocean area. Well, I have been digging deep into the incidents and analyzing the facts and evidences. This section is an account of those findings.   Bermuda Triangle   \u200b\u200b  So where is Bermuda Triangle located and how large is the area? Is there a map? And do you get to know when exactly you cross the line and enter the area? By the simplest of all definitions, Bermuda Triangle is located off the South-Eastern coast of the United States and in the Atlantic Ocean. The three corners of the triangle are: Miami (in Florida); San Juan (in Puerto Rico); and Bermuda (a north-Atlantic island).    The disappearances have mostly taken place near the southern boundary of the triangle between Florida and Puerto Rico. You can always argue that it's obvious because that's where the area of the triangle is widest and therefore such possibilities should be more anyway! But the area is not as simple as it appears in the picture above. In order to know more about its location, how the area is actually laid out in the Atlantic, and whether you will ever know when you are entering the dreaded Bermuda triangle area as you take a cruise or flight,So the next question is why the name \"Bermuda Triangle\"? At the time of coining the term, the first name that came up was \"Miami Triangle\". But Florida objected saying that they would lose visitors to Miami with such name as people would fear to come there. So the next name taken up was \"Puerto Rico Triangle\". Puerto Rico too raised objections. Then it was the turn for the 21 square mile tiny island Bermuda which forms the third corner of the triangle. And no one seems to have bothered. Bermuda was then also known as the \"Isle of the Devils\" which fitted to the triangle concept quite well and therefore the final name \"Bermuda Triangle\" was coined.  Lost Planes & Ships in Bermuda Triangle Here are some of the most amazing stories of planes and ships that disappeared while crossing the triangle area. As you visit the links, you will also see my findings behind such great mysteries of all times. In most cases I have discussed and explained the possible causes, in some cases I have also given excerpts from official reports that were produced by US Navy, US Air Force or US Coast Guards after completing the search operations. And in several cases, I have given updates on further findings.  Flight 19: The Avenger planes of Flight-19 took off from the U.S Naval Base of Florida for a routine training session on an afternoon of December 1945, but strangely this time they never returned.  PBM Martin Mariner: When all hopes for the above Flight-19 planes were quickly fading, two Martin Mariner planes (flying boats) were sent by US Navy to search them out. One came back, but the other didn't. Read the full story to know what happened.  Tudor Star Tiger: Star Tiger, a Tudor Mark-IV aircraft disappeared in Bermuda Triangle shortly before it was about to land at the Bermuda airport.  Fight DC-3: The flight DC-3 NC16002 disappeared when it was only 50 miles south of Florida and about to land in Miami.  Flight 441: A Super Constellation Naval Airliner disappeared in October 1954.  C-54 Skymaster: Apparently it seemed to be a sudden thunderstorm that had disintegrated the plane. But there was much more to the story.  Mary Celeste - The Ghost Ship: Known as one of the ghost ships of Bermuda Triangle, Mary Celeste had many misadventures even before her mystery voyage in 1872. But this time, although the ship could be salvaged, none on board could ever be traced.  Marine Sulphur Queen: This 524-foot carrier of molten sulphur started sail on Feb 2, 1963 from Beaumont, Texas with 39 crew. It was reported lost in Florida Straits on February 4, and lost for ever.  Ellen Austin: The Ellen Austin, an American schooner, met with another ship in Bermuda Triangle. The other ship was moving in full speed but strangely had nobody on board.  USS Cyclops: Disappearance of the carrier ship U.S.S. Cyclops in Bermuda Triangle has been one of the greatest mysteries of the sea.  USS Scorpion: USS Scorpion (SSN-589) was a Nuclear powered submarine of United States Navy that disappeared in Bermuda Triangle area in May 1968.  Those were only few cases. Check out Bermuda Triangle Incidents for a list of all the major indents in the triangle area along with fascinating stories for many.    Popular theories solving the mystery So what caused the ships and aircraft to disappear mysteriously? There have been many research and explorations done to uncover the mystery. There is no single theory that can explain all the incidents of disappearances. The ships and aircraft have been victims of different circumstances and situations. Things happened quickly and unexpectedly. While many theories have come out, there are few that come close to solving the Bermuda Triangle Mystery.   Methane Gas trapped under the sea floor can erupt, and as a result can lower the water density and cause ships to sink like a rock. Even planes flying over it, can catch fire and get completely destroyed during such gas blowout.  Sargasso Sea is a strange area that has no shores and bounded only by water currents on all sides. Many ships passing through it have been stranded and made motionless.  Electronic Fog, a strange thick cloud appears from nowhere and engulfs a ship or a plane. Instruments begin to malfunction, and finally the ship or the aircraft vanishes without a trace.  There are many other theories that try to solve or explain the mysteries of Bermuda Triangle. Check out the Theories of Bermuda Triangle that describes most of such strange factors that would have caused the disappearances.  And there are also theories that took recourse to some supernatural events to explain the disappearances. Check out Supernatural Theories to know about them. ",

            "answer_text": "In an area that stretches from the Florida coast, in Bermuda and into Puerto Rico, the infamous Bermuda Triangle - also known as the Death Triangle or the Devil's Triangle - is blamed for hundreds of shipwrecks, mysteriously missing planes and other unexplained phenomena.  Author Vincent Gaddis is credited for presenting the term \"Bermuda Triangle\" in 1964 in an article he wrote for Argosy magazine, \"Deadly Bermuda Triangle\", in which he catalogued many of the abnormal events in the area. Several other authors, including Charles Berlitz and Ivan Sanderson, have added valuable information about the mysterious phenomena in this area. This area has generated many theories and controversies. However, not even today, exactly what is happening in this mysterious area is known. What actually happens in the Bermuda Triangle? Here are the possible explanations. Unexplained vortices Researcher Ivan Sanderson suspected that the strange phenomena of the sea and the sky, the mechanical malfunctions of the instrument and the mysterious disappearances were the results of what he called \"inexplicable vortices\". This area is characterized by extreme currents and temperature variations, which affect the electromagnetic fields. And the Bermuda Triangle was not the only place on earth where this happened. Sanderson drew elaborate charts, which he identified with ten such locations around the globe, five above and five below the equator. Magnetic variation This theory, proposed by the US Coast Guard 30 years ago, states that: \u201cMost of the disappearances can be attributed to the unique environmental features of the area. First, the \"Devil's Triangle\" is one of the two places on Earth where a compass points to the actual North and not the magnetic one. The difference between the two is known as the compass variation. The difference between the two points is huge. If this variation of the compass is not compensated, a navigator might be away from the course and get into serious trouble. Space-time rupture It has been suggested that from time to time a space-time rupture opens in the Bermuda Triangle and that the aircraft and ships in the area are currently suffering accidents. Therefore, it is said that most of the time, no trace of ships or aeroplanes is ever found in the area. Electronic fog Is it an \"electronic fog\" responsible for many of the unexplained incidents and disappearances of the infamous Bermuda Triangle? This is the statement made by Rob MacGregor and Bruce Gernon in their book \"Foga\". Gernon himself is a witness and survivor of this strange phenomenon. On December 4, 1970, he and his father were flying a Bonanza A36 aircraft over the Bahamas. On the way to Bimini, they encountered strange weather phenomena - a tunnel-shaped vortex whose walls, the wings of the plane reached during the flight. All the electronic and magnetic navigation instruments on the plane did not work properly, and the magnetic compass was inexplicably rotated. As they neared the end of the tunnel, they were expecting to see the clear blue sky. Instead, they saw only a dull gray white - no ocean, sky or horizon. After flying for 34 minutes, a time confirmed by each hour on board, they woke up over Miami Beach - a flight that would normally take 75 minutes. MacGregor and Gernon believe that this electronic fog they experienced is responsible for the famous disappearance and other aircraft or ships. UFOs When there are no explanations, blame the UFOs. Although the reasons are unclear, it has been suggested that aliens have chosen the Bermuda Triangle as a point to abduct people for unknown purposes. Apart from the lack of evidence for this theory, we have to wonder why the aliens captured the entire aircraft or ship? Why not kidnap people in the same way that they say they kidnap them from their homes? Atlantis One of the postulated locations of the legendary Atlantis island is in the Bermuda Triangle area. Some believe that the atlases were a civilization that developed an amazingly advanced technology and that, in a way, its remnants could still be active somewhere on the ocean floor. However, there seems to be no evidence of advanced technology - except for a discovery made by Dr Ray Brown in 1970. Brown claims to have discovered a pyramid-like structure with a smooth mirror finish. Swimming inside, he discovered that the interior is completely devoid of corals and algae and was illuminated by an unknown light source. In the centre was a two-handed sculpture holding a luminous sphere. Methane gas One of the most interesting scientific theories about the disappearance of ships in the triangle was proposed by Dr Richard McIver, an American geochemist, and further supported by Dr. Ben Clennell of Leeds University in England. Hydrated methane that causes sedimentation on the ocean floor to bubble could cause ships to disappear. Land sliding off the ocean floor can release large amounts of gas, which would be disastrous, as it would significantly reduce water density. \"This would make any ship float a stone,\" says Connell. Extremely combustible gas could ignite aircraft engines, causing them to explode. ",
