            "answer_text": "A good question. It\u2019s often said that although English has a huge number of words that are similar, it has no absolute synonyms. Although \u201cpost-modernist\u201d and \u201ccontemporary\u201d denote similar concepts, they are not identical - certainly not in terms of Lit Crit. First, of course, \u201ccontemporary\u201d merely means \u201cof the now\u201d. This makes it quite a fluid concept. There will be contemporary literature a hundred years from now (if we are permitted to exist so long) that is very unlikely to resemble today\u2019s \u201ccontemporary\u201d literature. Of course, \u201ccontemporary\u201d has a connotation that suggests a movement from the past too. Part of the problem is that many post-modernist works are contemporary. (Equally, some are not!) Post-modernism as a movement is a rejection of past certainties - hence the \u201cmodernism\u201d part of the term is not necessarily \u201cmodern\u201d in the way that it is used today. (Think of linguistics: \u201cmodern English\u201d denotes the English language from the middle of the 16th Century - so Shakespeare was writing in modern English. Most of my students would have problems accepting this\u2026) So \u201cpost-Modernism\u201d is a movement that denies the certainties that previous writers (artists, of all kinds, of course, but the focus of this question is on literature.) accepted. From a premise that \u201call stories have already been told\u201d, post-modernist literature looks at accepted narratology- and challenges it. So, for example, we have the \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d - a technique that that questions the very basis of how stories are told. Think of American Psycho - how we begin by believing Bateman\u2019s narrative, but start to question his reliability - and hence the whole narrative framework. Look too at the solipsistic narrator of The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman - observing his characters, \u201cdeciding\u201d what to do with them, playing with narrative causality, and even the concept of endings\u2026 (Of course, it would be quite possible to argue that earlier novels such as Wuthering Heights, and indeed Tristram Shandy, could be considered to have post-modernist features\u2026 But they of course are hardly \u201ccontemporary literature\u201d.) So, HTH. Post-modernism seems a literary genre very suited to the age of the Uncertainty Principle, quantum mechanics and chaos theory! ",

            "answer_text": "In order to discuss literature, let\u2019s start with music. Contemporary music is just that \u2014 the music that is currently being streamed on Pandora or other streaming sites. Katy Perry, Kanye West, and Taylor Swift are all producing contemporary music. Post-modern music does some things that make it both contemporary and post-modern. When, for instance, Puff Daddy (Sean Combs) sampled Sting\u2019s Every Breath You Take on his tribute to the Notorious B. I. G., I\u2019ll be Missing You, twenty years ago, he demonstrated a purely post-modern sentiment: pastiche aka sampling.  Post-modern anything mixes styles and is deliberately self-reflexive. In a sense, it carries a message that new art \u2014 literature, music, architecture \u2014 is composed out of the shards of what has gone before it. Postmodern literature is more interested in focusing on the fiction of fiction than on creating fiction itself. It is intentionally self-reflexive and deliberately ironic. One of my favorite authors, Robert Coover was writing post-modern short stories at the end of the 60s. In a postmodern story, the usual conventions of character, continuity, and credibility are challenged by distortions and discontinuities in both time and character portrayal.  In many respects, I think that the movie Pulp Fiction, with its ability to link competing narratives and to challenge linear time and normal expectations is a typical post-modern piece. Like post-modern literature, it employs a level of distancing through pasting together incompatible elements and stories (pastiche) by introducing elements that are borrowed from other forms and with a sense of irony that overshadows the idea of narrative.
