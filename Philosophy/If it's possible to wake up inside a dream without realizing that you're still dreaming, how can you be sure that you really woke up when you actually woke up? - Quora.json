            "answer_text": "When I think about waking up inside a dream without realizing that I\u2019m still dreaming, I think of sleep paralysis which can be scary. I thought that someone was in my bed and hitting me on the back. I was lying in bed frozen, scared out of my mind. When I have actually awakened, there is nothing which is scaring me, and I\u2019m not frozen to the bed. I can find my crossword puzzle and get busy on it. I can go on Quora. If Quora can\u2019t wake me up to reality, nothing can! I can get some cereal. I can take a shower. Try walking around. Find something to do. Do a household chore. Go ahead\u2014find a rag and get rid of that dust! Sooner or later, you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re truly awake. If not, see a mental health professional. The bill might wake you up! ",
