            "answer_text": "One of the most contentious and interesting issues concerns the nature of mathematics itself\u2014if there were nothing conscious (i.e. us) to observe that there are, for instance, 4 apples falling from a tree, does the 'number 4' actually exist? In other words, is mathematics our way of labelling patterns that already have an existence in the natural world, or do those patterns only exist in our thinking? A platonist approach argues that mathematics has an abstract existence and we 'discover' those pre-existing mathematical patterns; while a constructivist approach argues that we formulate patterns in order to conceptualise both what we observe, and what we are capable of thinking. The issue might be summed up by stating that mathematicians looking for a solution may be creating that solution themselves, discovering solutions that already exist, or constructing a new way of looking at the problem.
