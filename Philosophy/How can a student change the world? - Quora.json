            "answer_text": "You can put various materials on a smart stick or USB thumb drive. They sometimes sell those at convenience stores for about $10. The way to load them up is if you have a laptop with a USB port in the side. Then you can get any type of copyright-free material online, like work on Quora that you attribute to the real author, and put it on the stick. The stick can often store quite a lot of information, more than some cheap computers I\u2019ve learned. Sometimes you can also use a computer at a library or college computer lab to download information from the internet and put it on the stick. You might think of it as a protection against doomsday scenarios\u2014what would you put in storage that might help civilization if you are not sure the social media websites will be up forever, or if you are not sure people will have free access to the internet? It can get a bit boring after awhile, if you have done it one or two times, so you can think about improving your collection of data over time, improving the usefulness and the variety of materials included. One thing to consider is materials by Nathan Coppedge, such as hypothetical perpetual motion designs (couldn\u2019t hurt, right, since there is some evidence now they may work?) and Programmable Heuristics which are methods that might be used to know reality without empirical data. Of course, there are a lot of other things that might be useful too like some of the colorful diagrams on Pinterest or information about health and survival. Chances are these sticks will be an amusing curiosity within 20 years or less, but it is still not the very worst use of your time, if you are worried about what to do. It is something you can probably do while you are at university if you feel like it. Also, I have in the past attempted to give USB\u2019s to other people sometimes, this is not always legal because of city regulations, but you can think of giving them to friends or family, or perhaps a stranger might take a risk on a new-looking USB. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst thing, and in the best cases the USB could end up being useful. Most people don\u2019t use all the data storage on the USB anyway, so a little extra data use might actually serve a purpose if the content stored there is actually useful. There used to be problems with USBs that microsoft would cause computers to crash if any of the files were Microsoft documents, but I think that problem no longer exists, they just require software subscriptions if people want to open those types of files. So, I am pretty sure in many cases USBs are safe even if reused from someone else, unless the person was a hacker or didn\u2019t run antivirus often enough. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you define \u201cthe world\u201d? How do you define \u201cchange\u201d? Society likes to glorify grand gestures and mass movements to make us think that being influential or important means there has to be \u201cbig\u201d results, lots of attention, news coverage, the works.  But. The most earth-shattering changes and acts of compassion and positivity occur behind the scenes, under the radar, in everyday life. The little things truly do matter. And the impacts they make are more effective and longer lasting than grand gestures could ever be. What impact do you want to have on the world, the sphere of people immediately around you? Do you want to help public health? You could study medicine and become a doctor or nurse. But even if you\u2019re not studying medicine, learn first aid so that you can patch up people who fall off their skateboards or little kids who scrape their legs (they really appreciate it). Do you have a passion for helping the elderly or impaired? You can study public health and therapy to help them, but even just holding the door open for them can lift their spirits and lessen the heaviness of ageing . Changing the world is a daunting prospect for a student, but if you change yourself, change your impact on the people in the world around you\u2026.you might be surprised how influential you can really be.

            "answer_text": "By asking your medical teachers to answer the life or death questions: 1. Is there or not human fecal dust* in hospital wards? 2. Is it or not a threat for patients, as causing HA Infection? (99.000 deaths /yr and 1.600.000 cases only in USA). 3. Is there a way to prevent its forming? *\u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left AFTER wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known fatal HA INFECTIONS. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance. It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics. Why a comparison is not made between a hospital, where all the special measures to prevent human fecal dust forming are taken and those, where no special care is taken, as the usual practice is, regarding the HA infection rates, so a safe scientific decision to be made about fecal dust\u2019s role on causing HA infection. On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think, that there are very strong reasons that other interests, than public health protection, are guiding science research.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Students have a unique opportunity to change the world through their willingness to learn and innate curiosity. Since they\u2019re already in an environment and mindset suitable for learning, if they want to change the world for the better, they should become aware of how it works, including what works and what doesn\u2019t work so well for humanity. They can learn that our integral reality operates based on altruistic principles \u2014 where each part of reality, living and non-living, works in harmony and balance to sustain the whole natural system. Students can learn from our past and present mistakes \u2014 the ways in which we act contrary to Nature\u2019s altruistic principles. They\u2019ll discover that egoism \u2014 only showing concern and care for self-benefit and self-fulfillment \u2014 leads to all of our current problems. Then, they can make the world a better place by applying this knowledge to their values and future choices. ",
