            "answer_text": "Another great question that seems easy to answer and isn\u2019t. On one hand, we could examine philosophy an an historical evolution of sophisticated thought that is designed to better understand social mores and folkways, cultural and personal identity, morality and deviancy, socially valued constructs, ethics, and even religiosity. On the other hand, we could make a tenable argument that all of the above is inherent in education. It\u2019s often said that the victors write the history, and history defines a culture. Thus, everything that is a part of education has roots in some form of philosophical thought or premise. For example, Japanese primary and secondary education is very different from that of American and European primary and secondary education. There is no summer break in Japan, they attend school 6 days a week, and students there are years ahead in math and science courses compared to American and European students. Further, Japanese parents tend not to lose to their children at any activity until the child is legitimately superior in skill relative to the parents. Confidence and self-efficacy are a result of failure and work, not fake wining, Not surprisingly, Japanese culture values the process of mastery as much or more than mastery itself, while Western cultures often appear to be on an endless quest for some imaginary magic bullet that will get students to the mastery level with the least amount of effort and the greatest speed. A cursory examination of Eastern philosophy compared to Western philosophy may (would?) explain these massive differences fairly easily. It\u2019s also important to remember that Japan was utterly demolished economically, militarily, politically, and with regard to operable infrastructure following WWII. The West played a major role in helping rebuild Japan while also limiting its military presence. In spite of a deep injection of Western culture and influence, Japanese core values, attitudes, beliefs, and traditions remained (remain) intact. There are no short-cuts to mastery, and failure is both individual as well as familial, organizational, or cultural. Failure is a deviation from the process, and an affront to deeply held traditions. Atonement is a moral and cultural imperative, which explains why the Sea of Trees is a 14 square mile epicenter of suicide among adult male Japanese. One could argue that all of this has origins in Eastern philosophy and is an embedded part of the educational system, even if it is never overtly articulated. The same could be argued for the West. Perhaps the real question might be something along the lines of, \u201cIs there a relationship between how well an educator understands philosophy, their philosophy of education, and student performance\u201d? I think that there probably is a significant relationship between these variables, and that the strength of the relationship is inversely proportionate to how long an educator educates. In other words, educators who understand some basic tenets of historical and contemporary philosophy, and use that understanding in developing their own philosophy of teaching are probably going to quit teaching much sooner than educators who are philosophically ignorant (at least in this part of the world). The ignorant don\u2019t possess the insight to question organizational policies and decisions. They accept, at face value, directives and practices that are handed down from further up the food chain. They accept words and ideas that lack any firm operational definition because they are incapable of understanding the value and relationship between words, ideas, and definitions. The more informed educator is intentional in what they do, they are able to articulate their reasons for doing/being what they do/who they are in the classroom, and they are inevitably confronted with words and ideas that are antithetical to logic and reason. Or, they are viewed as agitating outliers who should find employment elsewhere. They generally do as quickly as possible because what they were told about our collective philosophy of education (which helped inform their personal philosophy) turned out to be a malignant philosophy regarding manipulation and conformity. For everyone. ",

Philosophy, as a broad term, is inclusive which means that anything that has to do with philosophy is philosophical.
