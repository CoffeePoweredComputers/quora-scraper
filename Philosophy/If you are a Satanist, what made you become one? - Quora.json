            "answer_text": "Wow that is good question, thank you Angelica for asking me . There is lots of types of influences can lead some one to become Satanist, many or most people are satanist without even they realize it, satanism is not just sacrificing with blood and worship the devil, you can be satanist in many ways and forms, most people are just a production of Satan, there is hundreds of ways to be satanist, by following the satan principles and character you are satanist, arrogant,selfishness, unfair, hate and so on. Many things around you can lead to Satanism, every thing around you is Satanism or made to serve the Satan ideology, fake spirituality, false religions, fake religious figures, evil controlled media, social disasters, wrong love , instability, illness , dark thoughts, satan codes,evil politics all of these elements and factors will lead the human to be more isolated and more weaker which this all will cause earthly spiritual instability and weakness in the human spiritual defense system making the human more vulnerable for demonic attacks and satanic influences, emptiness also leading the humans to be satanists. It is deeper than you might think it is very complicated issue. I know that many people will disagree with me but still this is my free opinion and i insist to say it regardless to what might some will think. Wiccan as most humans calling it is not more than Satanic movement have its own understanding to the universe and magical powers, it is not a religion, it is just a branch or a way from different few ways worshiping or glorifying Satan through direct or indirect ways developed and not created by Satanic person which you all know his name. When the human glorifying any creation of God and in the same time ignoring the creator it is kind of satanism and this what also wiccan doing and saying. The wiccan is not just magical power but it is also pagan movement has nothing to do with any good human principles or God. Many empty and mentally disabled people around the world following it without realizing the danger in it, it kills your humanity and put you under the risk of demonic influence,nevertheless, practicing or performing any kind of spiritual rituals could be a risky thing even what it seems for you to be positive and good it may contain lethal poison in it, most human problems came by following wishes and thoughts not facts. Unfortunately most if not all people now a days calling them selves witches,wiccan experts and coven leaders are either fake or fraud or mentally disabled, thats why we have now a days lots of misunderstandings and misconceptions about the whole spiritual thing. The modern human are misinformed about lots of spiritual issues even God is wrongly worshiped, there is no safety in any spiritual thing you might do there is not even one real or genuine spiritual master around you can trust , im reading some funny answers here about doing such rituals, those ignorant and selfish people never saw one real paranormal activity in their life and they are speaking non sens living in their down self illusion created by emptiness . Some other people calling them selves priest of Wicca have no idea or clue to what they are talking about im sure they never practiced one real spiritual ritual from fear of being possessed telling you you can do what you want, no you cant just do what you want, this universe have secrets and codes and lows if you miss with it it will miss with you and the impact will be very dark and negative. Demonic influences as an impact of missing with such rituals could take different shapes and forms,it is not always direct possession as you see in some horror movies it could take different ways and faces like mentally influences, emotionally, socially, and spiritually if you go deeper behind the theories and behind the mask of those people (even you) you will find lots of signs, emptiness, lack of social communications, life or social problem,mental disorder, negativity, loneliness. instability, weakness , general fear and loosing self trust and many other typical human issues and behavior. Dont open doors, fill your heart with true faith and love then you will understand how much life is beautiful . I had lots of chances to heal and investigate such cases even some of them are known and powerful at least for their followers i was shocked always to see how do they live and behave, reality and truth never was issue for them, illusion and hallucinations is what left for them this is one of the consequences of missing with the spiritual universe lows . Humans have limits and rolls they should follow it and respect it and know how to deal with it, there is a lot of enemies around you wishing and waiting you to do the first step, protect your self from all these dark non sens and live as you suppose to live healthy and happy and stable. Never believe every thing you see. never believe any thing you think you know,and never disbelieve what you dont see or dont know. Fake paranormal experts and satanist writers calling them selves witches and wiccan priests are spreading wrong information and fake concepts about satanic demons. Do you know how much it is hard for humans to summon and later to deal with demons? such kinds of demons whom they summoned by humans through rituals are the evil kinds and this kind cant be friendly ,maybe it will trick to make you feel the opposite so that you trust it but in the end it will hurt you,summoned demons are not dogs or cats or humans, they see and feel different than you, they react in demonic way . Im getting lots of such similar questions from different kinds of people asking me how to be possessed by demons, regardless of the name of the demon such questions is very clear indication that this person either living under huge stress or suffering from mental disorder, some few known or famous women asked me secretly to summon sex or love demon, im always explaining for those people how risky and dangerous to do or perform such rituals first because most of the names you hear about or read are fake or because what you are reading is not true or it is satanic entities and not some thing to deal with . Again such question prove to you all how much humans still living in the dark ages with lots of misconceptions or misunderstanding to what going around them, of course there is secret ways to summon demons but the question is can you control it or control the demon behavior? i dont help or advice humans to summon any demon because what you will get is evil ones , the good ones are not summoned or unable to be summon through the known ways. In most cases people claiming to be possessed i investigated it appear later that it is just fake claims or hallucinating, in many mental disorder cases the individual imagine that he or she is possessed or hearing voices but after spiritual checking i come to realize that this is just another fake claims due to mental disorder, so i suggest for any one thinks that he is possessed or hearing voices to check first with his doctor, being possessed is not easy thing to say there is clear known signs and symptoms for that to be confirmed beside that demons or more than one demon cant possess one body and i dont know how you are sure that you are possessed by demons and not by one demon, and the way this question asked has clear indications that what the person is experiencing is illusion and not real . In most cases of fake possession claims the person whom he thinks that he is possessed getting angry and disappointed when i tell him that he is free of demons , some of those cases want to push him self to believe that he is possessed, first because he want to ignore his reality, some how he want to be victim of unseen forces responsible for his weakness and his life troubles to run a way from his responsibilities toward him self. Im saying that not to put you down or to be negative with you but to help you. My answer to similar previous question. Again, suggesting or asking such question just prove how much limited the human knowledge about spirituality, most knowledge do humans have is assumptions and or unproven theories or just fairy tales, most if not all people claiming to be paranormal experts have no idea about what they are talking about . I always get this question about ghosts , and im always asking what you mean by ghosts, ghosts is just human invention to identify unknown phenomena, humans are very good in giving names and theories to things they dont understand, i prefer to call it entities or demons or jinn, the word ghosts could carry lots of misconceptions in the minds and cultures of humans , lots kids stories and funny cartoons showing ghosts in fake ways, so ,,,, for me ghosts are not exist, the only thing can effect humans in many ways and or appear in paranormal ways are demons, dont misunderstand me demons are not always bad or scary or evil as you think, demons not always attack and possess demons could have many different shapes and forms and behavior , thats why humans might mix things up ,theories like ghosts, human spirits coming back to revenge, or Poltergeist and other similar theories is just reflecting the misunderstanding of the demonic behavior, so any way , do demons feel any thing like heat or pleasure? definitely yes but are you asking if they feel it in their dimension or in the human third dimension, in both cases it depend on many factors and it depend on how much the entity is involved in the human dimension,if you want to know about heat then not always specially if the entity in the between, or if the entity cant or dont have the right to manifest in physical shape, if the demon are living under the human physical lows with human form or shape then yes it can feel the heat but in different ways and levels, it is little bit complicated because we have different kind of forms and manifestations such as temporary manifestation or permanent manifestation. The pleasure is some thing else the demonic entity will feel it in every and any dimension or situation, the pleasure feeling for a demon is not the same way human see it or feel it though we have half of human population are considered to be sick or not normal like sadistic,fetishists,rapists,enjoying pain,sex with dead bodies,and pidophile. Demons dont have any of those sexual sickness but it is normal in some demonic societies to have what you call lesbians or guy sex, most kinds of demons are simple in their feelings not very complicated and exaggerating with their personality as most humans do but they in some degree enjoy sex and some higher kinds can love and have sex with humans and can be romantic because they are emotional ,other lower kinds of demons have narrow mind and emotions , they know limited feelings like hate,possess,obsess,revenge, the lower types dont have so much sophisticated feelings or emotions as human have but still they have some kind of primary or primitive feelings or emotions .

            "answer_text": "Being an ex Satanist, the one thing that drove me to Satanism was learning more about the Christian/Judaic God. There more you peer into one side, the more God is pushed as this all benevolent deity, only to find out all of the awful things God has done in direct contradiction of this; that was the main thing that lured me towards Satanism. To think that any benevolent deity would accept a challenge from an Adversary to test a follower for a game is cruel for one thing, for God to cast out His angel for not bowing before man because He thought God to be the only one worth praising is one further, to pass not other Gods before Him as He is a jealous God? It doesn\u2019t sound all benevolent quite honestly. And to send down His own son to be murdered in order to forgive mankind? It sounds crazy that this would be a most benevolent act instead of just finding another way to forgive man. These are the most basic of things you find out, and there\u2019s some very strange findings down the rabbit hole. Then there was the system of Satanism itself (Laveyan Satanism in particular), the individual, freedom of thought and expression. The freedom to be as you are essentially. The idea to search out further knowledge of all direction without ostracization, to believe in the Self as something powerful and to lead your own destiny. To use your mind and body as a way to manipulate those who did ill towards you just seems like justice which the system offered too (if you turn the other cheek, you will run out of cheeks). These are all alluring things. Why did I leave Satanism? There\u2019s a lot of manipulation, greed and deliberate misinformation in the whole area, and it\u2019s all used to fuel further greed and power. Authors and groups in all directions willing to hold you ransom for some extra pocket change. It also taught me that God was never an all benevolent deity from the start, God is both light and dark. Following Satanism just wasn\u2019t a beneficial system for me in the long run and I doubt it can benefit anyone long term. Light and dark? That\u2019s just the balance of nature and is therefore a reflection of its creator. It also taught me that not everyone can be saved, and that\u2019s just part of life and death. Only some can be saved and you can never be certain if you will as per Jesus\u2019 teaching. The law of nature is survival of the fittest (or most faithful and lucky) and it seems to transcend into death from the Judaic/Christian system. In the end I chose to pick being an individual while taking teachings from both sides, therefore Satanism no longer served me in this aspect either. ",
