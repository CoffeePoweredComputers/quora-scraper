            "answer_text": "Utilitarianism is a consequentialist system of ethical decision-making. This means that the ethical/moral rightness of an action is determined by the total consequences of said action. In classical forms of utilitarianism, this is specifically determined by an increase in pleasure and/or a decrease in pain for the people involved. In more recent adaptations, such as preference utilitarianism, other values are added; hence these models could be referred to subscribing to a value system of \u201chedonic pluralism\u201d versus strict hedonism. Overall, utilitarians value happiness and well-being, and those actions are considered morally right/good which lead to greater happiness and well-being for the people concerned. ",
