            "answer_text": "There is this idea in Star Trek known as the Prime Directive, which forbids the more advanced Type 1+ civilizations from interfering with the less advanced Type 0 civilizations, since doing so would alter their natural development and potentially result in unpredictable and undesirable consequences. That is cultural relativism in a nutshell. Cultural relativism is not a thing in less advanced civilizations. Primitive societies are only concerned with their own immediate culture. That\u2019s all they know, it\u2019s their whole world. They automatically view other cultures as inferior to their own and / or as a threat. The strength of cultural relativism lies in the understanding that your own culture is not the only one in the world, and also how significant a role tribalism plays in human nature. It offers a sober high-level view of the world. The weakness of cultural relativism is it\u2019s tendency to deny that it\u2019s possible to objectively compare cultures to one another. In my opinion, this is not necessarily a weakness of cultural relativism, but rather its faulty application. The idea is that while it\u2019s possible to measure various cultural factors such as the levels of violence, starvation and murder rates etc., it\u2019s impossible to say which of them are \u201cgood\u201d and which are \u201cbad\u201d without appealing to the values within ones own culture. Thus it is impossible to evaluate cultures objectively. And if you can\u2019t do it objectively, it\u2019s not scientific and therefore pointless. It should be quite obvious why this conclusion is a rather significant weakness, as it obstructs your ability to make any kind of cultural judgment. It becomes impossible to call barbaric practices from primitive societies by their proper names. At the same time, positive cultural developments can also not be appreciated and promoted to the extent they deserve. There can neither be any pride for noble cultural accomplishments, nor condemnation of anti-human beliefs and actions. It\u2019s all just one indistinguishable mush. That being said, I don\u2019t necessarily think this is the only possible conclusion of cultural relativism. In fact I think it\u2019s a rather naive and narrow interpretation. But it is very common for sure. ",
