            "answer_text": "I've been asked by Max to address the question, \"Does all our knowledge come from experience?\"  (Thanks, Max; I really like this question.) There is a big difference between knowledge and intelligence.  Knowledge is what we have learned throughout our life that turned us into adults.  We become adults, not necessarily by aging, but from experience.  This experience, and how we remember it, is knowledge.   Knowledge is what we know.  Knowledge comes from our day-to-day experiences and peoples\u2019 opinions.  Since knowledge is based on opinions, it generates opinions, not truths.  This being said, we can assume that knowledge is NOT truth. Intelligence is our ability to reason, which we were born with\u2026something that we all share in common.  It is what makes us uniquely human - it is our humanity.  Intelligence is the application of the rule and law of truth.  We see it in children, in their ability to be quick to forgive, play together, and act individually and selfishly without consciously taking away from the ability of another child to act for themselves.  Little children do not have a lot of knowledge, but they have intelligence.  Intelligence makes them uniquely human but allows and supports them in treating each other with equality.  Many people are very knowledgeable, but few are intelligent.  This is a very hard thing for the \u201clearned\u201d ones to accept.  They have dedicated many years of their life to the gaining of knowledge, which is of great value to them.  As a society, we have convinced ourselves that gaining knowledge (i.e., getting a college education) is a worthy thing.  This has allowed us to give power to those in our lives who we believe are more knowledgeable than us. Politicians and business people do NOT use intelligence; they use knowledge.  The knowledge they use in controlling our lives benefits them, not us.  The laws they force us to obey are their laws. Knowledge can destroy intelligence.  Our shared, original, inherent humanity is greatly affected by the knowledge we accumulate in our memories as adults.  Children do not cause wars, adults do.  To become united, which is the only way that we will create worldwide peace among us, we must use our intelligence to understand what truly divided us. We have lost our intelligence to the philosophies of men which include ideologies, traditions, religions, judgments and prejudices.  We have been taught (acquired the knowledge) how to think and what to think. This knowledge supports our desire to be accepted.  This acceptance is achieved through the cultures in which each of us was born, which becomes what we have in common.   Knowledge has convinced us that sovereignty is more important than unity and peace, but no child holds sovereignty over another.  Pure intelligence questions how any sovereign group of people can unite with another sovereign group.  Sovereignty is responsible for every war of bloodshed and terror that has ever afflicted humankind.    Sovereignty must end.  The only sovereignty that should exist is each person\u2019s individual right to exist and do whatever he or she wants, as long as his or her choices do not take away from the individual sovereignty of another. The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but imagination.  Our ability to use our imagination like we did when we were children has been stifled by the knowledge that we have been forced to value and accept.  We cannot achieve world peace unless we can imagine it.  Too many adults have been convinced that world peace is not possible and, according to their experience (knowledge), it will never be. ",

            "answer_text": "Does all knowledge come from experience? The question of whether all our knowledge comes from experience is one that causes us to examine all our supposed knowledge and determine how it came about in the first place. However, analysing the conception of our knowledge is not always an easy task. I would argue that in the case of physical knowledge, we need experience from the senses to lend meaning to physical measures, since we cannot comprehend the physical world we are trying to analyse without it\u200a\u2014\u200aand we essentially understand nothing. Although, while a great deal of our knowledge stems from our experience of sensations via the senses, I would argue our knowledge of \u2018necessary truths\u2019 and understanding of other a priori information is slightly different. In these cases, meaning stems from conception of a mental concept, which leads to a definition, an understanding, and henceforth, knowledge\u200a\u2014\u200awithout experience. Sensory information is certainly something that I would argue dictates the majority of what we think we know about our surroundings. Our senses feed everything about the world around us via a biological system by which the brain can decipher information and translate it into knowledge. Everything I know about my current physical situation is brought about by my senses\u200a\u2014\u200athe intensity of the light surrounding me, the heat of the air surrounding me, the sound of processes surrounding me\u200a\u2014\u200aarise from my senses. Beyond what we deem the standard 5 senses, the body produces other sensations specificly to preserve our healthy bodily functioning\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as experience of balance in order to know how to move, or experience of hunger in order to know when to eat. The body creates these sensations from our current state\u200a\u2014\u200aand the physical world around us\u200a\u2014\u200aand feeds them to us in such a way that we know how to function optimally. My understanding of myself as a physical being revolves around the biological and physiological systems that my body has in place\u200a\u2014\u200athese are necessary in order for me to know about the relations between my physical needs, such as moving or eating, and my survival. Thus, not only our surroundings, but everything we know about the actual functioning of ourselves must come from experience of sensory information. The question of whether scientific knowledge is derived from experience is even more complicated, for example in the cases of physics and chemistry. It could be argued that scientific theories, and what we take in 2013 as scientific knowledge, are laws about the world around us that can be taken as \u2018necessary truths\u2019 in themselves\u200a\u2014\u200abecause much like mathematics, they can be proven as the result of formulae and careful construction of logic. However, disputing this, the laws of physics are things that formulae have to say about the physical world. They are not formed via logic, but rather are the result of logically formed calculations. For us to model anything about the physical world, it follows that the physical world must have somehow been the focus of manipulation in our formulae. This means, in order to derive and model the laws of physics, we must have at one point used observations of the physical world around us to experiment with. Interactions between objects\u200a\u2014\u200avelocities, collisions etc. are all physical interactions which must have been observed, and hence experienced by us in order to understand the formulaic limits of a velocity, or a collision. Essentially, we could not have formed models of the physical world without first knowing what we needed to model\u200a\u2014\u200aand this must have come from experience, not any form of necessary truth. Moreover before we begin modelling physical concepts, to even understand what a velocity is, it is debatable whether we must first have observed it. How could we possibly understand velocity and its effects without first having an experience of what velocity means? The word velocity is surely meaningless without an idea of how velocity physically affects us\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially, of what it means to be moving. In more basic terms, velocity means to be moving a certain distance over a certain time. Can we understand movement, a physical concept, without a physical experience? Perhaps this depends on whether we can first comprehend the constituents of velocity\u200a\u2014\u200adistance and time. Distance is a descriptor of length, simply giving order of magnitude. For the comprehension of a physically big or small distance, we must first have experienced any certain length, before then associating the terms big or small with certain distances. Otherwise, without the original concept of length, we have no reference with which to compare. What we have seen in this analysis is that we cannot feasibly understand even the most basic of physical concepts without having experienced them. Descriptions of physical things, or even physical concepts, are meaningless without first experiencing what Hume would call \u2018an impression\u2019. This gives us a reference point with which to base ideas or concepts of physical things. Without our senses, we would have no experience of the physical world, and essentially we would live in a void without the physical. Understanding the original physical concept is key to understanding compounded ideas in the physical world. Furthermore, if physical ideas need physical impressions, we might then ask: do mental concepts need mental impressions? It is difficult to describe what a \u2018mental impression\u2019 could be as an experience, because we are not being fed any information on the concept other than our own thoughts which involve the concept. Thus, can mental concepts exist on a stand-alone basis? Or does the original conception of a particular thought justify a mental impression? In other words, is the first time we think of a mental concept an impression of that concept? This would mean that beyond the first conception of a mental concept, thereafter we can easily remember and think in terms of that\u200a\u2014\u200aonce again, using the impression as a reference. This shows how the thought process might lead to a priori knowledge\u200a\u2014\u200athings we could understand by not experiencing anything physical. Therefore, in the mental case, the concept is still the key\u200a\u2014\u200aonly it can be derived without physical experience. This inference can help us examine \u2018necessary truths\u2019. Earlier we mentioned how we can use formulae to model scientific limits, essentially by using maths as a tool to expose knowledge of the physical world around us. Thus, if maths is our tool to find knowledge, we must delve into the fundamentals of mathematics itself to discover exactly how we conceived it. Mathematics is like a structure of abstract concepts that we have created logically to model quantities and dimensions. These are our concepts: quantity and dimension. Taking the former as an example, we then created structural definitions which arose from the concept of quantity, and we happened to call these numbers. We defined each number as a logical progression from the next in order to verbally convey the concept of quantities. The fact that two plus two equals four is something that we know to be true because it is a sequence that we have defined ourselves. Just as the fact that three multiplied by two is six\u200a\u2014\u200abecause six is three away from three. We could argue that as we define a structure in our mind, and then use it accordingly, we have knowledge of the outcomes of the structure since we created that structure ourselves. Hence, these truths are absolutely necessary because there is no way our logical sequence could somehow fall out of place, or be manipulated for some other means. There was no experience necessary in this process, since we defined every part of how the structure can perform mentally. The concept lead to a definition, created by us\u200a\u2014\u200aand as a result, we have a perfect understanding of the systematic representations that our definition lends to the concept. Applied to our example: the concept of quantity lead to our definition of numbers, and we therefore understand perfectly how numbers represent quantity. To take a verbal example, if I were to define a new word at this very moment\u200a\u2014\u200alet\u2019s say \u2018mort\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aand its definition was \u2018the concept of passing from a state of life to a state of death\u2019, then, although I have never experienced this sensation, I technically have knowledge of the experience because I defined the word\u200a\u2014\u200aand I understand every word in its definition. Therefore, the concept of \u2018mort\u2019 lead to a definition, which I have a perfect understanding of. This process could be viewed as my formation of a necessary truth. This is because in defining a word myself, I have created a necessity that this word is associated with the concept described in its definition. It is self evident\u200a\u2014\u200aa necessity\u200a\u2014\u200athat a word is defined by the concept in its definition. Therefore I can create necessary truths like this with relative ease. This backs up the idea that in the case of necessary truths, a mental concept leads to a given definition, which leads to understanding. Hence, when we go through this process, and gain a complete understanding, we can be sure of how our structure works, or the concept which our definition lends itself to. We have created knowledge from mental forms of logic, using structure or definition, not experience. This is how we can justify that not all knowledge comes from experience. In the case of a posteriori knowledge, we are dependent on experience to lend us reference points to understand physical concepts. However, with a priori knowledge, we are not so reliant on experience to gain understanding of our concepts; instead, we define the concepts ourselves using numbers or words, and as a result, understand these mental concepts or necessary truths. Under the assumption that we can always think in terms of these given numbers or words: so long as we can logically define a concept, we can understand it and know it\u200a\u2014\u200awithout experience.

            "answer_text": "Yes, but much of the time the relationship between knowledge and experience is so indirect that it would be misleading to say it like that.  I think of knowledge as coming from three general sources: Experience.Authority, or knowledge that comes from someone else who we trust for one reason or another...but then where did those sources get their knowledge?Inference, which includes logic, reason, mathematics, intuition, divination, or any other system of rules--explicit or intuitively understood--that predictably derives new information from old information...but then where did this old information come from?  And for that matter, where did the rules come from?As described above, authority (2) and inference (3) refer to something else, and while that something else could be other authorities or inferences, if you follow them back far enough you will always eventually get to a source of type (1), which doesn't have to refer to anything.  Thus, all knowledge comes from experience.  That said, if I told you that my knowledge that the tides are caused by the moon's gravitational pull came from experience, that would be misleading--it comes from authority, which comes from a combination of observational data and scientific inference, the latter methodology being developed over a long period of time based on observations about what kind of knowledge gathering the most accurate possible understanding of how the world works. To use an analogy, if knowledge were water, authority and inference would be the mountain springs and channels cut through the earth and experience would be the rain. ",

But if we had to learn everything from scratch, we would be a pathetic trial and error system. Instead, our brains are preprogrammed to categorize experience and generalize it. Psychologists talk about intuitive physics, and intuitive biology, even theory of mind. Linguists also point to intuitive grammar - you have to learn words, but not how the parts of speech function. Plato argues all the important values are all known by the eternal soul before birth. He was on to something. Many social values are universal because we are a social species. There is variation, and learning from experience can affect views, but everyone already knows what justice is. Beauty? From symmetry, but we already knew that and did not have to learn it from experience. And then there are all the biological functions that would kill us if we had to learn them. How to breath, eat, reproduce, etc. Again, all these can be modified by experience, but the core of these actions in inherent. It could also be called instinctive. Nature or nurture? The answer is certainly both. This is the power of our species. Lots of pre-loaded knowledge, then open to modification by experience. ",

All your learning is predicated on the condition into common word sense, and commitment to the society, or nation. You are a citizen here after all. A consideration outside it takes careful reflection, and is never entirely independent. As far as ground knowledge is concerned, it develops from the past, complete revolution or continuation. Very few grounds stand the history of humans. Very few truths remain constant or classic, and most change with the historical progression. Not all knowledge is based on experience as outlined in education and society. The only analogy suitable here is the notion of a priori propositions, which is unfortunately passed to us in philosophy and history. You need to consider knowledge without experience on your own.

(3) Do you have direct experience of scientific matters (say, the curvature of the earth _sufficient_ to lead to direct knowledge of those things that you know? If those three things are so, then you can say that the things you assert that you know all stem from _your_ experience.

Once you know yourself truly, and demolish the wall between subject and object, then you will literally know everything, as you need to. Simply laying eyes or mind onto something will allow you to know whatever knowledge it contains. Discoveries are a 'indicative knowledge' way of seeing this, incrementally, while trapped in the subject/object duality.  I find it interesting that people don't carry the obvious logic of the fact that few people who research or look deeply into things claim they created or  'made' anything. Usually, they discovered something. Of course, corporations and profiteers and opportunists will do this, but they are merely agents of ego. You can only discover some part of yourself. Otherwise, how could you know it?  ",

Experience here would be species-based learning experience, not the experience of the individual subject, such a view would still ground knowledge in experience. Part of human knowledge is innate and consists in cognitive predispositions. For example, the children think about objects, agents, numbers, space, (See \"Science and core knowledge - Carey, Spelke - Philosophy of Science, 1996\"), and about living, in distinctive ways that do not seem to depend on the details of the child's environment. It was proposed as a domain of innate knowledge. ",

We can't see the fact that a dog doesn't wink out of existence when it moves out of the range of our senses.   When a heavy object falls on my foot, I can't observe exactly how it causes my pain, or even be sure of how an external event like a falling object can give rise to a subjective sensation like pain.    Even the most predictive, most mathematically sophisticated sciences represent more than our experiences, namely chains of inferences about the things we observe.  Thanks for the A2A.  ",

Although it is theoretically possible for a wooly mammoth or a passenger pigeon to be born from a surrogate mother, in neither case will they be raised in a mammoth or passenger pigeon society, which were unique to those animals.

If by 'know' you mean 'know irrefutably, beyond and possibility of error', then I don't know Australia exists.  Nor do most people.  Even Australians: they only go on other people's reports of what the place is called.
