            "answer_text": "You\u2019re absolutely right. If happiness could be achieved solely through mindset, there would be no need to do anything. In fact, achieving such a state would be dangerous, because one would feel no compelling motivation to do the tasks needed for survival. Humanity didn\u2019t evolve to be content with doing nothing. We are what we are today because we evolved to survive. That means feeling fear when there\u2019s something threatening, feeling pain when our body is being injured and feeling good when we acquire something that will prolong our survival. That being said, there are some things that we do specifically to feel good, because feeling good to a healthy degree will better motivate us to do more things that continue our survival. The bottom line, the notion that you can be happy whenever you want by doing \u2018nothing\u2019 is utter bullshit. I think what you\u2019re referring to are people who practice meditation. Meditation may seem like someone who\u2019s just sitting cross legged with their eyes closed, but there\u2019s actually a process going on in their brain with which they\u2019re consciously enabling. There\u2019s a number of different ways to meditate and there\u2019s some drugs that help facilitate it, but it\u2019s not the same as doing nothing. I personally see meditation as a self-induced high. When done successfully it\u2019s often a similar feeling to taking ecstasy. And actually taking ecstasy can make meditating a lot easier and more emotionally potent as well. There was a monk I heard about who was so good at meditation, he meditated his way right to his death because he didn\u2019t move for a week to eat or drink. ",

Because in order to truly do nothing you have to cease to exist which also is impossible that that is beside the point. The point is when you stand, some small minds might think he is doing nothing. NO he is standing there a reason \u2018standing\u2019 is a word to recognize standing when we see standing in action. Yes external factors are truly a factor. We all got 1.5 GB CPUs 16 GB RAMS. Nvidia Graphic Cards 3250 XD . Two 15 inch LG Crystal Display Monitors and my Beats Headphone. But it is nowhere near as satisfying as getting it for free. I earned these possessions with my civilized hard and smart work. ",

            "answer_text": "You know you should be very happy because most people are not capable of doing nothing. Most people have to watch TV, read a book listen to music. If you can just relax and do nothing that's great.You should be little less stressed then someone who feels the need to be always doing something. Many people feel they need something more money, new clothes, better relationships to make them happy. But even when you get everything that\u2019s supposed to make you happy, life will have ups and downs. Today your car breaks down; tomorrow you pull your calf muscle. If you look hard enough, you\u2019ll always find reasons to be miserable. So stop chasing; start living. Wanting more is fine, but don\u2019t forget to relax and enjoy life for what it is \u2013 in the present. ",
