            "answer_text": "I think it is already written, but it really depends on your beliefs. Most scientifically-oriented people still hold some form of belief that humans have free will, which means that nothing is predetermined and we make genuine choices every day. Non-scientifically-oriented people tend to have spiritual or religious beliefs which answer questions like these in their own ways. Personally, I have a more strictly scientific view. Maybe nihilistic? I don't fully understand nihilism, so I won't sully it's name by claiming to subscribe to it. As I understand the universe, all things are subject to the concept of causality, or \u201ccause and effect\u201d. What this means is that, since the very first event in existence (the Big Bang, for example), everything that happened after that was the effect of that cause, and so on. There are predefined rules for what effects certain causes have. We call those rules the \u201claws of physics\u201d, and if they were complete (which they are not, since we are yet to develop a Theory of Everything) then they could be used to predict every single thing in the universe that will ever happen. This is why scientists in the field of physics are often joked about to be arrogant and believe that their field is the only \u201ctrue\u201d science. The only thing in the universe which, with our current knowledge, seems to be completely random and arguably without cause is the decay of atoms in a radioactive substance. And the Big Bang, obviously. There may be new information now, but I was taught that we have absolutely no idea why one particular atom decays before another, making it appear entirely random. Everything else in the universe originated from that first cause; the Big Bang. Theoretically, a sufficiently advanced simulation could have predicted every action we will ever take, and everything that will ever occur in the universe. Other than which atom will decay first in a lump of Uranium, of course. ",

            "answer_text": " Both, Life is already written, as you put it. And we have made our own destiny. We are doing it right now. We will do it again, an infinite number of times.We have already done it an infinite number of times. Each time feels like the first time, like we have never done it before. It is a synthesis of the free will vs. determinism argument. Even though each moment is entirely determined, we are notaware of the outcomes and therefore can and do exercise our free will. There are two timelines in reality. One is finite and one is infinite. Our timelines are finite. We are linear beings in respect to time. We see our timeline as a straight line- birth- now- death. However, our finite timeline exists in infinite time, as a small fraction of an arc on the circular timeline of infinite time. Infinite time can only be understood as a circle. No beginning and no end. Project our timeline forward, after death, along this circle of infinite time. Project it backward, before birth. The two projections must necessarily meet somewhere along the circle of infinite time. One can posit any point on that circle and label it either the beginning or end of time. Meaningless, for there is no beginning or end, Time will move inexorably forward until it again comes to that moment of your birth. And you will be born once again. Once again you will live your life exactly as you have lived it, with no changes, right up to this moment now. Then you will experience this moment now, in fact you are experiencing this moment now, as you have experienced it an infinite number of times. You will experience each moment from now until the moment of your death, and then the moment of your death an infinite number of times.You already have! Whatever awaits you after death is anybody\u2019s guess.But you can be assured that you will return to this moment now.  ",
