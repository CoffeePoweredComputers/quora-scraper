            "answer_text": "Relevant to what? Is government policy irrelevant to the people it affects? No. Are there people comfortable enough not to worry about whether status quo politicians will continue to uphold the system that made them comfortable? Sure, until changes in the status quo start affecting them. Do people losing the very \u201cbootstraps\u201d (uplifting social programs) the comfortable are telling them they need to pick themselves up by have to worry about what happens in their state capitals and in Washington? Yes, if they\u2019re concerned about how to escape poverty. The Bootstrap Evangelists WANT to keep poor people where they are. They\u2019re not serious when they tell others to use bootstraps they don\u2019t even have while they\u2019re stealing those bootstraps away from people. Result? The USA is dead last in upward mobility among developed nations. ",
