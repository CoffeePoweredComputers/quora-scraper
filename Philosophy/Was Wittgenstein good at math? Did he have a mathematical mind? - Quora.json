            "answer_text": "Wittgenstein saw into the foundations of mathematics. He was acknowledged by his original mentor Bertrand Russell to have surpassed him. However, Russell grew to despise Wittgenstein\u2019s later thought, which repudiated and went beyond his foundational work. Wittgenstein\u2019s original masterpiece Tracticus, is still felt by some to have reached the peak in its analysis of the foundations of mathematical (and indeed all) thought. However, Wittgenstein became greatly dissatisfied with it, and after withdrawing from the world returned with and developed a unique way of looking at language and thought. This is to some extent laid out in his three later masterpieces, Foundations, PI, and Certainty. Foundations, being compiled from notes by his students, is somewhat incomplete and flawed although nonetheless brilliant. The latter two however, with slight annotation (especially Certainty) are reasonably clear. PI is his acknowledged masterpiece in which he lays out what language is and is not used for and resolves the mystery of thought. In it, by inference G\u00f6del and much of what passes for mathematical foundational thinking (itself the foundation of, perhaps, all thinking), is as a byproduct repudiated ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Wittgenstein was good at math. He was Bertrand Russell\u2019s student and had philosophical arguments with him about the nature of math. He was good at math in the way that an engineer is. He thought about math in the way a deeply philosophical engineer would, and this set him at odds with someone like G\u00f6del. His critique of G\u00f6del does not challenge G\u00f6del\u2019s thought. It is the other way around. ",
