            "answer_text": "Probably not. It seems that our organisms benefit from complex information processing, and hence evolved a bunch of fat cells into biological computers: our brains. These biological computers count the impulses of sensory neurons in extremely fancy ways, to predict future sensory input, with respect to the needs of the organism. These fancy ways include the generation of a dynamic world model, including a self model, and an integrated protocol of operations performed on this world model. I think it is this integrated protocol that we experience as our consciousness. Consciousness by itself is neutral: it does not want anything, and it does not identify with anything. To make our regulatory processes want anything, the organism corrupts them with an elaborate motivational system, creating pleasure and pain and various impulses, directed on future pleasure and pain. To make our regulatory processes identify with anything, the organism corrupts them with experiences of perspectivity, personhood, agency, a proprioceptive body image etc. Through meditation, we can turn off or modify these bindings, and as a result, may experience out-of-body experiences, depersonalization, loss of agency or feelings that we cause everything in the world to happen, loss of our bodily sensations or the impression that we are one with the universe, with God, with Gaia, with cells, with elementary particles, with another person, with a plant or with another arbitrary imagination. This may feel very surprising and overwhelming at first, but the miracle is not that you can experience not being you, but that you usually believe to be you! I suspect that the idea that our consciousness is a \u201cnarrowing down\u201d of a universal consciousness is often the result of such experiences. But the universe is nothing that we can ever experience: our brains do not have access to the world \u201cout there\u201d, but only to a few electrical blips coming in through our sensory neurons. The particles in the sensors of these neurons do not touch the universe, but are merely entangled with particles that are an almost infinitesimal distance away. From the fluctuating patterns in these entanglements, our biological computers construct a dynamic universe. The universe exists inside of our brains: outside, there is only a pattern generator with an unknowable structure. If we experience that we are the consciousness of the universe itself, we are experiencing our normal integration process that is not properly identifying with our personal self model, but instead with our whole world model. We are still experiencing a representation created by our brains. It is quite plausible that organisms gain evolutionary advantages from minds, that they represent structure discovered in sensory patterns, that minds can be generated by brain activity, and that brains can be evolved by multicellular organisms. Conversely, it is not clear what advantage a universe gains by having a mind, what environment a universe would represent in its mind, what parts of greater cosmology create the universe\u2019s mental activity, and how and why that universal mind would have formed. Cosmic consciousness is a beautiful idea, but it makes very little sense. Individual human beings likely do not partake in the same general consciousness (and how would they know: they have no way of truly experiencing one another; humans know each other only as projections that their brains create based on the available sensory patterns). But if individual humans turn off the personality bindings of their respective consciousnesses, they will no longer experience a difference between self and other, because their representation of their own personhood is no longer privileged over the representation they form of another person. Please note that I do not deny the experience that you are describing in your question. I just do not think that the experience indicates that the universe is conscious. (Even if it was, we could not know.) Instead, the experience of depersonalization (or satori) gives us valuable insights in how our brain creates a mind. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Are we simply the universe experiencing itself?\"  Yes. What else could we be? We can't not be the universe, and everything that we know of the universe is known through our experience of it.  \"Is the universe compelled to do so when it happens to create life with the emergent properties of consciousness?\"  I think that emergence is a concept which can only apply to appearances of physics within our perception. It cannot apply to perception itself. Physics has no perspective without consciousness, so there is no way for anything to emerge from anything else. Physics simply is, it cannot pretend to be something else.  \"Do  we merely think that we are an individual being, yet in reality we  are  all the same universe's consciousness with different, isolated  perspectives?\" I don't see that the two are mutually exclusive. We are individual beings, and we are also all branches of the same tree of conscious experience.  could  reincarnation be a real thing? But not a 'reincarnation of the  individual' but rather 'continuous, and multiple, reincarnations of the  universe itself' thereby creating a new 'individual, first person person  type perspective' of itself, with the creation of each form of life  Yes, sure.  could  the universe be also 'experiencing itself' in a way other than 'the  consciousness emergent in living things?' Does matter experience itself,  experience other matter?  Yes, I suspect that what we see as matter is, in its own frame of reference, an experience. That frame of reference is so alien to biological frames of reference that we might not be able to relate to it at all. I imagine that it would be a very primitive kind of awareness, both very slow and very fast but without any awareness on our human scale of time.  \"Is this something that we can know? Through science or logic or otherwise?\"  Possibly. Maybe we'll eventually build neural devices to step down our own awareness to more primitive levels...maybe we can attach a frog's brain so that it seems like a new appendage, and then the frog's brain could be connected to a sponge, and a sponge to an amoeba, etc. ",

Thousands of years of philosophising and scientific or empiric research have NOT brought us one iota closer to the answers of those big questions you're asking. Heck, we're just STARTING to treat research on consciousness as a serious scientific matter! And we have -at least!- 10 different theories about WHAT it is and what it could be. WE are comparably like those flatlanders who are confronted with phenomena they just can NOT perceive because they LACK the third dimension. I'm NOT saying DEFINITELY that we will NEVER know. If humanity stays in this universe long enough without exterminating itself THEN there might be one fine day when one or two of your big questions might be answered. What's absolutely clear right now is this: Through \"logic\" we will NOT know. Because logic has it's inherent limitations. If you want to know more about these limitations read this book The edge of reason: When logic fails usWe might find out a bit or two via science. Science has already taught us quite a lot of stuff we cannot even see. It  has uncovered realms which have been previously COMPLETELY hidden from us because we just can't see bacteriae or electro-magnetic waves. But we know now that they are there and we can make them visible with certain tools. Who knows? Maybe science will find a tool that can \"detect\" consciousness? But right now we are in the position of people sitting in a car whose speed indicator just goes until 160 miles per hour. ANY speed above that cannot be registered. We need better indicators and better understanding of what's going on if we EVER want to even get near to the bottom of things...Can we EVER really get a look behind the curtain? Is it at all possible?We might find out when we're dying... ;) ",

Before going to answer, I want you to know this fundamental problem in handling such philosophical ideas: \" Those who know (God/Universe/Life whatever) did not explain and those who explained, did not know(about it)!\" Why? Because, it is infinite and so is inexplicable in words which are finite. And whenever you attempt to do so, you go astray involuntarily and either land up in a wrong answer or into more confusion. Having said that, let me try and answer you.Your ideas are all very appealing at first blush and also seem to satisfy human logic. However, what do you think the Universe is made of? Super consciousness? Inanimate? Infinite but with a CNS that can think like us? Is it aware of itself and if so is it then finite with space around? Then what is space? If you consider such unanswerable questions, you will realise that 'you' can 'know' only if you lose this so called individual consciousness and merge with the Universe as one. But, then you cannot  pass that (knowledge/wisdom/experience whatever) on to this world or to anyone. Such is the mystery or enigma of life. Either you are the Universe or you are the individual consciousness. You cannot be both. And whatever assumptions we entertain will most probably be wrong because we can never 'know' for sure. ",

If we accept Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution of life however it began, and we have no idea yet as to how it began, then we have come from simple organisms and evolved into the erect apes, homo sapiens, of today. Whether we are indeed the top of the evolutionary tree is not absolutely certain, dolphins are pretty clever too but are limited by fins rather than dextrous fingers at their disposal and bound by a watery environment. However what is certain is that we have consciousness and we are the most creative of any species on the Earth today. We are most artistic, inventive and compassionate of creatures and yet paradoxically the most brutal barbarous bloodthirsty and cruel creatures as well. The universe is so vast and largely unknown and understood, we can only guess our part in the great play of the cosmos. What you postulate is impossible to answer but nevertheless another possibility in the infinity of possibilities beyond the scope of our intelligence and reasoning at this stage of our evolution. Remember if we accept the fossil record we are not the first conscious creatures given there have been at least two or more extinction events on Earth before our lineage came into existence. All good food for thought. ",

When we consider building electronic versions of our biological mechanical being thats also emergent. We have never seen any evidence that there is a master plan or master planner or master consciousness.  There is no evidence that the universe would care if we weren't here.  In fact, its pretty easy to suffer extinction.   We're just an artifact.  A strange result.  We mean nothing to the universe...  we only owe ourselves and our ancestors that survived against heavy odds.  So our only clear directive is to avoid extinction and maybe find others. ",

When these planets are destroyed there will be no Martian or terrestrial weather. Other planets appearing in the universe are virtually guaranteed to not be identical and to not possess identical weather, making the destruction permanent.   Eventually, new solar systems will not be brought into existence, and all planets will be frozen, or vaporized and then frozen. There will be no weather. There were, furthermore, moments in the past when planets did not exist, when weather in a planetary atmosphere did not exist. The universe without weather proceeded into a state where there is some weather, and eventually there will be no weather again. There were and will be no trumpets sounding or other landmarks besides the appearance and disappearance of weather.   The universe, being a vacuum, does not have large-scale weather. Weather requires an atmospheric system on a planet.  You had best explain why consciousness makes you speak of a connection and a recurrence and a permanence and a universality while weather does not. (Don't mention Deepak Chopra.) ",

Here is the way to 'prove'. On the cosmic scale you don't see two identical stars or planets; you cannot find your clone on the human scale - even your clone would be different from you; hence it's safe to infer that you wouldn't see identical atoms of carbon or hydrogen, or identical photons. Humans have life, so does atoms and photons. This universe is made with lives. It's the way of life. I don't think consciousness is life as your body is built with lives already. And your body doesn't die or wasn't born for that matter. Birth and death are literally assemble by the mother with a little help from the father and disassemble by the nature. What is the conscious mind? It's a mutation of evolution as it appears to me as a deviation from the nature. Read Tao Te Ching and it'll give you the ideas.Tao Te Ching (Taoism, Daoism and Laozism)  Therefore reincarnation is simply a reassemble into a totally new self-consciousness. ",

The universe was created when this God consciousness asked itself \"Who Am I?\". The result has been our universe, other universes, matter, reality, sunshine, good souls, so-called bad souls, lollipops and moon beams. lol Further we are apparently \"drops\" of this oceanic consciousness and as such experience reality on our own, individually, for quite some time til we grow so much in consciousness and awareness that we are able to finally drop both the ego and mind. We can do this on our own or get help via perfect masters. Research the \"seven planes\". I know the bare minimum but that bare minimum has made all the difference in my life. Try not to identify too much with one particular aspect of yourself (gender, social class, disease, obsessions like exercise or sports or nationality).

We are separated by the illusion of diversity, meaning we think we are someone completely different from the other. Physically that maybe true, mentally though we are all 1 consciousness.
