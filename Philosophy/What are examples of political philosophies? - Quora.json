            "answer_text": "A few of the main schema's in Political Theory are: Liberalism (a general belief in freedom socially and economically but lies both in the left and right and accordingly how much the state should recede from intervening - left leaning liberals may espouse more social intervention by the state to allow freedom but right leaning liberals may go for total free markets). \u2192 Liberalism splinters off into libertarianism to market liberalism.Socialism (left leaning view that sees human\u2019s as intrinsically social and wealth should be shared; social good and fairer redistribution is sought). Socialism can be very far leaning, like in some Latin American countries, to being more tame, such as in the UK with the Blair Government. It splinters of into various off-shoots.Marxism/Communism (differs from Socialism in that society is structured to communality the means of production and is left of Socialism with more communal means of wealth rather than redistribution).Conservatism (a favour for organic society and change and to conserve certain values, i.e. British Pragmatism and Values are the centre of the UK but organic change is allowed around these values, such as in government, markets\u2026).Fascism (very authoritarian and ordered governments sometimes on the line of ethnicity).Anarchism (mostly left leaning anti-state theory, power is a source of problem and the state is oppressive).Nationalism: a strong belief in supporting the nation state, can be ethnic and non-ethnic (often seen as a theory that stands along another or in addition to the other theories stated above).Populism: think of it AS GIVING POWER TO THE PEOPLE; it is a strong belief in implementing popular belief (often seen as a theory that stands along another or in addition to the other theories stated above).Religous Political Theories (where religion is taken as the driver of political life, most of the time it adds on to other theories like socialism, conservatism\u2026 When thinking of these theories, think Iran\u2026).Many more but the above are some of the key ideas.Political philosophy - Western political philosophy from the start of the 20th century ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy has a certain structure. Basic branches are metaphysics and epistemology. The central focus is ethics that is built on premises of metaphysics and epistemology. Finally political philosophy and aesthetics are the application of ethics to the most important works of man: social cooperation and self-expression. As theories of reality and knowledge vary thus vary moral, political and aesthetic theories. Political philosophies are either collectivistic or individualistic in their view of society, authoritarian or libertarian in their view of political power, pessimistic or optimistic in their view of human beings. Collectivism is the notion that the individual is subordinate to the collective, whatever it may be believed to be. Collectivist ideologies are: communism, fascism, socialism, nationalism, patriotism, green politics, progressivism, Christian democracy and so forth. Individualism is the notion that the individual should be valued as such and never immolated for the sake of whatever collective one may beleive in. Individualist ideologies are: classical liberalism, libertarianism, capitalism, conservatism. Authoritarianism is the notion that the will of the authority shall prevail in social issues, while libertarianism advocate for individual freedom and responsibility. The most extreme form of authoritarianism is totalitarianism, according to which every walk of life should be controlled by the government (communism, fascism). The most extreme form of libertarianism is anarchism, according to which the state, the government should be abolished and every walk of life should be controlled either by communal agreement in solidarity (anarcho-communism, anarcho-mutualism, anarcho-syndicalism) or by market forces (anarcho-capitalism).
