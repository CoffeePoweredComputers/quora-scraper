            "answer_text": "Thanks, Noah, for the compliment of the A2A. You are precisely right. Art is inherently subjective. And though it somehow seems \"wrong\", professionals in the art field do use their subjectivity when they select (or deselect) and write about art. It's simply that they bring more information to the task, so that their subjectivity has a greater objective platform on which to rest.  As Lily noted, when they look at an artwork, they are going to observe it differently than a neophyte art looker - but not necessarily differently than another artist, or many experienced viewers, collectors or connoisseurs.  They are likely to see the composition of the work, its draughtsmanship and structure, its color balance and skill in paint application. They are going to know how it \"fits\" into the artist's overall body of work, and how that body of work slots into the greater parade of art history. They may also factor in what they have read about the artist and the work by writers or critics for whom they have respect - or don't.  But ultimately, they will make their own, very personal assessment. The  assessment will be defined in some measure,  of course, by the task. For example, an evaluation of one of many landscapes from a particular artist in a regional museum being considered for deaccession is an entirely different evaluation than a critical magazine review of that same landscape. While both would be concerned with overall quality, each has a different context and purpose to consider, meriting special considerations.  Beyond these differences, however, the person who ventures their opinion is still going to end up with some level of individual \"liking\" or respect (or possibly the opposite) for an artwork. And that sense, that determination will be essentially visceral. It may have all this extra information underneath it, bolstering it, but our final judgment of whether this or that piece is a 3 or an 8 out of 10  will still be ultimately subjective, because no one can ever do otherwise. We can each only bring ourselves to any artwork, no matter how many degrees in art we have, or miles in museums we've travelled. It's all we have. Our background, our information, our tastes, our biases. In the final analysis -  just us.  This is exactly why we should never, ever take the high priests' of art opinions for anything more than they are - educated opinions. We each are entitled to the legitimacy of what we see and receive from any work of art. And it has been my frequent experience that an open heart can sometimes perceive more than an illustrious intellect. ",

            "answer_text": "Visual and emotional impact first, technique second, theory third, if appropriate. Visual art is about communication, but it is not a literal medium, it\u2019s about feelings and metaphor and how the content, color, shape, size, media and surroundings impact your emotions. Not always whether you like it or not, but whether it touches something in you, bringing joy or sorrow, perplexity, challenge or exaltation. I can\u2019t stand in front of a Chagall or a Matisse without wanting to jump for joy. Kollwitz and Kahlo evoke other emotions, more complex ones. Botero makes me laugh, Grau-Garriga makes my fingers itch to be busy with something, and Frankenthaler encourages deep breathing. Nam Jun Paik puzzles me, but it\u2019s a good puzzlement. It tickles places in my brain that don\u2019t ordinarily get a good workout. Henry Moore makes me want to run my fingers over the smooth curves of stone, while Noguchi relaxes me into an occasional state of grace. If you get a chance, spend half an hour sitting in front of his Water Stone in the oriental wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Smooth stone perfectly balanced, water flowing evenly around the edge and falling onto a bed of rocks with soft, peaceful sounds. The rough spots that resist the flow. The perfect marriage of vision, technique and philosophy, drawn from rock and stone.  Isamu Noguchi, Water Stone, 1986, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City ",
