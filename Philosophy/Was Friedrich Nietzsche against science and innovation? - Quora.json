            "answer_text": "Nietzsche was critical of virtually everything in one form or another\u2014even (and often especially) of the people and ideas he admired most. He was not opposed to science. Indeed, his earlier writings can sometimes border on the scientistic. In later writings, however, he was clearly opposed to what he saw as the growing tendency to uncritically replace religion with science. And in that respect, as in so many others, he has proven prophetic. ",
