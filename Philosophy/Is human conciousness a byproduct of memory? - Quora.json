            "answer_text": "Great question. It's good to note that neuroscience today has little consensus or direct knowledge of what or where either consciousness or memory is in the brain, or how it works. So this answer can be experientially tested in your own head - no other way :-) Vast alleyways, chambers and halls of individual and collective memory are available to all of us. Yet a memory is only accessed through consciousness. It is there, in an abstract way, but conscious invitation brings it over the threshold, where it can be viewed. So human consciousness is not a byproduct of memory, in the common sense. It is that which makes memory possible. To take it back a step, we could say that there is very little difference between memory and experience. Experience of any moment is composed by where consciousness falls. We can experience a room as a blaze of light and love, for example, or we can experience it as a box full of empty chairs. The direction of consciousness composes experience. Memory is based on these experiences, which in turn composes more experience - more often than not - to fulfil an \"expected\" reality or to ward off an \"expected\" threat. The key player is consciousness. If consciousness precedes memory and outlives it. If it is able to move between past memory and direct experience. If it is able to imagine, then consciousness has a versatile continuity beyond the content that it might bring forward. In a way, it is like silence. We rarely listen to silence - to its special and unique qualities in any given moment. We grasp at the content (sounds). Yet the silence precedes, underlies and outlasts all sound. Actually, without the differentiation of silence, and the space for intonation  and rhythm, no sound would be possible at all. So no, consciousness is not an effect of memory, it is a moment before any memory could form, and it is the medium through which memory is imprinted. ",

            "answer_text": "According to me, in process of evolution, whichever organism developed memory..developed consciousness. But it's not only constituent for it. Other two prior pre-requisite are physical existense (matter off course) and intelligence (in any form which helps organism to survive and grow). Everything around us is made of matter. But everything around us doesn't have consciousness. First category example is stones. Apart from physical existence, they have nothing. They just try to survive. By just lying there \\U0001f609! Second category examples are plants. They developed intelligence to perform photosynthesis, grow and reproduce \u2026 everything necessary to survive on earth. But no memory! They just exist like passive entity. If u cut them, they will grow up again at same place. They wouldn't say, 'hey I was cut here, better I dont grow here again'. But some plants (e.g. Mimosa pudica) shrink when we touch them and comes back to normal after sometime. To me this is very primitive form of memory. Touched-shrinked one state (logic 1) and untouched-open (logic 0) another. Formed due to release of some kind of liquid from its cells. Just with this small memory phenomena, they appear to us as conscious. As if they shy away and close on touched! Third category of organism developed such large amount of memory (bistable) cells which were capable of storing more info. More such cells, more memory, more info, more prior history. It is like data. Now organisms intelligence processes that data and come out with evaluation of surrounding. Initially, this memory and intelligence was small hence it was helpful in just reacting to surrounding in better way. E.g. primitive animals. But with evolution, as intelligence and memory grew, they were able to make more and more correct predictions of surrounding. Their processing become so complex as if they have model of entire surrounding in their brain (based on prior history of each part of surrounding). Based on this model, they can make predictions about what will happen next? But how do I decide if made prediction is in my interest or against. To evaluate that, they came up with model of their own .. which exist in model of surrounding. Predictions are tested against this self model first and then final actions are decided. And voil\u00e0, CONSCIOUSNESS ARISES! Hence, consciousness is product of matter, intelligence and memory. All three are mandatory ",
