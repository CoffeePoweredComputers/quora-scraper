            "answer_text": "Terrorism. I haven\u2019t read any other answer in this thread, so I\u2019m not sure if this has been mentioned or not. When I read this question, this was the first thing that came to my mind and I knew I had to write this. If I could, I would delete terrorism entirely from this world. Every other day, we hear or read or watch about the terror attacks somewhere in the world. Every other day, something or the other happens somewhere in the world where innocent people lose their lives. Few days back, I read an answer written by someone (I don\u2019t remember the name) who was on the London Bridge, an hour before the London Bridge attacks. Reading that answer itself gave me chills down the spine. He had written about how terrified he had felt knowing that he could have been one of those, who got blown away in the attacks. He could have been. But, he was lucky. He had written that he hadn\u2019t stopped thanking his stars that he chose to leave the place of attacks early, without even realizing what was going to happen there. I couldn\u2019t believe what I read. If a person who didn\u2019t lose anything felt so haunted and scared, can you imagine how someone who lost his arm or leg or any other body part in the attack would be feeling? Recently I visited Srinagar in Jammu & Kashmir. There were a lot of people who told us to not visit the city knowing that its not safe right now. We even gave a thought to it, and decided that if anything happens, we will catch the next flight home. We went, and I didn\u2019t notice one single tourist there. We talked to the locals there and got to know that the tourism in Kashmir is going down, as no tourists have the guts to come to such a city where every now and then, curfews are imposed. Instead they asked us that how did we gather the courage to come there. The people in the city, live their lives in terror. They have no idea what might happen the next moment, and when they might lose their lives, or probably be thrown out of the city. On a distance of every 10 metres in the whole state, there are CRPF army men and policemen standing in force. This is the level of the terror. While returning, I prayed to God to take care of the humanity. Only if I could delete Terrorism entirely. ",

            "answer_text": "Every answer here is about religion or tobacco or any other vices. Although I don't disagree with those answers, each of those serves a purpose, no matter how shallow. Like religion, in its stripped down sense shows a way of living, establishing the concept of right and wrong in its own terms, instilling fear and hope in its own right (I'm not a proponent of religions, by the way, but objectively they would do more good than bad, if it were not for their colossally spurious interpretation by humans). Tobacco keeps population in check, whether you like it or not. But the question itself is a little too vague. To ensure the longest survival of the earth to host a livable environment, I'd delete humans. The answer speaks for itself. For social security and harmony to prevail: What I would delete, hypothetically of course is pretty abstract. It's the \u201c gradient of class\u201d Allow me to elaborate. Humans have evolved with one doctrine constant \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. I'm not questioning or condemning this. Superficially it does serve a purpose I guess. But that's exactly what I'd eliminate. Because that is broadly speaking the reason why tiers exist - socially, racially or otherwise. In lieu of surviving by eliminating what's weak, I think it'd have been wiser to nourish and protect the weak. So I'd delete the whole \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d thingy (remember I am not referring to the Darwinian doctrine of evolution, I'm using the phrase figuratively). This way, there's a chance for proactive growth thus very broadly eliminating the need for social \u201ctiers\u201d ",
