            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t regret studying psychology because the knowledge I gained has helped me understand others and has thus enriched my life. However, if you study psychology without giving thought to specific practical applications and goals, as I did, there is a real risk of finding yourself going nowhere. Depending on what you specialize in, you might also have to face consequences of studying such a popular field. In yet another way, I realize I might\u2019ve been better served by choosing a different path. For those with careers in psychology and don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m about to say, it might be because your worldview already matches those of most others who study psychology or the social sciences in general - much like the way fish don\u2019t notice the water around them. However, as a forewarning to those yet to find themselves in my current position, the field of psychology (and the social sciences in general) tend to be monolithic in terms of political ideology. I\u2019ve experienced this firsthand. This never bothered me (as a member of the minority) until people in workplaces seemed to become vocally pushier in the past decade or so, roughly speaking. I personally conducted a pilot survey study on this. Simply put, in more recent times, I haven\u2019t been able to work anywhere within this field (or within social sciences generally) without having co-workers yapping my ear off about politics, their political values, or trying to subtly find out what mine are (i.e., trying to \u201cconnect over \u2018our\u2019 values\u201d). which, by the way, all goes against my culture of origin\u2019s norms of social etiquette.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve studied aspects of psychology independently for years until I pursued it in college. I\u2019ve always been interested in the human mind. My other dream job was to become a veterinarian. But, I ended up choosing to pursue psychology of people as an undergraduate and beyond. I noticed that it was so easy for me to focus on human behavior. If you hold a high degree in psychology, the research aspect grows. Some experiments that have been completed and government funded can\u2019t be replicated. That means the information that we believe in, and base new research on, may be false. There are statistical methods involved, grants, review boards involved in the institution where you work and outside of it. You can lose your license if you don\u2019t take proper steps to ensure your study meets standard protocol. You\u2019d be expected to share your results and get back moderate or excessive criticism. Your work can be flat out rejected otherwise. I know that my ultimate goal is to become a psychiatrist, which is someone who administers medication for disorders. They are also interested in the human mind. I am happy that I learned about psychology because both disciplines deal with human behavior and research. I don\u2019t regret studying it. ",

            "answer_text": "Never. I studied psychology because I wanted to write when I was in college, and I felt that learning about people would help my characters. I also wanted to know more about myself. I took psychology as a minor but I was only one class short of a triple major. I thought about going into the field, but I decided I would rather be the star of my own life than the supporting cast in someone else's life. So many people are so money and career oriented, especially in my generation, GenX. But I have found my happiness and purpose through experiences. I savor life, and psychology has given me a solid foundation for understanding people and most importantly myself. It gives me a strange sense of calm in the face of other's anger, or facing stressful situations. I feel fearless. I know you make your own moods, happiness is a choice you can consciously make. Some moods are just chemicals. And there is no purpose in beating yourself up when there are millions out there ready to do it for you. And most importantly, you can only change yourself and your own behavior. You can nudge others towards the truth but you can never make them change because of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I do regret taking psychology as one of the subjects to graduate that too from a government college. Not because I don't have any interest in it, but because of the faculty. I'm in my 2nd year of graduation and 4th sem as of now. Here we have 3 lady professors in psychology department. One of whom is pursuing her PhD and doesn't even teach any thing, let's call her \u2018A\u2019 A comes, read the notes from her phone, take attendance and leave. She doesn't even engage the students and is biased towards the students who doesn't go behind her at beck and call. Once in a while she asks our opinions, even after that she says we are wrong. And from the 1st sem she is the one who is taking our classes and now we are bored of her. We have a class of one hour. She comes after 15 minutes and leaves before 10 minutes. Even after being through in my subject and answers during exam she gives only 8 GPA and her fans gets 10. I'm quite fed up. Can't even complain against her as our marks, internal(midsem) and semends are in her hand. We have to maintain a record of the surveys we do. Notes are dictated by her in the class. She can't send the pictures of them in the WhatsApp group as it's not the way \u2018teachers behave.\u2019 Have to attend the classes regularly to main 75% attendance rule or else she may detain us in the semends as well as pay the condonation fees. 3 down 3 more to go. I'm sure she is the only one who is going to take the classes for whole graduation. I believe teachers make the subject interesting not the other way around. Education in India is becoming like: Attend the classes, study on your own, write the exams, pass the subject and move on with less to nil practical knowledge. God only knows how I'll graduate with only bookish theoretical knowledge in psychology and no practical knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "Every once in a while. People can be hypochondriacs with mental illnesses as much as they can be with physical ones. I originally started my quest for a degree in psychology because I knew something was wrong with me. I just didn\u2019t know what. So I would read about these disorders in textbooks and think, \u201cOMG! That sounds JUST! LIKE! ME!\u201d Aside from that, I know it\u2019s really important to have a certain measure of self-awareness in order to change. Dr. Phil says something like \u201cYou can\u2019t change what you don\u2019t acknowledge.\u201d I tend to think of this like a blind man wearing a purple shirt and red pants. He can\u2019t change his clothes to match better because he can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on. But the level of self-awareness I have, in part because of my knowledge psychology, is soooo very frustrating at times. I know I suffer from depression. I know why I suffer from depression. But I can\u2019t change it. I should be able to change it. Same with anxiety and panic disorder. I understand so much about myself and the psychology of my illnesses, and yet\u2026 I have been unable to change these things about myself. Thank you for the A2A, Michael. ",

I also have used my studies to assist my personal life as I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, both of which I now self-treat as I have made changes to my life to be less stressed and I no longer live in a mentally abusive environment. Granted I do not have my Masters or PhD, so psychology-based jobs are mostly off the table, but it has assisted me in my career and life so far. ",

I studied Psychology because I had love for this subject not because I was looking to make a career in it. Also, I love the reaction that people give me when I tell them I have studied psychology . They immediately want me to read their mind and study their behavior. I would suggest you take it up only if you like it, its not everyone's cup of tea. ",
