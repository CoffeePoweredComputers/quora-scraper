            "answer_text": "The short answer is: offering someone good reasons to do what you want him or her to do versus forcing him or her to do it at gunpoint. To treat someone as an end is to regard him or her as deserving of respect and consideration, which in turn requires acknowledging and approaching him or her as a rational, freely choosing agent. To treat someone as a means is to regard him or her from the standpoint of your own personal desires, asking in which ways this person\u2019s abilities and resources can be put to the task of satisfying them. Putting the two together, we can say that in enlisting someone to assist us in the pursuit of our personal desires we must limit ourselves to persuading him or her to serve our ends by offering him or her good reasons to do so (for example, by offering compensation). In this way, we treat people not as mere means to our ends but also as ends in themselves, in that we cause them to do things that benefit us (means) by addressing them as rational agents and arriving at agreements with them that all parties find beneficial (end). Below, using people as mere means: Egyptian slavery.  Below, treating people not only as mere means but also as ends in themselves: Henri F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux, Lamartine before the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Paris rejects the Red Flag on February 25, 1848.

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t have what Aristotle described as a friendship of utility. Aristotelians believe there are three types of friendships: those of pleasure, those of virtue, and those of utility. A friendship of utility is one where you are friends with someone because they are useful. For example, you may find that having a plumber is useful to you. Because of this, you might befriend that plumber, but you will only call on him when you need to have your pipes fixed. You won\u2019t hang out with this plumber, and you will not exchange gifts. Kant viewed this as immoral. He didn\u2019t like people just using their friends for whatever useful trait they had. That is what Kant meant when he was describing some friends as being used as a means only. He preferred what Aristotle described as friendships of pleasure. That is what we would describe as simply a friendship in our society. You hang out with these friends, and you might even exchange gifts with them. In this case, you are allowed to take advantage of whatever useful skill they have, but you can\u2019t use them for exclusively that trait. In sum, Kant wanted you to treat your friends like they had a purpose in your life beyond their useful skill. ",

I suppose it\u2019s kind of a thought experiment. It certainly serves as a bit of a check. It\u2019s worth noting that anytime selfishness or bias into the picture, the notion of love, kindness, and charity I think should enter the picture. After all human dignity in the underlying reason to follow the principles in the first place. ",
