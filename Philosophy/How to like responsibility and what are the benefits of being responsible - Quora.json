            "answer_text": "How can I like responsibility and what are the benefits of being responsible? First, let me say I had no choice to make decisions for myself when I was just \u201cnine years old\u201d and why? I didn't have parents that took their responsibility seriously even with five in a family. They lacked having decent jobs, so they could budget appropriately. Plus they gave us 50 cents per week for milk and desert which I only use part of that money to save for school supplies and to have a hot meal at the cafeteria once in a while. Secondly, when you take responsibility for your action you have a sense of accomplishment such as I was able to learn to iron my school uniform and polish my shoes without having to ask anyone to do it for me. It felt \u201cwonderful\u201d because I was motivated to do well in school, even if my parents could care less. I set myself to do well for the sake of my education and knew by the age of 11 that education was the \u201ckey\u201d to a prosperous future. When I tried to explain that to my mom she refused to do her part to educate herself in learning the English Language - and this I know - that our existence was never going to get better because they refuse to do what it takes to be responsible adults. However, nothing was going to stop me and I even got a small errand job knocking on apartment doors where I live and asked if they needed anything at the store for me to pick up. I did get a few neighbors and got tips once I got home. I was by this time 10 years old trying to survive in a home that sometimes we didn\u2019t have enough food for the week. For me responsibility should have been my middle name because I thrived in learning and understanding you get results when you work to do well not just in school but outside of school too. ",

            "answer_text": "Responsibility brings both power and fulfillment, which challenge and enrich us. Irresponsibility is normal for young children, but as a teenager or adult, you are part of a community, and your main responsibility is basic: contribute more than you deplete, and don\u2019t harm or unnecessarily disrupt others. The unnecessarily part is important, since it is also a responsibility in a civilized society to help and protect those less fortunate or to whom an injustice has been done. A good way to feel the benefits of responsibility is to volunteer somewhere that is personally meaningful to you. It could be an animal shelter, a food bank, a political cause\u2026 where you will be granted responsibilities and will feel very tangibly the contribution you are making. It feels good, by the way. :) ",
