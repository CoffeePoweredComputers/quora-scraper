            "answer_text": "A good life is not one where you have a lot but where you need very little to be happy and content. A good life is when you learn to enjoy every minute of it. When you learn to be happy NOW. When you realize that you don\u2019t need to wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. A good life is when everyone you know associates your name or your image with kindness, goodness, warmth and love. Just think how really precious is the time you have to spend with your family or loved ones and that\u2019s why every minute should be enjoyed and savored. A good life is inevitable when you stay healthy, positive and happy. When you work hard and never give up hope. A good life is when you are open to criticism and keep learning every day. Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. When you keep learning you stay young and the greatest thing in life is to keep your mind always young. A good life is when you surround yourself with loving, happy, warm, and genuine people. A good life is one where you have someone to share it with. A good life is when your heart is full of love and you have someone to give that love to. A Good Life is a series of trials and errors and the sooner you accept that the better. What looks like a mistake to others has been a milestone for me. Even if people have betrayed me, even if my heart was broken, even if I was misunderstood or judged, I have managed to learn from everything and never lost the lesson, even when I lost everything else. We are human, we are flawed and we all make mistakes but learning from them, not losing the lesson, is what makes all the difference in the world. Learning life\u2019s lessons is not about making your life perfect but about seeing life as it was meant to be. I read some place that someone said: \u201cA happy life is one spent in learning, earning and yearning.\u201d I tend to agree\u2026 ",
