            "answer_text": "One of many problems with hypocrisy is it accomplishes the same result as spreading boastful lies about oneself. Many people intuitively understand this but have trouble putting it into words. Here's an example: Imagine if your co-worker often lectures you, and others, on the importance of protecting Earth\u2019s environment & being active about it. As a result, you and your co-workers begin to respect him & treat him with respect, assuming he\u2019s passionate about his beliefs & acts on them. After months of this, you witness him putting all of the store\u2019s recycling in the regular trash. Then, on his way back into the store, you see him throw his candy wrappers onto the grass along with his still-lit cigarette. Wouldn't you feel a bit manipulated? He got you to believe he's a certain type of person when, in reality, he's the opposite. All the respect you & your coworkers gave him all this time was not deserved. He basically manipulated that respect out of you all by intentionally misrepresenting himself. He misled everyone with his lecturing, on purpose, so everyone believed he was someone other than who he really is. In effect, hypocrisy is no different than telling out-right lies about oneself for personal gain. The only difference is, it's trickier & harder to detect\u2026 therefore making it even more manipulative than a direct lie. That's only one problem with hypocrisy but I believe it's the one people are least aware of in general. Hypocrites know this and use it to their own advantage. There are numerous other problems with hypocrisy that others have explained in their answers here (for the most part). I, personally, take issue with the self-absorption hypocrisy represents\u2026 the whole \u201cit's only ok if *I* do it\u201d mentality which is indicative of all sorts of problematic thinking. It's that problematic thinking that's the biggest problem of all, not the specific example of hypocrisy so much. If hypocrites are able to tell something is wrong with someone else's behavior and goes out of his/her way to criticize that person for said behavior, why do they regularly excuse the exact same behavior for themselves? It indicates the hypocrite is viewing the world from a very narrow, self-centered perspective\u2026 and people who view the world that way are very toxic toward other people, sometimes unknowingly. In essence, hypocrisy itself isn't as bad as what the hypocrisy reveals about the hypocrite\u2019s way of interacting with others, which is so toxic it can be dangerous. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, it's counterproductive because you're not following up your advice by setting a good example -- this makes it less likely that people will actually follow your advice. I work in kindergartens, and I know that if I tell a three-year-old ''ask before you take someone's toy'', and don't follow that up by adhering to that principle myself, my advice will be ignored. Grown ups are the same, plenty of people feel safe ignoring Al Gore's advice in ''an inconvenient truth'', because he has a big house and a private jet. Now, I wouldn't go as far as to say that Gore should have kept his mouth shut for that reason, or that the friend shouldn't advice his friend to ask that person out. After all, there is a sense in which the advice exists separate from the person giving it, isnt' there? Anyway: in a case when you didn't actually believe your own advice, I'd say that's wrong because it's dishonest.  Also, if you do believe your own advice, but you're being judgemental, and even promoting punishment of people who don't follow the advice, I'd say that's also wrong unless you also believe you deserve that judgement and punishment. An ethical principle that seems appropriate is the golden rule. Do to others what you'd want them to do to you, and don't do to others what you wouldn't want them to do to you. Would you like there to be a double standard that works against you? Do you like it when people are dishonest with you? Now how about that good advice? Would you like your friend to keep it from you because he doesn't want to be a hypocrite? ",
