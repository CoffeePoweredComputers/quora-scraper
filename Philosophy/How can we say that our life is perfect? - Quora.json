            "answer_text": "Clever people have invented several ideas to make human life miserable. One of the most popular idea that is guaranteed to make your life miserable is the idea of a perfect life. Perfect life is as great an illusion, as the illusion of immortality. Everyone who is born has to die one day.Everyone who is living in this world has to live a life which is imperfect.Why should men create an idea of perfect life to make the human life miserable? It is so because happy people are very poor customers; while unhappy people are great customers. If you are happy with what you do, what you are and what you have, you would have no desire to buy anything or go to an expert (including politicians, priests etc.) to solve your problems. Only a man who is unhappy seeks happiness and willing to go to anyone who promises happiness. Therefore, when you make a society unhappy by inventing the concept of Perfect healthPerfect lifePerfect spousePerfect child/parentPerfect citizenPerfect leaderPerfect officerYou can easily explain human misery by telling them that it is so because:- You don\u2019t have perfect healthYou are not a perfect spouseYour spouse is not perfectYour parent/children are not perfectYour officers/leaders are not perfectYour job is not perfectYour life is not perfect.Once you are convinced that your problem is due to lack of perfection, then these people would sell their ideas, goods and services, or expertise which promise to make your life perfect. Then, they make huge money in solving your non-existent problem. The more is the level of unhappiness, the more they can charge to help you overcome your unhappiness. However, all such quick-fix solutions are like intoxicants, which gives you instant reliefs but actually magnify your problems. You are then trapped permanently in their clutches as you have to go to them again and again to solve your problem. This means:- You have to buy the latest I-phone to be happyYou have to go to a foreign destination with family to be happyYou have to purchase more luxurious house to be happyYou have to eat in high-cost restaurant to be happyYou have to shop expensive cloths to be happyMaking you unhappy and miserable is a good business for clever businessmen. Avoid falling into their trap by chasing perfection and seeking their help to achieve perfection. ",

Nobody has the perfect life. We have to work to make our own lives perfect. Let\u2019s take the example of Lord Ram. (I believe in him). Even though he was supposed to become the king of Ayodhya, things did not turn out in his favour and he had to go on exile. During the exile, his wife was kidnapped. He searched for her throughout, fought a whole war, and bought her back. When he came back, he was crowned as the king. But then, he had to abandon his wife so that the subjects of his nation have trust in the ruling head of the kingdom. His kids grew up with their mother, without him. When he was reunited with his kids, his wife was no more. Now, if you observe closely, his life was full of difficulties. He had the option to leave things midway and crib about his situations. But he always faced all the difficulties in his life with bravery and fulfilled all his responsibilities with utmost honesty. Now, if the incarnation of God in human form, had to face so many ups and downs, what makes one think that his life will be a bed of roses ? Everybody\u2019s life is different in different ways. Everybody\u2019s circumstances are always different. Everybody\u2019s problems are different. We aren\u2019t gifted perfect lives on a silver plate. We have to mend things, mend ourselves, work on our relationships, fight our battles, wear a broad smile, spread positive vibes and make our lives perfect. Here\u2019s a famous quote by Gulzar - \u0925\u094b\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0938\u093e \u0930\u092b\u093c\u094d\u092b\u093c\u0942 \u0915\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u093f\u090f \u0928\u093e, \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0928\u092f\u0940 \u0938\u0940 \u0932\u0917\u0947\u0917\u0940\u0964 \u091c\u093c\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0917\u0940 \u0939\u0940 \u0924\u094b \u0939\u0948\u0902.. English Translation - Try to mend a little, it will appear new. After all, it\u2019s life.. Here\u2019s me at peace, living my perfect life -  Source - my camera Smile brighter, laugh louder, love harder, shine brighter, give things your best shot, live your best life.. \ud83d\udcab Cheers, Srishti ",
