            "answer_text": "Philosophy in the modern sense of the term is not an ubiquitous phenomenon. With \u2018philosophy\u2019 I mean the effort of a person, or of a group of persons (a school of thought) to systematically challenge broadly encompassing problems that don\u2019t have an immediate, practical relevance: the nature of man, the nature of existence itself, the meaning of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019, the laws of nature (at the beginning \u2018science\u2019 and \u2018philosophy\u2019 were the same thing: the former was called \u2018natural philosophy\u2019)\u2026 What I want to say is that philosophical thought didn\u2019t start in every civilization of human history. Naturally, any person in any place can at a certain point wonder about the great questions of life (who am I, why am I here) and every human group known to science have developed some sort of religious thought, that tries to answer to these questions and also gives a moral compass to personal and collective decisions with taboos, prescriptions, promises of a good afterlife. But philosophy is by definition at least partially independent from religious beliefs - I don\u2019t mean that philosophers must be agnostics or atheists, but that they try to understand the philosophical subjects (among them God or the Gods) above the level of comprehension of the common believer. With all this in mind, I would say that only three great philosophical traditions were born in Ancient History: the Greek one, the Indian one and the Chinese one. The culture of Second Temple Judaism (from which began the collective work known as Talmud) was incredibly relevant for the developement of Western ethics, but I think fell a bit short from being a true philosophical tradition; obviously from the meeting between Jewish religious thought and Greek philosophy Christian philosophy was born - and from that, the European philosophy that shaped the world as we know it. Rome simply didn\u2019t have a real philosophical tradition; no Roman author invented any original philosophical theory, from what I know. As others have answered, the Roman view of the world was characterized by a strong pragmatism. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Romans weren\u2019t interested in philosophy at all: actually, they liked a lot the two Greek schools that, instead of focusing on metaphysics (the nature of existence, the nature of God et cetera), aimed to free men of burdens such as ambition, fear of death, greed et cetera. They were the Stoics (post-socratic philosophers that met in the Sto\u00e0, a porch in Athens\u2019 main square) and the Epicurees (from Greek philosopher Epicurus). So we have a few Roman philosophical works that, while absolutely not original, are truly great - I think way more readable, and read, than their Greek inspirators. Lucretius\u2019 magnum opus, De Rerum Naturae, is a didactical work written to divulgate Epicureanism to the Romans - also the poet Horace was an Epicurean, and one of his verses is famous to this day: Carpe diem (usually translated as \u2018seize the moment\u2019, in the context of the poem it\u2019s an invitation to not worry to much about the future). And the most beautiful Stoic writings are not the ones by Zeno, the founder of the school, or Epictetus, but the Letters to Lucilius and De Tranquillitate Animi by roman philosopher and politician Seneca, and the Meditations written by no less but an Emperor, Marcus Aurelius.

            "answer_text": "Greek society, just like the current ones, produced many different approaches to philosophy ,from natural philosophy ( which became physics in our time ) to ethics and more. Greek philosophers, especially Aristotles and the stoics had the more severe impact on Romans wich only follow these philosophical currents. In general, Romans didn\u2019t excel in humanitarian studies but in applied science. The difference of thinking between them can be shown by an example: Venus of Milos in greek is \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1 ( something that gives you joy). In latin is a statue ( something that stands ).This is an a2a, thanks Tudor! ",
