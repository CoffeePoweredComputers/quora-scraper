            "answer_text": "If it wasn\u2019t Ashton Hennessy who asked the question, I would probably have given a snootier answer. Probably the most conspicuous of the modern theological perversities and abuses is of the term \u2018racism\u2019. \u2018Racism\u2019 is a retroactively defined phenomenon, in light of the theories of the nineteenth century and the political events of the twentieth. Prejudice, soft and heavy, on every subject was not the exception but the rule in the pre-modern world, where only theological thought was regulated, but not that of social life. Social life itself may have been\u2014but not theories about which social faux pas\u2019s are in fact the spiritual ones. The racialism of the late nineteenth century hit a declining culture like a perfect storm. The spiritual vacuum preceded the political one, and religious nationalism gives way only too easily to racialism, which is not even a refutation of its legitimacy, but just such an obvious and inevitable workplace hazard. The savageries of the holes in the state and church\u2019s collective efforts to provide for the community were suddenly losing their theological \u2018cover\u2019, and the awkwardness of the intense and truly spiritualized inequality of Europe\u2019s world order were worsening just as that cover was slipping. The \u2018theologized\u2019 racism of the era was not so much more easily dismissible than any other political heresy, certainly not before the World Wars; and it offered an effortless spirituality alongside a license to pillage. People calling not only mere prejudice \u2018racism\u2019, but trotting it out as a lever with which to gauge the acceptability of someone\u2019s thought is like the Monty Python level depths of the Medieval excesses. It\u2019s not really my style to include photos, but look at some of photographs of the death camps made by the liberating armies. That is what racism is; it is grotesque to be flippant about or wield it as a rhetorical weapon. Even by his own standards, many of Nietzsche\u2019s remarks on most \u2018populations\u2019 are best understood as almost tongue in cheek, not at all because he was not serious, but because his ferocity was a quirk of his shtick; in part true to who he was, but in larger part a feature of a lingering desperation to be cute, clever, understood, admired, exactly as he knows just that is impossible. So was he kind of jerky, wildly prejudicial even by the standards of the time, even, I dare say, a bit Germanically c*nty? Certainly. But the question of whether Nietzsche harbored a categorical hatred of Africans, Asians, Semites, or anyone else does not bear examination. Nietzsche lived, fatally, in a world of abstractions; and he really did see these categories as closer to fictional characters in the drama of history, rather than working models of what any human being was likely to be.

            "answer_text": "No, he wasn't. he was proud of his nobility blood and his thoughts were philosophy of nobility, but he wasn\u2019t racist. he wanted to be western Buddha, after God was dead, he even wanted his philosophy became the new \u201creligion \u201d, that means he had God complex. you know, God loves everyone, how could he was a racist ? racism was based on the reality that Europeans created modern world, while Nietzsche was rebelling philosopher, he criticized modernity. as philosopher, Nietzsche was influenced by eastern thoughts, especially Indian culture, so he had broad worldview, with knowing other cultures. he wasn\u2019t narrative like the racist. as culture specialist, he knew about human\u2019s development well, he didn\u2019t really think Europe could always be advanced, in his philosophy, there is concept called \u201cthe last man\u201d, which predicted the crisis of Europe, so Nietzsche said his books were written for people hundred years later. then his thoughts influenced Spengler and his <the decline of the west>.
