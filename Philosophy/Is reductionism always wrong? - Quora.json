            "answer_text": "Reductionism has been incredibly successful at drug discovering in the health sciences. It\u2019s more in the realm of philosophy and analysis of truth using critical thinking that should be wary of reducing too much. Even Ocaham realized this when he articulated his most famous Razor. The challenge is that as you reduce the complexity. For instance, if you say or implicitly assume a phenomena is \u201c just biology.\u201d It\u2019s likely going to ignore physics and chemistry. The same challenges exist in organizations that ignore systems theory or complexity in organizations. One example of that reduction is arguably the incompleteness of drugs in treating mental health issues. The solutions from medicine to mental health issues is haphazard at best. Not to mention, if you don\u2019t understand human behavior in terms of psychology, rather than biology alone, you\u2019re likely to miss a much fuller and richer view. Here\u2019s an actual thought experiment\u2014actually roughly three: Imagine taking a masterpiece and slowly increasing the size of the pixels\u2014with a kind of blur effect. Now imagine doing the same thing but doubling the size of the pixels each time. At some point you can\u2019t even recognize the picture any more. The details have faded. It\u2019s all a blur.The other way of looking at this\u2014and one that might be truer to the notion of reductionism is taking a 2 x 2 inch square to being the whole picture, which is clearly fallacy with 99.9% of most art.Take a masterpiece and remove all the colors that weren\u2019t blue one by one. And then you are just left with blue and white. That\u2019s a literal metaphor of a reduction in my view.This is a fuller explanation of the disadvantages of reductionism: Nathan Ketsdever's answer to What is the disadvantage of reductivism in science?

            "answer_text": "Reductionism was a few baby steps into trying to understand how things worked but that was before we started to realize that all parts in an assembly could be communicating with each other and we simply did not, yet, have the proper tools to know what they are. When biologists finally started to accept that cells within the body did seem to communicate with each other, a mixture of Philosophy and Science allowed some to start to re-vision how living things really worked; but that brought up a problem with those where taught, and still believed (some still do because they refuse to update their outdated knowledge) that fields really did connect cells, not just in local organs but throughout the body and even beyond. In mechanical systems, think of Einstein\u2019s \u201cstrange action at a distance\u201d as a touchy subject with some elderly and outclassed don\u2019t understand new research. As we try, harder and harder, to determine how things work at the galaxy and universe levels, we are having to at least start to wonder if the whole universe is primarily information field and Energy/matter a very small component of all that is. So, reductionism is badly outdated and not a reliable way to seek out interactions between components of large assemblies, unless you add a function (or more) concerning inter-item communication through fields not yet accepted by some outdated types! Many brilliant, young types start out assuming that this is a universe where information fields are primary. Their bureaucratic superiors get angry at them, though, and they often need external research support to do competent work! BTW, if we were more accurate, all of our knowledge and protocols are likely wrong; or at lease partly false! ",
