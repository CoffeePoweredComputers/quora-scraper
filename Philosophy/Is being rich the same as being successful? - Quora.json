            "answer_text": "Obviously being richer is being successful...But richer is a type of a parameter on which we can say the person is successful or not but not all the time.There are many factors on which success depends.For every individual meaning of success is different.Someone wants to rich or someone wants to be satisfied.There are many great leaders who are very successful but not rich..Many enthusiastic man who have created a history by living in a simple way of life..Success means a feeling of a positive energy ,a feeling of a deep sensation which fills the body with a bloom and the body starts to flow with full of confidence..Some times success is small and sometimes success is big...We all are successful at a levelSomeone is more successful and someone is less.All that matters is we are satisfied or not..For me success is satisfaction...I am satisfied or not..Wether others think I am a failure...There is also time dependencySmall time success and big time success..Success is a output of your labour..It shows what you have done in your past. Being richer is being successful but always not..We cannot say that when a individual is rich then he or she is successful.. The moment when you are attending a seminar and among many peoples you have guts to put your views and shortly you heard a clapping sound for you..that's success. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people assume and believe that, becoming rich is life\u2019s ultimate goal. But it\u2019s not the truth. In this modern era, many of the things have changed and moral values have lost their way out. People tend to become jealous and they eventually develop an interest towards the money so that they can live a luxurious life compared to others. But people should realize that, the success on their life depends on how peacefully they live their life without jealousy, anger, hatred and other bad qualities etc.,. If you think your life is peaceful and you\u2019re happy enough, then YOU\u2019RE ALREADY SUCCESSFUL. ",
