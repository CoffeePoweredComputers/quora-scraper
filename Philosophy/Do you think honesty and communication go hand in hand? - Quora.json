            "answer_text": "In my opinion the answer is yes. Communication is essential to communication because it is so easy to lie by omission. This is an example taken from wikipedia \u201cLying by omission, otherwise known as exclusionary detailing, is lying by either omitting certain facts or by failing to correct a misconception. In the case of the former, an example of this would be a car salesman claiming a car to have amazing fuel economy while neglecting to mention that it has no engine and is completely immobile. In the case of the latter, it could be a situation in which a misconception exists that the claimant is aware of but fails to correct, such as a person who wanders around a hospital dressed as a doctor, offering treatment while failing to mention that she is in fact just getting a kick out of pretending to be a doctor\u201d Tactics like this can be used to avoid an explicit lie but they are hardly honest. Allowing someone to believe something that you know not to be true is a breakdown in communication. The above examples are extreme by design, there are many shades of grey between complete honesty and a downright lie. My point is that without complete communication you could be inadvertently lying to someone without even realizing it. ",
