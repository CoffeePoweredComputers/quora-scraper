            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not 100% certain what this question means. I\u2019m interpreting it as: Does inventiveness and futuristic-vision usually encompass ideas around science and technology? Inventiveness: Inventiveness exists along many axis. Examples would include personal relationships, business models, social models, economic models, and political models. When we describe \u201cinventions\u201d we are most frequently describing new manufacture-able objects, but I don\u2019t believe that inventiveness has the same constraints. Futuristic-vision(Foresight): Science-fiction has existed since at least the early 1800s with Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. It made giant leaps in the late 1800s with Jules Verne and HG Wells works. Superficially most science fiction is about technology, if you peer below the surface of that science fiction is just as frequently about social, political and economic change. Neither Inventiveness nor foresight typically deal with science and technology. But because the inventiveness and foresight related to technology is more concrete it is often easier to see. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Science and technology gives you solid proof. Either it works or not. Elon Musk's car goes to the space or not. The astronauts reach the space station or not. The missile reaches it's target or not. Very tangible. You have a Covid-19 vaccine that is very effective or not. You can look at the proof, data and can see and feel/ touch with your real senses. But that is not the case with humanity and social sciences. It is perspectives, attitudes, and emotions. I may like Broccoli. You may not. You may like fish. I don't. Someone likes theatre, while another likes rock, another likes heavy metal and someone else hates music. So many people, so many perspectives. Above that their culture, viewpoints, attitudes, perspectives. It is a mixed bag. Very intangible. You can just feel it with a lot of spectrums and ranges. Also it is about humans. You don't want to do social or economic experiments and find humans basically suffering. So, people don't get into social/ humanities/ psychological experiments. Also when humans come, then ethics and laws come along with it. You just can't or should not do experiments on people. That is how bioethics started in the first place. In science and technology experiments many times humans come only in the very late stages, if you have to send a human to space or test the vaccine. So, futuristic ideas, inventiveness and 'almost crazy' ideas happen with Science and technology. All the very best! Regards, Swaroopa. ",
