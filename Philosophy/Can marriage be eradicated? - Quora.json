            "answer_text": "It can if people stop fighting for it. Many are trying to say it is an ancient tradition, just an old fashioned social construct, that it's another way men hold women back. There was a study done between the ages 12-25 of thousands of people 83% said they would like to marry the person they will be married too their whole life, 70% said they didn't think it was possible. This was not a study for people of any specific religion, many claimed to not follow or believe any faith. Eradicate - completely destroy or put an end to. My belief. God gave us marriage. He had a specific idea and plan in place. We have been changing and manipulating it. I see kids in my children's elementary school \u201cdating\". From what I've seen they are practicing divorce. I've heard \u2018well I like this other person more but whatever reason they won't go out with me. So, I'm dating so and so instead.\u2019, \u2018(s)he was dating these people at the same time', \u2018they were gay and dating each other but now they are straight and dating boys again', \u2018popular girls are the ones that kiss the most boys,' and much more. We are failing to set good examples at home and be husbands and wives how we are suppose to. Titus 2:2-8 2 Teach the older men to be temperate,worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance. 3 Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. 4 Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, 5 to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God. 6 Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. 7 In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness 8 and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us. ",
