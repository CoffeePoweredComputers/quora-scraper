            "answer_text": "The answer to this is a bit more complicated than you might think. Most of the time, the answer is a hard no. Since opening the Snap Map from the camera display shows everyone\u2019s location on your map, it\u2019s tough for Snapchat to actually display who has viewed your location. Just because someone scanned by your Bitmoji on the map doesn\u2019t mean they were actually checking out your place in Snap Map; instead, they might have been looking to see a different person\u2019s location, or no specific person\u2019s location at all. They might have even opened the map by accident when sliding their finger on the screen.  When you open the app, your location will automatically be updated. After about five to six hours of leaving the app unopened, your location will be deleted from the app. It\u2019s possible to check the location of someone on the map through both the Snap Map itself and the profile of the Snap user. If the map doesn\u2019t appear for someone on Snapchat, it means they either have Snap Map disabled, or they haven\u2019t used the app for over six hours. However, Snapchat does have a feature that displays when someone travels from one location to another, using time and distance to calculate whether they moved by car or plane. This travel feature is viewed independently by selecting the travel card from the bottom of the display, and shows a dotted line from the original place to the new place the person followed.  When you view this, you do not directly alert or notify the person whose trip you\u2019re tracking you\u2019ve done so. However, on the profile display inside Snapchat, if you scroll to the bottom, you\u2019ll see that, when traveling, Snapchat treats your movements like a story within the app itself, and that includes being able to see who viewed your specific movement on the map. Clicking on the listing shows exactly who viewed where you went. So, while you can\u2019t see everyone who saw your location on the Snap Map, you can view who has looked at your recent travels, whether hopping from city to city or flying halfway around the world. Still, as a privacy setting, we need to reiterate that it\u2019s impossible to see who\u2019s checking your general Snap Map location, which is why it\u2019s important to make sure you have the app set on the privacy settings that make you feel most comfortable. If there\u2019s someone you don\u2019t want seeing your location, you should exclude that person from the list. Likewise, if there\u2019s only a small group of people you wish to allow access to your location, it\u2019s easy to select just a few names from your friends list. And of course, if you want no one to access your location, Ghost Mode makes it easy to hide your location from everyone on Snapchat, either for a limited time or until you turn off the setting.

            "answer_text": "so after some digging and light research it seems like the general consensus is no. and yes. (keep in mind, i do not have this app so i\u2019m not sure how every detail works; this answer is made up of summed up answers i found and context clues and a little guessing at how the app functions) it seems like if you (or someone else in this case) look at your snap map, no one will know. however if you tap on someone\u2019s bitmoji, or someone taps on yours, they can find out. by going to the settings icon while on your snap map, you should be able to find who tapped on your bitmoji. (a list with who has viewed your location should appear) additionally, if you have moved, and the dotted line from point a to point b appears you can see who has viewed your travel: \u201dHowever, on the profile display inside Snapchat, if you scroll to the bottom, you\u2019ll see that Snapchat treats your movements like a Story.
