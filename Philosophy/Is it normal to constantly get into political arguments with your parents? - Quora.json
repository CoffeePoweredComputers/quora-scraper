            "answer_text": "It may not be normal, but there is nothing wrong with it at all. The problem is, most people find it difficult to set their emotions aside when they are arguing, particularly about political issues. But if it\u2019s healthy, intellectual debate, that\u2019s wonderful! We all need to be able to think critically, evaluate and defend positions, and engage with opposing views. Political dissent within the family is a perfect defense against ideological echo chambers, since, more often than not, our family and close friends tend to reinforce our existing views instead of challenging them. My family is like yours. We all follow politics and love debating policy and economics. It probably doesn\u2019t happen in most families (except for people who argue about politics for the sole purpose of rebelling against their parents). But it\u2019s great that you and your family do this and that you\u2019re all fine with it. ",

If politics is the ONLY THING u R currently arguing about I would lean towards it being a sign of the times and the current political agenda ! And people who tell u political arguments don't happen in their house aren't paying attention !! ",
