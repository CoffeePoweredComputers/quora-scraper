            "answer_text": "I agree that evil is a learned construct - however I also agree that some can be born with deficiencies or damage to the areas of the brain that control certain emotions. For example if a 7 year old child decides to set his puppy dog on fire - most people would consider that as evil - but the child might lack the faculty to feel the animal's pain or see the value of the dog vs. the pig that was on the BBQ yesterday. Just to follow that particular line if thought a bit further \u2026\u2026 do people think that the people in the Asian countries who eat cats and dogs and other animals considered as domestic animals elsewhere - as evil people? So unless the areas of the brain have a deficiency or is damaged, then a perfectly normal young child can learn the behaviours commonly associated with evil as a construct from - parents - siblings - community - TV - movies - games - books - Internet\u2026\u2026. Etc etc etc. Remember normal behaviour is what the majority of people in your - community - state - country etc decide it is and to what extent they'll tolerate deviances from their commonly shared and tolerated construct of normality. So canabilism could become normal if enough people decide it is. Do some reading jn sociology about reality and construct and society's constructed values etc. ",

Because throughout time, until recently, being anti-social was very bad for your survival and for passing on your genes. The rest of the social group would just kill you. You need to contribute to the group or you will be killed. This is why humans are the way they are (social creatures). However, every generation variation produces more people with an anti-social bent. This causes the extreme cases, with a little environmental help, to become the evil people we all know. If they don\u2019t get environmental help (think your evil uncle George) , then they are locally evil and history does not record them. So, very much yes, evil people are born every minute, most of them won\u2019t kill you but they will make you miserable. As soon as you realize it - stay away, you can\u2019t kill them nowadays. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very controversial subject, but I will give you my take on it. Human beings are unpredictable creatures. We scrutinize other human\u2019s actions and gestures starting from the day we are born. We may incline to mimic or avoid these imbibed gestures hence to be or not to be evil. A child may observe unfavorable characteristics in his/her parent\u2019s behavior, and may, most likely reflect these characteristics in his/her own behavior depending on the child\u2019s own sense of morality. \u201cEvil\u201d may also be linked to mental flaws or trauma, or it could be linked to avenge or revenge, thus showing the individual\u2019s capability to commit \u201cevil\u201d. Now, the nature of being \u201cevil\u201d must, without question, have relation to one\u2019s background and/or mental sanity and plainly the sense of good/bad. The view of \u201cevil\u201d may differ by what is considered evil and on what degree the evil is displayed. But what I believe is that nobody is born \u201cevil\u201d, rather grown to be \u201cevil\u201d. ",

God gives us a way to overcome this. Galations 5:16 \"So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won\u2019t be doing what your sinful nature craves. 17 The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants..........19 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, 21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.\" ",

Whether we\u2019re actually born evil, born good, or born partly good and partly damaged, in the end it all adds to the same thing. If you\u2019re human and alive, you need to be TAUGHT to be good. You do NOT need to be taught how to lie, kill, steal, etc. This is all due to the fall of man. Only the real God of the Bible has the answer to these questions. Much of human philosophy considers evil to be natural - and therefore negates evil as being evil. Only God tells us the Truth. I pray that you believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and call upon Him for salvation. :) <3 ",
