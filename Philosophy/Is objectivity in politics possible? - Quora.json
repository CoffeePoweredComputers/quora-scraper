            "answer_text": "Yes, but it takes more work than people are willing, and often able, to put into it. While there is no PURE objectivity, one can attain sufficient objectivity. Especially, groups can. To be objective, I should first identify all my relevant biases. This is hard and most people can\u2019t do this, because they think they see truth. Then comes fact-finding. Often, people who are really interested in the facts do a pretty good job at this, including most journalists. Still, bias can be found, so I then look for those. It\u2019s important to study the facts until it seems like no one is to blame. Certainly there are people that cause lots of things, and there are irresponsible acts and decisions. But an objective point of view is impossible while one is passionate, while one is feeling that certain groups are right and certain ones are wrong. The result of this should be a concise summary of the issue, plus the details. It needs to be concise, because that\u2019s all most of us can hold in our head at any time. But you need to be able to revisit the details as well. Once I have a good, objective handle on the facts, I should identify the range of biases for an issue and look at the issue from each point of view. It\u2019s challenging to do this decently, and very hard to do it thoroughly. From each point of view, I should review the summary and the details and see where it makes me, that is, the view, right or wrong and see if the assessment is fair, or needs embellishment. So, it\u2019s a lot of work. One way people do this faster is to consult with people who have a range of viewpoints. This is good, especially as a check, but rarely do these people represent the full range of biases. Better is to check that they represent the full range of biases and run the whole issue- summary and details by them, to see what\u2019s missing. On the other hand, SOME objectivity is easier to attain. But we don\u2019t really have an objective measure of objectivity, so it\u2019s challenging to know whether you\u2019re objective. One telltale sign is that you realize your original viewpoint was limited and in some ways, wrong. Objectivity takes discipline. Especially, we tend to overlook cultural biases that most of us have. This is how a committee of 20 Congressmen can come up with so hellishly biased bills, they share so much bias that they just can\u2019t see it. ",
