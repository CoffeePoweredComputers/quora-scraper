            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. If the axiom does not relate to the theorem being proved, then there is no justification for it. The axiom would be justified if you cannot prove the theorem without it - that may be hard since it depends on you being sure you can\u2019t prove the theorem without the axiom. You also need to show that the axiom is not redundant, that is the axiom is not implied by other axioms. ",
