            "answer_text": "From my readings, these have usually targeted anything within postmodernism itself that looks like grand narrative. Tl;dr if postmodernism says that stable truths do not exist than why should we trust it to tell us anything like stable truths, which it seems to do? The most common critique is that it is a grand narrative to claim that, universally, it is true that there are no grand narratives, only particular perspectives that get taken to be universal. The issue is whether that claim is itself universal and therefore postmodernism is self contradictory. While it\u2019s a neat logical trick, it seems too superficial a critique \u2014 we need to think through whether the type of general claim postmodernism makes is on the same order as those grand narrative structures it critiques, and I am not convinced the too are all that similar.
