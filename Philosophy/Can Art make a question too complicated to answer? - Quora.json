            "answer_text": "The object of Art is not to ask questions or even to answer them but to get the observer to think and feel. Real Art should invoke a feeling about the subject of the art and draw an opinion about the subject matter. In a portrait you should draw an opinion of what type of person is in the portrait you should get a feeling for what type of person is portrayed, this feeling can be accurate or false but is not an answer just a feeling. In a landscape you should get a feeling for the location either good or bad not an answer to any question about the location just a feeling for the location you are looking at. All art is the effort of the artist to feel or see something from his/her perspective and feel what he/she feels or sees. Art does not ask or answer questions but may make you face questions you have abut something and then try to have you answer your question. ",
