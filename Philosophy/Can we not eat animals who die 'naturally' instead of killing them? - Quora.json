            "answer_text": "Living things who die naturally, do so either after being perturbed by a disease or through plain old age. You don't want to be eating the flesh of a diseased animal. And you can't eat those who die of old age die because you don't know how long it has been since the death and what parasites have infested the body since then. Either ways, I don't think it is a healthy choice. As for the moral choice, it is not right to eat animals.  P.S. - I am a non-vegetarian with really wobbly morals. (-_-)  ",

            "answer_text": "People living in caves were not mainly scavengers: they were hunters. For a reason. The reason may be that our bodies are not well adjusted to deal with all kind of growing stuff in a dead corpse. Also, they didn\u2019t survive grazing land. We tend to forget it and invent new rules: all good as long as they don\u2019t contribute to self extinction by protecting other species. And if they do lead to self destruction, we may as ourselves what exactly makes us do so. Did something go wrong with our evolution\u2026 maybe that\u2019s how the dinosaurs disappeared also? Maybe at some point they decided they don\u2019t want to be mean and eat their environment anymore? ",
