            "answer_text": "First of all, there is no IQ test to doing philosophy. If you are capable of understanding basic abstract concepts\u2014which most people are\u2014then you are capable of doing at least the most basic philosophy. In David Leigh's answer to Is philosophy only for philosophers? he asks if football is only for footballers\u2014\u201dof course not\u201d he replies. If by \u201cphilospohers\u201d you mean \u201cpeople paid to do philosophy\u201d then no; all humans need good philosophy, and many of them participate in philosophizing. However, I would argue that anybody who engages in philosophy is acting a philosopher. Is baking only for bakers? Yes: so long as somebody is undergoing the motions of baking, they are acting qua baker. It would be nonsensical to call somebody who is baking not a baker, because the very definition of a baker is someone who bakes. In some sense, however, even a professional baker who is sitting at home watching television is not a baker, because, during that moment, they are not acting as a baker would act. At that moment, the person who has the skill set to be a professional baker\u2014and, in that sense, is more a baker than you or me\u2014is only a television watcher. When you do philosophy, you are acting as a philosopher acts whether you are correct or not. Certainly, some people are better at it, just as some people are better chefs or bakers, but you are not less of a philosopher because you are less competent. Philosophy is only for philosophers as baking is only for bakers and football is only for footballers\u2014but anybody who does philosophy is a philosopher. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes!  Anybody can philosophize!  Highly recommended. Doing this is a great way to solidify your values and general approach and outlook on life.  Personally, I highly recommend people do take time to think about things and come to better understand who they are, why they do what they do and all manner of basic things. Minds are like muscles.  When you use them they grow stronger and more potent.  The very idea of philosophy can and should be accessible to anyone willing to exercise their mind.  It is not necessary to entertain the esoteric, lofty, complex elements of philosophy to realize the benefits of practicing it. It is only necessary that people begin to think about things they would not otherwise be thinking about.  Anyone starting down this road will at the least develop the attribute of intellectual curiosity.  Once that has happened for a person, they will find the drive to improve rewarding and valuable. ",
