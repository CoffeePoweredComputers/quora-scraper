            "answer_text": "It is already a branch of philosophy, and has been, since Aristotle devised his syllogisms some 2500 years ago. One can conceive of logic as consisting of two main branches: philosophical logic and mathematical logic. They have distinct but overlapping domains of applicability, and their main concerns are different. Although it is not exactly set in stone how the boundaries of the basic area of overlap are defined, it contains at least n-order logic, where n is a natural number between 0 and infinity. Zero order and first order logic is what one typically learns in intro logic courses. Mathematical logic may then go from there to proof theory, model theory and universal algebra, as well as computational theory, whereas philosophical logic may go from there to other kinds of logic or similar formal systems which were devised to serve some philosophical purpose, such as modal logic, free logic and conditionals (there are many, many others, including, for example, paraconsistent logic). The area of overlap may also include other, related subject matters which are treated from a different perspective in mathematics and in philosophy, such as set theory and probability theory. I find that, as a rule of thumb, these related subjects are (counterintuitively) treated semantically in math and syntactically in philosophy, meaning mathematics is more concerned with manipulating the structures that arise out of the meaning associated with these theories, whereas philosophy is more concerned with manipulating them at the level of their formal structure. For example, in mathematics one tends to think of set theory in terms of abstract collections which can be visualized via Venn diagrams, but in philosophy one tends to think of it as first order logic plus an additional relation, which means \u201cmembership\", but is not necessarily even visualized. The divergent development is a result of different concerns of mathematicians and philosophers. The former are more interested in proving theorems and building additional formal structure for its own sake, whereas the latter tend to regard these as means to further, usually philosophical ends.

            "answer_text": "All subject matter used to be part of the pre-modern \u201cumbrella of philosophy\u201d, including what we now call math and science. Logic, as in the study of new logic systems, and metatheorems about logic, are now properly contained within mathematics (via Order Theory and Formal Languages), but the application of logic, used in \u201chuman affairs\u201d, ontology, and in metaphysics, still belongs to the realm of philosophy. This is also why logicians are usually mathematicians and philosophers in the same breath, without contradiction. ",
