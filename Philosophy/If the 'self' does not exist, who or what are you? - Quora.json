            "answer_text": "Socratic questions have no final answer. What is justice? What is The Good? But a more important question that has to be answered prior to answering \u201cWhat are you?\u201d is \u201cWhat is consciousness?\u201d The Cogito or \u201cI think therefore I am\u201d runs into serious trouble when faced with modern brain science. Brain makes decisions before you even know it If decisions have been made before you are \u201cconscious\u201d (whatever that means) of them, what role does the \u201cI\u201d in \u201cCogito Ergo Sum\u201d come from? Maybe there are multiple perspectives that fight it out in a kind of democratic process before \u201cconsciousness\u201d is notified of the results. Maybe \u201cI\u201d should actually be \u201cWe.\u201d However many people are poking fun at buddhism when the ask the question in the OP. \u201cNo-self\u201d has special meaning in Eastern philosophy. It is related to Wu wei or \u201cnon action.\u201d I think both concepts refer to the kind of effortless being that comes from a flow state, but in this case it isn\u2019t just any flow state. It is the flow state associated with someone who has practiced mindfulness long enough for it to become internalized. Think of it this way. Mindfulness practice involves examining thoughts, feelings and perceptions as they occur and doing one\u2019s best to be non judgemental about them. There comes a time where you can notice a thought and not feel attached to it. There will come a moment where you will think to yourself \u201cWho originated that thought?\u201d Then you will look for the origin of that thought, but no matter how hard you look you will not find it. Is that because there is nothing there? Is it because you are unable to recognize something even though it is there? Is it because what you can recognize is a part of a structure that you can\u2019t comprehend all at once? Is the mind like a wave/process that reveals its structure over time and what we are doing is like trying to see a movie in a still photo? Why do we believe that that a brain is capable of understanding itself? I don\u2019t know. Neither do you. Most likely no one will ever know. Maybe no one CAN ever know. So in this way the self both exists and does not exist. Non duality. Who needs drugs when we have puzzles like this? Antigonish by William Hughes Mearns \"Yesterday, upon the stair, I met a man who wasn't there! He wasn't there again today, Oh how I wish he'd go away!\" When I came home last night at three, The man was waiting there for me But when I looked around the hall, I couldn't see him there at all! Go away, go away, don't you come back any more! Go away, go away, and please don't slam the door... Last night I saw upon the stair, A little man who wasn't there, He wasn't there again today Oh, how I wish he'd go away... ",

            "answer_text": "Answer me this: Do you exist? Don\u2019t think about it, just notice are you, or are you not? Many non-duality teachings make it very confusing by saying things like \u201cthere is no you\u201d or \u201cthere is no self\u201d. If they do not explain exactly what they mean, this can end up being very confusing because you most certainly have a sense of being, of existing. You are, and that\u2019s undeniable. All that they are saying is that the story you superimpose upon this obvious self-evident beingness is the \u201cself\u201d that doesn\u2019t exist. The you that is, without a story, before the story, after the story - that is the Real. However, you may want to understand that non-duality makes use of this knowledge in a particular way, and it doesn\u2019t actually have to be used in this way. I will explain: Non-duality focuses on real versus unreal, lasting versus ephemeral, liberation from that which is imaginary. The belief behind this is that bliss or lasting peace and happiness are to be found only through awakening to that which is eternal and ever-present, and no longer believing in the \u201csmall self\u201d. That is one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is that you are being one person or another in any given moment. You\u2019re always telling a story, and that is the story you are living. You are not limited by the person you are being or the story you are telling and truly you are beyond it, that I AM that is ever-present. However, as long as you are expressing yourself in physical terms, you will be this person or other, tell one story or other. There is no way to avoid that. Your choices and actions indicate who you are being. You can actually decide who you prefer to be, consciously, and your choices and actions will flow out of that decision. This is conscious creation, as opposed to automatic reaction. Since the person is an illusion, you can actually consciously create it, for understand \u2014 you will create one illusion or another. You are dreaming, and the realization that you are dreaming doesn\u2019t make you cease to experience it. You don\u2019t have to keep the dream at bay, as though it something to defend against lest it pulls you into samsara and suffering \u2014 you can consciously own your dream, as the dreamer of it. In this way you will find that you are able to do \u201cmiracles\u201d. But it is not for your ego, it is simply because you understand that your dream is YOUR dream, and that absolutely everything that you experience you are doing to yourself. There is no objective world; there is nothing outside of you. It\u2019s all you. And you\u2019re always deciding to be one way or another. To be or not to be is NOT the question, for you are and that\u2019s non-negotiable. But HOW to be \u2014 this you are deciding in each and every moment, and \u201cthe person\u201d that you may have thought you are was never a solid or fixed thing, but an ever-changing expression of the eternal you. Only you were never conscious of this. That what you call \u201cthe person\u201d is constantly changing \u2014 and that you can take conscious control over this, for you are deciding who you are anyway. You\u2019ve been simply doing it unconsciously, and I am saying that you can do it consciously. The knowledge that all of this is an illusion \u2014 all of physical reality and the person \u2014 can be USED in more ways than one. In the non-dual community there is no emphasis on that you are CREATIVE being, only on that you are pure being. That is because the common definition of liberation within this view is the awakening FROM the dream. Surely there is a great relief in knowing and seeing that you are not at the effect of anything that happens in this dream. To your being nothing ever happens. This is the part of the awakening that I call: \u201cnothing happens TO you\u201d, and yet I add another part to it: \u201ceverything happens FROM you\u201d. And this is the part that I am speaking about. That while you truly are not affected by anything in this dream, you are 100% responsible for all that you see, for you see only what you project. The world arises and subsides in you. It\u2019s not \u201cout there\u201d. You are only experiencing yourself. Many times people come to me after feeling that they\u2019ve understood that first part of liberation - \u201cnothing happens TO Me\u201d, and yet their life is in shambles\u2026 it\u2019s a mess\u2026 and they still have to live it. That\u2019s where in our sessions we begin to practice that \u201ceverything happens from You\u201d, and they begin to direct their dream consciously, and live in the power of who they really are. Now, the objection of non-dualists is that you shouldn\u2019t be focused on changing the dream, only waking up from it. We are not, in my case, changing the dream in order to stay asleep. We must understand that many times the awakening will not abide unless certain beliefs and attitudes are worked on. The change in the dream is a side-effect of shifting those beliefs. As you purify you inner-world, so does the outer become a clear reflection of your nature. The dream is to be USED rather than denied. It lets you know how clear and free of judgment and separation you are within your consciousness. Like a mirror, it does not lie. It can teach you what you hold within you that is not in line with your actual nature. And as you shift it, so the reflection must change. Your alignment is important. If your allegiance is to your mask rather than your true nature, this will show up in your actions and choices in the dream. You have to be conscious about the place from which you are acting. The improvement in the dream is a byproduct of alignment with your nature. It does not cause you to sleep, for you are not invested in outcomes in the dream, yet that does not mean you deny responsibility for what appears to happen to you in the dream. In my view, there are not two yous. This is confusing. There is just you. The ever-present you. While your experience may shift, you are always here to experience whatever form it is taking. That which we call \u201cthe small self\u201d doesn\u2019t exist. There is just one of you. The one that IS, that exists. And this one expresses itself either consciously or unconsciously. But you cannot withhold expressing your Self. ",

            "answer_text": "The SELF does exist. It\u2019s just not divided into many. It is ONE self or Pure Awareness looking through the eyes of all the forms it takes from human, to animal, to plant, to alien. Responding to this question requires us to first define what we mean by the \u2018self\u2019. If by \u2018self\u2019 we mean that which we refer to as the \u201cI\u201d living in an individual body-mind with all of its particular physical, chemical and genetic features with distinguishing traits and tendencies of thought and feeling and perception, then that \u2018self\u2019 does not exist. That self is illusory. If by SELF we mean that which we refer to as the \u201cI\u201d which KNOWS or is AWARE of our experience, then that Self does exist. It just doesn\u2019t exist APART from any \u2018other\u2019 self. To be more precise, the SELF does not exist per say, because existence means to \u2018stand out\u2019 from. If the SELF is ALL THERE IS (infinite and omnipresent), then it cannot \u2018stand out\u2019. It must be WHOLE, undivided - not apart from Reality, but Reality itself. ISNESS or BEING itself. I Am - WE ARE or WE SHARE - our very BEING. ",

When we tap into this, fully, we control the dream and overcome all ill-being. Reality as a whole, self and external factors, are actually a creation of mind.

            "answer_text": "The questions relates back to the context in which the term \u201cself\u201d is used. If we are talking about the concept of \u201cself\u201d as in the \u201cTrue Self\u201d. Then it does exist but its probably deeply buried under a mountain of perceptions called \u201cmy self\u201d, \u201cyour self\u201d and \u201cthem selves\u201d. \u201cMy self\u201d: What I think I am is not what I really am. Ask yourself this: How many times have we overvalued/undervalued ourselves?How many times have we wanted to do something, but found that it was not what we really wanted? Or did not do something but it was what we really needed?How many times have we been influenced by others perceptions with/against our own judgement?\u201cYour self\u201d: What others think you are is not what you really are. But it may affect the way you perceive yourself. Our parents/friends/colleagues perceptions of us are but a tiny fragment of what we really are. Some may come close, but no one really scratches the surface of our \u201csecrets\u201d.e.g. My parents/friends may say that I am smart. But am I really smart? They may really mean it, but is this true? Do I now go into society with the feeling that I am a genius?How many times have you heard a term similar to \u201cThat\u2019s just like you!\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s what you would do!\u201d? But your mind was going \u201cWhat the hell? That\u2019s not me at all!\u201d and then upon reflection, maybe that is me after all? Or is it?How many times have we thought that we knew someone well, only to have the situation of \u201cI don\u2019t know you anymore!\u201d comes around? Well guess what? They probably do not know you much either.\u201cThem selves\u201d: What general social groups tend to label me as is not what I really am. Almost automatic assumptions of certain characteristics and behavior because we are part of a certain social/racial/religious group, whether it is true or not, may affect how we perceive ourselves. It might be something as harmless as:Person A is working as IT, they must know how to repair a computer. (Obviously not true for all IT people, but there are some who fit the bill)Asian food is mostly served with rice, or Italian food is mostly pizzas and pasta. (Obviously not true, but we can have our opinions, no harm done, I guess.)The list goes on\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Then there are those mis-conceptions that could ruin some ones/society/countries day:Country X is a bad country because of \u201cpolitical agenda exhibit 1\u201d. Country Y is a bad country because of \u201cpolitical agenda exhibit 2\u201d.Race A are \u201cinsert racist slur 1\u201d, Race B are \u201cinsert racist slur 2\u201d and Race C are \u201cinsert racist slur 3\u201d (I wonder what people are saying about my race\u2026)My Country, Religion, Culture and Race are the best things in the world!!! (or is it?)The list goes on\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Apart from all these perceptions of ourselves, internal and external. Does that mean the True Self does not exit? Actually it does. The problem is with identifying it with all the shaded glasses we are wearing. Whether those glasses are applied internally or externally. We may never get to know who or what we really are. Perhaps finding out may lead to an unfathomable depths of truths and wisdom, or it could lead to nothing at all. Is not life about looking for answers? ",

What we tend to think of as ourselves is a collection of memories. Mess with the memories and you change the personality. Would there or could there be something else? Something that as long as you can recall has been present. Something that every once in a while you get a tiny glimpse of but can never figure out what it is. When you remove all of the beliefs, philosophies, fears, interests and memories there is something behind it. Find that and you will know the answer to the question. ",

Hinduism explains this as \u2018Om Tat Sat\u2019 or \u2018Aham Brahmasmi\u2019 or Truth is One (Rigveda). And so on. And so on. In conclusion: Truth is Oneself desiring companionship.
