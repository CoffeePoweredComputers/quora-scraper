            "answer_text": "Hi Ya Boi This is a fascinating question that all seems to hinge on what we mean by \u2018transfer\u2019 and \u2018another body\u2019. We are going to drive a little deeper than usual with this answer, so apologies in advance. Let\u2019s begin with idea of transferring your consciousness out of your body and forget for a minute the destination. The first concern that many people have goes something like this: \u2018If I transfer my consciousness out of my body, isn\u2019t that dangerous? What\u2019s left behind to protect my physical form and how will my body keep itself alive? Let\u2019s do some groundwork to this problem by taking the example of an insomniac or someone that has a lot of trouble sleeping. We find that insomniacs have lower health, age more quickly and often suffer from impaired functioning. The antidote? More sleep of course. But what is it about sleep that is so essential to our wellness? Many scientists will reassure us that sleep is merely an opportunity for the physical body, including the brain to rest and recuperate and that there is no science or proof to an \u2018out of body\u2019 experience that occurs during sleep. For example, if someone dreams about walking around in their garden shed during the night, then science would say that the brain has created the image of a \u2018garden shed\u2019 from stored images in memory and then has \u2018hosted\u2019 a recreation of a \u2018shed experience\u2019 to assist the psyche to work out issues using a \u2018garden shed dream framework\u2019. And while all of this could be true, there are also other possibilities. On the second evening, the dreamer could feel like they are in the same dream, except on this occasion they have actually projected their consciousness to the garden shed. Yet, they may not be able to tell the difference from the \u2018self created\u2019 garden shed in the previous dream the night before. The dreamer could then wake up the next morning and say that they are having identical recurring dreams about a garden shed. When in fact the two dream experiences have very different structures involved. On the third evening, the same dreamer could again find themselves dreaming they are inside their garden shed, but on this occasion they didn\u2019t project there. Instead, someone else who is passionately interested in something to do with the dreamer\u2019s garden shed has provided the psyche-based framework and unwittingly transfers part of this conscious intent towards our dreamer, who then experiences this external emotion laden intent as a dream drama of himself in the garden shed. The originating person may or may not be visible in the dream at all. On the fourth evening, the same dreamer could find themselves in a certain type of dream environment (that we will cover in more detail later), where thoughts can become \u2018things\u2019. Here our dreamer\u2019s desire can materialize the garden shed into being, in real time, using the physics characteristic to that particular plane or environment. The curious thing about this event, is that it doesn\u2019t so much occur \u2018out\u2019 of the body. As the relevant destination or coordinate points where this happens are not physical, and do not need to take up any space as we are used to thinking about it. So in summary, we have 4 totally different dream structure experiences appearing as essentially the same dream. Our dreamer happily quizzes their good friend about it over a casual coffee the next day, and then it\u2019s simply on to chat about the next topic with no harm done. Why? Because if a person\u2019s psyche isn\u2019t ready to deal with more detailed information about the structure of their dreams or the transfer of consciousness, for example, then the ego will simply block this information to maintain the emotional stability of the personality. Linking back to the earlier part of the question, whether we realize our regular comings and goings or \u2018transfers of consciousness\u2019 or not, that occur in the dream state. Their ongoing occurrence is essential to maintaining both our physical and mental health. A useful takeaway from all of this is, that the less stressed a person is, the easier it is for their relevant \u2018bodies\u2019 of consciousness to take their temporary leave from the physical body and recharge \u2018in their own systems\u2019. Conversely, if a person is under immense mental or physical stress caused by external factors, or even toxins in the body then, their \u2018bodies\u2019 of consciousness will have difficulty \u2018taking their leave\u2019 as the ego is struggling and has issued an \u2018all hands on deck alert\u2019 for the bodies to remain. If we stick with the boat metaphor, we have crew members who are effectively unable to rest, which leads to faster ageing and accelerated deterioration of the person\u2019s physical, mental and emotional systems. We apologise that we didn\u2019t get to look at the \u2018other body\u2019 side of the question and we hope to be able to cover that in future answers. ",

            "answer_text": "Heart transplant was thought impossible before 1967. Brain and consciousness transfer is only a matter of time. It could happen in 2 years, 5 years and defintily no more than 10 years. It will become an ethical question. In communist countries or detetctor political system, they would have more advantage into developing those technologies. Organ harvesting by farming human. With today\u2019s technology we already seen some robotic arms and legs that have feedback and tempreture sensing. Given 50 or 100 years. We are going to see full mechanical body. The future world simply can\u2019t be understood by the human now. Only 100 years ago, human at that time can\u2019t understand our information explosion, smart phones, and globalrization. The next 100 years, more dramtaic things will happen to our civilization. I hope myself get to see those technology. It would be nice to have a pain free mechanical body. Like I\u2019m experiencing shoulder and back pain for almost my whole life. If I can have a new body without those pain, it would be so awesome. Why stop there? I also want to have another mech body that is capable of flying like a drone can fly. Walking around just too ancient. The future is flying around. It is also possible that brain only store in a building. Everything else is all remote control with VR system. Many US war plane already operate like that. Why risk having our brain destory by accidents. We can remote control our robots to do groceries, social gathering, and all kinds of tasks. Our real brain should be in a protected building. How long can our brain live with future technology? Maybe 500 years, 1000 years? That is all possible. What\u2019s the maximum people our earth can support? There will be many challenging questions in the future for our chidlren and grand children to answer. For now, meditation is the simple and attanable brain hacking tool to learn and use daily. With meditation trainning, we can go beyond the automatic reaction; therefore re-program our traumatic expereinces and buld a new program, new habit, or a new experience. ",
