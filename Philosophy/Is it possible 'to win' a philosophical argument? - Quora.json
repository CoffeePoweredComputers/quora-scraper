            "answer_text": "Like so many questions on Quora, this one is a matter of definitions.  Questions come in various forms.  Some have precise answers that all reasonable people can embrace as accurate.  For example, \"Is an average hyena larger than an average beaver?\" We can agree that one and only one answer to this question makes you a \"winner\" if by that term you mean \"I have answered the question correctly and can justifiably bask in any applause generated by that answer. Many egotistical people believe that the kind of question illustrated above captures almost all questions. Listen to the tone with which they answer questions; observe their body language as they provide languages; notice their lack of interest in the answers of anyone who answers a question differently from the way they answered it. Such people have what might be termed a \"proper answer syndrome.\" That syndrome consists of the delusion that when answers leave my mouth, the world is now privy to universal truth. However, a large proportion of questions significant to our lives are by their nature, open-ended questions, meaning that those who require certainty in their lives are condemned to be frustrated when they encounter discussions of questions like: 1. To what extent is the portrayal we have of Marcus Aurelius an exaggeration of his wisdom, humility, and reasonableness?2. Is pragmatism a coherent philosophy given its dependence on the subjectivity associated with Rorty's definition of truth as \"the compliment we pay those statements that we have found useful\"?3. Does the common understanding of \"rhetoric\", as in \"mere rhetoric\", represent powerful evidence of the hold Plato has on our understanding of persuasion? Such questions ask us to make assumptions, uncover nuance, and make decisions about which relevant information to use in our answers and which to ignore. What sense does it mean in such a context to say \"I won\" after I have provided an answer? Do you possess what Hillary Putnam calls \"god's eye\" such that you are the arbiter of which of a multitude of possible answers to open-ended questions is THE correct one? But perhaps the question refers to a very different understanding of what it means to \"win\" an argument of any kind. If we mean that a \"winning\" argument is one that is victorious in a democratic poll, then all questions can be asked in a winning way. But even here expect a fruitful debate about how the demos was defined in this particular instance.  Or maybe the question implies that a winning argument is one that persuades a majority of philosophy PhD's or a majority of philosophers specializing in a certain domain of philosophy. If so, presenting a winning argument has more to do with the insights in Cialdini's, Influence: The Power of Persuasion than in the logical or empirical quality of the argument. One more possible meaning of a \"winning argument\" is quite ugly, but unfortunately commonplace among humans who should know better. I am referring to acting like a verbal bully and \"winning\" by being louder and more aggressive than the other people in the room who are failing miserably to have their point of view heard. In this sense of the original question, philosophical arguments are won on a regular basis. Short version of the answer: What would it mean to \"win an argument\"? ",

            "answer_text": "Rarely, certainly not metaphysical or ontological ones. Usually when a philosophical concept prevail against another one, it isn't a knock out. Some of the ancient philosophy became obsolete due to science, the composition of matter and so. Also in ethics, politics and logic, there have been some victors at least classifying and distinguishing the mess. For example in ethics we have now some well formed and consistent ethical systems that definetly make some things clearer. A lot of the , previously,daughters of philosophy have moved and became an independant beings like psychology, in this process many philosophical ideas concerning those daughters have been cancelled  or proved.  Philosophical arguments rarely ends on individual level. Usually it takes great time and advancement to judge who wins in one. ",
