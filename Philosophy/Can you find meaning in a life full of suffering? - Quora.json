            "answer_text": "Yes. A life full of suffering is a life that offers a tremendous opportunity for anyone who is happy and full of bliss to share that joy and bliss. I am always interested in sharing my perspective with those who suffer. My perspective is that anyone who suffers is employing language and self talk that does not celebrate the miracle of being alive. Those who suffer don\u2019t know how to appreciate life. They need models who do appreciate life. These models can offer them an example of how to appreciate life. If you are suffering, try to find ppl who are enjoying life and try to emulate their attitude and try to understand their words. Try to feel their life affirming energy. Learn how to look at the positive side of life. Listen to the wisdom of your bliss. This requires that you identify those bliss filled moments in your life, understand them, and seek more of them. Most importantly: FOCUS. Focus on what you want, NOT on what you DON\u2019T want\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Suffering is just a cognitive technology; a tool that minds have evolved to motivate a particular sort of introspective reaction. If you were always happy you\u2019d have no reason to do anything. You\u2019d probably starve to death. The myriad of ways that our minds have of making us unhappy or unsatisfied, or bored, depressed, miserable, etc. are like the pain we experience from being injured\u2014all of these stimulus evolved because they tend to improve our survivability. They focus our attention in ways that tend to inspire us to do something to mitigate the unpleasantness. Emotions are just the best mechanism that evolution has so far stumbled upon to predispose critters to behave in ways that enhance their fitness. Our genes are completely mindless. They are totally incapable of appreciating, caring, or even comprehending how unpleasant their handiwork is capable of making us feel. Their only feedback is our differential reproductive success. If they end up leaving us so emotionally distraught that we kill ourselves then they\u2019re less likely to persist in gene pool. But just shy of that is probably highly effective at motivating us to look for ways to make ourselves feel better. And that\u2019s probably the reason that suffering is so very unpleasant. Because it really does need to be in order to do what it is supposed to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Because your soul incarnates into an animal body, and animal bodies come equipped with senses attuned to both pleasure and pain in order to stand a chance of surviving long enough to fulfill their animal functions: growing up, reproducing, and dying. Your soul, meanwhile, undergoes an experience of separation and isolation because it\u2019s incarnate in an animal body that\u2019s individual. Humans are social, but don\u2019t normally have telepathy or even an extreme empathy that might offset our individuation into discreet bodies and minds. In my opinion, that bundle of limitations is exactly what we incarnate to experience, probably because that\u2019s the only way we *can* experience it, and experiencing it is a crucial part of our spiritual existence (and, presumably, spiritual evolution of some kind). I read a novel recently in which a major character reflects that the goal that draws immortal and invulnerable souls into such perilous and often painful circumstances is exactly the opportunity to achieve something that doesn\u2019t exist for beings in a metaphysical state: the extreme challenge of striving against and overcoming the separation of physical embodiment to achieve, however fleetingly, a true intimacy that\u2019s all the more valuable and significant and rewarding because of the difficulty of achieving it. I think that\u2019s an interesting idea. It doesn\u2019t diminish the pain of suffering and constraint, which is powerful, often overwhelmingly so, in people\u2019s lives. But it\u2019s a reminder that there are also keenly positive aspects of the physical predicament: only if I am I and you are you can we experience loving each other. We can only taste that ripe melon and feel the strength of our youthful limbs if we have the physical senses that provide these sensations. If as a single bare soul I\u2019m little more than a small range of vibrations among a vast sea of similar beings, then can I even distinguish the vibrations of a piece of music? I doubt I can hear it at all in such circumstances. See, I don\u2019t think we, as souls, are forced to incarnate; I think we *want* to incarnate, and that\u2019s why we keep coming back here. In the bare-soul state between lives, with no physical nerves or sensory receptors, I doubt that we can even hold onto any real concept of pain, because there isn\u2019t any where we are at that time. So we make choices there that look absolutely *nuts* when looked at from here, in the middle of the real-world consequences. Like, you book your dream trip \u2014 seeing Angkor Wat is something you\u2019ve always wanted to do. And you get there, and the mosquitoes! The humidity is crushing you. The place is swarming with tourists; the noise, the heat, the runs \u2014 and then a bit of ancient stone crumbles and you fall down and break your wrist badly, and it takes forever to heal and is never quite right again, and you have to go home early. But you saw a fantastic sunset there. You had an inexplicable moment of extraordinary peace and silence that made you cry, and there was a souvenir seller who seemed so familiar and so welcoming to you forgot the temples for a bit and just enjoyed chatting with her (can\u2019t remember what was said, that was trivial \u2014 but the connection was amazing and unforgettable). Next time \u2014 polar bears, before they\u2019re gone \u2014 and an old friend wants to show up in that life with crucial help. So you book another trip. ",

Chances of happening such things might be negligible sometimes but still thoughts pops up. Thinking about the past or future all the time is life full of suffering. Solution is very simple & sounds cliche. The solution is to just deep breathe for 2\u20133 minutes. It calms your nerves and helps you to come back to present. What we all have is present in our hand. Sounds very familiar. I am not telling you to forget your goals or don't be scared. Just think about what can you do best today to reach closer to your goal. Revisit your goals and ideas once in a month. Keep track of it where are you heading. Divide and conquer. P.S. Here goals can refer to your career, Hobbies, personal relationships, emotional relationships,etc. Hope it helps :) ",

The conduction enables it to pass through; the resistance to that passage through is what heats up the filament. In response, the filament radiates light and heat (mostly heat which is why they are so wasteful as sources of light). Life is like a filament; it both conducts and resists the flow of electric currents passing through. When that current is strong and it flows through our mind, we suffer. We radiate more energy when we suffer. Why? That\u2019s what we do, that\u2019s what we are: we are consumer / transformers / radiators of cosmic energy, didn\u2019t you know that? So our suffering steps up production (hungry cosmos, what can I say). ",
