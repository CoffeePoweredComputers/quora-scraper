            "answer_text": "During this pandemic I have had my fair share of existential crisis. I often find myself thinking about the second law of thermodynamics and how in the universe at the time of the heat death every atom will eventually seperate from every other atom, and those atoms will eventually deteriorate into pure energy and what that entails for any kind of notion of meaning in the universe. Over the summer sometimes I would even question the validity of reality itself, I began thinking about dreams and how we never suspect we are in dreams when we are in a dream, and that the brain could be stimulated in the right way as to constitute all our sensations and thoughts, and that my thoughts may not even be my own, and then I comtemplated suicide on the basis of that absurd line of thought. The problem was I was stuck alone in my own head in a basement and an INTPs head fills with thoughts and ideas that would seem absurd to the rest of the world, in fact I was thinking about a machine that eradicated human emotion by inserting a large dose of seritonin that acts as an inhibator to stress and depression into the limbic area, essentially shutting it down completely because so much of the hormone seritonin is concentrated into that area. My point is you need other people to make you sane, any mind especially an INTP mind with its brilliance and creativity and madness in that combination needs other people to tell you your ideas are absolutely absurd, that you are on an unhealthy train of thought. Now I know that other people are not the forte of us INTPs, but get involved in a theatre or music group start a band, but if you dont have that time you could even join a Facebook page with people of similar veiws to yourself, it provides for creative input for the Ne to flourish on so it does not run out of ideas. But using Fe to much is draining trust me, and dont be a chamelon and try to be everything for everyone geniunely express your veiws, ideas, and personality. But have a healthy balance of alone time and time with others. Also enjoy the bueaty of nature it tends to soften my veiws on spirituality and the meaning of the universe. Hope this helps. ",
