            "answer_text": "From what I\u2019ve seen, conservative and liberal criticisms of CRT are nearly identical. If a liberal becomes a vocal critic, they are automatically associated with the right. Sometimes even the far right, or alt-right. Every opposing opinion of social justice ideology based in Critical Theory is canceled in this way. That\u2019s one of the problems that has developed with this ideology. It\u2019s almost religious in nature, condemning and shaming those who part ways with the rigid ideology. Most of the critics of CRT that I\u2019ve listened to are liberals but they will be labeled \u2018conservative\u2019 by liberal media. The criticisms are complex because CRT is based in a complex academic ideology. I should say that it appears complex, very heady, but it\u2019s really quite shallow and collapses easily under scrutiny, one of the reasons the social justice types are so defensive. Most people who have adopted this social justice belief system are unaware of the roots of it. Their beliefs informed by years of propaganda online, nearly all of it is 100% opinion or unproven theory, treated as indisputable fact. My favorite critic is James Lindsay. He says his politics are in line with Sweden basically, suggesting that he\u2019s pretty far left. Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose co-authored a book that came out this year title \u2018Cynical Theories.\u2019 They can both be found on YouTube discussing the topic.  ",

            "answer_text": "From what I have seen it comes down to this; \u201ccritical race theory is the real racist!\u201d Consider the 1992 story, The Space Traders, by Derrick Bell; conservatives frequently cite this story as very upsetting and mean to white people. In the story, aliens arrive and offer the people of America a massive amount of gold, limitless clean energy, and other incredible technology in exchange for all of the black people in the U.S., no questions asked. In 2012, conservatives tied themselves into knots over this story and had a great big mad about how unfair and mean it was to white people. Now, ask yourself, in 2020, how Trump supporters would react if aliens showed up and offered them riches, clean energy, and wondrous technology in exchange for all the black people? I mean, isn\u2019t that kind of what Trump is promising them, anyway? White people are extremely sensitive about race which is why they try so hard to pretend there is no racism. ",
