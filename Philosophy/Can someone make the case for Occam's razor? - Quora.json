            "answer_text": "Occam's razor Entities should not be multiplied without necessity.This is really common sense. Without it, we would make theories that would be needlessly complicated. This would in turn make it very difficult to adapt the theory to any new evidence. This would also make them very difficult to discuss and therefore to have a rational debate even between experts. This would also make it difficult if not impossible to compare two theories and see whether they are logically equivalent. And, we could make any number of overly complicated theories. There would be no limit. Strictly speaking, it is not a logical constraint. It is a reasonable and rational contraint. We are finite beings. Time, energy and money are in short supply, so we better use our resources sparingly. Logically, I think this is equivalent to objecting to what is called \u201cweakening\u201d. Suppose a theory is \u201cA and B and C\u201d, where A, B and C are the axioms of the theory. We can write this formally as: A \u2227 B \u2227 CLogically, \u201cA and B and C\u201d implies \u201c(A and B and C) or (D and E and F and G)\u201d. This can be expressed formally as: A \u2227 B \u2227 C \u22a2 (A \u2227 B \u2227 C) \u2228 (D \u2227 E \u2227 F \u2227 G)This is weakening. This is valid, but the part of the conclusion which is extraneous to the premises doesn\u2019t bring any useful information. We could have any number of different extensions. For example: A \u2227 B \u2227 C \u22a2 (A \u2227 B \u2227 C) \u2228 (H \u2227 I \u2227 J \u2227 K)Whatever you add after the disjunction connector \u2228 would be irrelevant. The occam\u2019s razor here would say that A \u2227 B \u2227 C should be preferred to anything of the form (A \u2227 B \u2227 C) \u2228 D, where D could be any conjunction. It should be preferred because D is unnecessary. ",

            "answer_text": "As Einstein once said, \u201c\u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d This saying was attributed to Einstein by Roger Sessions in the New York Times of 1950. From In honor of Albert Einstein's birthday - Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler - Championing Science Wikipedia tells us: Occam's razor (also Ockham's razor or Ocham's razor: Latin: novacula Occami; or law of parsimony: Latin: lex parsimoniae) is the problem-solving principle that states that \"Entities should not be multiplied without necessity.\" The idea is attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham (c. 1287\u20131347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian who used a preference for simplicity to defend the idea of divine miracles. It is sometimes paraphrased by a statement like \"the simplest solution is most likely the right one\". Occam's razor says that when presented with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and it is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions. Similarly, in science, Occam's razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. In the scientific method, Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives. Since one can always burden failing explanations with ad hoc hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more testable. Occam's razor - Wikipedia [THERE IS MUCH MORE AT THIS SITE] OCCAM\u2019S RAZOR is a much misunderstood method of weeding out UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX EXPLANATIONS OF PHENOMENA. If there are two or more explanations of an event, usually less complicated is true. However, this must be applied carefully, for given any particular event, a TRUE explanation is sought, and sometimes the more complicated is the true explanation. Occam\u2019s razor is only a method that is used, among others, to gain a true account, hence the quotation from Einstein at the beginning. In other words it is a tool to be used carefully, and it\u2019s applicability must be used carefully! ",

A more complicated explanation has more ways to go wrong than a simple explanation all other things being equal. But the facts remain:Sometimes the most simple explanation is correct. Sometimes the most simple explanation is wrong. How simple or complex it is does not matter when all is said and done. However, there are more ways for a complex explanation to go wrong than in a simple explanation. - But still, more ways to go wrong does not make it more likely that it will be wrong - only that a random guess has more ways to go wrong with a complex answer. If an explanation is correct it does not matter how many ways it could have gone wrong. The OCCAM\u2019S RAZOR theory is a guessing strategy. Sometimes you guess right. Sometimes you guess wrong.

It\u2019s a somewhat balanced heuristic in the sense of applying simplicity when the extra complexity does not add useful or helpful data. But there are none-the-less problems with this approach. Some view Occam\u2019s razor as \u201csimple is better\u201d rather than actually applying what the razor say. The problem if that is true, we can just reduce to the level of chemicals or atoms and be done with it. As such this application is actually a fallacy. Not to mention, there is often an ideological motive to reduce. As if a kind of sweeping under the rug what one doesn\u2019t want to deal with, while totally ignoring the elephant in the room. Chemicals or atoms don\u2019t per se experience human experiences. They are more big picture and holistic experiences. ",

Avoid these and other problems associated with complexity by choosing the simplest alternative. Centuries of human choices have validated this guideline. ",
