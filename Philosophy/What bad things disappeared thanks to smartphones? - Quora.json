            "answer_text": "The Smart Phone hasn't made anything bad disappear but it can reduce the feeling of isolation an abandonment for many people but it's caused some self isolation issues for many. I save a lot of money on books and magazines because of Google and You Tube. In my humble opinion cell phones have increased most people's stress levels because work, drama, binge surfing, inattentiveness, distraction, and making your significant other feel ignored. I would think it's increased divorce rates and we know it's had a negative impact on roadway safety. I will venture to say that people's lives have changed significantly because of the cell phone but I cannot say that it's been all good. I can say that it's eliminated the need for pay phones and phone books. Sincerely ",
