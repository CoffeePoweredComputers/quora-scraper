            "answer_text": "I call myself a Realist. A Direct Realist. An Extreme Realist. A Platonist. A Radical Empiricist. That makes me an outsider in the world of philosophical thinkers. Out in the marshes, I am marginalized. But the edge of that magical field is also the center. So saith lord Derrida. And vice versa. I am well aware that when a philosopher such as I overturns a fundamental principle all hell breaks loose. It\u2019s more than ticklish; it is threatening. With an insolent flick of the wrist, I am dismissed. Am I immature, belonging to the adolescence of human thought? Am I na\u00efve? A Na\u00efve Realist? Yes, yes, yes. I love that philosophical Twink. But I have escaped Solipsism, the philosophy of our time. Here is the racket I raise. I sit here in my room and I look about. I see ordinary things of this ordinary world. When I leave my room and go into the kitchen, those things remain. But what are those things? Physicists tells me that there are micro-particles and fields there. OK, I will take their word for it, though I cannot see them. What I do see, what I assert is also there are particular things with properties. And sets of particular things. And Logical Form. And complex facts. And awarenesses of all that. It a great jungle of actual facts and imaginary facts. Of true facts and false facts. Of error. It\u2019s all there. Out there. I stare at it. It\u2019s a thousand-eyed god staring back. If you are a hard-headed, anti-romantic rationalist, you will demur. But you are probably not demure, so you will throw verbal rocks at me. Let \u2018em fly. The phenomenal world I directly see out there exists. That is rock bottom for a realist. It does NOT reduce to tiny physical pieces and brain patterns. I am not a monist. I don\u2019t ask where things come from. It\u2019s a meaningless question. The many, many things just are. ",

            "answer_text": "The main principle is that, when a given theory adequately models the data, it does so by virtue of being accurate. A consequence of realism is that the concept of data-modeling is to be understood in terms of the concept of truth. The main principle of anti-realism is that, when a given theory models the data, it cannot meaningfully be assumed that its doing so is a consequence of its being accurate. For anti-realism, there is no coherent conception of truth over and above that of data-modelling, and a consequence of anti-realism is therefore that the concept of truth is to be understood in terms of the concept of data-modelling.
