            "answer_text": "It is not clear from your question what realm you are referring to. In physics, complete lack of order would be perfect entropy. Ironically, perfect entropy would have its own form of order - all energy would be completely dissipated. But even in that case the laws of physics never cease to apply. Universal laws of nature are unbreakable by definition. Apparent chaos is simply perceived randomness. But the laws themselves allow predictions to be made to a high order of certainty. As with physics, in the social realm lack of order would be a matter of perception, not reality. There are laws of human nature. The main reason humans appear to be so unpredictable is that we cannot measure fundamental values (anger, hate, love, envy, power) accurately and that humans can restructure their behavior through learning. Leave any random group of kids long enough in a playground and the bullies and gangs would appear - as predictably as the sun rises. Power structures would arise spontaneously whenever people are completely scattered. We see this whenever large scale disaster strikes. We are guaranteed to see looters at first. But, sure as gravity, order would emerge. Leaders would begin to enforce rules. Followers would begin to obey. Property would be defined and distributed. Utopians are under the impression that, unlike anything else in the universe, the laws of human behavior are completely malleable. They are not. Order in the social realm necessarily emerges because we are ultimately limited by the hard rules of biology - the drive to compete, cooperate, mate, etc. Disorder is always an illusion. ",
