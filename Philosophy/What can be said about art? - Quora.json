            "answer_text": "As an art practitioner myself, I believe that art is an important, yet often overlooked aspect of human civilization. I\u2019m not sure myself why this happens. As someone coming from an art background myself, I find it\u2019s so ironic that most people don\u2019t pay much attention to something they literally see everyday, especially today where commercial art is everywhere you look. You could try checking one of my recent answer on visual arts: Teguh Li's answer to How does visual language communicate ideas?Basically, art makes our lives, almost literally, colorful. Without any art form, human civilization should look pretty lifeless if you ask me. Yet art, especially visual art, is one of the most underrated form of art compared to others such as music and performance art (dance/theater). I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s easier for people to jump on the hippest craze regarding music or movie trends, but up to this date, visual art trend is still a rather niche area. Commercial art, which commonly referred to graphic design or visual design, receive the same treatment as well\u2014it\u2019s a common secret among many designers I know that people have a tendency to look down on visual artists and/or designers. What\u2019s worse, for whatever reason, most people thought that just because they see visual art everywhere, it gave them a license to criticize other people\u2019s art tastes and artworks just because they think they have better taste. I think I lost count on how many non-designers would straight-up criticize an artwork without the slightest hint of guilt, or that they might not have much knowledge on art. Personally, I don\u2019t see that too often when it comes to criticizing other art forms such as music or movies\u2014people seem to think that those areas of art have higher \u201centry level\u201d for common layman to say anything about. This becomes even more obvious that people would come up with terms like \u201cmovie critic\u201d or \u201cmusic critic\u201d and feel that they have achieved something, while an \u201cart critic\u201d is often considered a loon or delusional. All these things combined is just beyond me\u2014like any other skilled professionals, visual artists and designers trained and busted their butts to be good at what they\u2019re doing, and certainly wouldn\u2019t like it so much if somebody with barely any knowledge of art come around and start telling them how they should do their artworks. To sum up, art is a wonderful invention of us as human beings, that existed far longer than any other form of arts, science, technology or anything else in between. It was through art that early human civilization flourished, up to the species we are today.  Prehistoric cave art, Ennedi Plateau, Chad. Source.

            "answer_text": "I love it. I love aesthetic creativity and the beautiful results it often produces. I love the imagery, the texture, the feel of it. I love the response I have to it, especially when that response inspires me to want to create. Or when different forms, genres and mediums of art come together to create works or \u201cpieces\u201d of such power that it moves me to sentience, inspires my imagination, arouses the intensely touching aspects of human-nature within me and creates anew the \u201cintangible art\u201d of reciprocation in the very appreciation of it. Painting that is less concerned with critique than mystique. Writing that is more than plot and storytelling, using words and language creatively and imaginatively while bringing to life characters whose personalities are as memorable as any actual people in our remembered lives. The sculptures and designs that mold and shape and form the environment we live in. The graceful and elegant or the vibrant and energetic movements of dance set to the right piece of music that combine in an aesthetic fantasy. Photography that captures moments, preserving impressions of a defined or re-imagined essence. Poetry when it is able to somehow transcend the words to convey what words alone can not. Cinema when it weaves and blends the various art-forms in a way unique to its medium. Music\u2026 that muse with the power to infuse our sentience and transport us to an ethereal realm as easily as it can heighten our experience in and of the moment. Music\u2026 that comes in as many colors, lights, shadows and expressions as there are things to express. Art! The attempt to create. To re-create. To express. To experience. To elevate and take deeper. To inspire. The projection of the inner to the outer to the inner again. The expression of the appreciation of the expression. Art! Aside from that, I don\u2019t think much of it. ",
