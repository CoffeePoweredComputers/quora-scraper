            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a little weak\u2014never treat others as MERE means but always as self-determining beings. Always get consent for the ways you treat them. More likely you should never treat people as means/tools/objects at all. Dehumanization in doing so seems unavoidable. (Kantians like Rawls have noted this.) The other part of the CI about being able to rationally universalize any intent? Well, in the realm of universal principles, that\u2019s a fine foundation. But then we need many contextual principles as well\u2014medium-sized and to the point of particular situations. Kant\u2019s \u201ckingdom of ends\u201d model makes it look like the CI is a decision-making principle. Luckily he notes that it\u2019s only for ruling out certain intents as morally irrational. It\u2019s a good guard against a certain kind of inconsistency, focusing on how to treat each other as sentient beings per se. But there are endless ways we should treat each other affirmatively in different social roles, in the roles of particular societies, groups, often where so-called \u201cspecial responsibilities\u201d apply. But they are not \u201cspecial.\u201d These are front-row responsibility. The CI deals with way in the background ones, fundamental but also minimal ones. At least that\u2019s how I remember it, not having the text in front of me right now as I should. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps I\u2019m mistaken, but I take Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative to mean the same thing as Nietzsche\u2019s offering of the Eternal Return\u2014a basis for judging the morality of an action without involving a divine moral authority. Both are clarion calls to consider the bigger picture of the consequences of one\u2019s actions. In Kant\u2019s case, if you decide that it\u2019s okay to cheat, you have just given dispensation to everyone else to cheat you should they so choose, as well; in other words, whatsoever a man soweth, so also shall he reap. In Nietzsche\u2019s case, your choice to cheat\u2014along with its consequences\u2014will repeat endlessly, like Groundhog Day; in other words, what goes around, comes around\u2026again and again and again. Both are valid definitions of a Godless Moral Compass. ",
