            "answer_text": "No. Right wing facism was discredited and destroyed following the spectacular failure of the ideology in the 1940s. I guess the Nazis were fortunate to have imploded before the nuclear weapon which was being readied for Berlin was ready. You can\u2019t run a state based on the joint fantasies of racial purity, protectionism and a god-given sense of entitlement. You can certainly have some noisy rallies with that stuff. You might even be able to win a referendum, or put a con-man in the White House. But at some point you have to deliver a functioning economy. And doing that is really hard with your hands tied behind your back. A nation cannot whine about how things were, and goose-step about waving a greivance narrative about migrants, and just magically become successful. The world simply does not work that way any more. To prosper and succeed you have to do so on merit. And meritocratic freedom is the core of liberal values. The points in history where economic growth was most explosive was at those points where equality of opportinity was most broadly distributed. When effort and participation was rewarded. When hard work and entrepreneurialism would ensure you were wealthier than your parents. Greedy fake capitalism has managed to divert so much wealth into their own pockets with such efficiency that it\u2019s now easier to for workers in mainland China to earn more than their parents than it is for those in midwest America. That\u2019s what needs to change. Those are the enemies who have taken the growth of the West and pushed the curve into the ground. And yet it\u2019s those same monied clowns who are pulling the strings behind the facist revival movement. Let\u2019s face it. The last thing they want in a meritocracy. Of course, their little scheme is not going to work. Trump\u2019s nacent presidency is looking more and more ridiculous. The team he has assembled don\u2019t even have the competency to issue a press-release without some enormous gaffe. At some point the people who voted him in will spot they have been conned. Some of them already have. Brexit too is heading rapidly onto the rocks. The plans for a post Brexit economy are in tatters, and we might end the decade with the end of the union. We will remember May as the last Prime Minister of the UK. Willing to tear-up national cohesion on the false promise of \u201ccontrol\u201d. The Brits who voted to leave were told their shrinking wage-packets was the fault of migrants. And having believed that, promptly voted for the very people who imposed austerity on them. But there\u2019s really only so many times you can tell people to punch themselves in the face, before they realise this is not making them feel any better. ",

            "answer_text": "Agree with Derek..These ideologies transform over time. We are in a pendulum swing here. Really the reason is that the current iteration of \u201cLiberalism\u201d in America is not the FDR Liberalism of the days of yore. RE Brexit, the main issue there is the results of underlying foreign policy. Many wealthier countries in Europe feel the drag of supporting other less economically viable countries as well as the flood of refugees their politicians are allowing into the country which is, in the minds of many Brits, also being a drag on their economy and also a security threat. Here in America, what you\u2019re seeing on the right are the paroxysms and convulsions of their death in their current iteration. However this process may take decades and like an animal in the same condition, those closest to and effected by them will bear the brunt of their jolts. The liberal wing of our party focused WAY too much on things (in American anyway) that they should not have. Guns, catering to minorities and foreigners leaving a feeling of alienation of the white middle and lower class. Not supporting labor (unions) all the while regulating out many aspects of the energy sector that have left people jobless without options for them to adjust into a new career. Signing trade acts that ultimately export American jobs or allow the importation of skilled people where they were educated under a socialized college system where that same education would cost an American an arm and a leg. Signing into law (or at minimum maintaining ones already signed) tax policies that allow all of the Mitt Romney\u2019s of the country to pay 13% in taxes while the middle and upper class pay double OR MORE than that (as a percentage of their income). All of these things are economically based in the minds of voters. Liberals need to come to grips with one thing here. People generally vote with their wallets. Talking up LGBT rights and marriage equality, gun bands, whether public bathrooms have a gender neutral facility and letting in Muslims, Mexicans and refugees etc, don\u2019t ring any positive bells in the minds of Americans regarding their current and future economic well being. They need to adjust not only their rhetoric but their votes in the house and senate on that rhetoric. Liberal politicians need to stay away from topics that alienate whites (I\u2019m not saying that they need to inject rhetoric that alienates others, just don\u2019t talk about any of it) and stay on topics of how they can make America prosperous for the middle and lower classes.
