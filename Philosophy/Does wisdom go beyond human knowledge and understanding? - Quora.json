            "answer_text": "No of course not. Wisdom is a human word, conjured up by humans to describe a particular type of knowledge - probably paraphrased as sage advice. It is only in our non-scientific, supernatural and primitive understanding that we would try to imagine that wisdom is somehow outside of us. There is absolutely zero reason why we would think that is true. However humans are not rational - and we\u2019re often not very good at reigning in our ape like brains which tend to seek patterns where there are none. We like to pretend that objects, animals and rituals have meaning - because for millions of years we had nothing else. We couldn't explain why the animals we hunted appeared seasonally, or why the lightning came - so we gave animals and the lightning an imaginary intent and purpose. That sits better with our ape brains than simply admitting that we don't know the answer to something. So we worship the heavens where the lightning comes from, and paint the animals we hunt on our cave walls. But we now know better. We need to be grown up and evolved enough to admit that we don't know things, but that that doesn't then require us to make stuff up. There is more wisdom to be found, but we find it by our own hard work -and it comes into existence only with the discovery. ",

            "answer_text": "It is knowledge to understand that tomato is a fruit. It is wisdom to know that you cannot use if for fruit salad. Wisdom adds extra dimensions to knowledge. Wisdom is the apex level in the model chain-of-understanding. It goes from Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom. Wisdom is nothing mysterious when you call it meta-knowledge. Meta knowledge seems like questioning questions and adding layers and layers of meaning to already existing knowledge. For example, it is knowledge to know how to build a ship but it is wisdom you need to sail without sinking it. In my understanding about this \u2018chain of understanding\u2019, wisdom exists in two spheres: wisdom of the ages, and transcending wisdom. Wisdom of the Ages simply exposes the knowledge of mankind that is deemed \u2018wise\u2019 at that point in time in history or within a particular place. Chinese wisdom could be wrong in American settings. Thus, wisdom of the ages is bounded by Space and Time. Transcending Wisdom on the other hand endures through the ages and it is unbounded by Time and Space. For one the concept of Love is a perfect description of Transcending Wisdom. This kind of wisdom is ever present in the Judeo-Christian worldview.  ",

            "answer_text": "Wisdom cannot go beyond human knowledge and understanding, or else no one would be wise. I believe wisdom involves the continued collection of knowledge, regardless of the source, and the attempt to understand the significance of accumulated facts; combined with understanding oneself (being self-aware of strengths, weaknesses, and biases). Wisdom also incorporates a moral code that acknowledges the benefits of altruism. One must be aware of the propensity for their own negative behavior and common human faults \u2026 https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-foundation-for-wisdom-based-on/answer/Dan-Robb-2 ",

            "answer_text": "In Book 6 of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle distinguishes between two intellectual virtues which are sometimes translated as \"wisdom\": sophia and phronesis. Sophia is the true conception of the first principles of existence and that which follows from them. This is perfect wisdom, the wisdom of the gods, unattainable by mortal men. This ultimate form of wisdom is sometimes called \u201cTheoretical wisdom\u201d and is often intimately tied to theology. Phronesis, sometimes translated as \u201cpractical wisdom\u201d is the highest level of insight attainable by mortals; the wise deliberation about human affairs. See: Wisdom - Wikiversity ",

            "answer_text": "I believe I already answered an nearly identical question about love. So, to balance this, I will include a deeply paradoxical statement from one of the greatest Direct Path non dual teachers ever, Nisargadatta Maharaj: \u201cWisdom tells me I am nothing. Love tells me I am everything. And between the two my life flows.\u201d These are the two main ways of thinking: Unified and Divided. There is a shared commonality you might find via self-inquiry between both approaches that show that it is not beyond human understanding. Having said that; contact with these, at the point of grasping the shared paradox at the heart of both will remove your need to remain trapped in the cycle of human births and deaths. ",

We inherit a systems feed-forward process that guides the organism to attend to selected aspects of the environment and activates perception which interacts with conception, feelings, intentions and actions. Human organisms organize their perceptions, conceptions, feelings, intentions, and actions, or fail to do so. The processing of data into information and the processing of information into knowledge, opens the possibility of processing knowledge into wisdom. ",
