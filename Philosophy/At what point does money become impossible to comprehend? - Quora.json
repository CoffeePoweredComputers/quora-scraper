            "answer_text": "We believe money to be the ends to all problems. What is money? I will give a million dollars to any person, but the catch is, they cannot spend it. So then, money is rendered useless. Money is only the means to barter, to commerce. We can do that without money, such as trade goods. The point is that we must first seek the end result to why we need the money, new car etc. So focus on the car and not the money? ",
