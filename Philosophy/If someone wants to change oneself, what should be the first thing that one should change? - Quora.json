            "answer_text": "This depends entirely upon the individual. It seems to me if one is committed to change, the first step would be to self-examine. Figure out what you want to change and prioritize your list. It\u2019s likely to change once you\u2019re in the process, but it\u2019s important to have a starting point. Then do some research into the top priority issue on your list and start instituting recommended steps. Keep moving through your priority list in that fashion. Remember that change isn\u2019t easy but it\u2019s worth pursuing if it will better your life. Good luck! ",
