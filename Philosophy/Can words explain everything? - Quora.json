            "answer_text": "Not completely, no. No words can convey exactly what color we are looking at to another person, though we may get close. We can\u2019t meaningfully explain the pain we are experiencing to another. And there\u2019s your first clue: words aren\u2019t that great at accurately reflecting our perceptions or our feelings and emotions. Music is often much better at expressing our feelings and emotions than words are. Some concepts simply can\u2019t be easily put into words, like the feeling of seeing your firstborn smile at you for the first time, (even if it is gas). One of the great exercises in a technical writing course, is to write a paper explaining how to do something you do every day, like tie your shoes, or put on a jacket. How do you tell someone who has never seen such an item how to perform that function? In our class, our professor did the jacket one in class, showing us what happens when someone follows the instructions literally. It was hysterical chaos, \u201cput your arm in the sleeve\u201d\u2026 from which end? Which way does the sleeve go? How do you explain which is the inside of the sleeve? He eventually wound up with the jacket on, but twisted across his shoulders. So it is often easier to show something than to tell it in words. Words are excellent at expressing ideas, or even talking about our feelings, if not expressing them directly. If I tell you I am thinking of a color that\u2019s between salmon and pink, but more white than fully saturated, you may not know exactly what color I am thinking of, but you\u2019ll be pretty close. We can come close enough to expressing our inner feelings that if someone wants to make the effort to meet us half-way, they can at least sympathise with us, even if they can\u2019t share our exact feeling. And a very good writer can evoke those feelings in his readers. Not everything can be expressed in words, but a talented author with a good grip of language, who has experienced life and knows what they are talking about, can often come close enough. However, words can only express those meanings we give to them. The expression \u201cwords fail me\u201d is there for a reason. ",

You are not always able to give your thoughts words and here your expressions are the best communicators. You might find situations where you don\u2019t have time to convey the whole message through words or its not feasible at the moment, so again here your gestures will work. So words are not just enough. Yes they are the core but you need other ways to have effective communication ",

For example, let us look at body language. Assume for the moment that you are blind. You cannot see what another person is doing (for instance, crossing their legs and turning), does this mean in principle that there are somethings that can never be communicated to you? Perhaps, but it hardly obvious that this is the case. Take an analogy. It is often said that poetry can express things that prose cannot. This often seems to be the case. However, once someone gets what is expressed in a poem, they are very good at explaining it in prose. It might not have the same impact as the poetic imagery, but for those who get the poetic expression, understand the prose explanation. That would seem to indicate that prose can be used to communicate the meaning in poetry. By analogy, once a meaning is understood\u2014however it is communicated\u2014it would seem that it can be expressed and transmitted linguistically. ",

We can\u2019t use words to represent new findings, knowledge, experience\u2026 We can\u2019t explain experience and feeling. For example, a boy tells a girl he loves her. She knows what love is but she can never know if he has it for her or not. He can\u2019t show his love to her with words that can only represent. We have our own perceptions. Words can be understood according to our perceptions so we might or might not agree on the same thing. For example, some people believe God exists, some don\u2019t. The word God might or might not represent something real. Words can also represent imaginary things, expectation\u2026 that are personal. Then only the person who uses the words can understand what he/she means by the words used. Others only try to interpret and hopefully understand the way he/she does. ",

            "answer_text": "If we accept the modern Skeptic view, then words are so limited that there are simply some things that Words will never be able to express. This was stated in modern terms first by Kant and his Unknowable Thing-in-itself, and later by Wittgenstein, with his dictum, \"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent\". The vast postmodern literature proclaims that the Truth can never be known \u2014 which means that it is beyond words. However \u2014 these positions are full of problems. How does Kant know what is Unknowable? How can Wittgenstein speak of the unspeakable? Why do postmodern writers insist as Truth that there is no Truth? The Skeptic arguments always fall back upon themselves. We must become skeptical of the Skeptic. Noam Chomsky (1999) posits that the usage of words is theoretically infinite. If that\u2019s correct, then Infinity itself is within reach for language. And that makes sense because we have the word \u2018infinity\u2019 and we have debated it for centuries. Words have already accomplished a tremendous feat by delivering Science to our collective experience. Modern science and technology is barely 150 years old in the vast ocean of human history. Why imagine that it is finished now? Why not accept that the best is yet to come? \u201cIn the beginning was the Word,\u201d wrote John, \u201cand the Word was with God.\u201d This suggests to me that postmodern literature fails to grasp the full implications of language, given its skeptical approach to reality.

You can use words to trigger recognition in others who have had experiences similar to yours, but you cannot communicate the specific experience itself. That is even true in the case of a photograph. We say a picture is worth a thousand words, but even then, we all know that a picture, even though perhaps excellent, doesn\u2019t completely capture the lived moment. The specific experience you are having is entangled in the complex web of experiences you know as your life, and though many aspects of this web can be communicated in words, what this amounts to, again, is using words to trigger recognition in others who have had similar experiences.
