            "answer_text": "Q: Is it really worth it to convince a skeptic to believe in anything? A: I have lots of experience attempting to convince a believer to be more skeptical. I think it's worth having the conversation to plant the seed but you're not likely going to swing them to your side right then and there. You just present your side of the story and let them decide fantasy or reality. Some people will choose The road less traveled and some will not change their path no matter what there's nothing you can say or do. For me personally there is no evidence to support the idea that supernatural magic exists at all. Every character to carry the name God is imaginary. Odin Zeus Osiris Allah Yahweh Jehovah Elohim God of Abraham all imaginary friends with no relevance to reality. ",

            "answer_text": "A skeptic is someone who requires evidence and proof to convince them of your assertion or claim before they believe it. This demonstrates a good epistemology, honesty and reason. The burden of proof is on you making a positive claim. Is it really worth making a claim without any evidence to support it? Do you want to be regarded as silly, dishonest, unreasonable, naive or ignorant? Skeptics don\u2019t. Why should you? ",
