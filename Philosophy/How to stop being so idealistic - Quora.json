            "answer_text": "You start by having realistic goals instead. And first out the gate, remove the word famous from your vocabulary. Delete it and forget it. Recognition is wonderful, it's a great feeling but cannot be your focus, it cannot be the thing the drives you. Instead, prioritize and streamline your thinking. You say you're an music artist. Brilliant! Absolutely wonderful because there is your focus. There is your passion. Sing every day, sing every chance you get. Do not dream about being discovered because that is not something you can control. Your goals are unrealistic because you're thinking ten \u2013 twenty steps too far. You shouldn't be thinking about the end-goal, what you should be thinking is the next step. You should be asking yourself one simply but very tough question; 'How I can use this in a productive way?' And once you've answered that question, you will find that the price of admission is far greater then you excepted, and the return is far smaller then you excepted because you dream about standing on standing on stage in front of thousands of people but even if you work hard and pour all your time and effort, you will maybe be on stage in front of a handful of people. But that's okay, if you love it. If singing is the thing you love, then all of that doesn't matter simply because unlike most people in the world, you have actually found something to believe in. This notion that someone's passion or someone's hobby is only validated if you become ridiculously famous is nonsense. It's utter nonsense. If you love what you do and you actively invest in yourself then that enough validation. ",

            "answer_text": "First, try to figure out why you have this compulsive desire for perfection. Is it because of your upbringing or your religious beliefs? I know someone who gets very upset if she is reminded that her actions are below the standard expected of a christian. (It's impossible to know the real standards expected because these are set by humans claiming to be inspired by God). This is terrible because humans can never be perfect and you are only setting yourself up for misery. If it's your upbringing, try to explain to your parents (or to your inner voice) that you are doing your level best. If you don't get perfect grades, it's partly due to your genes that you inherited so they should appreciate your efforts. That being said there are some fields of study or work that require \u201cperfection\u201d such as software coding so you should aim to create bugfree programs, which is very hard to do. Even the top programmers can't produce bugfree codes all the time. A high degree of so-called \u201cperfection\u201d takes years of hard practice. Don't be so hard on yourself ! Now, back to your homework. Do you really have to finish in 30 mins? Which is more important - finishing in a selfimposed time, doing in order to deepen your understanding, or just to get a superficially\u201dperfect\u201c score? Are you taking multiple choice questions that allow immediate checking of answers? Remind yourself that the steps to getting the answers are as important as the correct results, perhaps even more so.
