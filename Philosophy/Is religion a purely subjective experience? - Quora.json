            "answer_text": "No. Religion is clearly cultural (I recommend this answer especially to all those atheists who claim that we are all born atheists. If you say religion is subjective you will have to admit that anyone is about to get it just by him-/herself). Religion is culturally transmitted wherever it creates ceremonies, practices, a common language, a belief to explore - and it is culturally transmitted where it creates institutions, a text base and forms of collective acquisition and proclamation. It is even culturally transmitted where people begin to \u201ctalk in tongues\u201d which even they do not understand as they suddenly speak the languages of the Holy Spirit\u2026 (so the cultural practice among radical Evangelical groups.) We have a tension here as we do have personal experience involved - and this tension is a driving force. Up to a certain point religions allow this. They assume that privileged people experience the presence of the supernatural right now and here - as this sphere happens to be just right now and here, without the control of the others, without necessary precedent of the individual experience. This is what the shaman will do - he/she will make experiences which the others will not be able to make and they will trust this spiritual authority. Once we have more complex institutions in a more complex religion the same thing will not be that easy any longer. Our bigger world religions developed complex methods to control and limit the personal experience. \u201cMysticism\u201d is one of these controls - a field of classical experience. \u201cSpirituality\u201d is another such field of wider margins - yet a field with a name that can be handled as such. The major religions will isolate those who dive deeper into the personal and individual experience. They will turn these into Yogis and prophets - and they will demand that these people remain \u201cspecial\u201d. Or they create isolated festivities where people can experience the same in a collectively controlled situation that will eventually be over at a certain fixed moment.  <typical festivity of a controlled religious experience> The Catholic Church invented the Inquisition to make sure that this control is somehow institutionally organised. No one is allowed to just claim he talks to Jesus right now - and gets answers. If this was possible it would destabilise the Scriptures and the Church as institution. Protestantism is split into two branches at this sensitive point. Orthodox Protestantism is almost atheist. People can talk to God but he will not talk back officially. Anyone who hears God as at the brink of madness in orthodox Protestantism. US Evangelicalism is ready to accept the personal experience as allegedly being on terms with the Scriptures (as we are reaching the final days, when God will write history anew). Charismatic leaders will hear God. Believers who are \u201creborn\u201d will enter this direct communication with God. The new system is in a way democratic - but it is far more market driven. You have to decide whom to follow - and whom to believe that he/she actually is in communication with God. Trust in a currency is the essence of the free market and this is why evangelicalism is just that: driven by people who believe in the value of a currency whose circulation they personally support. The market driven spirituality is well in line with the free commercial market of finances which this system generates among preachers and congregations, TV-Evangelists and donors at home.  Orthodox Protestantism is, no miracle, on the other hand fond o a strong secular community running the collective - whether a city state as in the case of the Reformed Churches, or a country as in the case of Lutheran Protestantism and its branches. You do not get these structural differences if you just say: Religion is simply subjective. Religion is social and cultural - with a key problem to provide and to control an experience that has to become personal in order to convince. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIs religion a purely subjective experience?\u201d NO. You do not get to use the word \u201creligion\u201d and then make a statement unique to Christianity and the religions descended from it. You do get to let their missionaries own your mind but you do need to learn that\u2019s what you have done. \u201cReligion\u201d is not about belief. Only Christianity and those religions descended from it demand belief. All other religions are about practice. They demand practice. In them both belief and disbelief are common and at peace. See cultural jew, ethnic Hindu and a variety of other terms. Religious practice is objective. It produces results that can be recorded. There\u2019s nothing subjective about religious practice. Religious belief is what is subjective. That\u2019s only demanded by a few religions. Two of them have very large populations so you might be surrounded by their members. They still don\u2019t get to define what religion is. ",
