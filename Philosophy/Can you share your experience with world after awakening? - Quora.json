            "answer_text": "There is no longer self, it\u2019s now only a deep profound interconnection with everything, everyone. There is no longer anything to search for, we are the universe, we have the power of the universe within. The practice is removing the ideology and culture we are enslaved by. There is nothing to \u2018do\u2019 in life, it\u2019s about being in the space of love and compassion for oneself and everything in existence. Miracles are produced from being, not doing. And being authentic, without judgment, and self-expressed in this space is our purpose. We create our world. Our world does not create us. There is a profound alignment and gift in every circumstance. The gifts are often only visible when there is no judgment of the circumstance. What we judge as tragic and challenging contains alignment, love, contribution and compassion. Becoming \u2018awakened\u2019 gives me a deeply spiritual life of love and compassion for myself and everyone around me. My relationships have flourished to levels I never thought possible. My ability to profoundly contribute to others increases day-by-day. Drama in my life continues to diminish. I\u2019m discovering a peace and power I never thought possible. ",

No one knows what you\u2019re talking about, but they like how they feel when they\u2019re with you. When they\u2019re with you, their minds stop.  (photo by Nitish Kadam at unsplash.com) ",
