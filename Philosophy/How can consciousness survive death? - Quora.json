            "answer_text": "This is the argument I put forth in my thread Evidence of Consciousness Surviving the Body, in The Philosophy Forum. My claim is that there is sufficient testimonial evidence to reasonably conclude that consciousness survives the death of the body. In other words, I'm making the claim that I know the conclusion is true. And although I believe that I could make other claims based on the evidence, i.e., claims of knowledge, I'm limiting the scope of the conclusion. By limited, I mean I'm not trying to give evidence of a god, heaven, that we are eternal beings, or any other spiritual or religious idea; nor am I trying to give evidence of many of the other things claims people are making while having such an experience. Although I do believe there is strong evidence to support other conclusions, and these conclusions have varying degrees of certainty, just as many of our everyday rational conclusions have varying degrees of certainty. The first question is, what makes a strong inductive argument? As many of you know, the criteria for a good inductive argument is much different from the criteria for a good deductive argument. The criteria of a good inductive argument are as follows: (1) number(2) variety(3) scope of the conclusion(4) truth of the premises(5) cogency First, number. It seems rather obvious that if you have a greater number of testimonials that say X happened, then the stronger the argument. This does not mean that the conclusion relies solely on numbers, because numbers in themselves are not sufficient. Second, variety. The greater the variety of cases cited the stronger the conclusion. Remembering that when examining the conclusion of an inductive argument, the conclusion is either strong or weak, which is much different from a good deductive argument, where the conclusion follows with absolute necessity. The difference being what is probably or likely the case (inductive arguments), verses what necessarily follows (deductive arguments). Third, scope of the conclusion. This has already been covered briefly in the opening paragraph. It means that the less the conclusion claims the stronger the argument. In other words, conclusions that are broad in scope are much harder to defend. A conclusion that is limited in scope is easier to defend. Fourth, truth of the premises. Clearly this means that the premises must be true, which by the way, is the same criteria that makes a good deductive argument, i.e., a good deductive argument must be sound (soundness has to do with whether the deductive argument is valid, plus the premises must be true). (a) Also, since we are dealing with testimonial evidence, in order to know if the testimonial evidence is true we need corroboration, i.e., we need an objective way to verify some of the testimonial evidence. This helps to establish the truth of the testimonial evidence, and since the evidence is testimonial evidence, it helps to establish the fourth criteria of a good inductive argument, viz., the truth of the premises. (b) Another important factor in determining the truth of testimonial evidence is firsthand testimony, as opposed to hearsay or secondhand testimony. Firsthand testimony is stronger than hearsay or second-hand testimony, all things being equal. (c) Consistency of the reports is another important criterion in terms of getting to the truth. However, testimonial evidence does not have to be perfectly consistent to be credible. When dealing with a large number of reports you will inevitably find some inconsistency. So, inconsistency itself is not enough to rule out the reports unless the inconsistency is widespread, and of such a number, that it affects the quality and number of consistent reports. So although consistency is important, it must be looked at in terms of the overall picture. Fifth is cogency. You rarely here this criteria, but it's very important in terms of effectiveness. There is a sense where any argument's (deductive or inductive) effectiveness is going to be based on whether the person to whom the argument is given knows the premises are true. For example, if I give the following argument: The base of a souffle is a roux.This salmon dish is a souffle.Hence, the base of this salmon dish is a roux. If you do not know what a souffle or a roux is, then you do not know if the premises are true, so how would you know if the conclusion is true. You may know that the argument is valid based on its form, but you would not know if the premises are true. Thus, you would not know if it is sound. For any argument to be effective, you have to know if the premises are true; and since knowledge varies from person to person, an arguments effectiveness is going to vary from person to person. The Inductive Argument: The following argument is based on the testimonial evidence of those who have experienced an NDE, and the conclusion follows with a high degree of probability. As such, one can claim to know the conclusion is true. This argument makes such a claim. Each of the aforementioned criteria serve to strengthen the testimonial evidence. All of the criteria in the previous paragraphs work hand-in-hand to strengthen the conclusion, and these criteria serve to strengthen any claim to knowledge. If we have a large enough pool of evidence based on these five criteria, we can say with confidence that we know that consciousness survives the death of the body. In other words, we can say what is probably the case, but not what is necessarily the case. Again, if there is a high degree of probability that these testimonials reflect an objective reality, then we can also say with confidence, that we know consciousness survives the death of the body. Thus, our knowledge is based on objective criteria, not on purely subjective claims. We will now look at the testimonial evidence in terms of the five stated criteria, and how these testimonials support the conclusion. First, what is the number of people who claim to have had an NDE? According to a 1992 Gallop poll about 5% of the population has experienced an NDE; and even if this poll is off by a little we are still talking about millions of people. Thus, the number of accounts of NDEs is very high, much higher than what we would normally need to decide the veracity or accuracy of the testimonials, and much higher that what is normally needed to draw a proper conclusion. Also, as was mentioned in the previous post, numbers in themselves are not enough, which is why the other criteria must be coupled with numbers. The second criteria of good testimonial evidence is variety, i.e., do we have evidence from a variety of sources? The answer to this question is in the affirmative. NDEs have been reported in every culture from around the world, which by definition means that we are getting reports from different religious views, and different world views. NDEs also span every age group, from young children, to the middle-aged, and finally to the aged. The testimonial reports come from doctors, nurses, scientists, atheists, agnostics, literally from every imaginable educational level and background. NDEs occur in a variety of settings, including drowning, electrocution, while awake, while on the operating table, after a heart attack, etc. People have also reported having shared an NDE with someone else, although rarely. They have happened when there is no heartbeat, with the blood drained from the brain, and with no measurable brain activity. They have been reported to happen with a minimal amount of stress, i.e., without being near death. Finally, there have been many thousands more reporting these and similar events happening to those who have taken DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine), which is an illegal schedule 1 drug. These DMT reports are also reports that are happening without being near death. The third criteria is scope of the conclusion, and the scope of this conclusion is limited to consciousness surviving the body. The conclusion claims that we can know that consciousness survives bodily death. The fourth criteria is truth of the premises. To know if the premises are true we need corroboration of the testimonial evidence, a high degree of consistency, and firsthand testimony. In all or most of these cases, it seems clear that we have all three. We have millions of accounts that can be corroborated by family members, friends, doctors, nurses, and hospice workers. Corroboration is important in establishing some objectivity to what is a very subjective experience. It lends credence to the accounts. One example of corroboration is given in Pam's NDE out of Atlanta, GA, which can be seen on Youtube. Consistency is also important to the establishment of the truth of the premises. We have a high degree of consistency across a wide variety of reports. What are these consistent reports? 1) Seeing one's body from a third person perspective, i.e., from outside one's body, and hearing and seeing what's happening around their bodies.2) Having intense feelings of being loved, and also intense feeling of peace.3) Seeing a light or tunnel in the distance and feeling that one is being drawn to the light, or moving through the tunnel towards the light.4) Seeing deceased loved ones.5) Seeing beings of light that one may interpret as Jesus, Mary, Muhammad, an angel, or just a loving being that one may feel connected to.6) Heightened sensory experiences, viz., feeling that one is having an ultra real experience, as opposed to a dream or a hallucination.7) Communication that happens mind-to-mind, not verbally.8) Seeing beautiful landscapes.9) Seeing people who are getting ready or waiting to be born.10) Having a life-review by a loving being who is not judgmental in any way, but simply showing you how important it is to love, and the importance of your actions on those you come in contact with.11) Feeling as though one has returned home. This is also confirmed by people who were told they chose to come to Earth.12) A feeling of oneness with everything, as though consciousness is at the bottom of everything.13) Memories of who they really are return, as though they temporarily forgot who they were, and where they came from.14) There are also reports of knowledge returning, and many questions being answered.15) Understanding that ultimately we cannot be harmed.16) That we are eternal beings simply entering into one of many realities. These are just some of the reports from those who experienced an NDE, and some of these reports are confirmed by those who have taken DMT. Another aid in establishing the truth of the testimonial evidence are firsthand accounts, as opposed to hearsay. There are literally thousands of firsthand accounts being reported by the International Association of Near Death Studies. And according to polling, there are millions of firsthand accounts of NDEs. The fifth criteria is cogency of the premises. Whether the argument is cogent for you depends on many factors, but many people have heard of near death experiences, so the concept is not an unfamiliar one. It is not going to be cogent for everyone, but with a little study and reading it can be cogent. It is not difficult to understand the concept. Although it is probably going to be difficult to understand how it is metaphysically possible. This argument is claiming that it is highly probable that consciousness survives the death of the body, and that the conclusion is very strong based on what makes for strong inductive arguments. The further claim of this argument is that I know that I know the conclusion is true. Is it possible the conclusion is wrong? Of course it is possible, but we do not want to base a belief on what is possible, but on what is likely the case. All kinds of things are possible, but that does not mean we should believe them. A Proof... So how would I construct a proof? It is very simple. The following is a deductive argument based on the evidence of the inductive argument. Modus Ponens: (1) If it is true that NDE reports are accurate, just as any veridical experience is, then consciousness survives the death of the body.(2) It is true that NDE reports are accurate, just as any veridical experience is. Conclusion: Consciousness survives the death of the body. Of course as with any deductive argument all you have to do is dispute any premise, i.e., show that any premise is not true. I believe the inductive argument is more apt to be believed. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026\u2026\u2026. Near death is not death - it is near death. The distinction is important. It does emphasise the fact that death is a process. It is a process whereby our science has tried to define the point whereby the dying process has become irreversible but has thus far failed other than to make a diagnosis of brain death which is taken as death for purposes of making a decision to stop resuscitation. In the latter part of the 20th century technology evolved that allowed us to reverse the dying process in many instances but failed to identify that exact point of death other than at a point of decomposition (Shaw). Those of us who work in ICU often see this but are, for the most part, paralysed to act because we are uncertain as to the point of death and also have a legal Sword of Damocles hanging over our head! The further we have probed into near death the more it is clear that the central nervous system tries to deal with the issue with outpouring of various substances leading to altered conscious states, hallucinations and so on. One of the more famous descriptions was that of Livingstone who, while being gored by a lion, entered a state whereby he felt no pain and was accepting of his state. Prey animals when gripped in the jaws of a major predator also seem to enter such a state. In fact, Livingston survived. Various near death experiences likely reflect the same or similar physiology While we can identify several states of anaesthesia with their various affects on consciousness it is clear that it is extremely difficult to define \u201cConsciousness\u201d as opposed to \u201cAwareness.\u201d You can have a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15 and be conscious yet not aware. We still have no idea as to the physiological construction of the mind other than to say it is a function of the brain. Once death has occurred then, inevitably, such \u201cstates of grace\u201d fade away as cells are no longer able to produce the substances in order to protect a brain that is no longer alive to receive them anyway.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s possible to prove one is immortal. This is because it is possible to \u201ctune\u201d the nervous system such that it becomes an exquisite instrument that is so delicate that it can become conscious of the subtlest aspects of the biological process named \u201cconsciousness.\u201d By merely practicing the watching of the process \u201cconsciousness,\u201d (thousands of methods for this) the nervous system gradually evolves and refines this ability to see what\u2019s what within, and the ultimate achievement will be gained when the nervous system can become so \u201cquiet\u201d that thoughts stop being manufactured. That\u2019s called \u201cpure being.\u201d To achieve enlightenment, one must practice until one can reside in pure being continually. Pure being is, well, pure, and by residing in this state of consciousness \u2014 no thoughts, but awareness still is \u201cmanifest,\u201d the nervous system gradually gains an additional clarity \u2014 which is: it is realized that awareness is not dependent on any nervous system to exist. Once this clarity is garnered, identification with the nervous system is sundered. Identity is finally realized as non-physical. Thus: Enlightenment is a direct evidence of death being survivable by dint of the FACT (to an evolved nervous system) that one\u2019s being is non-material even though it can be \u201cmade manifest by symbolizing it with illusory processes of a nervous system.\u201d \u201cManifest\u201d means that the self of the nervous system is yet still a limited expression in that it is individuated. It is separate and operates within a sole nervous system. After residing in pure being long enough, an individual\u2019s \u201cperson\u201d can conclude that actuality is not physical, and that \u201cmanifestation is always symbolic, illusory, temporary, incomplete, flawed, dualistic, etc. This \u201cperson\u201d can say that \u201cevidence\u201d is solely validated by transcending all qualities of mind, but that means that anyone else who would KNOW this must also become enlightened to see that it is beyond what concept and emotions can symbolize. Then that person can give up being a person. No need to chunkify the flowing of consciousness with starts and stops. Let that river flow without a single toe being dipped into it. This is how one leaps out of the prison, consciousness, and realizes that identity has always been boundless, infinite, eternal bliss. The good news: the unsubstantiated life yet can claim to offer a lot of bliss\u2026\u2026commonly called \u201cignorance.\u201d Gotta love it that the grass is almost as green on this side as it is on the other.

            "answer_text": "No there isn't any evidence to support that a consciousness lives after death, and there isn't a terminal proof to establish that it doesn't\u2026. The factors attributing to the realization of someone\u2019s death are quite physical and simple. We start addressing the person as \u2018body\u2019, the body stops giving any vital signals and start to decompose, and once the body is cremated, the constant absence of the person (or body) makes us realize that the death has actually struck. We, being the conscious beings that we are, are always able to comprehend someone else\u2019s death. We could be certain what happens to a body after the person is declared as dead, but can we be certain as to what happens to the consciousness that drove the body? No, we just assume that it stops existing just like its materialistic counterpart. Consider this. A person is driving fast and is about to crash in some other car. Soon after the accident, the person is declared as dead, but the person finds himself at some other point of his life with everything around him just as normal as it should be. He has no memory of the accident or the consequences. In the world where accident took place, the person\u2019s consciousness no longer exists, but in the other world it still does. What if I had been dead multiple times and now this life in this world is just the next stage before I jump to some other place continuing this never ending loop? This is a hypothetical scenario, but provides reasoning as valid as any other reasoning that could be provided around what happens after death. There is no absolute truth related to death as we might never be able to provide the terminal verifiable proof. We just have to rely on beliefs and assumptions. If that is the case, then instead of having a remorseful and sadist belief that the person has gone forever, why shouldn\u2019t we stick to a more relaxing and satisfying belief that the person is still living in some other world. Don\u2019t you think that looking this way at the negative events like death would be more meaningful and settling rather keep looking for closure after the one we love is gone forever? ",

            "answer_text": "As I wrote in Old Souls: Compelling Evidence from Children Who Remember Previous Lives, the closest thing to \u201cproof\u201d are the cases researched by a University of Virginia psychiatrist over four decades. Here\u2019s an excerpt (about a research trip trip to India) that explains: \u201cSitting in the backseat, apparently unconcerned about the two-ton mud-splattered torpedoes racing toward us, is a tall, white-haired man, nearly eighty, who insists that he has compiled enough solid, empirical evidence to demonstrate that physical death is not necessarily the end of me or anyone else. His name is Ian Stevenson, and he is a physician and psychiatrist who has been braving roads like this and worse for thirty-seven years to bring back reports of young children who speak of remembering previous lives and provide detailed and accurate information about people who died before they were born, people they say they once were. While I struggle with my fear of dying, he is wrestling with his own fear of annihilation: that his life\u2019s work will end, largely ignored by his peers. \u201cWhy,\u201d he asks for the third time since night has fallen, \u201cdo mainstream scientists refuse to accept the evidence we have for reincarnation?\u201d On this day, and for the past six months, Stevenson has shown me what he means by \u201cevidence.\u201d He has permitted me to accompany him on field trips, first to the hills surrounding Beirut and now on a wide swath of India. He has responded to my endless questions and even invited me to participate in the interviews that are the heart of his research. The evidence he is referring to does not come from fashionable New Age sources, past-life readings, or hypnotic regressions during which subjects talk about being a Florentine bride in the sixteenth century or a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars, rendering the kind of details one might garner in an hour\u2019s time paging through a few romance novels. The details Stevenson\u2019s children recall are far more homely and more specific than those. One remembers being a teenager called Sheila who was hit by a car crossing the road to collect grass for cattle feed, another recalls the life of a young man who died of tuberculosis asking for his brother, a third remembers being a woman waiting for heart surgery in Virginia, trying and failing to call her daughter before the operation she would not survive. It goes on and on: These children supply names of towns and relatives, occupations and relationships, attitudes and emotions that, in hundreds of cases around the world, are unique to a single dead individual, often apparently unknown to their present families. But the fact is, the people the children remember did exist, the memories that the children claim can be checked against real lives and their alleged feats of identification verified\u2014or contradicted\u2014 by a variety of witnesses. This is what Stevenson has been doing for almost forty years; it is what we have been doing in Lebanon and India: examining records, interviewing witnesses, and measuring the results against possible alternative explanations. I have seen close up, as few others have, how compelling some of these cases can be\u2014and not just factually, but in the emotion visible in the eyes and the voices of the subjects, their families, and the families of the people they claim to have been. I have seen and heard astonishing things, things for which I have no easy explanation.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The majority of the modern world who are not religious but scientifically minded will say no. It appears in research to date that consciousness arises from the brain learning from itself. It works on data received by sensory experiences which translate into memories, associations and representations which cause our thoughts and behaviours or actions. But when the brain and body dies, none of these biological mechanisms are in place anymore, hence the supposed reality of duality body/spirit (or mind) seems a fallacy. However, there are also many unexplained things by science. For instance, how some people have memories which are impossible to have, or psychic abilities which are unexplainable. Some scientists say that the sun might be consciousness, and that bees, animals and other forms of mammal life have a certain level of consciousness. While we still don\u2019t have a clear-cut definition of consciousness, there is still progress being made in research which defines our experience of being as brain systems of automatic intuition (association/feeling/memory) interacting at lightning speed with a logical, slow thought system. Always best to look at complex issues from all angles. Author Peake and 19th century psychologists Myers and James think the brain is a receiver for consciousness and thus non-Cartesian duality theory. Meaning, it could be separate from the brain but the afterlife is just not God, as religions believe. Anil Seth, Antonio Damasio all give insight into the phenomenon of consciousness. Youtube offers goods in-depth talks. Nice question, thank-you for asking! ",

In EGMI we call this re-hosting it is simply energy seeking the most efficient use of itself, it could in theory happen at every death but as twice as many are born as die at this time most have virgin consciousness. This is not as exciting as heaven or as scary as hell but it is based of energy driven evolution theory so may become accepted science in time, German scientists have proven the consciousness can project from the body in an OBE. They have no way to observe the energy transcendence the particles are too small, the new planned collider is to look for smaller particles so they may get there one day. ",

If consciousness is some separate thing that controls the brain, this thing may persist. If physical matter is in fact created by consciousness and the universe is basically in our minds, then again consciousness may survive physical death in some form.Option (1) is most widely embraced by scientists. There is no scientific evidence for option (2). Option (3) is logically possible, but it's hard to find a way of determining whether this or option (1) is correct. Both 1 and 3 lead to us having some tricky things to explain, even though they seem possible. It could be that the truth is something else altogether, perhaps resembling (3) but also involving some elements of the physical universe existing independently in some sense, as Kant thought .... or not.

What exactly happens when states similar to death are entered into? In short: Consciousness is not a thing. It is not even a process.It is an emergent property that arises within a complex enough mind in a complex enough brain.Consciousness is not present in deep sleep or during full anaesthesia, which could be compared to a state of temporary death. It is not present bc. the mind states that create consciousness are not functioning. So, even shorter: NO. There is no evidence, there can be no evidence and there never will be any evidence.

            "answer_text": "Let us say there is a hypothesis that consciousness survives the death of a body. That is a good start to scientific research. First we have to get proper definitions about \u2018consciousness\u2019, \u2018survive\u2019, \u2018death\u2019. We need clear definitions and I think it is possible to write these. Next step is observation of phenomena that support the hypothesis. And then to write a plausible explanation about the phenomena. So it is possible to write a theory after you have done the observations. The observations are of course recurring and observable by more people. Good luck with this interesting project. ",
