            "answer_text": "To answer that you\u2019d have to know the motivation and intent and model the simulators was using. Perhaps they are testing out various cosmological models and this one we are in is just one with an omega value that produces expansion. Maybe they are modelling a universe like theirs. Maybe they\u2019ve got a bad programmer and a parameter was entered incorrectly. Answer to: If the universe is a simulation, why would it make everything move away? ",

            "answer_text": "It is not a simulation but waves. It everything is made by waves, we should think that it will lose energy just because there is expansion. At long term, there is no force available to hold the expansion except if there is a huge amount of energy coming into our direction outside the universe. ",

If such technological progress has reached the point where a simulation like ours is possible, then there could have already been billions and billions of iterations of this same kind of simulation with slightly different variables.
