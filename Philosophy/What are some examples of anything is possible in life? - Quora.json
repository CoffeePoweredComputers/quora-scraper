            "answer_text": "If You Believe In Yourself Anything Is Possible We are all on a journey of discovery which will be made both more pleasurable and successful if we believe in ourselves. You are a work in progress, on a never ending journey. What\u2019s important is to keep moving forward, ensuring you\u2019re heading in the right direction. One of the common themes that runs through my writing is that if you believe in yourself anything is possible, as long as you work hard enough to achieve your dreams, having the determination and persistence to never give up no matter how many times you get knocked down or take a wrong turn. Without a belief in your own potential and abilities, you are doomed to failure. Are you living the life of your dreams? Or do you have unfulfilled dreams that now you feel it's too late to pursue them? Well I'm here to tell you that it's never too late to make all your dreams come true. The only thing that matters is what you think of yourself and what you believe you can achieve. So yes if you\u2019ve given up all hope of ever achieving your dreams, you\u2019re right, you won\u2019t achieve them. On the other hand if you believe that anything is possible, then again you will be right. . In as much as you believe it, it becomes your personal truth. I\u2019m talking about trusting your gut, listening to your heart as well as your mind, and visualising achieving your dream. The minute you start to believe in yourself anything is possible, because a person who believes in himself will not be afraid to push himself to the next level and to risk the possibility of failure. They also know failure is only temporary, and sometimes it\u2019s only a stop on the journey to success. Every Olympian believes in themselves, and it is their belief that carries them past obstacles, keeps them committed to their training program and prepared to make the sacrifices they have to make to achieve their dreams. They are the greatest example that if you believe in yourself anything is possible. If you believe in yourself anything is possible. Your beliefs hold great power. Start believing that you can do anything you put your mind to. I will never get bored with writing blogs like this. All it needs is one reader to be at the right stage in life ready for the push, the wake up call, to make this post achieve something and help another human being to fulfil their life dreams. \u201cAll our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.\u201d Walt Disney You have the power within you to reach for your dreams and achieve your heart desires. If you believe in yourself, anything is possible. You just have to have faith in your abilities and always strive for your best! It\u2019s essential in order to better our lives and reach our dreams, to develop a strong positive belief in ourselves and our abilities. Every one of you has your own individual strengths, talents and passions. Well isn\u2019t it time you allowed these to define you and your life. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cNever Give Up\u201d \u2013 This is the three word phrase that\u2019s very simple to utter. It take a lot of courage to hold on to this phrase. Start by doing what\u2019s necessary; then do what\u2019s possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. Here, I am going to come up as the success stories of famous people who never gave up in their lives and built a respectable place for them in this big universe. 1. Jim Carrey Jim Carrey has come from a very rough phase. He was only 14 when his father lost his job and his family got in huge financial crisis. At that time, they had to move into a VW van on a relative\u2019s lawn. Few years earlier, Jim Carrey mailed his resume to a comedy show but he had to take factory job to feed his family. At the age of 15, Jim used to perform in a comedy show after the school hours. In the next year at 16, he quit school to give some more time to the comedy. And now he is known among the biggest start of Hollywood. He is one of the best actors, producers, comedians and impressionists in Hollywood. 2. Oprah Winfrey Who doesn\u2019t know this wonderful lady? The name is big but the story is even bigger and painful. She has been a real survivor from her childhood. Her childhood was terrible. She was a victim a sexual abuse who was molested by her cousin, uncle and a family friend repeatedly. This is the worst thing that could happen to a girl child. She got pregnant at the age of 14 and gave birth to a child who died after 2 weeks of birth. But she never gave up and built her life. She earned scholarships and finished her high school. She had to deal a lot with her public life too. She was criticized for her weight, race, and so many other things but she never let these critics to come in the way of her success. 3. J. K. Rowling J. K. Rowling has really seen a terrible phase in her life. She was a divorced mother who was under the government aid. She could barely feed her baby in 1994. Then three years later, she wrote a novel named \u201cHarry Potter and The Philosopher\u2019s Stone\u201d. She was so poor that she couldn\u2019t afford a computer at that time and she manually types so many versions of a 9000 words novel so that she could send it to the publishers. Even then her novel was rejected many times by the publishers. Then a small publisher from London gave her a second chance just because the CEO\u2019s daughter loved the novel so much. And now, there is barely a human in this planet who doesn\u2019t know about Harry Potter. 4. Brad Pitt Brad Pitt was first dropped out from University. He was just 2 credits short from being graduate with his journalism degree. Then he moved to Hollywood where he had to work in a giant chicken costume outside a restaurant. Now, he has been awarded with 2 Academy Awards, 2 Golden Globe Awards, Sexiest Man Alive 1995, Sexiest Man Alive 2000 and other countless acting and directing awards. 5. Eminem \u201cRap God\u201d or \u201cKing of Lyrics\u201d wasn\u2019t born. He was made so with his continuous and never ending efforts. This musician failed in 9 standard three times and he was dropped out of high school at the age of 17. He attempted suicide when his girlfriend broke up with him and took his new born child away. He could barely feed his family and her girlfriend had to wrap the gifts for Christmas. He used to sit whole night with a dictionary to explore the words and write the lyrics and no he can write someone\u2019s entire life in his songs. He is awarded with countless awards for singing and writing. He is the most respected and talented white rappers of all time. ",
