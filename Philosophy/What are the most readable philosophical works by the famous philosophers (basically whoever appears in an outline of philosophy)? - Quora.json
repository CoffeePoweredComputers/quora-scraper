            "answer_text": "There are lots of good anthologies of introductory texts in philosophy, with some Plato, Descartes, Hume, Locke etc. They are all fairly readable.  But I do have a favourite for sheer clarity of style and approachability. I would recommend reading AJ Ayer's Language, Truth, and Logic. Despite its errors and problems (and which philosophical work doesn't have those?), it is a focused work that pulls no punches. I read it when I was 15 or so, and I still recall the pleasure it gave me. There are lots of other choices. Peter Singer is a crystal clear contemporary writer on ethics, Voltaire was a great writer, Hume (though a little archaic to modern eyes) always wrote with purpose and drive.   ",
