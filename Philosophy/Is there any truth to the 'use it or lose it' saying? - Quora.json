            "answer_text": "Ive had 3 years of weight lifting class in high school plus and additional year in my mid 20\u2019s whenever i started a membership at golds gym. In high school i was an absolute shrimp, i knew women that could have easily beaten me up when i was only 120 pounds at the age of 15 - I was picked on alot too for being quiet, being overly kind, and usually whispering and looking away every time i spoke to someone. I had no self confidence hardly at all but one thing i did have was anger/resentment and with that after 3 years of working out i went up to just over 180 pounds before i stopped seeing results with nothing more than a 28 inch waist. Now ive heard that muscles begin to break down after 3 weeks of being inactive and i agree with it. I could do 3 sets of 25 pullups, curl 60 pound dumbells and butterfly over 450 pounds, i could never bench for shit though. After just a year or two i literally became half as strong just because i no longer seen anyone to impress after school and in my part of the world there was no point in being that strong so i stopped. The muscle was gone in no time at all, at 18 i weighed 180 and at 19 i was down to 135 - 145. I absolutely believe in the \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d phrase but one thing i always found pretty cool is that due to muscle memory i can build muscle much faster now especially if i ingest whey which i never did in highschool. My highschool diet consisted of steak, hamburgers, hotdogs, waffle house, cereal, fast food etc. and i ate like i had 3 stomachs. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely.  In your adolescence period, your brain undergo what we call a synaptic pruning, means any skill or hobby or activity or anything that you rarely used were eliminated. Meanwhile activities that you most often do were strengthened via growth of new neuron and neural myelination (coating the neuron with fat layer, making the whole network a better conductor; means a faster neural transmission resulting in better performance) So if you spend your teen playing basketball that would stuck on you, spend your day learning violin and that\u2019s the one that would stuck. It work both way though, things that society considered to be less desirable like playing video games or deconstructing popular TV Show plothole will also stuck if you spent all of your time there. So yes, things that you don\u2019t use often in your teenage day such as summer crocheting, daily diary writing, baking lesson you spend three times only attending and so on would be discarded in favor of the activities you often performed.
