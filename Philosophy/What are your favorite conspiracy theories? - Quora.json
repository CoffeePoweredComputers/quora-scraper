            "answer_text": "I have three that I really believe.  Two are original observations, not things I heard or was told. The third is personal observations on a story that appears and then vanishes again every so often... (1)  The government is conspiring to hide the non-existence of extra-terrestrial visitation. This comes from something I noticed while I was living in Santa Cruz, home of alien conspiracies of all manners.  What I noticed was that, every time the UFO nonsense had almost completely died out, someone would pop up with a new \"personal story\" about an encounter.  Most of these were pilots and almost all of them were military. My theory is that the government is actually concocting these stories and feeding them to the public. Why?  Because if the suspiciously inclined people are off chasing non-existant conspiracies with extra-terrestrials, they won't be chasing the real conspiracies with big business (like the invasion of Iraq in order to secure oil rights for the oil companies.) (2)   The government shot down flight 93 on 911. I think the entire \"brave passenger\" story was a concoction to cover the unpalatable idea that our military shot down a civilian plane full of US citizens. Consider this: First,  Flight 93 was the one furthest from its target.  By the time it went down, the first two had already hit their targets.  The US military knew what was going on and had ample time to scramble aircraft. Secondly, the target was the White House.  The White House had been hit by a plane before.  (A small aircraft pilot deliberately crashed his plane into the White House in 1994-- CRASH AT THE WHITE HOUSE: THE OVERVIEW; Unimpeded, Intruder Crashes Plane Into White House).  It would be unthinkable that the military has not responded to that incident by having a ready plan to eliminate any future threat from the air. Additionally, the black box was not released after it was found. It disappeared into the government and there was no reporting on its contents at all beyond a brief notice of it having been found.   (I don't know that it has ever been released, but there was certainly ample time between their finding it and any release that did occur to doctor if necessary.) FInally, what is hard about flying a plane is take off and landing.  Flying itself is pretty easy, especially in a straight line.  If the passengers had actually taken control of the craft anyone could have kept it level and in the air while they radioed for steering and landing help from the ground. All inall, I find the idea that we shot the plane down far more likely then this story of \"brave passengers sacrificing their lives for the president.\"  I also think it was the right call.  All those people were effectively dead anyway had the plane been allowed to complete its flight. (3) The government created the inner-city gang wars. First, the theory:  The most famous, and arguably original, gang war was between the CRIPs and the Bloods in inner city Los angeles.  Something most people dpn't know is that CRIP stood for either \"Community Restoration in Progress\" or \"Community Resources for Independent People\" depending on who you ask.  In either case, they were a group of young people who formed to improve their community taking their lead from the Black Panthers.The Bloods and the Crips The Black Panthers were really always a civil rights and black independence movement, but they took their structure and rhetoric from Marxist philosophy.  (Which was an important strain of political thought in the 60s.)  This scared the government who didn't realize that full on socialist revolt in this case was a metaphor for independence and freedom not an actual threat to the federal government. When the ghettos started organizing around marxist/socialist liens it must've felt like imminent revolution to the powers that be.  In response, they encouraged and armed opposing groups.  The evidence suggests this was done by the CIA.   During the Vietnam, the CIA operated a clandestine airforce called \"Air America\".  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/15/cia-documents-reveal-deta_n_187109.htmlThe CIA denies officially condoning drug trafficking on Air America, but its fairly common knowledge that such did take place.CIA Air Operations in Laos, 1955-1974 There have been claims that the CIA actually brought drugs into the ghetto too, as a way of trying to control the population. Why I believe at least some of this. The theory is plausible given the absolute fear that our government had of communism up through the 80s, and the other known terrible violations it made  on citizens rights in the name of fighting it. More to the point, while I was living in California there would be occasional stories that would break on this and then vanish.  The last and most obvious I remember was in the early days of the public web.  The San Jose Mercury News, a well respected CA paper, ran a series of articles on their public website that were interviews with a gang leader who swore that he was getting machine guns from the government.   Now, by itself, this would not be a terribly trustworthy source.  But what happened next caught my attention.  A week later, the article simply vanished from the website.  No retraction was ever released.  No mention of it ever made by the newspaper again. It was simply gone.   Unfortunately as this pre-dated the Wayback machine there is no evidence that it ever existed except in the minds of those of us who read it ",

            "answer_text": "Paul is dead, miss him, miss him. That\u2019s what you hear if you play the seemingly nonsense ending of I\u2019m So Tired by The Beatles backwards. This is a piece of evidence in the wide spread conspiracy that Paul McCartney died on November 9 1966. The theory says that on the above date, Paul McCartney of The Beatles got into a disagreement with fellow bandmate Ringo Starr and preceded to storm out of their recording studio, get into his car, get into a car crash and eventually die. But Paul McCatney is still alive and making music right? Well what if that isn\u2019t Paul, what if that\u2019s Billy Shears. According to this theory, after Paul\u2019s death The Beatles for whatever reason wanted to cover it up and held a look alike contest and found a man. William Shears-Campbell. This man had gone missing a while before and his name has appeared in a Beatles song post 1966. People say the band felt bad for covering up the death so they left clues in their songs and covers. One was the cover of their album; Abbey Road.  In this cover, Paul isn\u2019t wearing shoes. This might seem trivial but Paul has been \u201cseparated\u201d from the group many times. Because of this people went looking for clues about his death. One was found on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. If you look at the back of the cover Paul is the only one who\u2019s back is facing the camera as if he\u2019s hiding something.  A lyric in one of the songs is \u201cHe blew his mind out in a car\u201d seemingly referring to Paul. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is an album that is littered with Paul is Dead references, and if you search enough you will surely find them. The evidence for this theory is astonishing, but the must convincing part is the difference between pre 1966 Paul and post 1966 Paul. I personally don\u2019t believe this theory but the evidence is astronomical. Some say The Beatles heard this theory and came up with these clues to mess with people. Others say it\u2019s all a coincidence. Whatever it is it certainly is strange. Footnotes: Paul is dead - Wikipedia ",
