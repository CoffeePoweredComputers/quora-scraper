            "answer_text": "This started as a comment, but it stands as my answer: Firstly, it\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t meet certain criteria. It has more to do with the background and motivations behind the behavior, as well as their reliable repetition, rather than those behaviors themselves with regard to diagnosis. Also, there are dozens of disorders and mental illnesses that manifest traits that comorbidize with NPD or might outwardly, in passing, appear to be narcissistic\u2014 but all children are narcissistic, and almost all people with some kind of mental problem or drug addiction appear narcissistic. This does not make them narcissists or necessarily indicate NPD. Secondly, because of the statements above, it is completely irresponsible, totally unreasonable, and ultimately harmful for unqualified persons to go around diagnosing people. Only a qualified psychiatrist can acurately spot a person with narcissistic personality disorder\u2014 and it takes months of analysis and ruling out of other disorders. Quorans like to puff their chests and pontificate as if they know more about NPD than real doctors or the NPD\u2019s themselves; it\u2019s just not so. If you don\u2019t like the behaviors, concentrate on that. Leave the diagnoses to professionals. Only Trump\u2019s doctors can really tell if he has NPD; anyone else is just speculating/talking out of their asses. If Trump really is an NPD, he\u2019s a rather low-functioning, unaware, and stupid one; it\u2019s fair to say that most of us don\u2019t agree he\u2019s qualified IN ANY WAY to be counted among us. Stop diagnosing ANYONE unless you\u2019re the psychiatrist who has treated that particular person. Doing so is irresponsible, unethical, and almost always incorrect. ",
