            "answer_text": "\u201cBy definition, those who see evidence of the \u201csimulation\u201d of reality are literally arguing for a designer. This makes the simulation hypothesis, in a sense, an argument for intelligent design, because it posits that the very nature of the universe suggests deliberate, intentional arrangement. Likewise, the simulation hypothesis would strongly support the possibility of miracles, since a simulation could be adjusted by whoever is in control of it. Ultimately, the claim that all of reality is a simulation is something that cannot be proved, at least not in philosophical or scientific terms. This is mostly due to the self-defeating nature of solipsism: the more sure we are that our experiences are false, the less we can trust those experiences\u2014including the experiences that lead us to believe in solipsism!\u201d Quoted source\u2026 What is simulation theory? Genesis 1:1 (NIV bible) \u201cIn the beginning, God (the intelligent designer) created the heavens and the earth.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "No not at all. Foolish people are always searching for foolish answers for their existence. Instead of turning to their Creator they turn to foolish ideas. These foolish ideas are mainly dreamed up by Hollywood or foolish scientist. Instead of turning to the known they turn to the unknown. Yahuah has told us everything we need to know if we search the biblical scriptures. People actually get paid huge money to investigate if humans can live on the moon or now mars, how rediculous !Yet foolish people entertain this foolishness. ",

A text with such broad and ambiguous content that is for most people completely adrift from any historical, linquistic or cultural context is bound to support almost any possible philisophical position through some interpretation or other.
