            "answer_text": "The central idea of Christianity is reconciling with God, overcoming our mortal state, and eventually joining God\u2019s presence as a joint heir with Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The two most important rules in Christianity are to love God and to love one\u2019s neighbor. Christianity is about faith, repentance and forgiveness, baptism, brotherhood, and following the Golden Rule, relieving suffering, caring for the poor, and obeying every word from the mouth of God. There are many symbols in Christianity, including the cross, the empty tomb, the dove, and the fish.  Christian ritual is full of symbols like the bread as the body of Christ, special clothing, and art. The primary text of Christianity is the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments. Jesus started one church. He chose 12 apostles and ordained them, giving them authority to act in his name and lead his church.  There are over two billion Christians today. Some of them belong to the church Jesus founded, which He still guides today. All the others are either unaffiliated, or belong to man-made denominations. I hope this is helpful.
