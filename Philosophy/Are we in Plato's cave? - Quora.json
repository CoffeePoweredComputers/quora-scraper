            "answer_text": "No, because the allegory of the cave was meant to convey the idea that what we observe is not real reality but rather a shadow of the Forms. I reject the Forms as being actual reality because what we observe is real reality \u2014 what you see is what you get, in terms of the fundamentals. In other words, reality is really composed of entities that have attributes and can engage in motions or changes. Plato was against change or at least fell for the ancient belief that if it changes then it cannot be perfection, because to be perfect meant that a thing would not change over time because this would take it away from a perfect state of being. Also, Plato did not understand causation and therefore thought it was an illusion of the senses. But Aristotle corrected that particular mistaken view by coming up with his four causes to explain motion or change. Here is what Ayn Rand thought of change or motion: \u201cTo grasp the axiom that existence exists, means to grasp the fact that nature, i.e., the universe as a whole, cannot be created or annihilated, that it cannot come into or go out of existence. Whether its basic constituent elements are atoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it is not ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the law of identity. All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions of elements within the universe\u2014from a floating speck of dust to the formation of a galaxy to the emergence of life\u2014are caused and determined by the identities of the elements involved.\u201d -Ayn Rand Lexicon I also wrote an essay on causation that I think is accurate and a further example from Ayn Rand\u2019s understanding of causation: \u201cSome people seem to think that one has to get to the particular aspect of the entity that leads to the conclusion that it acts that way under those circumstance due to that particular factual nature of the entity. An example would be that water boils at that temperature due to the hydrogen bonds breaking which transforms water (a liquid) into water vapor (a gas). But while this is true, it is an advanced scientific \u2013 special science\u2019s \u2013 understanding of why water boils, and comes only after one understands that water boils due to the fact that it is water. One has to grasp that an entity acts the way it does due to that fact that it is what it is, before one can abstract further and get to the more specific cause of that particular action, and the philosophical knowledge that an entity acts due to what it is precedes the scientific knowledge. What I\u2019m claiming is that one observes that it is water directly and observes that it boils directly, and that the boiling (action) is abstracted from the water (entity), leading to cause and effect \u2013 water is the cause (a fact about water) leads it to act that way (boiling) under those conditions (sufficient heat).\u201d Causality Given in Observation ",

            "answer_text": "Let us begin by taking the allegory to mean that there is a real world whose nature is independent of appearance, and, that as we commonly know from illusion, there is no a priori guarantee that appearance is what is real or that appearance precisely reveals the real. Of course, we know (e.g., from Descartes\u2019 Cogito argument) that there are appearances. So that is one mark against the idea that we are irrevocably in the cave. On the other hand, it does indeed seem that we may never be able to entirely transcend appearance and arrive at final, complete, and true knowledge of the real. Let us examine that. I think it is fair to argue that some appearances reveal the real in some rough sense to some degree of approximation. Notice that I said \u2018reveal\u2019 and not \u2018correspond to\u2019 (or something along the lines of a theory of truth). That is, I am being vague about what truth is (at this point). However, I am able to negotiate the world as it appears with some degree of success and I think it would be too much to argue that all of the apparent success is merely apparent\u2014i.e. is illusory. So, then, appearance has some efficacy as a measure of the real. To say that is not to say we are out of the cave but it is saying that what is going on in the cave partakes of the real even if it is not precisely the real. What is more, if it is argued that we can never get out of appearance entirely, then surely we have two options (i) admit we can never have perfect knowledge according to a realist (not pragmatic) theory of truth or (ii) say that realist theories of truth do not make entire sense to maintain. A problem, though, is that we do not know whether we can get entirely beyond appearances. But we can do so sometimes. We already saw that there are appearances and that they are part of the world. We can also say \u201cIf being is what there is, then there is being.\u201d We can say \u201cIf we define the universe as all being, then there is a universe.\u201d We can then also say \u201cIf material cause is interaction among different beings then, since there is no other being for the universe, there is no effective cause on the universe.\u201d We can also say \u201cIf a creator is another being, the universe has no creator.\u201d That is we can arrive at perfect knowledge. Some perfect knowledge, that is. But note that the perfection arrived at is the result of abstracting out from the world only its features so general that they are not subject to the distorting effect of illusion. Conclusion\u2014of course, with some hesitation: From a truth perspective we will always have one foot in the cave and one out in the light. We can arrive at some truth; but we can never overcome illusion (or incompleteness of knowledge) entirely.But if that is true, then it makes perfect truth in all things undesirable\u2014for it makes no sense to desire the impossible.We therefore (as has been argued) prefer to not disengage our theory of knowledge from our theory of value and think that our imperfection from one perspective is perfection from another. That is, while we ought not to stop striving to become better (e.g. have better knowledge) we ought not to think that we are lesser being because we have not yet arrived.",

            "answer_text": "Most certainly. the message of the allegory is that we on our own have no access to truth about ourselves and the world around us. This fact has not changed. Plato saw that all is in flux, we could not be certain of anything that we claimed to know. modern man has been deceived by the successes of science, but has forgotten the search for truth. he has been satisfied with untruth, with shadows, exactly as those chained in the cave. truth must be revealed. In the case of the allegory, one man is released and he discovers truth. Upon returning to his friends and telling them that the truth is not here, these are shadows. The real is outside the cave. Do they follow him out to see truth?? No. They rise up and kill him. that is the perverse nature of man. The sick fallen sinful nature because we do not want to know truth. i should not need to remind you of the claim made by Jesus who said \u201cI am the truth\u201d and what his brothers did to Him. mankind Is mostly satisfied to live in the Cave.

Insofar as our minds are concerned with anxiety, anger, jealousy, fear, or negativity of any kind \u2014 and not with uplifting, noble and inspiring positive thoughts \u2014 we are in the Plato\u2019s cave. The cave allegory can be understood in two senses: cognitively, and in a religious/spiritual way. At the cognitive level, it symbolizes how we are chained to false opinions. We develop and cling to false opinions because unregulated appetites and desires distort our thinking. At a spiritual level, being in the cave symbolizes a mental life oriented towards material things. Plato argues that both to think clearly and to live happily our thinking should be guided by eternal verities of Truth, Beauty and Harmony, and by our highest innate sense of the Good. The solution Plato proposes is a renovation of the mind by moral development (especially the virtues of Courage, Moderation, Prudence, Righteousness and Holiness), and by focused sharpening of the intellect (dialectic).

It is however most likely to be in multiple caves that contains inner caves and conjunctions of caves. Your biology is a cave. Your nationality and your culture is a cave. Your family structure, your states values, your relatives, your friends are all caves as well. Some have deeper walls and higher hierarchy. So yes, you are in a cave most certainly I'd say. It is however fairy illogical and ineffective to observe your walls without being inside a cave I believe. And yet one can argue against being inside a cave and believing existence of a cave is actually willingly accepting residing in a cave. One of the most astonishing realizations of being in a cave is you obtain certain amount of self-doubt and scepticism that you should use always. ",

We see ourselves and others as their real selves inside their bodies, including plants and animals. The greatest freedom is realizing we are eternal children of God and the goal and meaning of life is to reestablish Sanatan Dharma - our eternal duty/function in connection with loving God. This is removing our shackles and finally getting out of the dark cave of illusion. ",
