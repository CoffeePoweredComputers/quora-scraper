            "answer_text": "The facts about the formation of the Illuminati, or Bund der Perfektibilisten(Covenant of Perfectibility) from 1776 by Adam Weishaupt is not a conspiracy. It is a fact. The rumors about what that original group became is the conspiracy. As an observer of \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d for many years, my opinion is based upon common sense. I believe that conspiracy theories remain conspiracy theories until enough evidence proves them to be based upon facts or proven without any doubt to be false. There seems to always be folks that regardless of the facts will believe that something IS or IS NOT a conspiracy theory. These folks are usually extremists. I think some of the most extreme are the people that don\u2019t believe something after it is proven to be true. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally because people find it hard to understand a world where one monolithic organization or one person can\u2019t be blamed for everything. Human society is a very complex machine. Billions and billions of causes and effects, beliefs interacting with one another, joining and conflicting, ideas rising and falling, the wheels keep turning. In a way, believing someone is in control of everything comforts us. Even if that controlling force is your perceived enemy. It gives them purpose, and tends to make people feel special or important When they Believe themselves to be fighting for the greater good against what basically amounts to the greatest of all evils. It\u2019s easier to blame everything on one target, Even a fictional one, and suits the ego to treat yourself like a rebel hero. ",
