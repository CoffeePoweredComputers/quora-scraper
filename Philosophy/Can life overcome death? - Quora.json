            "answer_text": "We are promised in the Bible we will live forever on the earth. John 3:16 says \u201c\u201cfor God so loved the world he gave his only begotten so so those who believeth in him may not die but have everlasting life. So God, through his son grants us everlasting life if we exercise faith in Jesus. In Psalms 37:9\u201311\u201329 says man will live forever on the earth in peace. In Acts 24:15 God promises a resurrection of our dead loved ones back to earth in the last day. In Revelation 21:4 says there\u2019ll be no more pain or death. God\u2019s original purpose was for man to live forever in the garden of eden. God\u2019s purpose hasn\u2019t changed. In Romans 5:21 says \u201c\u201cso that just as sin ruled as king with death, so also underserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness, heading to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d So we are guaranteed everlasting life through the end of this system or at our resurrection. When Jesus resurrected Lazarus from the dead, it was to earth. That was a foregleam of the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets look it this way. The existence of any object has a life cycle. The creation, existence and destruction. So, for every creation leads to existence, which ends up in destruction. So ideally life and death co-exists. It is how we spend the existence phase. If your focus remains on creating beautiful memories in existence phase, there is nothing to worry about creation or destruction. Its our responsibility to live the fullest in our existence phase.

            "answer_text": "Birth and death the two sides of one stick and its name is life. In existence whosoever is live has to take birth and finally death prevails. Death is the end point for new birth. Death is eternal truth so as life. Life exist in the moment but when physical body loses its capacity to hold consciousness death took place.  So death must be celebrated as part of new birth. If you want to get rid of this life and birth enlightenment or nirwan is the way. Thanks ",

As a specie\u2019s environment changes, the species changes to allow it to survive, the species that is, not the individuals. I can imagine a future where science has figured out how to allow individual humans to be able to enjoy the adaptability that the species enjoys. That would make death, for humans, unnecessary. ",
