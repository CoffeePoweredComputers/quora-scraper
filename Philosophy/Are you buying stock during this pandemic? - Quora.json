            "answer_text": "I bought a bunch of stuff in the short-term that revolved around mean-reversion. All of these trades are closed now as I\u2019ve reverted back to the normal stuff I\u2019ve had (and have wanted to own from even before the pandemic hit). This is in no particular order (every single trade done by some algorithm/computer/etc): Walgreens, WBA - I think that of the brick and mortar establishments, the battle between CVS and Walgreens was a weird one. CVS has better locations and generally larger revenue, but Walgreens was mathematically the better candidate by proportion. Since the implied volatility was low, I\u2019d consistently purchase options on them between $36-$38 strike when it fell. The premiums were low because the equity has far less volume moving and far less traffic relative to the technology madness occurring. If I was slightly in the money, I would purchase the equity and hold until it was more profitable before selling.XRX, Xerox - I think the pandemic was hitting companies like Xerox disproportionately because most investors thought they would have close to no business. I executed similarly to Walgreens, except I had far less options trades on them, particularly at strikes around $13-$14. Again, low implied volatility, low premiums. I also almost always picked up options on the money or slightly in the money (to hedge against premium decay if I wanted to buy out the equity).BA, Boeing - Boeing fell so badly that I couldn\u2019t guess where the lowest point was going to be, and that was okay. I purchased options at around $150 strike while it was still falling to its bottom at $90. I lost a few trades for weeks on end, and then the following options made back that money within two weeks (and continued to make money for around 8 weeks straight).VIX (options) - I typically hate the VIX as a measurement of anything because I don\u2019t think it does anything except give gamblers an extra instrument to guess on. However, between April and May, I began selling weekly calls starting at around $40 and I kept inching that down for around 10\u201312 weeks straight to around $28-$30 or so. The reasoning behind this was quite simple, algorithmically: The implied volatility in the VIX is extremely high because the implied volatility of trading S&P calls were extremely high (and the former is derived literally from the latter). So, I essentially used the VIX to bet that the American economy would remain stable (or stabilize) relative to the drop that had occurred. For those 12 or so weeks, I took advantage of the very high premiums that the market-takers were willing to give me. I believe I won every single week, and on most weeks the premium on those calls decayed fully.VIACA, Viacom - Media is here to stay. Viacom trading so low was so silly that I purchased only one set of calls on May 6th at $17.5 for $1.36 a share. I rolled all those calls into November 20, 2020. They appreciated around 400% or so. I sold them last month. It was one of the more disproportionate opportunities that the system picked up.DFS, Discover Financial Services - Of the bunch, including AMEX, Capital One, Visa, Mastercard, etc, Discover was the most deflated. I had a pretty significant amount of $34 calls expiring on April 24, 2020, that I put in on April 22, 2020. I can\u2019t remember if this made money or not. The following two weeks or so I purchased an $80 call expiring in January 2021 for extremely cheap along with a significant amount of $34-$40 calls expiring at the end of July and the end of August. These appreciated about 300% or so, too. All of these are sold, including the $80 strike.One thing to note was that these were trades done usually each week or every two weeks. The idea was to play what would happen on average. I also sold puts where I thought the premium was significant (this was the reasoning behind selling VIX call options, which is basically the analog of that). Other miscellaneous trades that align with the same as above: PCG (Power, Gas, & Electric), Nvidia (this wasn\u2019t a pandemic pick, I had a lot of Nvidia from 2011 when it was pennies and bought more in 2019 around $150 or so a share, and a small group of equities that a few of the algorithms were designed to be tracking. All of those positions are sold. ",

            "answer_text": "Regardless of whether there\u2019s a pandemic, I\u2019m always buying stocks whenever I see opportunities with 5\u201310x+ returns. I\u2019ll share 3 of my investments below (please do your own research, as they are all very volatile, so if you can\u2019t stomach volatility, these investments are not for you!). 1. ImmunoPrecise Antibodies, Ltd.  ImmunoPrecise Antibodies is a clinical research organization (CRO) that offers as full suite of services as Immunoprecise Antibodies does. Take a look at its Q1 of 2020 financial results\u2026 $6M of cash on hand.Revenue of $3.8MGross profit of $2.4M (64%)Adjusted EBITDA of $932KNet loss of $549KFinancials aside, look at what makes ImmunoPrecise Antibodies attractive\u2026 A phenomenal leadership team.Balance sheet loaded with cash ($6M on hand).Cost efficiencies that have improved margins.Some competitors may offer partial expertise in the antibody discovery space but they don\u2019t offer the full complement of services in antibody optimization, and engineering and manufacturing. But ImmunoPrecise does!ImmunoPrecise is the ONLY company (out of 3 that have come forward) with 3 antibody solutions for COVID-19, as of 2020.75 antibodies with potent neutralizing ability ready to go.2 quarters in a row of 50% YOY revenue growth.U.S. institutional investors are piling to get in.In conversation with U.S. and Canadian governments.Once ImmunoPrecise Antibodies reaches the minimum $4/share required to be listed on NASDAQ, it will be listed there, which will bring a whole ton of liquidity.  I am also a part of an investor forum with one of the directors of ImmunoPrecise (Paul Andreola), and I know it is his largest position in his portfolio (~50% or 60%, if I remember correctly). Along with the macro tailwind of the search for a COVID-19 therapy and funding being injected into CROs, there is a lot more room for ImmunoPrecise to run. 2. Antero Resources  Antero is the second largest NGL (propane) producer in the United States with 50% free cash flow yield. That\u2019s a significant statement! The oil crash in 2020 has caused a massive imbalance in U.S. gas supplies in 2021, and it\u2019s likely that U.S. gas prices will average ~$2 in 2020, but ~$4 in 2021. Speaking macro, natural gas accounts for almost 40% of electricity generation in the U.S\u2026.  While nat gas isn\u2019t just used for electricity generation, the big growth in nat gas consumption over the last 20 years has been in electricity generation!  In fact, the demand for natural gas has also grown by ~30% over the last 10 years, driven by conversions of coal-fired power plants to natural gas, along with dramatic increases in LNG exports. While there are a lot of other natural gas names, I\u2019d say you get the best bang for your buck with Antero. Take a look below at other natural gas companies\u2019 2021 production/share when compared with Antero\u2026  Goehring & Rozencwajg researched about the oil/gas ratio going from $25 to 6\u20138x. They believe that we will see WTI (West Texas Intermediate\u2014crude index) at $75 which means gas could be $9~$12. If they are even half right about their research, Antero Resources will be worth much more than $20. Also, don\u2019t ignore the fact that Berkshire Hathaway made a bet on the macro tailwind of natural gas and allocated $10B into the sector! I love the asymmetric risk/reward here. 3. Commodities and Hard Assets  The commodities market is cyclical and typically uncorrelated to the broad market indices. If anyone were to invest in commodity stocks near any of the bottoms in the past few decades, they would have multiplied their capital in a matter of 5\u201310 years. And we are in the same place today\u2014a historical cyclical bottom. With central banks constantly expanding money supply and debasing their own currencies, this is the catalyst for an inflationary environment, which is a huge macro tailwind for commodities to do well. Again, commodities is a CYCLICAL asset class, and I\u2019ve been buying a ton of energy and commodity stocks because\u2026 They\u2019re trading at historical lows when compared with broad market indices.They\u2019re needed for society.They\u2019re critical to political security.Truth is, no country can obtain political security without energy security, and that\u2019s a part of the bull thesis for energy and commodities. I\u2019ve dumped my deflationary assets (tech) and bought inflationary hedge assets (energy, materials, commodities), and plan on holding them for the coming decade, as that\u2019s where mass capital will flow in to over the coming years. Positioning yourself near the bottom of the commodity cycle and riding it for all its worth can be the difference between life in a cubicle and achieving financial freedom. Don\u2019t know where to start? If you\u2019re interested in learning about more unique investment ideas that target 5\u201310x+ returns over the coming years, I highly recommend checking out Chris MacIntosh\u2019s weekly research. Chris retired in his late-20s, having turned pennies into pounds in asymmetric bets like\u2026 The New Zealand real estate (64x return)The last commodities bull market (10x)Bitcoin (20x)Shipping (27x)He now runs a deep value hedge fund and is sharing what he\u2019s doing in his fund with retail investors who are not accredited investors and cannot access his fund.

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe way to make money is to buy when blood is running in the streets.\u201d - quote John D. Rockefeller. It\u00b4s not necessary to be a master of economy to predict that this will end up in a recession. It\u00b4s also not necessary to dig too deep to understand the purpose and the effect of it. What will happen is the usual, the rich will get richer and poor will get poorer - also called the Matthew effect. History repeats itself To understand why buying stocks during a pandemic or a recession is a good idea you just have to consult history. 1990 - Oil crisis - recession - Stocks drop and rise again2000 - Dot com bubble crisis - recession - Stocks drop and rise again2008 - Banking crisis - recession - Stocks drop and rise again2020 - Corona crisis - recession - Stocks drop and rise againYou might see a pattern here. You can search for more crises in the past. You will find some every 8\u201310 years. Now the tricky part! Which stocks should we pick? That demands attention to detail of the stock in question. You can bet that the majority of blue chip companies will still be alive and kicking after the crisis. It has a reason why they are at the top of the economic food chain. They showed resilience towards crises and political changes and often have decades long historys. However, since the Lehman bros went broke, the old saying of \u201ctoo big too fail\u201d is no longer valid, even though not completely wrong. The future and the past - not the presence That said, stocks that have along history are a preferable choice but also those who are on their way, like Blockchain companies, sustainable clean energy, and all the other thigns that will become more and more important in the future. What is at a high at this very moment might not be in the near future. Those are chancier than old and established blue chips nethertheless interesting options. The due dilligence on those needs to be conducted to a very deep level though. ",

Picked up some Shopify, Home Depot, Amazon, Microsoft, Lennar, Crowdstrike, Cloudflare, Adobe, Paypal, Salesforce, Mastercard, Visa, and Apple in the past week. In this sort of volatility I think individual stocks can be a bargain compared to buying ETFs. You have to be picky right now and ETFs are now burdened down with losing companies. I have about three bullets left to continue buying with. If I exhaust those and the market stabilizes and begins it\u2019s recovery I will use margin loans to increase my buying power. I do not worry about doing so because I could raise the cash it is just inconvenient. I don\u2019t use all my leverage and treat it like a car loan. Pay it every month and stay far away from a margin call. At 2% interest why not? If Apple goes under $200 I will use margins and sell one of my kidneys to start and my second as it nears $150. ",

            "answer_text": "What can ordinary investors do to prepare 1.You cannot time the market. Invest in the long-term and do not overthink about the entry point if you are a long-term investor. You never could and definitely cannot start now. So, instead of guessing whether stock markets are going to rise or fall further after Covid-19, adopt a longer horizon. Get some exposure in the stock market but do it for the long run. There is no point to pick the best mutual fund, as most of them underperform the markets. Go for a cheap ETF. Robinhood or Vanguard will probably do for most jurisdictions.  If you are a long-term investor, you will earn money. Read the Intelligent Investor written by Graham, Warren Buffet\u2019s mentor. 2. Keep some cash. Not only as a safe haven but to also exploit opportunities when you identify them. Having liquidity is also very important. 3. Choose low correlated stocks. You diversify more with 5 stocks that negative correlated than buying 100 stocks that are extremely correlated.  4.Safe havens, like government bonds (US, Germany, UK) still have their place in your portfolio. 5. Look for market-neutral alternatives. This can be alternative types of exposure, investment styles, methods, etc. Look for market-neutral assets and funds. At the toughest periods, the market-neutral investments will keep your portfolio beating. It is true that market-neutral exposure is not the easiest thing to achieve as an ordinary investor, but there are a few apps that try to achieve that. I find Daedalus Investment Platform interesting, but I am sure there will be others as well for jurisdictions not covered. Other tips to diversify your portfolio. If you don\u2019t know where and what to invest , here are some tips most recent tips from BlackRock Institute, the best performing asset manager in the long-term  Summary: These are hard times for the markets and events that are unprecedented for our generation. It is and will be tough, but the best we can do is be prepared both for the virus (social distancing & healthy routine) and for our long-run financial plan. ",

As it stands -96% of my investments in MARCH 2020 are now 30% INCREASE more than purchase price in the last 01 month & 01 week I have always said i just followed the below simple benchmarks and needs minimal research & i have always done the under -SO follow the below rules a) Studied a potential share & also studied the industry of the concerned share-example:with plastics identified as a problem i looked at the paper industry b) Is the potential share a Dividend paying company ? c) What is it\u2019s EPS(earning per share ) of the concerned company ? d) What is the P/E (price earnings) & Industry PE & EPS of the company ? e) What is 52 week High,52 Week Low & Current Mktg price of share researched. f) Finally watch the ACTUAL share movement of this Share over 25 days-Do not be in a haste -you are not God WHO HAD 07 DAYS to make this planet Here below is a small sample of actual purchases made at actual prices as below I seek NO CHARGES from anyone -nor am i seeking business NOR am i pushing any shares of/or any company.

In your life one really has just TWO CHOICES which are as under : 1. Would you like to control your life & all your actions in all your investments ? 2. Would you like to HAND OVER your hard earned money to strangers & end up paying huge charges which are 10 times more than doing it yourself ? I started my business in 1989 and by 2009 -my business was in 14 verticals-in 2010 since i was preoccupied with my business -I started investing my spare money around Rs.1.50 lacs monthly in 12 mutual funds -i was told to wait for 05\u201307 yrs for a 12% annual return In April 2018 when i reviewed the total investment i found i had invested Rs.1,44,00,000/-(Rs.1.50 lacs x 96 months ) and my nett asset value Rs.1,51,20,000 or just 5% in 08 years from these mutual funds -I can send anyone the actual documents of the above to anyone as proof. Anyway I stopped my monthly SIP payments of Rs.1.50 lacs in April 2018- and since there was a 01 year lock in period i sold 70% of the 15120000 INR nav VALUE and started investing directly via my trading demat ac (here too there was a great variance in brokerage charged -so i had to find a reasonable demat firm) Today\u2019s generation are part of smaller families and unlike my generation who had to put maximum of our life savings in property -the current generation who have grown up on fastest DATA plans & smartphones will DIRECTLY invest in shares,forex,futures etc Indian stock exchanges which was 02 Trillion US Dollars will be 200 Trillion US Dollars in 2045 -Direct investing in Mid Caps and Small Caps are mostly Risk Free and easily gives me 25% nett return year Hope the above has been helpful & all the best to your families ",

Of course, I expect the stock market to get worse before it gets better, so I\u2019m in no hurry to buy back in, having liquidated most of my stock positions shortly before the Talented Mister Trump took office. Right now, I am basically in the same position as people who rode the market up and back down. I plan to buy back in slowly, keeping enough funds liquid to last through an extended economic downturn of up to two years. ",

As in, I buy it and I \u201chope\u201d it works\u2026because there are no fundamentals to rely upon in a global shutdown. Hope for the best. Be prepared for the worst. This market is either a Good Buy or a Good Bye. What individual names you buy are not as important. Seems like you can throw a dart at a few quality names and take your chances. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a fraud. I deal in probabilities. If the numbers are in my favor and I can quantify my risk, I do it. What happened to the Stock Markets in the last Global Pandemic where the World stood still? That\u2019s right. No one knows because we have never experienced this, man-made shut down. We are at the mercy of unintended consequences. ",

I have made a number of small dollar amount investments since then into seven no-load Fidelity mutual funds. In fact, I put money into two funds yesterday. This is called dollar cost averaging and I am diversifying my investments by investing in a number of funds in different sectors of the market.
