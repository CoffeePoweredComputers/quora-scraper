            "answer_text": "Heaven and hell can simply be compared and defined: In heaven, one lives eternally in the presence of Love. In hell, one lives eternally in the absence of Love. I don't know if we can truly imagine the dreadful reality of existing in the absence of love. Our creator of all things is Love. Yes, God is Love. And since love naturally allows the freedom to choose, love cannot/does not force anyone. Therefore, each human being decides, by our own will, our destiny \u2014 heaven or hell. We're told, \u201cEyes have not seen and ears have not heard the things the Lord has prepared for us (those who choose to accept the offered love of God).\u201d No one could know this or even foolish enough to conjure up such thoughts. We had to be told by a self-revealing God. Though not a lot of detail is known about heaven, the record of origin gives us enough to await with great anticipation; yet, not enough to make us want to die to be with the Lord; and just in case, we are told to \u201cchoose life\u201d \u2014 understood to mean, choose to remain alive. In the case of hell, we are given enough info so we are discouraged from going there. No one will have an escuse to reject the forgiveness of sins, therefore choosing condemnation. Heaven and hell are places, but where are they? Though many have made suggestions, that's all they are \u2014 just suggestions. We know that the \u201cHeavenly Jerusalem\u201d will descend from heaven and will \u201csettle\u201d over the current Jerusalem in Israel. God's people (made so by the sacrificial death of Messiah Jesus) who once lived in time, throughout the ages, will descend from heaven along with Jesus and the New Jerusalem. What I and all Believers do, and the responsibilities we are given, only gets better from there. Some believe that hell \u2014 the place reserved for the eternal punishment of Satan and all who sides with him \u2014 is located in the center of the earth. But hell's location is not revealed. We know from the word of God that all humans will be given a body that will exist forever \u2014 in heaven or hell. For the sinful body we now live in cannot exist in God's holy presence; neither can it withstand the eternal suffering of the fire and agony humans have chosen for themselves. Our presence in heaven and hell will certify its reality. Meanwhile, let's not forget that God is love and do not wish for any to perish. That's why Jesus saves. ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven is a state of mind just as hell is. You can see the physical heavens by looking upwards. You can see hell in the things that people suffer intensely and needlessly. As for heaven i believe it is a location also, a heavenly paradise. As for hell i dont think a loving God would create a human being to throw them into an eternal place of torment. That is a duality and goes against the nature of what love is. Hell is symbolic. As for a place of fiery anguish it doesnt exist. God isnt that cruel. But the things the human soul has to go through will be as strong as its flames if it rebels against the creator indefinitely. There is a scripture that early Christian writings used to signify that hell isnt eternal but an age after an age. They used \u201cuntil he has paid the last penny\" signifying that hell is only for the correction and not the destruction of man. Most indoctrinated people wont agree but they truly dont know. Theyve been taught that hell is eternal which isnt compatible with Gods nature. The early church father Origin introduced doctrines of everyone being saved. The latin church leaders didnt agree with this and they were the ones that influenced the bible being translated into its current translation. The other schools of early Christian thought believed that people would be punished by hell but not cast out forever and condemned to an eternity there. In my opinion that more lines up with the truth of Gods judgment. ",

            "answer_text": "How are heaven and hell, and who will certify those to be real? Heaven and Hell will be what they have always been - a diversity of conflicting images in indoctrinated brains; - usually indoctrinated into immature brains, before they have developed the defensive mechanisms of rational critical thinking during the formal operational stage of cognitive development. Alan Appleby's answer to When you get to Heaven and he asks you why should you stay what is your response? Atheists be nice. who will certify those to be real? Those who think from their indoctrinated preconceptions will certify their versions of the personal images in their minds to be real, and their god-delusion programming will inhibit them from doubting this. They may even seek out reassurances and the asserted writings of fellow believers, to help prop up the preconceptions on which they base their circular thinking. Alan Appleby's answer to What makes it hard for you to believe that there's an afterlife? Regular community Sunday/Sabbath, reaffirmations of these beliefs will help maintain them, and resist inputs of evidence from the material world which could cause doubts. ",

There is the Bible that was written by about 40 different individuals over 1600 years which was inspired by God. How can it have conilogical order, and prophesies that all have come true. Before the creation of everything, God created angels and some of them turned bad. Satan, a fallen angel, deceived Adam and Eve, and as a result everything is not perfect any more. Man and everything on earth, even the universe became cursed. Because of sin, God created a hell for people who are bad, don't believe in God, and for Satan. Those that believe in the triune God, in the gospel, who ask for forgiveness of sins will be in God's created heaven. God will deal with Satan and unbelievers when he comes to earth for his judgment.

Of course immigration status and travel plans will need to be negotiated directly with each other republic. If they are off world locations, they can negotiate directly with UN for alien registration. We will then need some proof of their existence and purpose. Probably their constitution, laws, anthems, flags, their governance style, legal system and whatever religion constitutes their realm. We would also like to know their demographics, currency and population. Their diet, food sources and medical fraternity would also be beneficial. In the aspect of mutual relations, we would also like to know about their sporting activities and pastimes. I am certain that as a global community we will strive our very best to have cordial relations and trade with them. We will also encourage tourism if they seem amicable. ",

Can you make a difference between these two? To me that is an visible example God gives us,by what you see it make sense, one season for cold weather another season hot. Those example prove to me He'll and Heaven exist. Only way I can make you understand better it's to Refer you to Revelation 20:10 and Luv 16 : 19-31 ",
