            "answer_text": "What are the benefits of having your own philosophy? There are none. You put all that thought and effort into it, in an alternative furious and cursory evolving dialogue between hard, no-nonsense thought and a sure aesthetic sense of what makes conceptual systems beautiful, and at the end of it all you\u2019re left with a dog\u2019s breakfast of banal truisms propped together by tautology, puerile and jejune moral, artistic and sexual manifestos whose coherence can best be described as atonal, a retarded process of examination (hampered and impeded by various tenets previously arrived at and \u201cproved true\u201d), and an underlying justification for it all that not only fails to justify, it fails to underlie. It\u2019s overarching instead! Get your ass back down here and start acting foundational before I put a boot up your fundament, basis! I swear. Premises don\u2019t stay put, jumping to conclusions in a wild leapfrog race and demanding to be falsified the second they get there, inferences are lockstep valid inexorably and inevitably right straight through in an iron chain of causality that just trails off into the aether, failing to hook anything good. Anything important, illuminating, provocative or even interesting. Worst/best of all, whichever way you tilt your head, all these combinations of lenses come sliding and clicking into frame, different combinations depending, each combo pulling a view into focus that you could not rule out. Because each of the individual lenses (or if you prefer, frames) was one you\u2019d previously established demonstrably valid, depending case by case. Therefore, theoretically of some potential use to squint and peer through things at, dubiously. Actually, that part\u2019s pretty cool! I saved a lot of those. I call it my pantheatic frame array. No I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t call it anything. There\u2019s no need to call it anything. \u201cPantheatic\u201d is a little grandiose, frankly. More like zalitheatic frame array. Anyway! Please understand, when I describe the benefit of having my own philosophy, I speak from experience. However, you should not mistake me. I do not and cannot describe the benefit to you of having your own philosophy. Yours would surely not turn out to be mine, and would have its own features and potentially, benefits. Your mileage may vary. Mine never really did. I came up with a pretty sweet name for it though. I called it Combobulism. It was an extraordinarily combobulated approach to thought, but it never got there. Never quite got there. Regardless! At least in the course of pursuing it, I became interested in philosophy. Prior-to, I really had an antipathy towards philosophy. Partly this was contempt of wisdom. People would talk about wisdom like it was some whole deal, like it was a distinct and identifiable human attribute, but the things they\u2019d call wisdom seemed - okay! Some of them, clearly practical! Good sound sense. Others, luminescent or effervescent, and pleasant to contemplate. To hold in the mind, slowly rotating in a light from who-knew-where. A good bit of what got called wisdom I could specifically dig! But as a specific personal ability that could be recognized and appreciated and in some sense measured, like strength or intelligence? Like dexterity, or\u2026I dunno, charisma? Like comeliness? Now there\u2019s one you don\u2019t hear every day. But you sure do know it when you see it! Wisdom by comparison just seemed this real loose, blobby feel-good thing. I resented the nebulousness, hailed by all as if it were all one thing. That was then. Now, I realize I just wasn\u2019t wise. Still amn\u2019t! But then I had an active, visceral disdain for wisdom. By knee-jerk disinclination, I was an antisopher. I practiced, in my offhand head-toss way, antisophy. When I said something and someone called me wise, I used to look at them like they\u2019d just given me my midichlorian count. Pretty high! Thanks? Anyhow, that and people calling me \u201ca philsopher\u201d (gah) (PAH!) eventually got me interested. I decided I had dismissed something without fully understanding it, perhaps peremptorily. So I put some strong direction and intention into the whole schmear. It worked! I developed my own philosophy, I got a weird handle on the whole tilting and shifting relation of philosophical objects as held and suspended differently by different schools, and somewhere along the line, I acquired an uncertain, but sure and loving, ungrudging regard for wisdom. Because looked at objectively, wisdom is the shit, yo! It doesn\u2019t have to be a distinct coherent phenomenon, readily identifiable by its nature and character. Wisdom is the ultimate case of case-by-case, where you pull light straight from your fundament and shine it on, shine it down. People are like, \u201cHey!\u201d Anyway, I\u2019m like \u201cHey.\u201d Now that I got my mind right on the wisdom tip. Hey, wisdom. The philosophy was worth it for working it out, but ultimately it proved about as useful as a blowjob in a gas chamber. That\u2019s okay. I\u2019m first glad I saw it through, and second glad I saw through it. If there\u2019s one thing I learned by the exercise, it\u2019s that principle is completely alien and superfluous to me, and philosophy (at least such philosophy as I could contrive) was way too heavily-dependent on it. I call bad job. I cop to it, I own it. I did a bad job on Combobulism, even if I also must (in fairness to me) respectfully submit that I did probably the best job I could. Given my just means, my available materials (including immaterial ones), and no end in sight. Point is: it may very well be that you could do a good job! On your own philosophy. On your own philosophy. Hands off mine, pal. It remains taken, even if I don\u2019t sport around on it anymore much. I remain a Combobulist, and if there\u2019s one thing the world doesn\u2019t need, it\u2019s another one of those. Go get your own. Might I propose, Organizism? I almost went with that one! The way things were shaping and heading, though, it seemed way more combobulated than organized, or even organic. ",

            "answer_text": "The benefits are huge. The need is less obvious. A philosophy is a coherent way of thinking. Resembling mathematics in this, a language developed from a few simple postulates, for example about points and lines for geometry. A philosophy does the same. It develops from a set of basic concepts. The variety of subjects encountered forms overlaps between systems of thought. However, the creator of his own philosophy recognizes himself through some basic principles which unify his thought. This approach responds to acute problems. Important things remain unexplained in the eyes of the philosopher. The black hole is ominous enough to motivate sustained intellectual upheaval. Very different situation from a circumstantial interest. Many people read philosophy out of curiosity or boredom, because they have been encouraged to do so and it is in the mores of their cultural background. They don't have a very serious problem to solve. Their life is easy. The philosophical work is read like a novel: full of surprises, paradoxes, fun. Not that these readers would be incapable of making their personal synthesis. They make one, electing their favorite author. They identify with the thought of another, comment on it, develop it. They could go further, but do not experience the sufficiently intense existential conflict that gives rise to a new philosophy. If I take my personal example, I became interested in philosophy very late. When I was young, I really didn't need it. I was a materialist. The great advantage of pure materialism is that it is not difficult to get along with other materialists. The real effectively unites the personal worlds. I didn't even understand what phenomenology was talking about. What then is a mind if not the reflection of the reality it represents? It is by faithfully marrying it that our intentions best control reality. Materialism is pragmatic and efficient. Those who remain safe from the neuroses of youth adopt it easily and are very satisfied with it. Philosophy is of little use to a young scientist. Other equally difficult subjects demand his full attention. Unfortunately materialism works very poorly with non-materialists. My ex-partner was one of them. Her personal world was made up of eternal youth and beauty. Very disturbed by the ineluctable effect of time, it became a stranger to mine, until it broke up. I was more amazed than sorry. My world hadn't changed. My reason argued with a myth. Our different postulates had split two universes. My acute problem. I suddenly became interested in how people create their inner world. Where do these postulates come from? Why do they produce such a diversity of personalities, such strange behaviors? Classical philosophies do not answer these questions. Phenomenology takes the mind as a starting point but neglects to have it examined by the real. Materialism makes the real the starting point but neglects the various possible examinations of the mind about it. No philosophical system is bidirectional. I built mine unfettered, having read little of the others. Double look. Judge its effectiveness in my posts. The pure materialist that I was wouldn't have understood a thing. I feel like I've been teleported into a universe with an extra dimension, the complex dimension. The flip side is that my audience is restricted to those who perceive it ;-) Thank you for this question which is not easy to ask oneself. ",
