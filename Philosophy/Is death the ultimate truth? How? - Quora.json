            "answer_text": "No. You cannot have a coin with one side only. Birth is one side of the coin (called life) and death is another side, and it is a cycle to repeat forever. In nature everything is cycle. Hence it is unreasonable to expect only our life to be an exception. Interestingly, there are many shrewd and very great ones, who viewed death as something good. William Morris wrote: \u201cDeath have we hated, knowing not what it meant.\u201d Steve Jobs (the Father of the Digital Revolution & the cofounder of APPLE) declared: \u201cRemembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.\u201d Famous novelist R.A. Salvatore wrote: \u201conly with the honest knowledge that one day I will die I can ever truly begin to live.\u201d (The Halfling\u2019s Gem). \u201cBecause of its tremendous solemnity death is the light in which great passions, both good and bad, become transparent, no longer limited by outward appearances.\u201d (Soren Kierkegaard, Danish philosopher) \u201cIt is IMPOSSIBLE that anything so natural, so necessary, and so universal as death, should ever have been designed by providence as an evil to mankind.\u201d (Jonathan Swift, English satirist) \u201cLet death be daily before your eyes, and you will never entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.\u201d (Epictetus, Greek philosopher) Socrates had absolute clarity on this subject, hence described death as \u201cthe greatest of all human blessings\u201d and \u201cthe greatest good that can happen\u201d to us because it prevents one\u2019s feeling of self-importance from growing eternally. Thus all those great men agree that remembering death makes a person act wisely\u2014it guarantees that one's planning will be realistic. A keen observer can have the same conclusion because it is observed that when the body is in upward growth, people in general tend to grow in desires and self-importance, and when the body is in reverse growth towards complete collapse and thus experience suffering, people in general begin to lose the basis for keeping their desires and self-importance. It repeats in each birth a person takes. It can also be observed that in happiness humans forget God, and in sorrow they remember God and call for His intervention which He does recreating heaven on earth each time unrighteousness reaches its peak. It is like in rain we thirst for summer, and in summer we thirst for rain. Thus history becomes a never-ending cycle of joy and sorrow both in micro and macro levels. In small scale, in our daily life, happiness and sorrow alternate. And in large scale, in each Kalpa (cycle of 5000 years), first half is characterized by happiness because of egolessness shown by everyone therein and second half is characterized by sorrow because of ego shown mostly by everyone. Thus Ageing, suffering and death teach us this great lesson: TO FEEL SELF-IMPORTANT IS MEANINGLESS. This is exactly what the whole universe is collectively conveying: 1) In comparison with the incomprehensibly vast size of the universe, our earth is just a tiny dot. Carl Sagan (great astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist \u2026) got it correct when he called our earth as a \u201cPale Blue Dot\u201d which destroys the very basis for \u201cour imagined self-importance\u201d and \u201cunderscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one.\u201d 2) The way in which inanimate things such as planets and stars operate teaches us humility! They move around keeping to their orbits just like vehicles follow lane-discipline on a busy Express Highway (as though submitting themselves to some unseen authority). 3) The way in which animate things such as plants (producing flowers) and trees (producing fruits) behave teach humility as they work for others to enjoy (not for themselves). 4) All the stories and histories written show that those who pursued self-importance reaped misery in the end, highlighting the unmistakable fact: ego creates suffering, and suffering destroys ego. Thus humans are soaked in the information that ego means trouble and egolessness means peace and prosperity. In such an environment, mechanism of birth, ageing, suffering and death check the eternal growth of ego. People who do not know the truth about the above are worried about these things. However those who practice Rajayoga meditation have an added advantage. They have a practice of dying daily as they go incorporeal during meditation. Practice of Rajayoga convinces them that they are immortal souls that never die but keep changing the body, egoless and viceless in their original form which ensures them to enjoy precious qualities such as peace and joy even in this peaceless and joyless world.

            "answer_text": "Why any doubts about it? See around you or turn the pages of history, have you seen or read about any person who has not died? Every living being maybe humans or animals have to die. It is the rule of nature. Imagine a situation if nobody dies, then where is the space on the earth for new arrivals? Hence it is rightly said birth is accidental and death is certain. In other words for all of us God first books the return journey ticket and then issues the forward journey ticket. Can we avoid death? No. Whether you are rich or poor, good or bad, saint or criminal one has to die as per the length of life given to you. Some live for the full length some die prematurely. As one has to die physically, but can live for ever in the minds of subsequent generations by virtue of our deeds. You might have heard about few Chiranjeevi persons like Ashwatthama, Bali, Vyasa, Hanuman etc who are known for not having death. But they are chiranjeevis during one cycle of creation and destruction of universe only. So to avoid this birth and death what is the remedy available? Answer is try to attain MOKSHA. ",
