            "answer_text": "Can a person be an atheist as well as an anti-theist at the same time? I met a person who told me that you can only hate those things which you know exist that is you can't hate anything which to you is nothing but a figment of imagination, according to him since atheists don't believe, the question of hate shouldn't arise at all. Well, you have a straw man here. There is no such thing as the antitheist described in your details. Of course the person who told you that was right, people don't hate unicorns, it is ridiculous to hate unicorns. But... But you can hate (I'll come to that word later) people who are unicorn fans because they are trying to push the unicornist agenda in society, because unicorn fans insult and despise anybody who isn't an unicorn fan, because the fans of the green unicorn kill the fans of the red unicorn and both team up to kill the fans of the blue unicorn or just because unicorn fans are annoying. See? People do exist. You can hate people. But, again, hate is a straw man. Of course some people who happen to be atheist actually hate theists (after all, atheism is not a group so except the common feature of \"not believing in gods\" the rest is freedom of choice among us) but usually the right description should be strongly against. Several atheists are strongly against people pushing their gods and their agendas into society, strongly against people insulting everybody who doesn't share their beliefs, strongly against religious wars, strongly against abuses in the name of religion and, why not, strongly against people being indoctrinated in primitive superstitions and false hopes. But, guess what? There are several theists who also are strongly against everything listed above (well, maybe not the last one, but you get the idea). Because that's what good rational modern people do, be strongly against everything that promotes intolerance, war, abuse and \"niceties\" of the same kind. So, can a person be an atheist as well as somebody who is strongly against the ugly aspects of religions? Of course! That is the right thing to do! But, can a person be an atheist as well as somebody who is strongly against the nice aspects of religions?Hmm, well... I don't know if strongly against, but against or not seeing the point of keeping religions and all their bad aspects just because they do some good that can perfectly be done secularly. I mean, it is admirable the work of those priests that help the poor, live with the poor and fight for the poor but, actually, all the good they do can be done all the same secularly, without the need of a god. Religion is an excuse and not a sine qua non condition for being \"good\".So, yes, an atheist can and maybe should not see the point of keeping religions just because they serve as excuses or cathalyts of good behaviour. See? The scary straw man of your question is actually a rational vocal person expressing his point of view and opposing to things (actual things) that he perceives as nocive, negative and wrong. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Anti-Theists are people, as far as I understand, are those who oppose the ideas of Theism. They do not hate god(s), what they hate is the way various theistic beliefs operate, how god intervenes in the functioning of the universe, or how god(s) hate gays, or how apostates are to be treated etc etc. A simple idea of god is seldom hated by atheists, sure there might be some atheists who probably find it repulsive, but atheism is simply not believing in existence of any god(s), from there on an atheist can be anything, he/she can be anti-theist, or a doctor or an engineer, or whatever. Many atheists are also anti-theists the late Christopher Hitchens comes to mind when we speak of anti- theists, and the idea is to oppose what bad ideas theism has, to criticize nonsensical beliefs that various theistic faiths hold (especially the abrahamic ones). I am not an anti-theist, I am only an anti-theist when organized religion(s) tries to impose things without evidence or sometimes even when there is conclusive evidence for a certain thing for example evolution, that's when the anti-theist in me rises, most days I am simply an atheist, I have no problem with your god(s), or whatever it is you do personally the things that do not effect me. I will become an anti theist, if someone's theism enters public domain, and starts to effect my life, public life, and especially when those things make no sense. It is a very correct thing to say that one cannot hate a thing that one does not believe in, but that is not how theism works, it effects others as well. Someone's god might be in their faith only, but organized religion isn't, and some of the doctrines in organized religion deserves to be criticized, simply because they are bad, and hence the term anti-theism-- Not hatred for god, but rather what that god asks you to do, or believe in, quite a lot of which makes no sense, or are simply bad ideas, or proven to be wrong.

There's a quibble around the edges about being able to hate things that you don't know exist. You can hate Voldemort, if you like. But let's ignore the quibble and take it as given for this discussion that you can't hate anything that you don't actually believe in. There's a bigger problem here, though. It sounds like we have a term getting confused. It sounds like \"atheist\" is OK (one who doesn't believe in god(s)). But antitheist? the definition of antitheist: one opposed to belief in the existence of a god Note the presence of the word \"belief\" in there, and the absence of the word \"hate.\"  It's not \"one who opposes God.\" It's not \"one who hates God,\" or even \"one who hates theists.\" He's right that the question of hate isn't involved. But he seems unclear on the definition of the word that he's trying to use. If you think there are ones or more gods, but they're evil, then you're a maltheist (or misotheist). And no, you can't be a maltheist and an atheist at the same time, since a maltheist is a subset of theist. ",

I think that belief in god (organized religion in particular) does more bad than good and so I am opposed to it. >> you can only hate those things which you know exist that is you can't hate anything which to you is nothing but a figment of imagination Let's assume that is true (although you could make the argument that you can hate imaginary characters - like Dolores Umbridge or Joffrey Baratheon or the Judeo-Christian God). But still an anti-theist doesn't hate something imaginary. Anti-theists hate (might be too strong a word, but let's go with it anyway) the belief in god, and not god itself. The belief in god is real and exists. I don't think any atheist says that the belief in god doesn't exist.. So, even with the (questionable) assumption that you can't hate something which doesn't exist, it's still totally valid for a person to be both an atheist and an anti-theist. ",

To begin with, let's define the words. Atheist: a person who lacks belief in the existence of gods Anti-theist: (that's a little ambiguous term) direct opposition of religion and/or opposition a malevolent god-figure There lies the difference. An atheist lacks belief in the existence of gods. An anti-theist may typically work on the assumption that god does not exist, and religion, according to them, must be eradicated. However, when adverse situations arise, the average anti-theist will usually begin to blame a malevolent deity. It therefore follows that an atheist will generally not be an active anti-theist (since they only lack a belief in gods on a personal level), but an anti-theist will have an atheistic mindset to an extent.

I think so. As an atheist, I have no belief in any god or gods. As an antitheist, I am opposed to the belief in gods (religion) since I consider it nothing but ancient folklore and superstition and a waste of people's time and treasure. As an individual, I respect the right of others to believe whatever they wish, as long as they keep it in their homes, the homes of their co-religionists, and their places of worship. If they intrude it on my personal space I won't be so nice about it.

Answer: Yes, a person can be an atheist and an anti-theist at the same time. Such a person remains at heart simply a disbeliever in the existence of gods, but when the injurious effects of theism present material harm to him or her, then the atheist rises to become anti-theistic.  An analogy is that a cat can be a harmless, purring animal when left alone, but when threatened arches its back and shows its teeth and claws. As for \"you can only hate those things you know exist,\" that is not true. All humans can hate things they only suspect or fear exist. That is the base cause for the existence of god-based religions in the first place.  ",

We atheists do believe in theism. We believe that theism exists. (There's plenty of evidence, such as churches and religious books.) Anti-theists further believe that theism is a bad thing.  The assertion confuses anti-theism (being opposed to theism) with the less-known concept of misotheism, or dystheism, the belief that a god or gods exist(s) and is(/are) malign.   (A lot of religious apologists conflate these things, of course, asserting that everyone knows their god exists and atheists merely claim not to because they reject or hate it.) ",

As Scott Berry said, anti-theist is a person who is opposed to the belief in god. All atheist do not believe in god - but they do know that belief in god does exist among theists. And some can choose to hate that belief - although opposition doesn't always imply hate. Also hating the belief doesn't automatically imply hating the believer or the object of belief. So YES - a person can be atheist and anti-theist. In fact, a theist anti-theist seems to be a theoretical concept rather than atheist anti-theist. ",

If you\u2019re going to define anti-theism as hatred or opposition towards deities themselves (which I don\u2019t think is the right definition)\u2014then his or her point stands valid.

            "answer_text": "Yes, a person can be an atheist and an anti-theist. There are a decent number of atheist antitheists, however. An atheist is someone who doesn't believe in God/a god/gods. Some atheists still practice religion, though they know it may be mundane, because it provides them some benefit. Most atheists love the believer, but hate the belief or are indifferent to it. An anti-theist is someone who opposes theism at the level of belief. That means they oppose the belief in God/a god/gods, as Scott Berry has said. However, that doesn't mean an antitheist cannot appreciate architecture, beautifully illustrated texts, and symbols, among other things associated with theism. Being an antitheist often depends on the condition of being an atheist, though this is not always the case. Members of one particular religion may oppose the beliefs of another faith or belief in God. This is also antitheism, though it is more specific. In short: Atheists don't believe in God/god(s). Antitheists oppose the belief. You can be one or both. EDIT: \"Hate\" has been changed to \"oppose\" and its related conjugations. Additional information has since been added or removed.

That they must blind themselves to truth and the important ability to think for themselves aka having faith.  That being judgemental and harsh as the god in the bible is should be there example. That hurting people that oppose your ideals is ok as god himself both commands and does. That sending people to be tortured endlessly is justifiable, aka hell. That doing whatever you want is ok after all you can't help sinning and god will forgive you he always does if you believe in him, aka being a sociopath. So you see I don't stand against god I stand against what any sane person would declare as completely inhuman teaching that in order to be accepted require forcing them on a child at birth. Condemning people to carry around a guilt, shame, and stress that should not be forced upon them and threats if they even think about doing anything contrary to those ideals is wrong. This is clearly a form of child abuse and even if the brainwashing works it is hard for someone to be blind for a lifetime so at some point the person will believe even more fervently to run away from doubts or in the realization that they focused there whole life around a lie end up psychologically screwed up and have to go though years of therapy to deal with it. Instead of christens pointing to everything such as being gay, or transgender and saying you are evil simply for being you and believing that it doesn't matter if you aren't hurting or attacking anyone else. They should look closely at those beliefs that they claim to be so good for then they would see that what they were taught to be good is clearly unjustifiably evil. ",

            "answer_text": "The first fact that should be pointed out here is that the prefixes 'anti' and 'a' do not mean \"hate\".  Prefixes change the function of the word.  The prefix 'a' adds the function of 'not' or 'without', effectively turning a word into its opposite. Thus an atheist is simply a person who doesn't believe in God,unlike a theist who does.  They do not hate God or hate theists.  Similarly 'anti' prefix basically means 'against' or 'opposite to', here it denotes a person who is opposed to the idea of belief in God,  or one who is against the whole concept of belief.  So much for definitions. Now for the practice part. An atheist or an antitheist by definition is not a person who hates, it's just his opinion or way of thinking, based on facts, logic, rationality and evidence. And yes a person can be both at the same time.  P. S. By adding 'miso' prefix  to the word 'theist' , you get a word that defines a person who has 'hatred for Gods or God'.   ",

If your friend can identify who the good guys and bad guys are without believing that it's a true story, then you've demonstrated that your friend already knows that this claim is bullshit. ",

More relevant to antitheism, we can feel that certain ideas are harmful and that humanity is better off without those opinions being held. You might want to read up on antitheism. It does not require 'hating' anything. While I am not an antitheist, my understanding is that an antitheist is opposed to theism,  considering it harmful. ",
