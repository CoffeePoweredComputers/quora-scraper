If you want to argue that the official estimated numbers are inaccurate, and you have solid evidence backing you up, you can and you should argue that position. The truth may be ugly or upsetting but it is always important. However, in the case of the Holocaust it is very rare for someone to only question small things like the exact number of Jews who were killed at a particular camp or overall. At the risk of overstating, 99% of the time when someone starts out asking \"simple questions\" about \"minor issues\" relating to the Holocaust, what they're really doing is setting things up so they can segue into full-blown Holocaust denialism. Some of the details of the Holocaust may be arguable. The Holocaust itself is NOT arguable. It happened. Period. End Of Debate. Anyone attempting to argue otherwise is utterly without credibility. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume that you are talking about jurisdictions that outlaw holocaust denial.  You're completely correct that this violates free speech as well as the ideals of a free society.  The reason for the laws is to keep a tight lid on the hateful emotions that caused the original tragedy, preventing a repetition.  As societies, these jurisdictions have come to consensus that this is an insignificant infringement on speech, when compared to the horror of any burgeoning sentiment to attempt any kind of human extermination in the future.  Sadly, we have nevertheless seen several triumphs of human avarice and ignorance over frail human goodness since WWII.   Hence, most of us believe the problem persists.  The holocausts of 1850 to the present day need to be taught in every school in every land, instead of the inane hero worship that so many today choose to call history. ",
