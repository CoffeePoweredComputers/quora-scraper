            "answer_text": "Because people are not primarily moved by what they know. The human brain is not unified into a single personality. It\u2019s modular, and the modules fight for dominance. Emotional and algorithmic processes tends to outmatch intellectual ones. Intellectualism is expensive and can\u2019t be kept up for long. Cheaper processes were generally good-enough for our ancestors to survive long enough to raise viable children, and we\u2019ve inherited their brain architecture. I do all sorts of things I know are wrong? A more colloquial explanation for my behavior than what I\u2019ve written above is that I\u2019m weak willed. I give into temptation. The \u201chedonistic modules\u201d and \u201cterrified modules\u201d of my brain win out over the \u201cintellectual modules\u201d and even, sometimes, over the \u201cempathic modules.\u201d (The quotations are to indicate metaphors. There isn\u2019t literally an empathic module, but there are lots of semi-independent brain processes that push and tug at each other.) I\u2019m 52 and I became a vegan two years ago. All the way back in my 20s, I realized that killing cows was morally equivalent to killing people. It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014to this answer\u2014whether that\u2019s true or false. The point is, I believed it, yet kept on eating meat. For decades! I was absolutely convinced that I was an accessory to murder, and yet I went right on doing it. Why? Because I had an intense craving for meat that overpowered my ethics. Sure, I felt guilty, but the guilt wasn\u2019t as strong as the cravings. And even when I finally gave up meat, it was for health reasons. I had a health crisis that scared me so much, I changed my diet. I\u2019m very glad that I\u2019m no longer paying people to kill cows and chickens, but I can\u2019t pretend that I changed because I knew it was wrong. My reasons were as selfish as my former reasons for eating meat. It\u2019s worth noting that ethical behavior isn\u2019t a switch you just flip on and turn on. Each hamburger was a new moral crisis. If I resisted temptation on Monday, that didn\u2019t help me resist it on Tuesday. I had to keep re-choosing to be good over and over and over again. It was simply too daunting for me. (It\u2019s true that one can form good habits. But there\u2019s a hump one has to get through first. Until the behavior is habitual, it\u2019s a battle that has to be won many times.) I\u2019ll give you another example: I know\u2014or at least I believe\u2014that I could cut my income nearly in half and be just as happy as I am now. And research backs me up on that. Every year, I throw lots of my disposable income away on trifles\u2014on movies I don\u2019t like and gizmos that wind up gathering dust on my shelves. Meanwhile, there are people in the world\u2014in my city\u2014who are starving. Starving! The money that I\u2019m wasting on stuff that doesn\u2019t even make me happy is money that could be saving lives. It could save a child\u2019s life. I know this. I know (or I believe\u2014you and it\u2019s fine if disagree with me) that what I\u2019m doing with my income is wrong. Deeply wrong. If I know it\u2019s wrong, but I do it anyway. Why? See above. ",

            "answer_text": "First, it\u2019s important to recognize that all humans engage in behaviors that are considered wrong. It\u2019s actually quite natural. Like all other living things, we are genetically mandated to act in our own best interest, to exhibit the behaviors that we perceive will benefit us most. Right and wrong are merely adjectives that represent the group\u2019s point of view, how someone\u2019s behavior affects the group. Human beings are a species of social animals, which means that we instinctively engage in two different and mutually exclusive types of behavior. We do things that benefit us individually, and we do things that benefit us by facilitating our acceptance into the group (i.e., social behaviors). We naturally engage in the behavior that we perceive at the time will provide the greatest benefit. The more aware we become of the often subtle, complex, and distant benefits associated with being part of a group, the more likely we become to engage in social behaviors. Accordingly, every person exhibits a different ratio of individual and group behaviors based largely on their awareness. When someone engages in a behavior that benefits them self at the expense of the group, we adopt the perspective of the group and refer to it as wrong or bad. ",
