            "answer_text": "I have solved the Omnipotence Paradox. Can God Create a Stone that He Cannot Lift? This question is more than 800 years old. In asking this question, the questioner had already assumed the existence of gravity because of the word \u201clift\u201d in the question. What is \u201clift\u201d? My definition for \u201clift\u201d is: Moving an object to the opposite direction of gravity. By definition, God created everything. Hence, God created gravity. Since God can create gravity, he can certainly make it disappear. So God can \u201clift\u201d any stone. Put another way, this question could become: if God were to have an arm wrestling match between his left arm \uff08gravity\uff09and right arm (to \u201clift\u201d the stone), which one would win? Both arms belong to God. This is not a contest; there is no winning or losing. Therefore this is a stupid question. If God is omnipotent, God must be everything, everything must be God. Since \u201coutside everything\u201d is an oxymoron, therefore \u201coutside God\u201d is an oxymoron: if there is God, then there will be no \u201coutside\u201d; if there is an \u201coutside\u201d, then there will be no God. There is no gravity \u201coutside\u201d God. God doesn\u2019t live in a gravitational field. For an omnipotent God, there is no such concept as \u201clift\u201d. \u201cLift\u201d only exists in human experience. Gravity, like everything else, exists inside God. For an omnipotent God, there is no such concept as \u201cstand\u201d either, because there is no ground \u201coutside\u201d God. By the same token\uff0cfor an omnipotent God, there are no such concepts as \u201cbreathe\u201d\uff0c\u201ceat\u201d\uff0c\u201cdrink\u201d\uff0c\u201cexcrete\u201d, \u201cwear clothes\u201d, \u201cwalk\u201d\uff0c\u201csit\u201d, \u201clie down\u201d. God doesn't have a body. All bodies have skin, skin is the boundary of the body. God doesn't have boundary. Therefore, God doesn't have a face\uff0cnor shape. An ant looks at you while you are talking, it could see your lips and tongue moving. The ant asks you: \u201cHow do you lift your lips and tongue?\u201d You reply: \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid question.\u201d A man sees that the Moon is moving, he asks God: \u201cHow do you lift the Moon?\u201d God says: \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid question.\u201d The editor at Wikipedia doesn\u2019t agree with me.

            "answer_text": "I have solved the irresistible force immovable object paradox. The irresistible force simply passes through the immovable object. A lot of people were perplexed by this paradox because they were using the wrong kind of logic. Their logic states a person cannot both be sick and healthy at the same time, a team cannot both win and lose at the same time, and so on etc. Therefore according to this logic the irresistible force has to move the immovable object because it cannot both be irresistible and not move an object. However if we accept that the law of the excluded middle in logic is wrong then we can see how the force can simply pass through the object. This is the logic that applies to the quantum realm, where an object can be both a wave and particle at the same time. I have also solved time travel paradoxes. In a time travel paradox such as the grandfather paradox what happens is that the relationship between what exists and what happens ceases to hold. Therefore an object can exist yet have no influence upon reality and an influence upon reality which can clearly be seen, heard, even remembered doesn't necessarily have to correspond to something that exists. If you go back in time and kill your grandfather then what happens is that you will no longer be able to influence reality. No one will be able to see, hear, or even remember you, even though you are a real object. The opposite occurs in a bootstrap paradox. The object which has no origin is not a real object, yet it can be seen, heard, and even remembered. ",
