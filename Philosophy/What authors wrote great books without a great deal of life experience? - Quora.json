            "answer_text": "This is always a fascinating question, because fiction is both a matter of reporting what you know and what you imagine, and the latter can very often trump the former.  Take the example of E.M. Forster (1879-1970) While few would ever describe him as being without experience -- he was quite well-travelled and had many friends in high places and low -- there was one area in life where he was quite ignorant: sex. Or, I guess we should say, heterosexual sex. Homosexual by nature, he had been raised in a pampered and sheltered environment. According to his biographer, P.N. Furbank, Forster \"said later that it was not till he was thirty, by which time he had published three novels, that he altogether understood how copulation took place.\" Two of those novels were Where Angels Fear to Tread and A Room With a View, and I doubt anyone who read them would find that his knowledge of men, women, or the complexities of romance was in an way wanting. There are writers with simply exhaustive sex lives who will never write as well as Forster did. Crazily obvious fact: you really don't have to know the mechanics of sex to grasp the conflict of the human heart, do you? Henry James, likewise, may well have died a virgin -- indeed, seems to have lived a mostly asexual existence -- yet few people ever wrote more intelligntly or pervasively about the psychology of attraction. All you virgins out there: just keep writing. Another great man with little life experience: William Blake (1757-1827) was a poor painter and printer who never travelled more than fifty miles in his life and died largely unknown. It's hard to imagine that travel would have helped him any, though, as he was gifted with a strange religious mysticism and a subversively Biblical imagination that fed into the deeply mythic and vastly influential poetry he left behind.  How much experience does a writer need? A lot -- or should he or she just observe well and re-imagine deeply what little experience is available? Maybe Flannery O'Connor said it best: \"Anybody who has survived his childhood has enough information about life to last him the rest of his days.\" ",

            "answer_text": "User is certainly correct in naming Jane Austen.  Austen lived her entire too-short life (1775-1817) as the genteelly impoverished daughter of a clergyman in rural England, with the exception of a few years' residence in the glittering metropolis of Bath (which she hated) and some visits to London. She was engaged once, for less than 24 hours (maybe less than 12), and never married. She may have been in love or close to it once or twice (although certainly she was not in love with her short-term fianc\u00e9) but she was almost certainly a virgin. She lived a generally quiet and retired life, with little in the way of \"life experience\" as that is understood in the modern world. Yet by the age of 20 she had written a brilliant and often hilarious epistolary novel, Lady Susan, whose subject matter was considered so risqu\u00e9 (an unscrupulous and calculating female sexual predator) that it was not published until 50 years after her death.   She wrote the first drafts of the books we know as Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice before she was 22 years old. She was something of a wallflower in life, mostly an observer of those around her, but from her observations of the rather limited society in which she circulated she drew insights that helped her create six immortal novels (in addition to Lady Susan) that are pointed, wickedly accurate, timeless accounts of human nature and behavior.  Outside the scope of the question but also illustrative of her genius, in her letters, she also gave insightful and practical life advice to her young nieces, cousins, and friends, relating to areas of life with which she personally had little to no direct experience. She's a miracle, basically. ",
