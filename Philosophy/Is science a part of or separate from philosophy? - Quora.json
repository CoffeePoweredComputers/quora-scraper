            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I think everything is a part of philosophy. Science concerns itself with finding exact explanations to the question: why does something happen the way it happens? Science believes in experimentation and the underlying theories and models. In this regard, it employs a lot of philosophy. Why, anyone reading relativity would tell you how moved Einstein was by the fact that the laws of physics are the same in all reference frames, which is a pretty heavy philosophy to carry around. However, most of the time we don't realize the underlying philosophy of it. Most quantum physicists don't stop to think how we have beautifully given up on determinism for the sake of possibilities. Most field theorists won't notice how elegant the idea of taking only the total number is, as compared to going into the details of it. Or perhaps they do. Cause often, upon pondering over these things, a new philosophy springs up which science then adopts ",

            "answer_text": "Science is philosophical at an elementary level. For example at the level of formation of hypothesis, science is philosophical. After that the hypotheses under go lot of verifications to confirm whether the same hypotheses could be accepted as a theory. It undergoes test of objectivity, repeatability and falsifiability(Scientific method) at different levels. Then it is accepted. Thus science become free from all sort of logical fallacies. While in the case of philosophy, it does not undergo any sort of such tests. After formation of hypotheses, philosophy is left for subjective experiences mostly. If I take vedic philosophy like advaita, the hypotheses is tested at an experential level. Subjective experiences are never repeatable or falsifiable. Hence science and philosophy are totally different. ",
