            "answer_text": "Examples of people who disagree about ethics doesn\u2019t disprove ethics non-objective any more than people who believe in Flat earth proves that to be a subjective feeling. 2 + 2 = 4. Always and forever. Similarly, it\u2019s wrong to harm innocent individuals or take their rights away for no justification. Examples tend to be descriptive, not prescriptive. That\u2019s the is/ought fallacy. That distinction is incredibly important for these purposes. (if you\u2019re not familiar, it makes sense to Google it after reading this post) The notions of justice, truth, human rights, and human dignity all hinge on objective morality or something very related to the principles of objective and absolute morality. There are certainly bad examples of absolute assertions of morality, but those are subjective ones. Not to mention, the assertion that relativism is true is simply an absolute assertion in drag. This makes Mother Teresa and Adolf Hitler moral equivalents, which is illogical on every single level. A cannot be the opposite of A. It make genocide and non-genocide the same. But everything in humanity screams that the opposite is actually the case. ",
