            "answer_text": "Yes it does and it can already proven subject to speculation of course as is everything! But there are microbes that can survive even in space on the outside of the space station there was tons of testing done. Read this months popular science magazine the answers to what you seek are in this months issue. With the endless possibility of earth like planets in the universe it is likely that there is something out there even something intelligent. It is likely that our own information our genetic code came from elsewhere in the universe thus technically making us \"aliens\" if you will. Life elsewhere has a higher possibility then we once thought as well after witnessing some of the extremes that microbes can endure in the past 4 decades. I would say it is actually more unlikely that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe.  But the answer is a YES it does and it can and it is proven enough for me to finally accept it as highly likely. If we want to be technical 1 second ago we were orientated in a different spot in the universe as the universe continues to expand. Thus even we existed elsewhere in the universe... And if the precursors to life can exist in things like space debris and microbes can withstand the adversities of space short of an alien landing on your front lawn you likely are never going to believe otherwise. This is not a bad thing however I think we need opposing views to really get to the bottom of everything. But there is enough proof for me to be strong on the yes answer. When one thinks of it the god particle was actually discovered long before it was proven. Same goes with the electron and the atom and many other discoveries. There is an insanely high probability but the definition of life existing outside of the earth is different for everyone! We have had many people exist inside the ISS or International Space Station. 100% confirmed and microbes that can survive and reanimate after living in space as stated. Depending on your true definition of \"Life\" or \"Location\" it is or is not proven I suppose. In which case you will be waiting for some time for proof unless some aliens drop a space ship in your back yard. But I will note even this scenario is more likely than for there to be no life elsewhere in the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "There is something which doesn\u2019t add up regarding the way that we are lookout out for life outside Earth at the present moment and I would love to run it past you folk.  Whenever we are on the lookout for life beyond Earth, we look for planets that are present in the so called \u201cGoldilocks zone\u201d. We can define it as that distance from the host star at which liquid water on it\u2019s surface, essentially conditions that mimic life on planet Earth. Now I am someone who thoroughly subscribes to the theory of evolution and it has come to my understanding that we have evolved according to the conditions that are present on planet Earth, namely gaseous Oxygen, liquid water and temperature that ranges between 15\u201325 C. So, if we look at it from the point of view of evolution, I think that we can all agree that over the years, it is because of the fact that we have acclimatized ourselves to the conditions here that we are comfortable with it. Hypothetically speaking, if temperatures ranged from 50\u2013100 C on our planet right from the onset, I am sure that we can all concur that we would have adapted ourselves to those conditions. Life would have existed than too. Maybe not in the form that we are familiar with right now, but it would have existed nevertheless as would have adapted ourselves to those temperatures. Maybe we would have somehow developed ways to depend on gaseous water. Maybe we might not have developed such a liking to water at all and might have evolved with a fondness for another liquid or even a solid.  Basically, we are setting too much store on life as we know it on our planet today. That is precisely why we are looking out for other life forms that are exactly like us. Sure there may be other life forms that bear a lot of semblances to ours\u2019. But that does not mean that we must limit our search to it. We must broaden our search as our present parameters have not yielded fruitful results.  My point here is that there could well be other life forms (aliens) in other planets that do not have Earth-like conditions. It is quite possible that life form present over there might have learnt to live in the conditions present over in their planet. We keep rejecting hundreds of potentially life-harboring planets as candidates of planets that could contain life every day as we feel that the conditions are too harsh or extreme. Yes they might be harsh from our point of view. But that does not mean that we can reasonably disregard the possibility of other life forms that could have adapted to the conditions present in the planet in question. We are so constantly on the lookout for planets with conditions like ours\u2019 that we might have in reality skipped over thousands of planets that indeed have life in some form or the other. In conclusion, I think that we have made a grave error in limiting our search for ET in planets that are present only in the Goldilocks zone. In doing so, as I have constantly repeated in my essay, we are only searching for life forms that are very much like our own. We must do away with our faulty assumption that life can exist only in Earth-like conditions and search broaden our search to other life forms that we don\u2019t know about at present. For instance, we must not inherently assume that life cannot exist in a planet that is too close to its parent star just because the conditions are extremely hot for human beings. There could well be aliens that are perfectly at ease with the hot conditions that are present in that star, who would find Earth a bit too nippy for their liking. This could be a reason why our search for ET thus far has been a colossal failure. ",

Our science has a long way to evolve before we would be able to initiate contact, given the unbelievable vastness of space.

            "answer_text": "The question uses the word \u201cchance\u201d. The word for the commoner is \u201cchance\u201d but in terms of science we call it \u201cprobability\u201d. If I talk in a layman language I can easily tell you that there is quite a good chance that there is a conscious and maybe even a super intelligent life existing out there. Here I want to make it clear that \u201cintelligence\u201d does not necessarily mean human intelligence. It could come in a variety of forms. Dolphins, for example, are considered to be extremely intelligent by scientists. But we couldn\u2019t have a conversation with a dolphin as it possesses a different form of intelligence to our own.[1] And this layman prediction that there exists extra terrestrial living beings is based on considering the scale or the size of the universe. This is well explained by the Fermi Paradox[2]. Our sun is one among the 400 billion stars in our Milky way which itself is one among the 100 billion galaxies in the universe. Each star is thought to have on an average at least one planet in orbit, meaning there are trillions upon trillions of planets in the cosmos. But so far we know of only one \u2013 Earth \u2013 that has life. Are we really alone? This is a problem that has long plagued astronomers, and is known as the Fermi Paradox.[3] Enrico Fermi goes two steps ahead on the above line of reasoning. He argued that if in this huge universe, there exists some intelligent life, then some of these civilizations might have even developed space travel, a step the Earth is investigating now. Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years. According to this line of reasoning, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial aliens! Now, if I talk about the chances in mathematical terms, the probability of the existing number of civilizations besides earth is given by the Drake equation[4][5]. I don\u2019t want to quote the equation here and scare off the people who want just a casual reading. The nerds can follow the links below! :p But summarizing the equation, I would say that the Drake equation is a probabilistic argument which used to arrive at an estimate of the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. Drake states that given the uncertainties, there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky way galaxy. Still there are many people who disagree with both the arguments since there are no physical evidences for any extra terrestrial life. This debate whether \u201cWe\u201d are alone or not will continue and can only settle when some extraterrestrial beings, if present anywhere, try to reveal their existence to us.

            "answer_text": "Few recent reasearch findings point out that there is extra terrestrial life somewhere in the deep space. Professor Milton Wainwright and his team from the University of Sheffield and the University of Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology sent balloons into the stratosphere 27 km above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to collect particles from space. A mysterious dragon-shaped organism was discovered in dust and particulate matter gathered deep in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere. Professor Wainwright says that it is a \u201cbiological entity\u201d made of carbon and oxygen, the building blocks of life. And those scientific team which made the incredible find insist there is no way it could have blown up into space from our planet, and so must have originated elsewhere in the universe.  Professor Milton Wainwright He said: \"The photo shows a structure colloquially called \u2018the dragon particle\u2019 which scientific analysis shows is made of carbon and oxygen and is therefore not a piece of cosmic or volcanic dust.  Is this the picture that proves life exists on other planets? Unless a means of lifting them from Earth exists which selectively sieves them out from other Earth-derived debris then they must be incoming from space. In addition, the fact that some of the biological material samples by the team produce impact craters when they hit the sampler, confirms their space origin. In a way these claims reveal that all life on Earth, including humans, is extraterrestrial in origin. Another researcher involved in the study, Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, said algae-like organisms have previously been found on meteorites which have fallen to Earth. According to him, particles of DNA from extraterrestrial life are also being picked up by organisms on earth and built into their genetic make up. He said, \u201cWe have evidence that even in the human genome, 40 per cent of our DNA is viral, and it has been incorporated during our evolution. There is growing evidence that says this DNA comes from space and it is carried into our atmosphere on micro-meteorites before dissipating. It is then taken up by bacteria and viruses. Everything that we have on the Earth is derived from space, including humans.\u201d In a new finding, the Astronauts of the International Space Station (ISS) which orbits Earth too said that they found traces of tiny plankton life on the outer surface of the orbiting Space Station. The discovery of tiny plankton on the ISS was the first time complex organisms have been found in outer space. Experiments have previously shown bacteria can survive outside our planet but the discovery of these so-called diatoms supports the increasingly popular theory that the biochemical catalyst for human life originated elsewhere in the universe. Diatoms are coming in from space all the time, raining down on Earth, these findings are about to blow all theories of biology and evolution out of the water, they will have to start re-writing text books. Some researchers said in one explanation that the organisms were carried to the Space Station on air currents from the sea where plankton is found in abundance. However others claim this is impossible with the only rational theory being the minute plants drifted onto the Space Station from elsewhere in space. The Space Station (ISS) is more than 200 miles from earth, there is no way that anything of this size can get to that height from Earth. The space station is orbiting the earth in a total vacuum, there is no air, so it is a total defiance of the laws of physics to say these organisms were blown into space from Earth. The only explanation is that they have come from elsewhere in space, and this supports the long held theories that plankton, and therefore all life on Earth including humans, originated from organisms in space. It is an amazing discovery and the evidence is overwhelming that these organisms have originated from outer space. Professor Wainwright said, \u201cThey may be the same, or similar to the ones we have found.\" In both cases they will be intercepted on their journey from space to Earth and not as some unthinking critics have suggested-lazily drifting up to such extreme heights from Earth. He further said: \u201cWe are starting to find diatoms in space, mixed up in debris in the stratosphere. The evidence points towards theories that complex living organisms are falling from the skies to Earth.\" This is the tipping point towards science proving that life is continually coming to Earth from space, and that it did so in the first instance. If these findings are true, then they will forever alter our view of life and particularly evolution on Earth and we will need to rewrite of our biology textbooks. ",

            "answer_text": "The enormity of the universe makes it likely that there are other thinking beings out there. The universe is so gigantic that it\u2019s almost beyond imagining. Astronomers estimate that there are around 140 billion galaxies in the universe that we can actually see. In 1924, Hubble demonstrated that a constellation once thought to be a gas cloud was actually an entire galaxy, located at least 900,000 light years away. This fact opened our minds to the idea that our universe doesn\u2019t just consist of the Milky Way galaxy \u2013 where earth is found \u2013 but many other galaxies too. In other words, the universe had to be far more vast than anyone had ever supposed. With this revelation also came the disillusion that humans could be the only thinking beings in the universe. According to professor Frank Drake\u2019s famous equation from 1961, he suggested that it is possible we are merely one of millions of other advanced civilizations. Drake came to this conclusion by dividing the number of stars in a selected part of the universe by the number that were likely to support planetary systems. He then divided that number by the number of systems that could theoretically support life, finally dividing that by the number on which life might then evolve to become intelligent. Although the number shrinks enormously with each division \u2013 even with the most conservative inputs \u2013 Drake\u2019s estimations on the number of advanced civilizations within the Milky Way alone always comes to somewhere in the millions. However, because the universe is so enormous, the average distance between any two hypothetical civilizations is estimated to be at least 200 light years \u2013 with just one light year being the rough equivalent of 5.8 trillion miles. So even if alien civilizations do exist, their potential distance away from us keeps the idea of a casual weekend visit in the realm of science fiction. ",

            "answer_text": "Many scientists believe we are not alone in the universe. It's probable, they say, that life could have arisen on at least some of the billions of planets thought to exist in our galaxy alone -- just as it did here on planet Earth. This basic question about our place in the Universe is one that may be answered by scientific investigations \"Sometime in the near future, people will be able to point to a star and say, 'that star has a planet like Earth',\" says Sara Seager, professor of planetary science and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"Astronomers think it is very likely that every single star in our Milky Way galaxy has at least one planet.\" NASA's quest to study planetary systems around other stars started with ground-based observatories, then moved to space-based assets like the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Kepler Space Telescope. Today's telescopes can look at many stars and tell if they have one or more orbiting planets. Even more, they can determine if the planets are the right distance away from the star to have liquid water, the key ingredient to life as we know it. The NASA roadmap will continue with the launch of the Transiting Exoplanet Surveying Satellite (TESS) in 2017, the James Webb Space Telescope (Webb Telescope) in 2018, and perhaps the proposed Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope - Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets (WFIRST-AFTA) early in the next decade. These upcoming telescopes will find and characterize a host of new exoplanets -- those planets that orbit other stars -- expanding our knowledge of their atmospheres and diversity. The Webb telescope and WFIRST-AFTA will lay the groundwork, and future missions will extend the search for oceans in the form of atmospheric water vapor and for life as in carbon dioxide and other atmospheric chemicals, on nearby planets that are similar to Earth in size and mass, a key step in the search for life. \"This technology we are using to explore exoplanets is real,\" said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The James Webb Space Telescope and the next advances are happening now. These are not dreams -- this is what we do at NASA.\" Since its launch in 2009, Kepler has dramatically changed what we know about exoplanets, finding most of the more than 5,000 potential exoplanets, of which more than 1700 have been confirmed. The Kepler observations have led to estimates of billions of planets in our galaxy, and shown that most planets within one astronomical unit are less than three times the diameter of Earth. Kepler also found the first Earth-size planet to orbit in the \"habitable zone\" of a star, the region where liquid water can pool on the surface. \"What we didn't know five years ago is that perhaps 10 to 20 percent of stars around us have Earth-size planets in the habitable zone,\" says Matt Mountain, director and Webb telescope scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. \"It's within our grasp to pull off a discovery that will change the world forever. It is going to take a continuing partnership between NASA, science, technology, the U.S. and international space endeavors, as exemplified by the James Webb Space Telescope, to build the next bridge to humanity's future.\" This decade has seen the discovery of more and more super Earths, which are rocky planets that are larger and heftier than Earth. Finding smaller planets, the Earth twins, is a tougher challenge because they produce fainter signals. Technology to detect and image these Earth-like planets is being developed now for use with the future space telescopes. The ability to detect alien life may still be years or more away, but the quest is underway. Said Mountain, \"Just imagine the moment, when we find potential signatures of life. Imagine the moment when the world wakes up and the human race realizes that its long loneliness in time and space may be over -- the possibility we're no longer alone in the universe.\" ",

            "answer_text": "If aliens ever sent us a message, scientists hope to pick it up in a remote part of northern California. There, in a clearing nestled amid the volcanoes of the Cascade Range, 42 radio dishes point together at the sky. The dishes, each 20 feet across, form a single, giant scientific instrument called the Allen Telescope Array. Scientists built the array to receive radio signals \u2014 the sort of message that could answer a very important question: Are we the only intelligent life in this vast universe? \u201cIt\u2019s a question humans have been asking forever,\u201d observes astronomer Jill Tarter. Until recently, she directed the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Mountain View, Calif. \u201cWe read these ancient texts, and the ancient Greeks, the Romans, the Chinese \u2014 they were all wondering how we humans fit into the universe.\u201d The SETI Institute helped build the Allen Telescope Array in hopes of finding some answers. While the question is ancient, our understanding of the universe has changed over the centuries. We now know that stars do not hang from the sky like fruit on a tree. We also know Earth orbits the Sun and not the other way around. But we still don\u2019t know if life exists elsewhere. And if extraterrestrial life does exist, does it have the technology to communicate with us on Earth? If so, the Allen Telescope Array is listening, day and night, for some signal. From time to time, the dishes pivot toward a new patch of the sky. The array has not yet picked up any alien calls. So far, intelligent life appears limited to Earth. But that has hardly frustrated scientists. The search for life elsewhere in the universe continues to prove irresistible to experts in a wide variety of fields, from biology to astronomy, and from psychology to computer science. And they\u2019re not just looking for aliens that can communicate: Many researchers suspect that simpler, microscopic alien life might be lurking on some distant planet. Even if their quest has yet to turn up any aliens, it has led to some surprising discoveries \u2014 including some right here on Earth. If anything, the search for extraterrestrial life has become a lot more exciting. Perhaps it\u2019s just a matter of time until we discover we\u2019re not alone. Life, unexpected In 1960, astronomer Frank Drake (father of Science News writer Nadia Drake) was among the first to listen for extraterrestrial radio signals. That was decades before anyone knew whether any aliens out there even had a place to call home. We now know they might, thanks to discoveries since 1995 of planets outside our solar system. To date, astronomers have found hundreds of these far-off worlds, called exoplanets. Some scientists predict hundreds of billions more exoplanets await discovery in our galaxy, the Milky Way. It\u2019s easy to imagine there must be life on at least one of those planets. And if not there, perhaps life thrives on some moon orbiting one of those planets. \u201cSome may be at the right temperature where liquid water might exist. And that\u2019s necessary for life as we know it,\u201d says Tarter. The discovery of so many new worlds, most of them found by the Kepler space telescope, has helped narrow the search for aliens. Tarter says the Allen Telescope Array now points at stars Kepler has flagged as having planets. Astronomers elsewhere in the United States and abroad have joined the hunt for life elsewhere in the universe. Scientists searching for extraterrestrial life aren\u2019t just looking up. Biologists, who study life in all of its forms, have joined the search too. They peer down into some of Earth\u2019s most unfriendly places to find tiny but tough organisms called extremophiles (ex TREEM oh fylz). For more than 50 years, scientists have found extremophiles in places where life wasn\u2019t thought to be possible. Some of these microbes live in the acidic sulfur springs of Yellowstone National Park. Some thrive near cracks in the ocean floor \u2014 called hydrothermal vents \u2014 that spew scalding water. Others flourish in cracks in the ice in Antarctica, or deep underground in mines. The discovery that life on Earth can survive under such harsh conditions has broadened the understanding scientists have of where they might find life off Earth.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it quite likely does. Here\u2019s why. Life thrives in most hostile places. Colonies of crabs and other species living in superheated deep sea vents are proofs that life can exist in the absence of light and oxygen. Although vastly relying on photosynthesis, life can also use molecules other than chlorophyll. In fact, a study has discovered that early life on Earth might have been just as purple as it is green today, due to the prevalence of synthesis that was used to draw energy from an unidentified molecule. Some of the weirdest life forms on earth, like the Tardigrade, can survive even in the vacuum of space.Resilience. Some catastrophes in the history of Earth have turned our blue planet into a living hell. The five worst mass extinctions cost the earth its biodiversity, the percentiles skyrocketing to 95%. But even if it took up to 30 million years, life found a way to spread again.Precursors of life. Life on earth is assumed to have evolved from a chemical that may have been initiated by complex organic molecules with a reddish-brown color called \u201ctholins\u201d and there is evidence that these precursors can be traced throughout the universe. They have been found in Saturn\u2019s Titan, and its hidden surface obscured by lakes and rivers of methane may have provided a suitable environment for life to develop. Tholins were also detected in the binary star system HR 4796, dubbed \u201cthe eye of Sauron\u201d as well in the Orion nebula.Water. For years we have believed water to be the cradle of life. Many sci-fi movies and books depict aliens coming to earth to plunder this rare resource. But earth is not the only planet that sustains water. Water can be found in Jupiter\u2019s Europa, whose surface is estimated to bury a 100 km deep ocean. The largest reservoir of water was discovered within the APM 08279+5255 quasar, precisely around its supermassive black hole, which holds around 140 trillion times the water on earth.Life arises quickly. Microbial fossils found in Australia in 2013 are the earliest evidence of life on earth, dating back to 3.5 billion years. Bacteria probably appeared only a few million years after earth\u2019s formation. The process was rapid enough to change single celled organisms into a diversity of complex life forms. It is even speculated that life might have arisen promptly after the Big Bang during the habitable epoch when the universe was only around 10-17 million years old. ",

            "answer_text": "Science does not obtain knowledge based on belief and yet many of these answers talk about their belief that life in the universe has to be common.  Science is about evidence. So what is the evidence? First there is evidence that there are lots of planets in the universe. For example the recent Kepler satellite has discovered several hundred planets in just one sector of our galactic neighborhood. Some of these planets are even in the habitable zone of their star. So extrapolating to the whole galaxy and to all the billions of other galaxies in our observable universe there will be many planets in the habitable zone.  So that is a settled issue. So now the question is what is the probability that life can arise on a planet in the habitable zone?  I used to think that since life arose on earth within a few hundred million years after the Earth formed, the probability that life will arise on a habitable planet was significantly greater than zero. After all, if the probability was extremely low we might have had to wait several billion years after the formation of the planet before life would have arisen on Earth. However, it turns out that if a proper Bayesian probability analysis is done, almost nothing can be learned from this one example of life arising quickly after formation.  See this paper for detail: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.3835.pdf The TL;DR summary is that for a Bayesian analysis you have to have a prior estimate of the probability of life forming, then you add in the fact that life did form early to then obtain the final (aposterior) probability.  This paper argues that the final result is strongly influenced by you initial estimate, so the observation of life on earth gives almost no information.  So the answer is that even with this one data point we really have no evidence about the probability of life forming. I personally hope and believe it is high, but there just is no evidence. Now once we find just one other independent example of life arising, then I think that would give strong evidence for lots of life in the universe, but until that is found, we could be the only example of life in the universe. :-( Here is the title and abstract of the paper:  A Bayesian Analysis of the Astrobiological Implications of Life's Early Emergence on Earth       David S. Spiegel, Edwin L. Turner Life arose on Earth sometime in the first few hundred million years after the young planet had cooled to the point that it could support water-based organisms on its surface. The early emergence of life on Earth has been taken as evidence that the probability of abiogenesis is high, if starting from young-Earth-like conditions. We revisit this argument quantitatively in a Bayesian statistical framework. By constructing a simple model of the probability of abiogenesis, we calculate a Bayesian estimate of its posterior probability, given the data that life emerged fairly early in Earth's history and that, billions of years later, curious creatures noted this fact and considered its implications.  We find that, given only this very limited empirical information, the choice of Bayesian prior for the abiogenesis probability parameter has a dominant influence on the computed posterior probability. Although terrestrial life's early emergence provides evidence that life might be common in the Universe if early-Earth-like conditions are, the evidence is inconclusive and indeed is consistent with an arbitrarily low intrinsic probability of abiogenesis for plausible uninformative priors. Finding a single case of life arising independently of our lineage (on Earth, elsewhere in the Solar System, or on an extrasolar planet) would provide much stronger evidence that abiogenesis is not extremely rare in the Universe.

I really can\u2019t understand anyone who thinks otherwise, other than to assume they just are not overly informed on the subject. 1 to 2 trillion galaxies. With an average of 200 billion stars apiece. Just in the observable universe.Most stars have multiple planets, almost all stars have at least one.20% of stars are \u201cSun-like\u201d.The Sun (and Earth) is at most about 1/3 as old as the universe. And maybe only an infinite fraction of its infinite age. Depending on whether you believe in the \u201cBig Bang\u201d or not. The majority of the observable stars in the Universe are much older than the Sun. By billions of years.Once the Sun formed, the time it took for the planets including Earth to form, and then life to form on Earth was quite short percentage-wise.To me, it is obvious. I cannot imagine a rational set of logic that leads to the conclusion Earth is the single host to life in the Universe. I can imagine not having thought of it. I can imagine carrying a belief given by another. I cannot imagine sitting down, pondering what one knows about the Universe, about its age, size, and the population of planets. About how long so many of them have been around. About DNA and RNA and genetics, and evolution. And then putting my thoughts, my info, my understanding to paper, and concluding, \u201cEarth has the only life in the Universe\u201d. That just will not happen. The data leads in only one direction.

            "answer_text": "There are many theories as to why we haven't made contact with intelligent life, and many other theories as to if intelligent life other than ourselves even exists. The most prominent seems to be the Fermi Paradox:http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox Basically the Fermi paradox says: There is no intelligent lifeWe've made no contact because there is no equally intelligent life forms out there. Hard to believe given the truly incomprehensible size of space. There are a few sub-points: There's a filter, a stopping point that an evolving species either meets and exceeds or dies off before surpassing it. A theory is that humans are rare as they've managed to surpass this filter even though its highly unlikely for a species to do so.The aforementioned filter is simply a point that other species haven't yet reached. It may simply be difficult to succeed in surpassing it, and humanity may simply have been one of the first, if not the only so far.The filter is upcoming. In other words, we haven't yet reached it, but most, if not all other intelligent life has.Intelligent life exists and we haven't made contact for a few reasons Intelligent life may have already made contact with earth at a time where we were highly underdeveloped and they haven't yet returned.We live in a desolate, unexplored portion of the galaxy and as such, the prominent species hasn't deemed the area worthy of exploration.The dominant species has managed to establish a self perpetuating sphere of existense deeming \"physical colonization\" obsolete and unnecessary.There are highly intelligent, vicious predators that peaceful species know to avoid and as such, they don't broadcast their locationThere's one dominant, ruling species that decides the fate of developing civilizations and terminate them once they reach a certain point (think Mass Effect, \"to create, you must first destroy\")Our technology and method of communication is much too primitive to be intercepted by other species and theirs is much too advanced for us to interpret.We are receiving signals and communications but the powers that be (the government) have kept it hidden from us.We've been deemed a \"zoo\" of sorts, apart of a national park if you will, with a strict \"look but don't touch\" policy.There are higher civilizations all around us but we're simply incapable of perceiving them.Our reality is entirely false. In other words like a Men in Black type thing, where we're a species within a locker, or on a grain of sand within a universe so substantial and significant that we truly cannot comprehend or perceive its existence.What I've relayed is a rough translation of a highly complex theory. I've linked the theory's wiki page so I recommend you give it a look as I've most likely mis-interpreted certain aspects and accidentally omitted vital concepts. ",

            "answer_text": "To date, we don't have direct evidence of life on any other worlds (planets or moons, e.g., Europa). Within our own solar system there is a chance to directly look for life, most likely on Mars (under the surface) or on Europa (under the ice in its vast water ocean). Outside our own solar system we are searching for secondary evidence of life on exoplanets. We can study the composition of the atmosphere of these planets by taking a spectrum of it as it passes in front of its host star. That is, light from the star passes through the atmosphere of the planet before traversing the distance between it and Earth. We can systematically remove all of the contaminating components such as the Earths atmosphere and the host stars atmosphere and we're left with that of the planet\u2019s. There are a ton of technical challenges to overcome here but this is the state-of-the-art now and there are a lot of brilliant folks working on it. By looking at the spectrum of the planet\u2019s atmosphere we can detect certain elemental and molecular signatures that are consistent with our understanding of the presents of life on Earth. For example, O2 could suggest the presents of life. This is because that molecule would otherwise be lost from the atmosphere of a planet of similar mass to Earth unless there was something continuously producing it, which is what many forms of life here on Earth do. We haven't made any such detections as of today that I'm aware, mostly due to the technical challenges involve; however, this is only a matter of time now. ",

            "answer_text": "How likely is it that life exists outside of our planet? As many scientists have done, we can roughly calculate the chance that alien life exists somewhere else in the universe as 50,000,000,000 : 1. That\u2019s a probability, based on recent knowledge gained from observation of the near universe and some extrapolations. As to what life elsewhere is like, that\u2019s pure guesswork. The nearest possible place for civilised (or any) aliens to be located would be on a planet (if there were one) circling around our nearest star, Alpha Centauri. Travelling at a speed of 300,000 kilometres every one second it would take us, or them, 4\u00bd years to cover the distance. Nothing approaching that speed can possibly be achieved by us. Even if those aliens had invented a near-light speed vehicle, that time gap still remains. Every signal takes at least 4\u00bd years to get here, then 4\u00bd years back. The chance of life elsewhere depends on the existence of stars harbouring suitable planets. About 1 in 20 stars are of the kind, like ours, that have often been observed to have rocky planets that could host conditions suitable for life. There are some 100 billion stars in our galaxy, so that leaves around 5 billion stars of the kind that could have rocky planets. It looks as though about a quarter of those actually do, so, let\u2019s say around 1 billion possibly habitable planets. As for the chance of life somewhere in the universe, if there a billion possible contenders in our one galaxy, just consider that the observable universe contains 10 trillion galaxies. Let\u2019s count them up: 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 earths. I\u2019d say that makes ET a very safe bet. But if our nearest star is so impossibly distant, just think how long it would take to get to or communicate with the any of the others. We\u2019ll never get to meet. The universe is so vast that way out there light, travelling at 300,000 Km per second, having set off around big bang time is only just reaching us now. And that\u2019s as far as we\u2019ll ever see.

In my opinion, there is no doubt of intelligent life existing outside of Earth. According to the Drake Equation, there are roughly 4500 Extraterrestrial Civilizations in our galaxy alone. Now extrapolate that into the hundreds of billions or trillions or who knows how many zillions of galaxies in the universe. IT'S UNLIKELY THAT WE ARE THE ONLY LIFE FORMS in this unimaginably massive thing we call the universe. In regards to whether or not these civilizations are advanced enough to be able to communicate with us, that is unknown. Some may be behind us on the evolutionary scale and some may be eons ahead of us. (Look up the 3 types of civilizations: Type 1, Type 2 ,& Type 3.) The universe is pretty cool ay? ",

            "answer_text": "It is very, very likely that life exists on the probes and telescopes we\u2019ve launched away from earth. A few of them have even left the solar system, but it is uncertain if the bacteria has been sterilized by exposure to solar and cosmic radiation and extreme temperature. The more recent probes, landers, rovers, and orbiters around the moon, mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the moons of other planets surely contain bacteria that is still viable. Beyond that, no one can say with certainty whether life exists beyond Earth. There simply isn\u2019t evidence for or against. There is only speculation. We know life arose quickly and early on Earth, immediately following the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment, and we know that life can be extremely resilient because we have discovered the tardigrade can be turned to glass and rehydrated; and we have found microbes in volcanic vents. But we haven\u2019t found life or evidence of life beyond Earth, at least not yet. If we find oxygen in the spectrographs of an exoplanet that would be evidence (but not proof) of extraterrestrial life; we know that simple life has a history of excreting oxygen. Everything at this early stage is speculation. We\u2019ve only been searching for half a century. We\u2019ve only been capable of flight for one century. Keep your head up! ",

            "answer_text": "I subscribe to the notion that \"the Earth really isn't all that special, even if it is special.\" What does that mean?  It means that if it could happen here, where there aren't crazy weird conditions, elements or other such stuff, then it really could happen anywhere there was running water and a steady supply of radiation.  That's a LOT of places.  Well, let's separate complex, multi-cellular life and simple life.    Simple life, like bacteria, evolved (or were brought here from some other place, like on an asteroid or from meteorites broken off from Mars) based on specific conditions.  Those conditions aren't really that rare:  vulcanism, a mixture of certain elements that aren't all that rare in the universe, a stable star, water and a stable-ish environment (enclosed in a biosphere, enclosed under ice, enclosed under ground).Stars exactly like ours are about .2% of all stars (about a billion out of the estimated 500 billion in the Milky Way galaxy).There are a also non-G type stars and stable multiple star systems.  When one separates the flare stars and other unstable elements, even if that left only another billion systems (about .2% of all stars, a very gross under-estimate, but we'll be conservative), that leaves a total of 2 billion stars in our galaxy.If only one in ten had a stable planet that could produce life (a Europa like planet or an Earth like planet), that's still 200 million stars with the ability to produce life.I happen to believe that if life happened here, and we aren't all that special, then it will undoubtedly happen in any environment with the appropriate factors.  Even if only 1 in 10 produce life in its existence (which is billions of years), that's still 20 million stars.Even if 1 in 100 of those planets, now, had stable biospheres (probably made so by a large-ish satellite, tidally locked) capable of allowing multi-cellular life, that's still 200,000 planets in our galaxy with multi-cellular life (jelly fish, animals, planets, etc.).  That's plenty of interesting life in the Galaxy worth exploring.BUT[!!!], if we discover life on Europa or \"past life\" on Mars, life that had no link to the Earth, then we know that life will abound in numbers greater than what I proposed here.  If either of those planets have life, then we'll know it's not just common, but probably matter-of-fact.  If that ends up being true, then we'll end up finding life on a massive percentage of planets in the galaxy, numbers from 100 billion to 250 billion would not be to liberal an estimate.If there are \"a trillion other galaxies\", then that puts the planets with life (and the possibilities thereof) at a level of likelihood--IMHO--that reaches nearly absolute.Then what about intelligent life? That gets a lot tougher.  We have to remember that it's not just about space, it's about time.What are the number of planets that will exist NOW that can produce intelligent life?What are the number of planets that will have existed in the past 10 billion years that will have produced intelligent life AND have survived all celestial events that can destroy such life?What are the planets that exist now that will have intelligent life that won't destroy itself during one of the critical technological phases?If we weren't the first, then surely there's been some intelligent life out there.  IF they are out there, they probably don't care enough to bother themselves with the likes of humanity.  The galaxy has been around for something like 13 billion years.  In all that time, during all the many star existences, life could have come and gone a trillion-billion times.  Intelligent life could have been produced and wiped out, wiped itself out or moved on to a higher level of existence.   The problem compounds when you consider how fast technology advances once you have access to the genome and micro-processors.  I happen to think we're less than a century from The Singularity.  I also happen to think that we're 500 years from looking like aliens that we think are a billion years more advanced than us.  Such a life form need only survive a few hundred years passed the nuclear revolution to become utterly godlike to us.  After that, they would probably leave the planet and move off with little concern for matters on our level (and don't buy the bunk about aliens like in ID4, War of the Worlds or V, coming to our planet for our resources; any technology that permits a voyage between the stars has long dispensed with the need to siphon material off of planets, they'd merely need the stars and nothing else).  So it becomes one of not just finding the right conditions, but finding the life at the right time, otherwise they'd either be extinct or have moved on to much higher level domains. _________________________________________________________________ REFERENCES http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/021127a.htmlhttp://www.solstation.com/habitable.htmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy#The_Milky_Wayhttp://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/  (BEST LINK!!!)",

            "answer_text": "You are driving along a highway in a strange country. Your car breaks down. You decide to hitchhike to the next town to get help. You stand by the side of the road and stick out your thumb. You don\u2019t know how long you will have to wait; you don\u2019t know the local customs. Maybe hitchhiking is common, and plenty of drivers pick up hitchhikers, and you only have to wait a few minutes. Or maybe it is illegal, and people are scared of hitchhikers, and you may have to wait days. Or maybe never get picked up at all. You have no way of calculating how common it is for drivers to pick up hitchhikers. You stand there for a few minutes, and the second car that drives by picks you up. Now, it is quite possible that there is only one person in the whole country that stops to pick up hitchhikers, and you were lucky enough that he drove by that particular spot just a few minutes after your car broke down. But I bet that\u2019s not what you think. You assume that picking up hitchhikers is quite common in that country. And it probably is. In mathematics, this is called Bayesian inference - Wikipedia. Biologists believe that the first life on earth appeared very soon after the earth had cooled enough for life to exist - certainly within a billion years. Now, it could be that life forming on earth-like planets is exceedingly rare and infrequent, and we were very lucky that life appeared so quickly (or at all). But, like the hitchhiker, a far more plausible explanation is that it is quite common for earth-like worlds to quickly develop life. And we know that most or all stars similar to our own Sun have planets, and our Sun doesn\u2019t appear special, so there is a high probability that lots and lots of other stars have rocky planets in or near the habitable zone of liquid water. And there are literally trillions of stars like our own in the Universe. Put these together and the chances of at least simple life forms existing on planets orbiting suns similar to our own become close to an absolute certainty. My best guess: 100% ",

            "answer_text": "There are estimated to be as many as a septillion stars in the visible universe, in more than 80 billion galaxies. Even if you assume there is an average of 1 planet per star, that would make a septillion planets. How big is a septillion?  So big you cannot imagine.  This big: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 So big that if one planet in a trillion had life, that would make a trillion planets containing life. But does one planet in a trillion contain life?  A convenient formula, the Drake Equation, exists that you can use to calculate how many planets in the universe have intelligent life right now: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation The results varies a lot based on the inputs, but given that the laws of physics work everywhere and the theory of evolution works everywhere, and given how abundant oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon are, I'd argue the odds are quite high. So, almost certainly yes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe ",

            "answer_text": "There is no reason NOT to believe about lives existing beyond earth. There are infinite stars and galaxies existing which our scientist are always trying to navigate through as much possible coming out with newer and thrilling information. They say that there are innumerable galaxies existing as starts billions or light year away. They have yet to discover about our galaxy which is huge in itself. If we find the hypothesis of life evolution, even if it could be theoretical idea with no surety but have drawn a possibility of atmospheric condition that was conducive we know about and it came in a form of bacteria with multiplying nature and then followed a cycle of marine creature / plants and so on\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 leading to the human form which could be millions of years story. If surrounding conditions can help create lives we know about life here but who knows the capability of higher life that would be requiring different conditions and would be existing already. Scripture does indicate intelligent species stay in different planet and why can\u2019t be think as a possibility. Scientifically it is not found today but who knows they get a clue in hundreds of years ahead. I believe that God has not given power to think what does not exist or even what human cant manifest, this is also one of them. One day scientist would discover and in another day a enlighten person would navigate easily as well. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people share the same thought. That if the universe is so large, the chances are we aren\u2019t the only ones here. A popular analogy is to say: Saying there is no life beyond earth is like taking a cup of water from the ocean, not finding a whale in it, and saying there aren\u2019t any whales in the ocean. For life to develop, a planet needs to have a few things. For example: Gravity, Nutrients, Water, Atmosphere, Energy (E.G. The Sun), Must be in the habitable zone meaning, not too hot and not too cold. (Source: What does a planet REALLY need to support life? The link will provide a more detailed list and discussion) There are planets that have been discovered that are very similar to earth. They appear to have these things and are in the habitable zone.  There is a good chance that there are several times more planets just like ours. It\u2019s exciting to think we may discover life on one. The chances of life being on another planet would say: Yes, life likely exists beyond earth. ",

The only thing we have are just theories. But these theories are so strong which proves that there might be alien life on other planets too. Kepler-186f also known as Earth's cousin, is the first plant found with radius same as of Earth which is supposed to support liquid water given sufficient pressure.  Kepler-452b or Earth's bigger older cousin, is 1.6 times bigger than Earth's surface. This planet is also in a region of a star where temperature are right for water.  We assume that water is the first proof of life, but even on Earth there are creatures who live without oxygen around highly heated volcanos. Extermophiles, these organism can survive in extreme heat, cold, poisonous chemicals and even in vaccum. So there is a possibility that Life can exist of another planet which may be chemically different from us. Who knows they might be watching us right now  ",

Life is a rare thing and it is definitely out there. Considering that H2O CO2 are the bases for life to exist. There are proven water planets which could contain life. If it has an atmosphere with oxygen life is there. Water is also required. So life does exist out there. If you want evidence then I am happy to send a space probe to a planet with oxygen, water and an atmosphere just to prove life exists out there. Anyways why would you think there isn\u2019t? Why would you try to argue that we are the only life in the universe? If we are then once our planet is gone, there is no knowledge of the universe ever again. All of the memory would be destroyed. Life would be extinct. To argue that we need evidence is an excuse to say that there is no other life because we don\u2019t see any. This doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t. Life is a rare thing to form. First it needs elements. It would be a waste of elements and energy to have a universe with planet earth being the only planet with life in the entire universe. Also if you argue that there isn\u2019t other life then life is immediately extinct in the universe. So life does exist out there. ",

            "answer_text": "The overwhelming majority of cosmologists, exobiologists, and scientists are convinced that life must exist elsewhere in the universe besides our own planet. They base this conclusion on a number of factors: the fact that life has arisen and evolved on the Earth.The Earth is a pretty average planet, circling a pretty average, G-type yellow sun, in a pretty average galaxy. We are aware of millions of G-type stars in our own galaxy that are similar to, and of the same age, as our Sun, as well as further billions of such stars in other galaxies. Considering the number of such stars, and the number of planets similar to our own Earth, it is simply reasonable to assume life has arisen elsewhere. If complex and intelligent life, in the presence of water and oxygen, could evolve on our planet, circling our Sun, it is almost beyond reason to assume life could not develop elsewhere. 2. the age of the universe, our Sun, and the Earth Cosmologists estimate the age of the universe to be about 14 billion years old, the age of our Sun at about 4.6 billion years, and the age of the Earth at about 4.5 billion years. At those time scales, it is reasonable to assume that life could have arisen, evolved, and become extinct on other planets circling Sun-like stars several times over, even before the formation of our now planet. 3. The ubiquity, hardiness, and adaptability of life here on Earth It\u2019s interesting and important to note that life has arisen and developed in every ecological niche and biome on the Earth, from the bottom of the deepest ocean, at freezing temperatures and crushing pressures, to the tops of the highest mountains, to hot springs that have a temperature of the boiling point of water, and that are highly acidic and contains powerful toxins. Life even exists at the center of Antarctica, in the form of bacteria and viruses, and on meteors that have traveled vast distances for millions of years through the vacuum of space. It seems, wherever life finds a foothold, it adapts and is tenacious. Life finds a way to survive and flourish. If life can arise in the most inhospitable environments on the Earth, then it is nearly certain that it could arise on planets with conditions far less hospitable. In short, the possibility of life, and even intelligent, technologically sophisticated life such as ourselves, is a slam dunk. ",

Let's get down to Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution as explained by Richard Dawkins in his seminal work The Selfish Gene. Earth's in it's earliest phase consisted of ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor. When sources of energy such as lightening and heat interacted with these compounds, it lead to the formation of most basic building elements of \u2018life\u2019. With gargantuan amount of permutations and combinations over more that 4.5 billion years, these basic building blocks combined and formed a mutually beneficial colony. These colony initially developed as basic organisms like amoeba, but after much more permutations they formed into the modern day organisms. In this process the only colonies of building blocks (organisms) that were fittest for survival and replication remained and are present today on earth as various forms of life. Now, let's look at the Universe other than our earth. It is 13.7 billion years old, has more than 100 billion galaxies. Our galaxy Milky Way consists of around 2\u20133 trillion planets, where as it comes on the lower end of spectrum in terms of size, when size of many other known galaxies is taken into account. So, there are hundreds of trillions of planets in our universe. Well it seems very foolish and eccentric to think that there won't be a few planets atleast with any kind of life. There surely are places in this universe other than earth which have life on them. Period. ",

Of these say at least half of came existence before sun itself.And of these say 10% have earth like planets. That means there are 1.5 billion stars similar to earth in our galaxy alone. Now, since they are older than our sun, any such planet of these 1.5 billion stars should have a life much evolved than ours.  If humans have evolved have so much over just 200,000 years, imagine what 100,000,000 old planet might have evolved into.

Stars and planets as diverge from a chemical, physical, thermodynamic diversification can have similar course in other parts. What takes place now there need us wait that many billion years. Nearest Star Alpha Centuri believed to have a habitat that perished away and some claim the aliens escaped through a space ship. Computer simulations of Nebula Super nova Galaxy etc are made and the scientists look forward any clue for habitat conditions from the early stages of universe watched by NASA, but discovery of some dying star planet system may help us to derive any habitats likely to exist. Whatever be, our technology needs a million years to reach the nearest planet. [Indian epics postulate that there are at least 14 realms (Habitats) including Earth.

            "answer_text": "This was an essay question back in high school (1975). Long story short, at that point in time, we could not tell whether there were planets orbiting other stars. So I made up numbers, guessing a billion stars in the entire universe. Now, we have a better idea of the size and number of stars out there... Today, the guess is that 10 trillion galaxies holding the average of same number of stars on the Milky Way (100 billion stars) would result in a huge number: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a \"1\" with 24 zeros after it (space.com) . We now know there are planets around some of these stars. Let's be very conservative and say there is only ONE possible planet per entire galaxy with life. That's 1 in 100 billion. That would still leave 1o trillion planets in the universe with life. Let's consider that some planets are too hot, some are too cold and only ONE planet in one billion is just right and has life on it. That leaves 10,000 planets in a HUGE universe that have life. It's more likely than not that life exists elsewhere, though its more than likey we will never meet our nearest star neighbors__________________________________________________While we are playing with numbers, let's toss out this oldie but goodie: Which are there more of \u2014 grains of sand on the Earth or stars in the sky?(Which Is Greater, The Number Of Sand Grains On Earth Or Stars In The Sky? - Robert Krulwich On Science) Obviously, grains and stars can't be counted, not literally. But you can guestimate. if you assume a grain of sand has an average size and you calculate how many grains are in a teaspoon and then multiply by all the beaches and deserts in the world, the Earth has roughly (and we're speaking very roughly here) 7.5 x 1018 grains of sand, or seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains. Our stargazer gets a Hubble telescope and a calculator, so now we can count distant galaxies, faint stars, red dwarfs, everything we've ever recorded in the sky, and boom! Now the population of stars jumps enormously, to 70 thousand million, million, million stars in the observable universe (a 2003 estimate), so that we've got multiple stars for every grain of sand \u2014 which means, sorry, grains, you are nowhere near as numerous as the stars. So that makes stars the champions of numerosity, no? the number of stars in the heavens is \"an unbelievably large number,\" but you will find the same number of molecules \"in just ten drops of water.\" Link: http://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2012/09/17/161096233/which-is-greater-the-number-of-sand-grains-on-earth-or-stars-in-the-sky Enjoy...

There is no empirical evidence, that we are aware of, to prove extraterrestrial life does exist. Also, since the universe we see is billions and billions of years old and the galaxies we can see are at the greatest of distances, Andromeda our nearest galactic neighbor is 2 million light years away, it is a sound theory to suggest that most of the life in the universe is extinct. The idea that those galaxies are so far away so they are so much older than us, that life may have evolved, advanced, and been eradicated long ago. That maybe perhaps we are part of the last remaining forms of life in the universe. However, we don\u2019t know anything for certain. It\u2019s all best guess and in this case probability and statistics would support the idea there must be life elsewhere in some fashion. ",

From my research earth has been the Eden of the cosmos and other beings have come and gone for perhaps millions of years. Man, throughout the ages has worshiped beings they called sky gods. You will find this documented in the writings of Jewish author Zechariah Sitchin who wrote the books on the early Sumerian culture. They left behind cuneiform writing that told the story of SKY GOD\u2019s and their advanced teaching of early man. You can also find in the bible, book of Genesis the chapter 6 how beings called Nephilim came to earth found earth females attractive then took them to wife. It is written there that these produced giants and nearly wiped out the human bloodline. So, here is proof, if you accept it that there are other beings in the universe. Neither the church, the government, nor education teach these facts about life else where. This information is yours to accept or reject. d ",

If one in a billion planets has life, then there are a trillion of them. (I bet it's at least a million times more than that.)  There doesn't seem to be anything extremely unusual about Earth - it's about average size, it orbits a pretty average star, in an average galaxy, and it's made of the same stuff that the rest of the universe is made of. Life on Earth is also made of common, regular stuff. The elements in our body are the most common ones in the universe, and we have almost exactly the same proportions of those elements in our bodies as we see everywhere else in the universe.  So although there's no actual evidence, it seems perverse to doubt that there must be other life.  There might even be alien life nearby, under the surface on Mars or under the ice in the (enormous) oceans of Europa or Enceladus.  ",

            "answer_text": "In short, yes. I believe life exists beyond Earth, but not in the traditional sense that people may think. Most people believe that with so many habitable planets in the Universe, that the chances of life are irrefutable. Some people believe that the Universe is infinite, which would automatically render other life certain. If the Universe were infinite, then everything that we can ever imagine would exist; every combination of every atom would have to exist somewhere. Therefore, I do NOT believe the Universe is infinite. With that, you can ask the question if life exists beyond Earth\u2026 but not necessarily within the confines of our finite Universe. Within Earth, it can already be argued that Artificial Intelligence is alive. It portrays many of the ingredients required for life, such as responding to external stimuli (environment), presenting growth and change, and maintaining homeostasis. In accordance with the Simulation Theory, what\u2019s to say we aren\u2019t Artificial Intelligence ourselves? Would we even know? Is that why many believe in a higher power? To look beyond Earth in search of life is to seek a treasure chest, in which we already know what riches lay inside. We don\u2019t have a treasure map, nor do we know the correct interpretation of \u2018treasure,\u2019 or that there even is treasure to begin with. Then what led us in search for this treasure that we knew so much about? When life is given the opportunity to live, it lives. When people are given the opportunity to question, they question. When we are given the opportunity to believe, we believe. That is why I believe life exists beyond Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "Anthropic bias (bias created by observation selection effects) allow the probability of intelligent life existing on a given planet to be arbitrarily small while still being consistent with the fact that we are indeed intelligent.  If the probability of life forming on a planet is 10^-100 then the probability of another planet having life is effectively 0 while the probability of life existing on Earth given that we are life existing on Earth remains 1.  If life formed somewhere else we would be asking this question from there instead.  The mediocrity principle does not apply. 10^24 may seem like a large number but when it's put up against a large product, like in the Drake equation, it doesn't give much confidence.  All that it takes is the sum of the base 10 logs of each component of the Drake equation to be smaller than -24 for the odds of no other life to become small.  A slight misprediction in any part of the Drake equation leads to orders of magnitude changes in the expected number of life-bearing planets.  This all without mentioning that the Drake equation is a pretty naive calculation to begin with. Mostly what I want to say is it's a difficult question, one that is by no means settled, and to believe that the answer is obvious is the only foolish response. ",

Why everyone around us searches for exoplanets more feequently than analysing our own solar system?(Not that we haven't analysed our solar system, but researchers around the world come up with discovery of some or the other exoplanet light years away more often than pondering upon life sustainability on Titan.)How or what are the techniques currently used to track down distant exoplanets?

The scale of universe however is so large that we may never come to know that there exists some other planet in just right conditions to sustain life. They may even have some intelligent life, like us or maybe more advanced than us. They might have travelled in space more than us but maybe at some hurdle or something. Thing is , We don't know it yet. To search for life outside the solar system is to toss a grain of sugar in Sahara size desert made of leta say Salt and ask a 4 year old toddler, heck , ask a grown up to go around and find it. Space Technology in modern world is rekatively very young to us compared to other technologies and with time it may evolve. But one thing is for sure. The conciousness of living beings that makes them alive, the material things exisitng around us, things we have around us come up from same star dust and must be held together by some common governing principle. We may not be able to get it now. But if it has happened here, chances are that it has happened elsewhere too. Just that communication link has not been setup. ",

While there may be other life out there, our chances of finding it aren't looking very good and the chance of finding intelligent life near enough to the Earth that we could communicate is looking to be zero! Sure, I'd like to visit with a friendly alien and I'd also like to win millions in a lottery, but I don't expect either to happen in my lifetime. I'm not being pessimistic, just realistic. ",

If you only considered life in forms for which there's a terrestrial analog (e.g., something we'd recognize as life), then there are only a few dozen variables that most be satisfied to make life a thermodynamically favorable and stable system. The proper conditions may be somewhat rare, but the universe is a VERY big place. The Drake Equation ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation ) attempts to describe the probability that civilizations capable of being detected remotely exist elsewhere in the galaxy based on estimable coefficients. At one time, we were uncertain that planets were common outside our solar system and many even postulated that planetary systems were rare; though modern astronomy seems to indicate that they are, in fact, quite common. Per Drake's initial assumptions in 1961, he calculated that there would be between 1,000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in our galaxy alone. One thing that Drake did not specify, is what's the likelihood we could detect the presence of the civilization -- and I would guess that it would be approximately 0. The intensity of our radio signals on earth when they reach proxima centauri, our nearest neighbor, would be all but inseparable from the radio static of space. ",

Stars of a similar type to our Sun are very common in the universe. The Kepler project has demonstrated that most stars have planets in orbit. The odds of a planet with a similar composition/size to Earth existing in a similar orbit around a similar star seem fairly high. From that point it\u2019s all chemistry, Abiogenisis and the rise of life\u2019s various stages is essentially extremely complex chemistry. And this is limiting the possibility to an Earth like source of life. There\u2019s a good argument to be made to expect life of some sort to live under the Europa ice sheets. To the best of my knowledge there is as yet no evidence of alien life however the statistical argument is compelling. ",

The chances of us meeting, or even detecting, other life though, is extremely remote based on the distance even to our closest star system Alpha Centauri (4.2 light years away) which would take longer than the lifespan of a human being to get to. There's not even a detailed map of Alpha Centauri planets. Travelling round earth is fine and dandy or even to the moon, but I don't believe we were ever meant to travel any farther than that. ",

And even if there IS a common root, the environmental influences (weather, climate, gases in the air etc) would cause differing evolutions and therefore (after a few million years) different results. However, this does not mean that it is inevitable that Alien life wouldn\u2019t look similar - two arms, two legs, one head, stereo vision etc - because we know that pattern works. Our (Human) rise has been because of our opposable thumbs. We are able to use tools because of this - other simians don\u2019t have this, but stand Human and Orag Utan together and the similarities are remarkable (which, is not actually surprising; we are related) . For some animals, 4 legs and no arms mean no opposable thumbs so no technological development. Dolphins and Whales are smart, but no hands, no manipulation of fire = no technology. If life on another planet was to evolve (whether from raining protolife or not) an intelligence and a technology, they would need to have opposable thumbs (or equivalents), so they would need \u2018arms\u2019. They would need two eyes in order to have 3D vision, so they could judge distances. They would need two ears (so they could detect direction of threat or food from sound) and, most probably a nose of some sort. It may be that for all of that to be possible, they need, evolutionarily, to be bipedal, upright and perhaps vaguely, human-like. But insects have six limbs - it\u2019s possible a creature with four legs and two arms exists. The ONLY way we would find \u2018Human\u2019 life on other planets would be if an earlier civilisation on Earth sent them there, or if we migrated here in the first place. ",

The best evidence we have, obtained by using a marvelous process called science, the best system we have for figuring out the Universe, shows the same building blocks of life are present throughout the Universe of galaxies. Stars explode in galaxies peppering the vast spaces within the Milky Way Galaxy (and other galaxies) with the heavier elements. The lighter ones are all over the place. Extraterrestrials that might exist on exoplanets mere trillions of miles (km) from Earth will not look at all like humans, having adapted to conditions unlike Earth\u2019s. Even if the planets were similar to conditions on early Earth there are innumerable, myriads of different ways things might have developed. Most creatures on Earth might have been tri-pedal instead of bipedal (there are fossils of unusual creatures that just did not survive; how and why they died out we haven\u2019t a clue). We might have been closer in appearance to eight-tentacled squid or octopi that had adapted to the land. Or be the equivalent of intelligent dinosaurs, descended from creatures happily inhabiting Earth from 200 to nearly 66-million years ago, but for an extinction event that killed nearly all, except for their avian branch, the birds. That extinction made it possible for small early mammals to take over and adapt. The same evolving and adaptations over long periods of time would produce anywhere and everywhere as diverse a grouping of creatures, plant, and animal, that have ever existed on Earth. ",

They stalled at the magnetospheric cavity and established orbital motion resonances with each other. The odds are great that substantial amounts of water are present on these worlds. There is significant tidal heating. Except for Trappist-1-c, all the planets have low densities indicating large quantities of water. Planets d and e are most likely habitable and inhabited. Planets b and c may have retained enough water to be habitable. Surface environments of these habitable zone planets with an Earth-like dense atmosphere would be similar to present day Earth. If ozone is detected by future observations, it is a slam-dunk for surface life. The planets are excellent targets for transmission spectroscopy. Bio-signatures of ozone and methane indicating present life will be observed by JWST and E-ELT. The planets strong magnetic field protects their atmospheres from flares of the Red-Dwarf star. Interplanetary Panspermia is probable as is abiogenesis. The Trappist 1 system has no moons and no giant planets. SETI observed Trappist 1 and found no signals and no intelligent transmissions enhancing the possibility that with no moons, no giant planets, and no asteroid belt, the planets have not suffered impacts from large asteroids wiping out their Dinosaurs and so have large but unintelligent Dinosaurs and flying reptiles dominating the life of these Trappist 1 Exo-planets.

Its not possible for our planet to be the 'only one' with life as there might be a hundred or thousand other galaxies with the planet positioned at the similar distance from its star, having a life form. But the question arises, what kind of life form? When I say there might be life, I refer to the entire existence of organisms on Earth starting from a tiny microorganism to a complex body of a human. The life form can range between any of these! Well, the signs of intelligent life is unlikely but not impossible to receive but for a life form to exist isn't that difficult to contemplate. ",

Leave the universe, we have not even explored our own galaxy. Recently, seven planets of trappist-1 were discovered which could support life. So, it might possible that life may already present there. Although it is not proven, but yet probability say that life may exist in the universe except for the earth. And the most important thing which I have discussed earlier also on quora is that life does not mean only human beings. There is one more form of life \u201cwater bear\u201d.

A biologist discovers a new species of fern growing on one acre of land on the leeward side of a mountain on Ascension Island. With no other information to go on, how do you calculate the probability that the fern or a close relative also grows somewhere else on earth? There are approximately 3x10^10 acres of land on earth that support life (according to Wikipedia). Doesn\u2019t that make it likely that the fern grows somewhere else? Someone who does not understand biology or ecology would say that it must. But the biologist would probably disagree. He or she understands that unique conditions can exist in one spot on earth, and that it is definitely possible for the fern to exist in one place only. But how can you calculate a probability? It is not enough think about soil and weather. The fern is part of an eco system. Another place may hospitable but contain lizards that eat ferns. I trust astronomers to calculate the number of habitable places in the universe, but without a mechanism for abiogenesis, any calculation of the probability of life is worthless. ",

As amazing as finding Life would be outside of our little planet it would still be kind of expected and would be more of a matter of when not if. Most prominent scientists even believe that we'll find signs of life outside of Earth within 2-3 decades and by that they most likely don't mean little green men but signs of basic microorganism type life living somewhere in our own Solar System. Now, to me the more frightening and scary part is not finding anything at all. Imagine, say 10,000 years into the future where Humanity is a Type II civilization and has colonized other star systems and possibly milky way as well. Yet, even in such advance stage we find absolutely no evidence of any kind of life outside of our own in the observable Universe. What would that mean to us as probability of us being alone in the entire observable Universe is astronomically low... ",

Some galaxies have as many as a trillion stars. We also know that planets exist around at least some of those stars and likely around most of them. Since we know that life exists in the universe, there is every reason to believe that life should have occured on at least some of those multi-billions of other planets. So we can say with a reasonable certainty that life must exist elsewhere. As I said, it is not a proof, but it is a solid inductive argument. ",

Statistically, the odds of there being life elsewhere are so close to 100% that I\u2019d be utterly amazed if life wasn\u2019t present in vast numbers and forms right across the universe. How much of that life is intelligent is of course a different matter, although given that intelligent life has evolved here on Earth, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to suppose it hasn\u2019t evolved elsewhere. We\u2019ve already discovered many thousands of planets orbiting other stars, and a significant number of those planets are in the so-called habitable zone where life (as we know it) could exist. Will we find traces of life, or evidence of the presence of life, on another planet? I\u2019ll be very surprised if we don't. Will we ever be able to communicate with intelligent life from another planet? I\u2019d be amazed if we ever do; the distances and time scales involved are just too vast. ",

In fact I would be surprised if we didn\u2019t find another example of life in our own Solar System, such as on Europa, Enceladus, Titan or even Mars. Whether said life will be more evolved than, say, pond algae is another question. Life on our planet didn\u2019t really get big until about 2/3 of the way through our planet\u2019s lifetime, so there\u2019s no reason to assume it\u2019s likely elsewhere. As for intelligent life, well, intelligence seems to be fairly easy once you get brains (octopuses are intelligent and they\u2019ve been around for 400 million years) but it takes a special combination of things, not all of which we understand, to produce the kind of intelligence that can sit down and write these sorts of things.

Something that is beyond change, is already separate and not born in first place, exists post this change as well. It is beyond change now and always, unaffected by time. Change and time are interdependent. There is no change then there is no time as well. When we observe this timelessness when our body is alive, then it becomes easier to conceive the ever-continuity of consciousness after death too. We, as consciousness are having temporary human existence. Prakash Kushwah's answer to Why does time seem nonexistent when you're sleeping? ",

The is based on P(a|v) = P(a)P(v|a)/P(v) where a is the proposition that conscious life exists in the whole universe, v is the proposition that conscious life exists in the universe we can observe. The logic is the same as with an urn with 87 balls. If we draw a single ball from the urn that is black, what is the probability that at least one other ball in the urn is black? Inflationary Super-Hubble Waves and the Size of the Universe by Thiago S. Pereira,\u2217 and Luis Gustavo T. Silva of the Universidade Estadual de Londrina (Brazil) uses analysis of the CMB (cosmic microwave background) to conclude: Using the recent quadrupole measurement of ESA\u2019s Planck mission, we find that the homogeneous patch of universe is at least 87 times bigger than our visible universe if we accept Planck\u2019s best fit value ns = 0.9624. Disclaimer: The calculated result is based on somewhat rusty recollection of specific Bayesian methodology and rather spurious premises. Anyone interested would be welcome to comment constructively. In any case: the probability 0.011 = (2/87)(1/3)/(2/3). The probability of drawing a black ball from the urn is 0.5012. ",

Oh, and don't forget there are at least a BILLION other galaxies out there. Does life exist out there? Definitely.

One is the theory of primordial seas.  This theory states that, at some time in the formation of the earth, some chemical reaction occurred in the primordial seas which resulted in the evolution of life form. Some scientists think another explanation called: Panspermia theory. This theory states that, life didn't evolve naturally by itself on earth. Instead an asteroid having some type of primal life form, which fell on earth, populated the earth with basic life forms. The life forms evolved on earth. So, if the theory of Panspermia is true, life may exist some where else.  And the first theory may also be true, stating that the life can evolve in planets which have gone through the transformation such as planet Earth. ",

But if that gap required a chemical coincidence on the order of one chance in trillions of trillions of trillions, then we might very well still be alone. ",

This means that there could be millions of other civilisations in our galaxy alone. I recommend watching a couple of videos from the \u2018In A Nutshell\u2019 youtube channel on the Fermi Paradox. It really puts it into perspective. And that\u2019s just intelligent life. There could be life on moons in the Solar System, like Europa, Mimas, Enceladus, Titan and others.

If it\u2019s like Earth, I\u2019d bet money something like us would spring up eventually, if it hasn\u2019t already. The Kepler scope found a crap ton of planets orbiting stars. About 40 million. A lot of them are shit, either burning up or frozen solid or just plain fucking weird, but they say at least 1 in 5 in our galaxy alone are orbiting a star in the habitable zone. And there are millions. The most common type of star is a red dwarf and unfortunately they are a lot weaker but again, I heard something like 10 million are like ours. In that case, I think it\u2019s completely unreasonable to say there is no life out there. At the very least there is microbial life.

There are some exoplanets which are rocky(unlike Jupiter and Saturn which are made of gas) and hence can support life. There are some exoplanets which lie in the goldilocks' zone (at a perfect distance from the sun so that the solvent stays in liquid state). But there are very very few planets which have all the three benefits... And hence the probability of finding life on other planets is very low... But let's hope we find someone out there waiting to be known. ",

Given the vast distances of light years between stars Man has not found or discovered technology to be able to get a glimpse of those Earth like planets. But the Hubble telescope which is powerful is always tuned to find some traces of indications in the universe. By the by the conditions in Mars indicates that possibly there was life on Mars some time ago and got disappeared due to changes its atmosphere. ",

Problem: The problem with life is that it requires many-many-many factors to work perfectly in order to provide the conditions that are suitable for life to exist. Dilemma: The greatest dilemma that I face is defining life itself! You can talk about carbon-based life, but how can you be sure that the life in some other galaxy is carbon-based? This is a very important question. Opinion: Even though the combination of all the needed factors is hard to find, but given the number of planets(and satellites, etc.) in the whole universe, I don\u2019t think it is impossible for life to exist. There is one planet where such conditions exist (Earth), so if it were impossible, then there should not have even a single planet achieving such conditions. ",

Now for existence , every life form needs some energy and for hydrocarbons like us it is practically impossible for any energy to reach us inside of the earth ( our energy source is the mighty sun ) . Sadly for a depth of about 5 kms , there is no energy that the ground can absorb and send to the life form there. Even though the life form may have some sort of water and nutrition with it , but without energy , the water and the nutrition are useless . You can make out the fact by thinking what will happen to you if you just eat and drink but not have any rest ( energy ) then without energy , ( God forbids ) you may even die . So out the three essantials for life , you are having only two and hence your hypothetical life form may just perish . Nevertheless , superb imagination . Best of luck!! ",

Life is an inevitable emergent process that evolves always given the right conditions; (an energy source, a liquid medium presumably and enough time).

Personally, I believe that (just like cells, and humans) humanity and other civilizations also perish.  I believe as we come together as a community, a higher level of intelligence or consciousness will emerge from our interactions.  Perhaps the \"end times\" as have been predicted mark the beginning of a new era.  It will symbolize the birth of our developing society, after which we may be contacted by other developed societies outside our small world. ",

How likely it is that life exists inside of our planet depends on how far inside we are talking. Earthworms are inside of the planet but not so deep compared to the core. I am not sure if some type of weird life might be able to thrive in the core of the Earth though it is highly unlikely anything would. The question is probably asking how likely it is that life exists on another planet besides Earth. If that is what is intended, I would say it is close to a 100% chance that it does.
