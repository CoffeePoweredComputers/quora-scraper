            "answer_text": "My experiences ive had with abuse, trauma, physical and emotional pain is i had to face the \u201cPAIN\" in order to be healthier and move forward mind, body and soul. Its a freedom like you can breathe again. Im not in darkness but in light. Doesn't mean my life is easier. I. In the midst of more than I could realize scary times in my life. It caused me to get sick, weak, lose hope. I have to begin as always to pull myself back together. Realize my past I came threw. I will get threw this also. Easy? No. No. But im a pretty strong individual. Ive my faith. Ive my loves which are my daughter and Grandbabes. I nearly lost for good by the 2 narcissists that triangulated me to the point i was absolutely alone, isolation, loneliness. But she also is a very smart individual. I had to stop defending myself. Causes only more confusion amongst the people who are in the family because of gaslighting. I had to keep faith that somehow she could start to see the truth. I don't expect her to keep these people out of her life because its her father and grandmother. I'll never cross that line. It was the divorce turnout I believe is what truly made her question things. The turnout wasn't in my favor. He walked away with everything he Wanted and I lost everything in 1 day. It traumatized me again. It caused me to shut down completely. Vomiting, lost 10 lbs so far. I can't afford anymore than that. Way to thin. I got 20, 000 a yr . He gets 120,000 a yr plus bonuses and benefits. I lost all my benefits, doctors, can't seem to get medications, have no clue yet my monthly income and enough to move. Still living together divorced. Talk about narcissists control. Mind blowing. He even got my lawyer to feel sorry for him. So he didn't help me at all. Anyways I'm sitting on my bed reading this. Im still no closer than yesterday to answers. Im 59. Im disabled from 4 spine reconstructions. I could go on and on about pain in a person's life. I had to step back. Face what was happening for real, make the choice to move forward and stick with it. Fricken scary. Yes. But if I don't endure the pain I can't get the answers wether good or bad in order to make the choices. Im a huge procrastinator too. I hate facing reality because I've been conditioned to fear. I use to numb myself started at the age of 10. Took me a very long time to stop running. To numb my pain that was emotional turmoil. It just never really helped. So many people do run to push the pain away. I understand this completely. In the long run it only holds you back. Its not the answer. Facing our demons i believe is the only way to finally set yourself free. Its difficult. Its painful. But in my case it was the only way. The only thing that worked. ",

            "answer_text": "It is just the wrong question all together. It is only religion that pushes master purposes on humans. And they do that for control. Not that bad, since most people lack any self control. I think we do not have to teach these myths and superstitions to children. And if no one was exposed to this as children, they would never think of it. In fact, I am sure the way it all got started was invoking some higher ju-ju to threaten children with. So, to your question. Chasing purpose is a dead end. You may make your life purposeful for something, or not. You can certainly have your purpose to be to avoid pain. And that doesn\u2019t have to be your only purpose, does it? But, see? That doesn\u2019t mean it is my purpose, or the mythical Purpose of Life. Trying to force purpose on others is simple tyranny. And I am sure for the most part it is necessary. Trying to say there is divine purpose is sheer guesswork over what was told to children since the dawn of humans. The only question is, will you act purposefully, in the pursuit of your own happiness without harming others? Or are you like that poem in Spanish I learned. I feel like a leave in the wind\u2026..A vague un-ease invades my heart Don\u2019t do that. :) Follow your heart and do something that is meaningful for you. Time is a wasting. ",
