            "answer_text": "Do you mean in a marketing sense, or in a cosmological sense? If marketing, yes, engineered obsolescence is a part of every products life cycle, whether it be from support being discontinued to make way for newer versions all the way to being made from less expensive, shorter lived materials. As to the cosmological, entropy will eventually bring about the heat death of the universe, so in a very real sense, EVERYTHING is made to be broken and eventually will be disintegrated on even the atomic level.

            "answer_text": "I think everything is made to be renewed. Just like nature undergoes renewal, so do most other things - countries, governments, companies, etc. When things remain forever, they stagnate and fossilize. They stop adapting and evolving. They become \u2018anachronisms\u2019. They lose value and respect. We, too, as humans, must constantly renew ourselves. We must continuously learn, be flexible, allow our brains to be plastic, constantly evolve with the changing world around us. ",
