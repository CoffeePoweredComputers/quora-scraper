            "answer_text": "I would be very skeptical about this as a parent. There is no reason for a 17 year old boy who is full of hormones to be hanging out with a developing 12 year old girl. I understand that some kids develop slower especially if they are autistic which makes it harder for them to make friends in their own age group, but if he is going to be friends with a young girl it has to be monitored by both parents of the little girl and the sons parents. Don't give them a chance to be alone together, don't give him a chance to be falsely accused of anything by the family of the girl or the girl herself. Be very cautious is all I can say. This girl is probably infatuated with him and is being lead to believe that perhaps he feels a certain way about her and she might feel obligated to show her affection by being close to him. Remember that most teens see their friends with a car or sometimes an apartment or some form of freedom that they wish they had and this can have an effect on them. It shows that they got things together, that they are cool and have so much freedom that their Friends wish they could have. This can lead to them looking for a reason to leave the house and start breaking rules. Ideas in the brain of a teenager seems like great ideas at the time. I know this because I was a teen once as well. When I had my first car, everyone wanted to ride with me. When I had my own apartment everyone ran away from home to come hang out with me and my unlimited amount of freedom I had. It got to the point that I thought I was hot shit and I was just the popular guy that everyone envied. It also lead to alcohol and drug abuse as well as fights and laws being broken. It's a slippery slope when it comes to teenagers and it's best to be weary of their motives and groups of friends they choose rather than regret it later. Everyone knows that after hanging out with someone for long enough one of two things will happen. One, you either start to get annoyed with that person and want a break from them, or two, you begin to grow a liking and possible attraction for that person and try to be around them more. This is especially true when it comes to boys and girls being Friends with one another. So is this girl always wanting to hang around him or is it him always wanting to hang around her? Either way I think it's best to sit him or her down with the parents and discuss things so it doesn't look bad and precautions are taken. Not saying something bad will happen but if you could prevent a false allegation from an attached girl wouldn't you want to? ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer \u201cNo, friendship is something beautiful, regardless of the ages and genders of the people concerned.\u201d Longer answer What do you mean by \u201cfriends\u201d? If they are literally just friends, i.e. with no romantic or sexual aspect to the relationship then all is good \u2014 she can learn a lot from an older friend. If this is a romantic relationship I\u2019d be more cautious \u2014 there is a big difference in maturity between 17 and 12, and even the kindest, most responsible older boy could be tempted to take advantage of that to get the girl to go further sexually than she was ready for. Basically, it all depends on the nature of the friendship and what you know about your son and his friend \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to give you a good answer without knowing more. My daughter is now 18, but if she\u2019d had a 17-year-old male friend when she was 12 I would just have wanted to know who he was, meet him and know what kind of relationship they had. I would have started from the assumption that all was OK. She\u2019s always had male friends, and we\u2019ve encouraged that, but they\u2019ve always been her age. FWIW I had my first boyfriend when I was 14 and he was 17. A smaller gap than in your son\u2019s case, but still enough to raise eyebrows among our friends. Interestingly, our parents didn\u2019t express any concerns, but that might have been because the two families already knew each other quite well before we started dating. And it worked out fine. Didn\u2019t last, of course, but was great while it did :-) ",
