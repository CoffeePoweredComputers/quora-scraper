            "answer_text": "Interesting that all the answers so far do not in any way reflect what sociopaths themselves have had to say about this. They say that they indeed can. I am more inclined to believe their personal experience than conjecture. Athena Walker's answer to Can a sociopath love? Sociopaths can yes. Here I will insert a brief description of sociopathy that will then assist with the rest of the answer. Athena Walker's answer to Is it true that sociopaths don\u2019t lack empathy but lacks remorse and guilt? I read it somewhere in sociopathworld.com. Sociopaths do not have an absolute lack of empathy. However, this is not an AHA!! moment where you can say, I KNEW IT!! They just don\u2019t want to be nice people. Those wily bastards!! Okay, in fairness I have no idea if you thought that at all, but someone reading this might, so, you know, disclaimer. What it means is this. As sociopaths have the neural map of a neurotypical person in an fMRI machine, they are not lacking in, nor do they have differences in the brain that are apparent as psychopaths do, they have the grey matter necessary to experience what empathy is. Here is the massive difference from neurotypical responses, from sociopathic ones. When the sociopathy is formed, the person experiencing whatever the causative agent is tends to shut off their access to the emotions like affection, desire for attention, empathy, anything that would make them outwardly dependent and turn insularly. While the pathways are still there, they are no longer used. Think of it this way. If you have a child that you never speak to, the neurons of the brain responsible for language get pruned away. The less experience with it, the more stunted the ability to learn language becomes. Often this is irreversible. The child will have difficulty with communication for the rest of their life assuming that their lack of exposure to language was chronic and ongoing. Apply this lesson to sociopathy and what they are cutting themselves off from. The neurons that are responsible for bonding, empathy, affection, love, are pruned away. They have the pathways, but instead of a eight lane highway, they now have a two way, single lane, mountain pass. It\u2019s treacherous and unpredictable. You have no idea what is going to successfully traverse this pass, and what is going over the edge, never to be seen again. The ability for empathy is there. The communication of it however is not like a neurotypical person. It\u2019s difficult to navigate and get through from origin to manifestation. Also, it doesn\u2019t necessarily trigger for a person. It is just as likely, if not more so in some cases, for it to trigger for a character in a book over a live person. The character in the book, or perhaps a movie, has no actual impact on the sociopath\u2019s life. They cannot cause them harm in any way. There is a safety to that person being locked away on paper, or behind a glass screen. They can allow themselves to experience that person\u2019s life more fully and without reservation because it\u2019s separate. While they look fully capable on brain scans, and in some instances in their life, it would be a mistake to assume that this means that empathy is an emotion that is at their fingertips that they are ignoring. There is a much larger picture at work. Okay, now that you have a working understanding of the brain of a sociopath, yup, replace love with empathy, it is possible. It\u2019s not always available, it\u2019s not always deep, sometimes it\u2019s very deep, it depends. Sociopathy is a very complex condition. It\u2019s not a straight forward, they have no empathy and are demons kind of condition, like many people would like to have them defined as. Two great answers on this were provided by Quora writer Corey Reaux-Savonte. Corey Reaux-Savonte's answer to What is a sociopath? Corey Reaux-Savonte's answer to Could a sociopath stay loyal in a relationship? I highly recommend them both. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, in short, yea, a sociopath can genuinely love anyone they can bond with. However, I'm not sure either of you are sociopaths. You seem to be following the media's vision of a sociopath rather than understanding what a sociopath actually is. Reading people as a skill is a psychopathic trait. Sociopaths don't really do it any better than normal people unless they've practised it.Sociopaths experience emotion. We are lacking in empathy. You stating multiple times that you have never felt emotion before is completely unbelievable - unless you are brain damaged.Society as a boring burden - a burden on what? What would make them exciting? Not a HFS trait. We accept the world for what it is - boring and exciting people included.Superiority Complex - Nothing to do with sociopathy, especially a high functioning one. HFSs - even when we know we are smart - know we are not the smartest people in the world and don't feel like everyone else is below is. That attitude is detrimental to objective living because you will go into situations always thinking you can't be beaten. That's a bad move. More an indicator of NPD than sociopathy.High IQ doesn't make you a HFS. Function level is about how well you can control the characteristics of your pathology, regardless of how smart you are. A HFS can have an average IQ. Also, though this is a level of narcissism that a sociopath can have, when combined with the above point it's looking more and more like NPD.Manipulative - people in general are manipulative and you never gave any specific detail so it can't be judged.Faking emotions and expressions - psychopath not sociopath.So, can two sociopaths love each other? Yea, but it doesn't seem like you are them, based on what you've written. If everything you say is true, you just seem like desensitized, narcissistic misanthropes, or would it be desensitized, misanthropic narcissists? Whichever is of a greater presence in you is the one that should appear last. Anyway, I would assume two of those could love each other - as long as one doesn't start hating the other. Anyone can love anyone under the right conditions. Making it work, however, is a completely different story. ",

I don\u2019t feel anything towards the people I date or am in a relationship with. I select them because of their looks, then I charm them, and fuck them stupid. I break up with them out of nowhere and don\u2019t give a good reason for doing so. It breaks them.  I think I\u2019ve only experienced emotional love with a single person. It wasn\u2019t the typical type of love, though. In a way, it was very childish. I care about them and wanted to help and protect them. They are my favorite thing. I care about them the way a toddler might care about a toy they have. I don\u2019t like people messing with my things. Around 17 I was curious if I really cared for this person. I would make up scenarios in my mind to see how I would react if something bad happened to them. I imagined them being bullied. It ruffled my feathers. I was a little irritated. I imagined them emotionally broken. I didn\u2019t like that. Lastly, I imagined something awful. (I\u2019m not gonna type it out.) The make believe scenario in my head was enough for me to experience the most intense rage I\u2019ve ever felt. I felt my body heat up from anger. I could hear my heart pumping loudly in my ears and feel an insane amount of adrenaline coursing through my body. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it before. It took a while for me to calm down. It took 30 minutes, if I remember correctly.  It\u2019s an extremely possessive type of love, if you can even call it that. ",

            "answer_text": "No no and no I don't care what your scientific explanation is for this . A social path is not capable of truly feeling emotions of love . They can share a bond with someone but even then it's for personal reasons that has nothing to do with pure selfless love. Social paths look at relationships or people as more of an investment than anything. Social paths are able to feel attraction Wich can sometimes be mistaken for love but once there need is no longer being met or the relationship is considered inappropriate then these feelings can change very suddenly. A social path can be very helpful I don't know why? But a since or duty to be as helpful as possible is there. Also they are resilient because most of the time they don't take you personally at all so forgiveness is not a problem or holding grudges from something that someone may have done years ago doesn't happen. The moment the problem is over with so are any feelings torwards it. Social paths are not evil people nor are they always predators. If someone is mentally mature then there is not much problems that a social path is interested in causing and also they love to get an adrenaline rush from doing something daring it's the only thing sometimes that makes them feel really alive and is raw emotion . Also they can be very antisocial or the exact opposite eighter way some can be very pleasant people to be around without going through the moodswings or emotional rollercoaster never knowing exactly who they maybe tomorrow there moods are pretty stable . It's just that if you ask them how they are feeling you will have to pick up the chart at the doctors office with all of the face expressions on it because most of the time they don't know how they feel or it's just nothing I call it peaceful . Now for some who are obsessed with becoming a robot or obsessed with perfection it's best to be original and try to be the best you. Otherwise, you can end up ruining your life and others simply wanting to be something that your not . Its not all as it's cracked up to be anyway being able to relate more to people is a better trait to have because understanding where a person is coming from is the best way to help them. It can make you feel powerless or useless if someone comes to you for help and you have nothing to offer them but trying be as concerned as you are able to be but not knowing exactly how to show this so the best you can offer is some money or a hug. Other than that you can do nothing for thier emotional well being and people really need that . Oh, did anyone know that there is a cure for being a social path? It's called the the love of God it works I am a witness. ",

            "answer_text": "Thoughts from a married sociopath. These Are the 7 Types of Love Everyone seems to be hankering after romantic love, but few of us realize that far from being timeless and universal, romantic love is in fact a modern construct, one that emerged in tandem with the novel. The article briefly describes the seven types of love. Despite what many have stated, I believe most, if not all, sociopaths have the capacity to love. Briefly glossing over many of the answers that sociopaths have written, there is this theme among many that state, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can fall in love.\u201d. Interesting. This to me seems to highlight the trust issues that many a sociopath have. The ones who said I don\u2019t think are not willing to risk it, so therefore they say no way, I can\u2019t do it. Self-limiting, I suppose. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u201d is not the same as I can\u2019t; it\u2019s a conscious choice one makes. As for me, I am learning to love. The Eros type love, romantic type love, is what I think this question is aimed at. At any rate, that type of love falls off as a couple spends any significant length of time together, usually greater than about two years. It\u2019s similar to the shiny, new object syndrome that loses its luster, so to speak. (Avoid Shiny Object Syndrome in Your Relationship) So it is with Eros love. For me, I\u2019ve never been romantic. I have always been highly sexually attracted toward my wife. Compliments paid to her physical beauty. And so on. But not the dope who sprinkles rose pedals on the floor and candles everywhere. Too much wasted time and someone has to pick that shit up after, is how I see it. A waste. It doesn\u2019t makes sense to me. But does that mean we can\u2019t share a moment watching a sunset or some shit like that? Not my cup of tea, but willing to do it for her. Isn\u2019t that love? Sacrificing for the other person. So out with the Eros love. Next up is the practical love. This called Pragma love: Pragma is a kind of practical love founded on reason or duty and one\u2019s longer-term interests. Sexual attraction takes a back seat in favour of personal qualities and compatibilities, shared goals, and making it work This is the type of love that I have always had for my wife. It\u2019s the type I will always have for my wife. Since I am selfish, sexual attraction does not take a back seat. It has, is, and will remain prominent. Pragma is the type of love that all successful relationships will be based on: long-term, shared goals, and making it work. The pre-determination to stick it out. Sociopaths can and have the capability to display and honor this type of love. The short-sightedness, impulsive, and immediate gratification we seek may challenge this type of practical love, but if one can display impulse control this practical love can be held intact and lead to a lasting relationship. Again, this is love. I\u2019ve been with my wife 20 years, married 18. Not all glorious, as it is expected when one is of my type. I\u2019ve experienced the Eros love (diminished intensity) in conjunction with pragma love. But what I have really learned over the last 5\u20136 years and am continuing to learn is how to love my wife the way she wants to be loved. How to give up my selfish tendencies to accommodate her needs. It comes back to control and trust. I have a very difficult time giving those things up. As I learn to rely on her and give trust and control over to her, it allows me to bond more with her. Admittedly, this is very, very difficult to do. I still think crooked thoughts despite zero reasons to. It\u2019s me and my world that I am projecting on to the relationship, not her. I think this is where many sociopaths think, \u201cScrew this, it\u2019s getting too close, I\u2019m out. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d. I have joked in the past that if she betrayed I would ____ her. The ultimate betrayal would hurt deeply. It wouldn\u2019t end me. It would likely kill off what traces of hope I have left in humanity. Can a sociopath love? I think this picture says it all.  The branch represents our pruned pro social emotional neural pathways. The bloom represents our capacity for love should we place ourselves in the right situation, with the right person, and give our relationship the right attention it deserves. The capacity is there. We are human. The better question is: will a sociopath place themselves in a (vulnerable) position to find and cultivate love? It\u2019s taken me many years to learn the love. Pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t be ready to do this again any time soon should I become single once again. Yet, the capacity is there, so who knows? I will say having a life partner who understands you beats dating and banging chicks that you know won\u2019t be around or that you don\u2019t intend to keep around. So we can love so long as we choose to love. ",

If a sociopath feels like you are convenient in their life and that you can help them achieve some purpose ( perhaps a family or a a stability for the external world to be fooled into thinking sociopaths are like them) than yeah sure, you can become a sociopath\u2019s favorite toy. Sociopath are generally very intense and passionate and if they really want you (\u201clove you\u201d) they can even show possessivity over Their object of desire. But, would that be enough if you are an empath ? Maybe it will, maybe it wont . For an empath, love is often seen as a \u201cfeeling\" of perpetual kindness showned by proofs of constant devotion, understanding and compassion and they surely take great pleasure in that. An empath would have no problem denying his/her needs for their loved ones if they feel this could make the other person happy. Empaths find great satisfaction and confort into making sure their \u201cloved ones\u201d are satisfied and it's what feeds them and make them feel the love connections Of course, they are sociopaths that will desire an empath so much or see them truelly benificial in their lives to keep playing the game of \u201clove according to an empath\" until somethings goes \u201cwrong\" and sometimes it doesnt. Or perhaps an empath will be satisfied with the knowledge that he/she is the sociopath's favorite toy and will accept the sociopath for what he/she is but that is of course a rarity since most empaths wont acknowledge lest accept a sociopath\u2019 s true nature and a sociopath will rarely show or reveal his true self looking for \u201cacceptance\u201d from an empath when in his/her mind, it\u2019s the empath that is deranged, way too emotional, easily manipulated and most importantly, disposible and replacable.

            "answer_text": "All of the research I\u2019ve done on says no. My latest partner was a sociopath, she never ever said she loved me, she instead said she loved me too, she was only ever reactive, she copied me, believing that it was what I wanted or needed to hear without knowing for certain. When we broke up, soon after she told me she never loved me, and this was despite the fact we were together for 13 years and had three children. I never felt loved by her, entrapped by her instead. She left me soon after I paid her gambling debt, and told her I never would again, I had served my purpose then. Sociopaths are incapable of loving, but dangerously capable of being loved. They are the master of con. When we were a family she was an uncaring mother, she had an addiction that was a greater priority to. I was the opposite, I cared about my children, and taught them respect. Eight years ago my sociopath ex told the law I was a safety risk to my children, the law believed her, the law was conned by her. The law gave her sole custody of our children. My children were respectful, now eight years on, and living with a disrespectful parent, they have now naturally become like her. Who was only ever going to be the real risk to my children? My sociopath ex has divided my children and me, they want contact with me, but only under their now new disrespectful terms with me, it\u2019s like dealing with their mother again times three, sadly for now it ain\u2019t going to happen.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if i\u2019m truly capable of feeling love because I see how different others are when they are in love or how they love family members. I am however very possessive and protective over the ones I value in life. Like my mother for instance. I can like someone though. How do I know i\u2019m different from normal people loving another human being? I just don\u2019t understand why people do things they normally wouldn\u2019t do when they are in love with someone or why they would stay in a abusive relationship just because they\u2019re in love. I can\u2019t comprehend the feeling of giving everything you have to someone else because you love them so much, while suffering from it in the progress. Why do people think they can change a person just because they love them? I act on logic rather than emotion and I know and see that people are not able to do that when in love or when any other strong emotion come into play. The only reason I stayed in my previous relationship was for my own personal gain. I liked him in the beginning but he was disappointing. When I no longer have any interest in a person, I just become cold and distant. I stayed with him longer than necessary because of two things; the regular sex was convenient and because I wanted to actually hurt him. Not physically but mentally. Especially when I found out he cheated. And then lied about it. It was entertaining to watch him try and convince me he didn\u2019t do it. He actually cried and begged me to trust him at one point because I kept pushing the issue. Later, his best friend told me he not only cheated on me once but twice. With the ex girlfriend of the best friend. How his best friend was able to stay friends with him, I have no clue. I am loyal to my friends and I don\u2019t accept disloyalty. Back to the point. Was I hurt by this? No. Did I care? No. Did I like him? In the beginning, yes. But the feeling of liking him changed immediately when he showed signs I didn\u2019t like. ",

            "answer_text": "To a certain extent. Sociopaths can only true love themselves, no matter who they bond with. Once a sociopath has allowed themselves to bond with someone they feel an adoration with that person mainly because said person might know and accept the sociopath for what they are which increases the sociopath's interest in the person because they can finally be who they really are instead of being someone they aren't. Though the person who is with the sociopath must understand that once they have bonded with that means that their beloved socio will hold back nothing and will tell them the hard truth, which they will expect their boyfriend/girlfriend to do to them. The Moment you lie to a sociopath then everything is over. A sociopath who has bonded will try their best not to lie to the person they like and would hope the person doesn't lie to them in return. In the sociopath's eyes once you have lied about something small then eventually you will lie about something big and they just can't have that so they get rid of you in a flash. Long story short, yes they can love but it ain't the whole 100% chemical love neurotypical people feel. They may want you but they will never need you, they can always find another you but you will never find another one of them. ",

Yes; we can. With the right person who can accept us and we can be honest with. Other psychopaths or sociopaths don't always make the best partners but some unique individuals can be the best thing for you. All depends. I have loved before. I've tried to be honest in all relationships although unfortunately with regards to the neurotypical sort that makes it far more likely to fail than if you lie and just go along with it. But if you lie it'll last longer and consequently be miserable and seem to be an utter farce and you will abuse or use them at some point because of it. It's work no matter what, especially at first. I don't trust anyone. I don't bond easily at all. So if I love someone they have an undying loyalty. My feelings fade very quickly with everything but from love specifically and I've only felt it for one relationship so far. I definitely think I love in my own way. Feelings are complicated for everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "That is an interesting question. Sociopaths typically lack empathy, which is at least one of the prerequisites for a loving relationship. Real attachments are difficult for them since they tend not to have the same range of emotion as someone who is \u201cneurotypical\u201d. Sociopaths are mostly quite self-aware and many suffer with the awareness that they will never feel the intense loving emotions that other people feel. I would think a sociopath could form bonds with someone who shared the same views and goals, and he/she might be quite protective and committed, but for reasons different than love and caring. The relationship might be otherwise beneficial, as in shared income, regular sex, someone to talk to; or the sociopath may want or need the appearance of normalcy for some reason. Statistically, sociopaths do not tend to form successful, loving, long-term relationships. But all sociopaths, now and forever more? I don\u2019t know. I would like to hear from someone who identifies as a sociopath and who may have done some research on this topic. *Please note I am not a doctor. My views are based on personal experience and informal research. ",

A sociopath will use the term love with ease but no true understanding of what loving someone really means and they will express thier own version of love in the form of fascination and see it as tool for manipulation and a way to gain power rather than as a deep felt emotion. Any deep emotional connection with a partner and expression of love are not meant with any heartfelt genuineness as much as they will act in a way that seems to do so. ensuring thier own needs are satisfied and they get out of the relationship what they want is priority as they play their own version of the game of life which they always ensure that there is only ever one outright winner - them. My Sister was in love with a Sociopath. She had the best times with him so forgave his poor displays of behavior when the mask slipped on occasions but inevitably she has to put an end to the relationship when she realised that his version of expressing love failed to resonate her past experience of feeling loved. Fortunatly was able to step back and see the bigger picture, pinpoint the behavior traits pointing to that of a sociopath and get out before she was in a sociopath's manipulative spin. She looks back on that 2 year relationship with a sense of realization that he didn't stop loving her\u2026he never actually ever truly loved her as he wasnt capable of loving anyone and the closest he got to loving with emotional feeling was the love he had for his sociopathic self.

We typically have a select few people we \u201ccare\u201d about, for all intents and purposes; but very few people on this earth, will we ever truly love.

Like, snoring and other quirks, behavioral traits. I didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me at first. I thought I was losing my mind ha ha. Took me about a year or so to figure out that I had felt love for another being, who was not my offspring. That is still the only thing I can account it to. I am pretty certain it is love, and here is my line of reasoning. When I look at my son, I feel an intense sensation in my chest - I feel this same sensation for my fianc\u00e9. Something I have not felt since I was a small child\u2026.and never for anyone outside of my own relations. That\u2019s not to suggest I couldn\u2019t drop him in a heartbeat, were I to find it to be necessary; and completely shut down anything I may think I feel for him. ",

Our brains aren't wired to not feel it like those of psychopaths, it's just way harder. We surely do not jump from one love to another, we may jump from woman to woman which is something I've actually never done but love is a very rare occurrence for those of us that actually felt it. We do have the same love people have once the whooo I'm in love phase is over although we have a way easier time moving on so long as we stop obsessing. Unlike what people think we are not jealous, our love looks very pure when we actually do love so if we love you, you will know by the remarkable difference in treatment we give you compared to everybody else. If you have doubts you are either blind or we don't love you, at most we just care about you, meaning we want you and need you. Ever heard the song \u201cTwo out of three ain't bad\u201d? That pretty much covers it most of the times. ",

Lowered sympathy and empathy can be the result of depression, trauma, and even taught but being born without the ability to have sympathy or empathy is a sociopath. To love requires sympathy and empathy. A sociopath objectifies everyone and everything. Love can be felt as in \u201cI love my car\u201d but not the kind of love that typically parents feel for their newborn baby - an unconditional love. A sociopath\u2019s love always has strings attached. Having what people call a \u201cconscious\u201d also requires sympathy and empathy so don\u2019t expect a sociopath to feel bad about their actions. A sociopath feels bad about consequences, not actions. Lastly, a sociopath will say they feel love because they do know one kind of love and aren\u2019t aware there is anything else. It is like the saying \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Never actually in love. One can enjoy someones company, or even genuinely respect someone. However, that\u2019s pretty minimal. I respected one of my old friends and I could still quite easily exploit, use or leave them if I for whatever reason felt like it. In fact, I did all of those things, yet I still did respect him for the most part. So it\u2019s very weak. At most, a sociopath could have their own version of it. A basic \u2018You give me what I want I will give you what you want\u2019 thing would be applied in some of their relationships. That can seem like love to the other person, and to the sociopath it pretty much is since it\u2019s still more than they give others and it can look just like traditional love. So, the chemical won\u2019t be there telling them what to feel, but, they can make a concious choice to treat the person as a lover would treat someone. This, in my view, is more reliable than actual love, since it\u2019s very black and white and easy to navigate, less unpredictability, more direct and each person would usually be content within it moreso than the \u2018whirlwind\u2019 that people describe real love as.

One things for sure is that a sociopaths \u201clove\u201d will not be the same as a NTs. I personally have never felt any true romantic feelings for another. But that doesn't mean I am not capable. I have just never stumbled upon someone worth my time. Someone I could enjoy a long term relationship with. I have been in short term relationships that usually ended because 1. I was emotionally unresponsive to their strong emotional needs. I would dismiss it and pretty much tell them to suck it up (after my failed attempts to comfort). The second is, well, they were WAY too emotional for me. And I don't mean the usual emotions that burden people. I'm talking over sensitivity. Crying over the simplest things everyday. If I happened to get romantically envolved with another who I actually like, then I will take care of them, be loyal, respect their personal space, tend to their needs, the whole shebang. I have gotten better at the whole emotionally comforting thing so that's a plus. ",

My daughter has always been a s Confident, intelligent, outspoken young lady, but not anymore. I have tried talking to her about it, but, in her eyes, he can do no wrong, so I've given up trying to get her to understand the effects he's facilitated. I am afraid for her safety.

What I mean by that is, you can become so close to someone that you'd really not like to think about them not being there (emotional) and you can realise cognitively why someone is so compatible with you for whatever reasons (state of mind). Love for us may not be the same as what neurotypicals feel but it is still love nonetheless. Have I experienced it? Not in a romantic sense but I have love for my closest friend. I don't doubt that I can feel romantic love either but I've yet to meet someone that's worth it. It's just as subjective as with neurotypicals, some of them may be very loving and others may not. It's harder for us to get to that point of being in love but it's certainly not impossible. ",

They are able to develop a bond with that person and, to a certain extent, care for them. They become obsessed with the individual, and be extremely territorial. Plenty of these questions have already been answered by others more qualified than me. Corey (I hope I spelled your first name right) being one. Anyway, sociopaths can love, it's just different. In a lot of cases, it's unhealthy to the person they are in love with simply because of the nature of sociopaths. ",

However, as I said in an answer I'm too lazy to link here, there are people I respect and I like to pass time with. Funny, interesting, open minded people who benefit me. What I noticed about love is that it is something unconditional, a person in love is willing to sacrifice something for another person. I would never do that, I'm the most important person for myself, end of the story. About commitment, yes, sure, as long as it isn't boring or annoying. I didn't experience it either tho, my last relationship didn't last long, but I know it's possible anyway. If I can be myself with someone in a give and take relationship that benefits both partners who respect each other, have fun, start interesting conversations and share information, why not? ",

It is merely a tool they can mimic and use to exploit others for their own benefits. Sociopaths do not admire, love, or like any sort of people\u2026 They merely tolerate people at best. The more severe the sociopathy in an individual, the more nonexistent the emotion of love becomes. There are exeptions when a sociopath does develope love for another (lover or inner circle friend). If someone manages to make a sociopath care for them in a living sort of matter, then they must be an incredibly special person to make a sociopath love them. ",

Lets also say that half are high-functioning and the other half is low functioning. For the purposes of this answer, I'm just estimating, I don't have actual numbers. So 1 in 50 people you meet is a high-functioning sociopath. Lets also assume that 1 out of 100 sociopaths can bond with you, bonding is a rare experience and some never do. The chance to find a high-functioning sociopath who can bond with you is around 0.0002%. Add in the possibility that this may be a person you don't like it would never consider dating. If you found yourself an actual sociopath fitting these descriptions, you've hit a really tiny fucking probability. Ultimately, it doesn't matter. Date who you'll date, it makes no difference, its just unlikely you'll be in a position to have a relationship with a sociopath. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, most will never feel the chemical love that others feel. They can take an extreme interest in a person and eventually marry (Yes I have seen that happen) And even so, the relationship can end suddenly when something we/they don\u2019t happens. For example since this is hard to explain: I dated a guy for about two years but I was highly into manipulative behaviors(Lots of sociopaths may not be, depends on the diagnosis. It\u2019s more commonly a psychopath thing) so I would control his emotions by making him pity or cause anger then calm him down, it gave him a weird sense of trust but I took such an interest in him for how he thought and behaved I stayed with him for a long time never boring. Now, as a Sociopath I never talked much or engaged in any care for a conversation that I wasn\u2019t interested in. I never felt bad for him when he would be suicidal, when he was asking for pity and other things I was right away disinterested and I left within a day. So in summary I believe that love for Sociopaths just will never be what you see in others that do not have Sociopaths behaviors. It is more interest so love may be too strong of a word. EDIT: This is just my experience, it may be different for others. ",

I guess if there was a high functioning sociopath who has a switching mechanism that wanted to love, he could, but I heard of no such case personally.

A sociopath falls in interest with someone. While they do fall and fall hard for some people, it\u2019s less love and more fascination coupled with fondness. Their devotion to this person is unmatched. They will sacrifice anyone and anything to make that person happy (with the exception of their own happiness, of course). They want that person\u2019s happiness as much as their own and they will continue to adore that person until that person betrays them. It may not be love as the romantics would have it and it may not be true empathy in the sense that they don\u2019t feel your feelings as though they were their own, but it is, in every respect, very much a type of love.

I seriously struggled with this because I have certain traits that correspond with being a sociopath but I genuinely care about some people like my children and my grandson. I, like many others, get upset when something doesn't go my way but I recover and move on. However, I have never truly been in love. ",

I reject the notion that they have a little bit of empathy and that it is selective. If a person has no conscience, it is impossible to have empathy. If a person disconnects spiritually from other conscious being, which is what a person does when they deaden their conscience, then there is no love and thus no feeling for others. There is no capacity for love in any way. So no, a sociopath cannot love. ",
