            "answer_text": "Until this question, I have always stood by the belief that, no you cannot love without respecting. It is an interesting turnout that I am now reevaluating this into a more flexible form of no. I understand you are looking for a firm answer- however, when it comes to complicated ground that adults and children stand on together, the answer is based more on the overall growth mentally/emotionally. In adults respect is a crucial part in love. Without it, much like hope and faith, it adds doubt and more destruction because it is shown less verbally than gestures. As we all know the saying, \u201cPay closer attention to actions- not so much words\" because trust had been compromised often enough, we are used to it looki g for other signs of truth. When I think of respect, I think of acceptance. Sure we differ strongly, but you accept that thought or action outside of your own square of morals and courage. You treat me as if I have the right to go a separate way than you because of how I may have been raised, or what the ease or hardship I must of encountered to act out or speak up. When I think of respect, I think of compassion.Knowlege. invitation into the part of you that would make a positive change in you mentally. Even if it's just for a few moments,that you are locked on that greater good of someone and wish to become it yourself. It is kind of hard to be absent of all this, and feel love toward someone. Respect is earned, but\u2026 doesn't the person you enjoy being accompanie by----deserve it? Already earned it in some way? As for children, they have a more shallow way of thinking. They are in their learning stages of respect and occasionally will do it and not notice it. Children have the ability to love without respect, because the corruption of adolescent and adulthood has not altered their brain yet into thinking selfishly. Not intentionally, at least. They don't have respect pre installed. However, their words or actions are great examples of what respect is. It\u2019s interesting to see a child act selfish at times, but isn't because though everything is about themselves, they are learning that acceptance, compassion and knowlege with other people is equally important. Children learn love by actions. They see someone be nice, they learn to be nice. When they see a bully, they feel bad for both the bully and the victim. Respect is an action they understand as they grow and are more exposed to different people and different mentality stages. Whether they apply it afterward is up to them, but as adults, respect is what we teach them-sometimes even through disrespecting. ",
