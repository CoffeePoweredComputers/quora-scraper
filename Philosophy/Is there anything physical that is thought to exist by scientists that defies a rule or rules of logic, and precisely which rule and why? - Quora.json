            "answer_text": "Of course not. Physical things are a different domain from logic. Logic (and its offspring, mathematics) says that from things like \u201cA implies B\u201d and \u201cB implies C\u201d we can deduce that \u201cA implies C\u201d. At one level these are simply axioms and manipulations of symbols with no connection to the physical world. Sometimes (very often actually) we use models to map logic onto the physical world. For example we might model gravity with a three dimensional vector field. If that works, great. If it doesn\u2019t then its the model that is wrong - we haven\u2019t \u201cdefied logic\u201d (whatever that might mean). When the physical world turned out not to match 3-D gravity, scientists recognised that Newton\u2019s gravity needed to be amended but not that there was any problem with \u201clogic\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum entanglement, and the double-slit experiment challenge the idea that prediction can be made on a deterministic basis. In my view, the lack of knowledge of primary causes makes the use of statistical bases necessary at the moment. On a much grander scale, we know there is life, but we have not figured out why. Gravity is associated with mass, but the association is not understood, or whether mass causes gravity or something about the force of gravity causes materials to have mass. ",
