            "answer_text": "Hi there, I guess this is one of the most widespread questions doing rounds of the data driven world. And why not -- with so many books available both off line and online \u2013 one could easily get spoiled for choices. But worry not, as I will share some of the best books, which were recommended to me by my seniors when I was starting out my data science career and then few of them were suggested when I was working as a junior data scientist in a firm. So without a further ado\u2026 here\u2019s my list of best books that you should start reading!  Some books for aspiring data science professionals or beginners \u2013 The Data Science Handbook: Advice and Insights from 25 Amazing Data Scientists by Carl Shan, William Chen, Henry Wang, and Max SongDoing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel SchuttData Science for Dummies by Lillian PiersonThe Art of Data Science by Roger D. Peng and Elizabeth MatsuiNumsense! Data Science for the Layman: No Math Added by Annalyn Ng and Kenneth SooWhile there are numerous other books for beginners the above-mentioned books would help you prepare for your data science journey. Now I will share some of the books that could be considered as classics in the world of data science. Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data by Charles WheelanPractical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python by Peter Bruce, Andrew Bruce, Peter GedeckPractical Data Science with R by Nina ZumelPattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. BishopDeep Learning with Python by Fran\u00e7ois CholletSome other books (for both beginners and seasoned professionals) that you could read include \u2013 Data Science and Big Data Analytics: Discovering, Analyzing, Visualizing, and Presenting Data by John Wiley & SonsBayesian Methods for Hackers: Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference by Cam Davidson-PilonDesigning Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems by Martin KleppmannThese are some of the best books that are available in the market about Data Science. I hope you would enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed reading them. ",
