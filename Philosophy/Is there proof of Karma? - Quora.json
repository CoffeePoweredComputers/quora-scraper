            "answer_text": "Not just proof, I can tell you a chronology of how Karma works, sometimes in brutal ways. Note: Purely historical stuffs. So if you are somebody who prefers reading short stuffs, then this answer will be seriously boring and long, so you can skip it if you want to. . . . Okay, assume you like history, let\u2019s learn about a nation in our neighbourhood, called Afghanistan.  Somewhere in 1970s, Afghanistan was a kingdom, ruled by one man called King Zahir Shah-  Zahir Shah around that time was trying every attempt to let Afghanistan evolve into a modern society, advocating industrialization, democracy, women\u2019s rights and so on. He even brought in a law, saying that people belinging to royal family won\u2019t be allowed to take part in electoral process. Benevolent king, right? But then, such benevolent men are bound to have enemies. One such enemy was the country\u2019s Prime Minister and by relation the King\u2019s first cousin, Mohammed Daoud Khan-  The king and Daoud had several issues between them, one particularly was how Daoud was an open supporter of Pashtun nationalism in places which were in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. This created severe issues between not just Afghanistan and Pakistan, but also several other ethnic groups within Afghanistan. One of Daoud\u2019s acts of trying to attack Pakistan became the reason for the King to make him resign forcefully. So, what happened? The King once went to Italy for getting an eye surgery done. Seeing the opportunity, Daoud and a general he picked up himself, conducted a bloodless coup and overthrew the government. Daoud declared Afghanistan a republic, and he became the first President. Daoud and that general weren\u2019t alone. A lot of detractors of the king played a role in this, one of whom happened to the People\u2019s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (better known as PDPA), the communist party of Afghanistan. Many of his supporters, including the folks of PDPA, were rewarded with government positions after the republic got proclaimed. Well, now things become exciting. Daoud Khan in his early days kind of was okay, but with passage of time, the man started to target anybody whom he happened to see as a possible person trying to remove him. This included even likes of PDPA. At a time when a prominent PDPA member died under mysterious circumstances and his funeral saw protests by PDPA members against Daoud, all whom were arrested later, it became evident that Daoud seriously wants to get rid of his opponents. On 27th April, some folks of Kabul claimed to see a tank column heading for the city,and some men in army uniform guarding government buildings . Later on in afternoon, two Sukhoi-7 started flying low, and fired missiles at the Presidential Palace, the same place where Daoud was living. The attacks by Sukhois became worse in night.  Meanwhile, in evening the Radio Afghanistan sprang into action, with something Daoud wouldn\u2019t love at all- The \u201cKhalq\u201d has decided to overthrow the Daoud government. The word \u201cKhalq\u201d means \u201cmasses\u201d in Pashtun, and was a term used by Afghan communists faction, which I will talk of later. So, while Daoud was busy eliminating his opponents, what he didn\u2019t know in his wildest dreams was that, the PDPA had infiltrated the Afghan military a long time ago, to use it against Daoud. Now one may wonder, that soldiers later on arrested Daoud, tried him and executed him, right? Nope, it didn\u2019t exactly go that way. Next morning, the soldiers surrounded the Presidential palace. \u2018 Daoud and his brother, in a last effort, charged at the soldiers, armed with nothing but handguns. Soldiers saw them, and shot them dead. An April Day That Changed Afghanistan 3: The legacy of the Saur Revolution's war crimes The one who overthrew the king got overthrown himself. But however unlike the King, he didn\u2019t remain alive. That\u2019s karma, which knows how to bite.  Following this, Afghanistan was declared a communist state, and got renamed as \u201cDemocratic Republic of Afghanistan\u201d. A man called Nur Mohammed Taraki, became the new President. He was also the \u201cgeneral secretary\u201d of PDPA-  Well, story doesn't end here either. The PDPA was divided broadly into two separate factions. Both were communist, but their approach for communism were different - Khalq (translation: Masses)- Radical communists. The followers were called \u201cKhalqis\u201d, and were led by men like Nur Mohammed Taraki and his best friend Hafizullah Amin, and an army general called Mohammed Aslam WatanjarParcham (translation: Flag)- Moderate communists. Followers were called \u201cParchamites\u201d, and was led by likes of Babrak KarmalBoth these factions had an absolute mistrust towards one another. And since the Khalq was in power then, likes of Taraki soon began to conduct a massive \u201cfriends list clean-up\u201d of anyone he knew as a Parchamite. A large number of Parchamites preferred running away from the country, and those who were envoys to foreign nations for Afghanistan, didn\u2019t dare to come home when they were called. But Taraki had issues with fellows close to him too, including his friend and also the Prime Minsiter, Hafizullah Amin, whose aggressive policies on socialism was something that was making the rural folks of Afghanistan very displeased. To make matters worse, Amin , like Taraki, was brutal too in his own ways- getting people hanged who protested or throwing them into the infamous Pul-e-Charki prison. Taraki (left) and Amin (right)-  On the other hand , Amin began suspecting Taraki to have become power-mad after the later took measures to consolidate power of Afghan Army into his own hands. The whole mistrust got fueled to dangerous levels when Soviets began saying that they didn\u2019t like Amin at all. One fine evening, when Taraki returned from his official trip from Cuba, Amin was called to have lunch with him, which he refused, but was still cajoled into it by the Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan. When he reached the Presidential palace, some guards from inside the palace fired at him, but he managed to escape,and drove of to Ministry of Defence. He came back, by putting the military at high alert, and several soldiers to \u201carrest Taraki\u201d. He succeeded, and forced Taraki to say his resignation on radio, then ordered soldiers to kill him. Taraki was smothered with a pillow, and then buried. Following this , Amin declared himself as President. Fellows who were friends of Taraki, one being that General Watanjar, took refuge in Soviet embassy. Two friends, who began hating each other, went on a scramble. One was better-prepared than the other, and by luck, managed to survive, only to come back to kill later. That\u2019s karma, which knows how to bite  Amin later on began a horrifying series of arrests of almost anyone whom he saw as a Taraki sympathizer, including Taraki\u2019s entire family. Soviets on other hand, who already had enough to hate him for the way he murdered Taraki, and they began to to think him as a serious liability when Amin openly began saying that allies of Afghanistan shouldn\u2019t take them for granted. They knew that he was going out of control. So, what happened? Some seriously hardened soldiers of Alpha and Vympel group, alongwith 345th Airborne Battalion, some armoured personnel carriers, and attacked a well-guarded fortress that was protecting Amin, and had him shot dead. Following this, they took control of a large region of Afghanistan, especially urban areas. No need to say - Soviet Union. Tajbeg palace, where Amin was hiding, and ended up dead-  A man who killed his own friend, later ended up dead in hands of those who loved his friend. Karma says hello  Soviets later on installed Babrak Karmal, who has been in talks with Soviets since he was out of Afghanistan. Karmal, compared to both Taraki and Amin, was kind of more sane in approach-  But then, technically this time, a huge amount of role was there in hands of Soviet Union, who didn\u2019t wish to send the country into days of Amin once again. At same time, while Karmal promised reforms, none could happen under Soviets. The whole thing caught eye of one famous country of the western world- United States. The USA knew that they had to stop Soviets from controlling Afghanistan. So some phone calls, discussions, and finally, Ronald Reagan with some \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d , better known as \u201cmujaheddins\u201d-  Very soon some more foreigners decided to join this, what they saw as a \u201choly war\u201d. One was this man, guess who?  The war was long, brutal,and the supplying of modern American weapons in hands of mujaheddins made things tougher for Soviets as well as the Afghan Army. In addition, Soviet forces seemed to have very little trust on Afghan counterparts. Soviets were tired of the war, and even the ones in Moscow began feeling the heat of it. The war was draining away a huge amount of precious resources of Soviet Union. Later on, the new President of Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, openly said that Soviets would withdraw-  But then, they understood it too late. The war, alongwith internal conflicts and disturbances inside Soviet Union, together with demands of greater freedom ended up in a complete collapse of this nation in 1991-  A forceful capture of another nation, killing one autocratic president,leading to a long war, which finally ended with nothing and ultimately leading to collapse of your own nation. Well, that\u2019s karma  The story continues\u2026.. At same time, USA\u2019s funding for mujaheddin through Pakistan might have looked like a really cheap investment rather than sending American soldiers into Afghanistan, but then, come on, we are talking of mujaheddins and Pakistan here!!!! Well, somewhere later on, to stop a group of armed bandits in the lawlessness that was created after the fall of Afghan government, Pakistan gave arms to some students who used to study in madrassas close to Af-Pak border. They succeeded in the work assigned to them. But what many didn\u2019t know was, that they had some other plans up their sleeves. They were described as just \u201cstudents\u201d , but the entire world came to know them by their Pashto term-Taliban-  At same time, one of the \u201cforeign fighters\u201d who came to fight in the war, be began his own group,which led one of the worst ever terror attack in 2001 on American soil, which was known as \u201cWorld Trade Centre Attack\u201d. You know whom I am talking of-  Again, a karma of sending weapons to the worst fellows in this planet. This same man was later on found to be under full protection of Taliban and several of their supporters, for which USA began their usual series of bombardments and sending troops into Afghanistan. Exactly eleven years later, in a house close to a military base in Abbotabad, Pakistan, they managed to find this man and shoot him , ending his reign of terror for good. Death of Osama bin Laden - Wikipedi  Karma strikes again, this time on the man himself. Now if that wasn\u2019t enough, Pakistan\u2019s support to Taliban later created a Frankestein, in form of Tehreek e Taliban, or better-known to others as \u201cPakistani Taliban\u201d, against whom the entire Pakistan has been at a state of war since a decade or so, with countless loss of lives. Also,the same group was responsible of some of the worst-ever massacres of innocents in history of Pakistan-   2014 Peshawar school massacre - Wikipedia So in other words, one way or another whoever was involved in Afghanistan, had to pay some seriously heavy prices in form of everything-money, weapons, human lives, property, national pride, self-respect, but in the end, achieved literally nothing.  What happened to the Afghans? Lives of Afghans got destroyed completely, and it\u2019s now only that they have begun picking up stones to rebuild their country. A nation that one point was an epitome of beauty, now is often known for things from Tora Bora to Taliban. The leaders who were caught in squabble for power, many were forced to run for their lives. Most of the men who earlier ruled the nation got reduced to nothing, and were forced to flee for their lives. One man wasn\u2019t that lucky, and ended up getting lynched by Taliban.  So next time when you try to have some nasty plans for someone, or worse, another country, remember, there are some nasty ways by which it can backfire on you. So, some don\u2019ts- Don\u2019t see a hero in every random fellow claiming to be a \u201cfreedom fighter\u201dDon\u2019t try to sell Stinger missiles or anything just because another fellow whom you may not like is trying to fix the nationIf you have strong friends, make sure not to plot something nasty against themRespect others if they are in a habit of minding their own businessOr as they say- Karma always comes back to bite you  Thanks for reading.
