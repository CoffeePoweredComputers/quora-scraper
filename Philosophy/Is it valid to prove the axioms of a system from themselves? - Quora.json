            "answer_text": "By definition, axioms are accepted postulates or hypotheses on which we choose to base our system (Effectively assumptions/rules defining our system). As such we cannot \u2018prove\u2019 our axioms from within our system. They define the system and therefore are inherent truths of the system. If however the statement can be proved without the assumption of truth, then it is not an axiom. That is, there exists a smaller set of axioms (assumptions/rules) which completely defines our system without including that statement. However conversely it is possible to \u2018disprove\u2019 an assumption of something\u2019s truth if the assumption of its truth results in a contradiction i.e. the system fundamentally breaks down. This is proof by contradiction and is a commonly used technique in logical systems such as in mathematics and philosophy. We take something as axiomatically true (assume it is true without proof) and attempt to derive a contradiction of our other axioms (or a statement that is a proven consequence of our other axioms). If the assumption of truth leads to a contradiction then we can in fact state it is defined as inherently not true by the previously defined properties of our system - our other axioms. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course! Everything implies itself. So every axiom can be proven by itself. However, axioms are usually chosen in such a way that every axiom brings something new to the table, i.e., that no axiom can be proven from the conjunction of all the other axioms. Especially for a young theory it may happen that one of the original axioms is later found to be a consequence of the other axioms, or at least of the other axioms and a simpler version of itself. In that case the axiom is dropped. ",
