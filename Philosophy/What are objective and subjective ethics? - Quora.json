            "answer_text": "Objective Ethics refers to a view that a person's action can always be seen as right or wrong, regardless of the situation or the consequences. It focuses on rules for governing what is considered to be morally right, wrong, or obligatory. The person\u2019s subjective evaluation of the situation is not of much importance. Objective Ethics is also known as moral absolutism or ethical absolutism. ",
