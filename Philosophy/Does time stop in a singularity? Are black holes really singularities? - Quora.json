            "answer_text": "It is well-known that in strong gravitational fields, time slows down And black holes contain the strongest gravitational fields in the universe.Even time is so slow near the center of a black hole, that process simply is taking an enormous amount of time. Loop quantum gravity is a difficult mathematical theory that has resisted the making of testable predictions inside black holes. However,abhay ashtekar and javiel olmedoat Pennsylvania State University and parampreet singh at Louisiana State University have applied loop quantum gravity to the center of black holes. They claim that the result is NOT A SINGULARITY. Their calculation predicts that space-time is curved very strongly near the center of the black hole THAT IS SINGULARITY. The result is that space-time continues into a region in the future that has the structure of a white hole. A white hole is like a black hole in reverse, meaning that unlike a black hole, which pulls matter in, a white hole shoots matter out. As always in theoretical science, there are many interesting and provocative ideas that just aren\u2019t true, and this may be one of them. So it's important to see if there are few possibilities. Scientists have observed very high energy phenomena in space that have not been completely explained. One is the existence of very high energy cosmic rays that hit Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Another is what are called \"fast radio burst\". which is when a large amount of radio energy is observed in a very short amount of time. Both of those phenomena could, at least in principle, be the signature of a black hole transitioning to a white hole. It is certainly premature to accept this interesting new idea. Instead, it would be prudent to see how ongoing calculations using loop quantum gravity unfold. If predictions improve and begin to look more like some of the unexplained observed astronomical phenomena, it could be that this new result will both explain how quantum gravity works and reshape our understanding of both the past and the future of our universe.l support for theoretical ideas like these.
