            "answer_text": "Thanks for your question. Demand creates supply: before Keynes, economists believed, from the classical economists (when it was called political economy), that supply creates demand. Keynes theorised that companies will not change prices according to demand (e.g. they will not raise prices when there is high demand and people compete to offer more money, and they will not reduce prices when there is little demand and people do not have to offer as much). They will supply as much as is available in stock and inventory at prices set at a previous point. They will not change prices. Therefore, companies will supply goods and services once individuals demand them. They will not refuse to supply goods and services at a previous price because demand has changed. Demand will create supply.Fiscal policy: When recessions occur, individuals in the economy will tend to save money, usually in the fear that they will need it in an impending personal economic emergency. Keynes stated that the only solution to this is government spending. He showed how fiscal policy and the stimulus it injects into the economy can ensure unemployment is avoided. Borrowing from the classical political economy tradition (especially Adam Smith), he showed that in the economy, the value of all goods and services produced = consumption = income. He showed that the best way we can avoid recessions is to enter the circular flow of income through the consumption avenue, and that way stimulate demand. In other words, the primary lever society should use in improving our economic conditions is to spur consumption (through demand) through government involvement. The reason why governments should be used is because they are uniquely equipped with the ability to print (or create) money and because they can change tax rates.The multiplier: Keynes showed that government intervention is the best intervention because every dollar it spends in the economy will be multiplied. If I receive $1 from the government, and I choose to spend $0.50, then another individual will receive that $0.50. They can choose to spend $0.25 of that, which will become the income of another. That person will choose to spend $0.125 of that. If you add everybody\u2019s income (1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 \u2026), the total income in the economy will be equal to $2, despite the fact we began with $1 of stimulus (You might say, how can we add 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 when that is really the same money just changing hands. The trick used here is a system called fractional reserve banking, where banks decide to store 10% of the money you store in your bank account, and lend the other 90% of your money to mortgage-holders and other borrowers. If everybody in the economy decided to visit their bank and withdraw every dollar in their bank account, only 10% of the dollars withdrawn in that economy will actually emerge from the cash machine. The other 90% is virtual and stored on computers). Another point to note is that we assumed in this example that everybody saved half of their income and spend the other half. We can only assume in this case that everybody in the economy chooses to save and spend a particular ratio (in this case 1/2). The mathematics here only allows a constant ratio, i.e. it is very hard to assume the first person saves and spends at a ratio of 1/2, the second saves and spend at a ratio of 1/8, and then the third person saves and spends at a ratio of 1/3. We must simplify the analysis to assume the ratio is the same for everybody. The formula is equal to 1/1-MPC (where MPC or marginal propensity to consume is the aforementioned ratio). In this case, it is 1/1\u20130.5 = 2.The paradox of thrift: if individuals in the economy decide to save, this will reduce consumption, which means companies will not raise as much money because consumers are purchasing fewer of their goods. Workers will be laid off because companies won\u2019t be doing as well, with the result being a lower equilibrium of national income (depicted as Y in the figure below). A lower level of national income will correspond to a lower level of investment, which reduces the demand for savings (a lower interest rate on savings will be offered, and therefore reduce savings). So when individuals in the economy save, national income and savings will both fall. This is the paradox of thrift. ",

            "answer_text": "It might be important to understand what the historical context of the ideas of Keynes is before we dive into the ideas concretely. **Stage 1: The regulation of capitalism made redistribution less taboo** In most countries, the crash of 29 exposed a few of the flaws of capitalism in regards to providing a stable level of employment. However, Marxism was not seen as an answer in the west due to the ideological opposition and the analysis of its ineffectiveness to redistribute in an effective manner. Some examples: Germany: The situation preceding the crash was miserable. This misery caused a flee towards Nazism. Why? Well, they basically took the shame out of poverty by saying that material wealth was not a goal in itself. Yet, the nation\u2019s goal is more important. What made them successful was the fact that they had something to offer to every class in society The capitalist: They were afraid of the Marxist (of course)The middle class was afraid of becoming poorer as a consequence of Marsism as wellThe workers were a part of the larger missionThe unemployed got bread and a uniformHow did they regulate capitalism? => Financing public works and the weapon industry where there was no competition from private enterprise etc, the organization of health care, outlawing child labor,\u2026 Belgium: The influential Hendrik De Man was afraid of Nazism and fascism and wanted to combat unemployment by establishing \u201cPlanned socialism\u201d (I guess the man was a fan of tautology) which split nationalized industry and en free enterprise (which was just a tactic to satisfy the middle class). A few years later the man became a fascist himself. The United States: FDR established the New Deal Policies which were a compromise between the capitalists and the workers. It kept free enterprise and competition but gave the government the responsibility to create jobs in support agriculture. It\u2019s not a secret that this made people dependant on the government and decreased the importance of charity. **The Keynesian revolution** It turned out that the neoclassical theories were not realistic as they relied heavily on mathematics which made them a bit unworldly. JM Keynes was the most important figure to wipe out this sort of thinking. Who was he? He only lived from 1883\u20131946 but was very successful. He taught Philosophy of science at Cambridge, but had an enormous direct impact on economic policy as well: Worked at the treasury during WW1 and 2 (he was against the reparations)He was a leading figure during the Bretton Woods conferenceHe was, however, less a public policy figure in a direct manner than an influencer in the more academic sense. A few examples of his ideas in his writings: A treatise on money (1930): There is a distinction to be made between different sorts of inflation. Expansionary monetary policy stimulates lending, interest rate impacts the business cycle. The crisis in 29 was caused by the reparations enforced by the allied powers en bubbles on the financial markets => This drove up demand in the financial markets which made the interest rates rise. This dragged the global economy in a recession.Articles on the meltdown: He argued for low interest rates and expansionary fiscal policy => This would start a process of multiplication (What is the Keynesian multiplier? (What is the Keynesian multiplier?)) => as the economy recovered, the government could repay debts by raising taxes.General theory (1936): The content of this book really sparked the Keynesian Revolution by giving a moral outlook on economics: the economy should facilitate prosperity and the government was responsible for practically organizing it. In other words: the study should shift from how the economy causes prosperity to how we can make the economy do that more effectively. Some ideas:In order to achieve full employment, the government should organize public work projectsSavings cause unemployment. Make money flowThere is a positive correlation between Aggregate Demand and the level of employmentUnemployment has a negative effect on wages => Makes demand on the labor market rise until the natural rate of wages is reachedAfter his death, the school of Keynesian thought split between the post-Keynesians who saw their theory as an alternative against the neo-classical school and the new-Keynesians who mixed the two In short: he shifted the discussion from how the economy creates prosperity to how we should actively force the economy to do so. The government is responsible for establishing an anticyclical policy in order to do so. What was the problem with his theory: Exogenous factors caused the crisis in 1973, but the Keynesian theories never provided an answer\u2026 Hope it helped, Cheers ",
