            "answer_text": "Is fascism a capitalist ideology? Not exactly. The three forms of state socialism that dominated the 20th century can be distinguished in part by their varied economic approaches. Communism, which got its start in Russia going back five generations (and China soon after, though with some detours) lasted only a bit more than three generations precisely because it stuck with Marx\u2019s original idea that the factors of production should be owned in common. In fact, they were to be owned and allocated by the state/party, something Marx would not have approved as he felt statist power was antithetical to ending class strife. The economics of communism proved incapable of going beyond subsistence levels of production (as had been fairly widely predicted). The form of social democracy we have had for almost eight generations came courtesy of Bismarck\u2019s theft of it from Lassalle, Marx and the SPD. The theft created a furor. Marx was spitting mad and penned his scathing Critique of the Gotha Programme. There was another furor a generation later when emissaries Kautsky and Bernstein announced to the Second International their intention to retain capitalism, just make it their \u201cbitch\u201d by industrial policy and high levels of taxation. Like state communism, fascism emerged five generations ago as anti-Marxist socialism. It replaced Marx\u2019s ideological driver of \u201cclass consciousness\u201d with the more up-to-date absolute idealism [think: Triumph of the Will] popular in Europe, and it replaced Marxian materialism with the much more current nationalism of the pre-World War I period. It\u2019s economic concept was a bit tighter than the social democratic one. Dirigisme would be a formal policy of state direction of industry. All of the fascist states of Europe were anxious to rearm, and they rationalized that keeping the industrialists on board would speed things up. Besides, most of them took to fascism too. Mussolini credited President Wilson and, especially, his assistant naval secretary Franklin Roosevelt with proof of concept for dirigisme courtesy of the ship-building program FDR directed for the war effort. They further rationalized that since Marx had insisted a century or two of a dictatorship of the proletariat would be necessary to arrive at true socialism, they too would ease into a long-term program of producing true socialist workers and managers. Basically, social democracy and fascism enjoyed a more robust economy than communism by being parasitic on capitalism. Fascism\u2019s failure owed more to military defeat and bad PR than to economic deficiency. Social democracy remains the dominant form of socialism (how does it still get called socialism when it exalts its political class much more than its working class?) with the very conspicuous fact that social democracies prosper more to the extent they let their free enterprise be freer.

            "answer_text": "No. Although both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy believed in relatively free markets, private initiative, and private property, this does not make them Capitalist. Free markets, private initiative, and private property existed for centuries before Adam Smith wrote An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Just because a state has free markets, private initiative, and private property does not mean it is capitalist. In a similar matter, just because a state has a planned economy does not mean it is marxist, socialist, or communist. Planned economies existed in ancient empires such as the Indo-Greek Kingdom, the Seleucid Empire, and the Parthian Empire, they certainly were not Communist or Marxist. Critics of Fascism, especially Communists and Socialists, often overlook this and say that Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were both Capitalist, simply because they had free markets and private property. Following this kind of logic, we must conclude that the USSR, from 1921 to 1928, was also a Capitalist state because the New Economic Policy introduced free markets and private initiative in the USSR. Of course, such a conclusion is incredibly inaccurate and stupid. The USSR was never Capitalist, the NEP wasn\u2019t Capitalist, but rather, an example of market socialism. Fascism, from the very beginning, always rejected Capitalist philosophy, which isn\u2019t surprising, considering that Fascist and Capitalist philosophy is extremely conflicting, as Fascism rejects materialism, free trade, and the idea of profit being primary. Here are some quotes from two Fascist leaders, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, clearing showing their distaste for Capitalism. To-day we can affirm that the capitalistic method of production is out of date. So is the doctrine of laissez-faire, the theoretical basis of capitalism\u2026 To-day we are taking a new and decisive step in the path of revolution. A revolution, in order to be great, must be a social revolution. -Benito Mussolini, 1933. \u201cWe want to build up a new state! That is why the others hate us so much today\u2026. They are, after all, plutocracies in which a tiny clique of capitalists dominate the masses, and this, naturally, in close cooperation with international Jews and Freemasons.\u201d -Adolf Hitler, 1940. Another point often brought up by critics of Fascism is that \u201cFascism was funded by American bankers and German industrialists, therefore, Fascism must have served the interests of big business!\u201d. This is also an incredibly faulty belief. While it is certainly true that American bankers and German industrialists funded the NSDAP, this does not mean that Fascism served the interests of big business. National Socialism was always against interest on loans, something which generated a lot of income for banks and bankers. If Fascism was truly serving the interests of big businesses and banks, it would not have vehemently been against interest on loans. Similarly, National Socialist intellectuals often wrote about the dangers presented by big business and capitalism. Abolition of the Bondage of Interest - the core of National Socialism National Socialism demands State protection of the farmers against aggression by the big business interests. To-day business merely looks for a return on capital. Let us now examine this state of affairs in the light of its effect on political economy, so as to realise the corrupt character of the capitalist system. -Gottfried Feder in \u201cThe Programme of the NSDAP\u201d and \u201cThe German state on a National and Socialist Foundation\u201d. Funnily enough, most of the Communists and Socialists who talk about how German industrialists and American bankers funded Fascism completely forget to mention the millions of dollars which the Bolsheviks received from bankers and businessmen such as Jacob Shiff and Olof Aschberg. In just 1917, the Bolsheviks received 62 million Reichmarks from German intelligence services, does this mean that the Bolsheviks were pro-German and pro-Monarchist? Does the fact that the Bolsheviks received millions from bankers and businessmen mean they were pro-big business and pro-capitalist? Of course not, and the same applies to the Fascists. A. James Gregor, a political scientist who studied Fascism in-depth, stated in 2006, \u201cFascism never served the interests of Italian business . . . there is no credible evidence that Fascism controlled the nation's economy for the benefit of the 'possessing classes\u201d. Similarly, Peter Drucker, an American writer and university professor, stated in 1939, \u201cIt is not true that \u2018big business\u2019 promoted fascism. On the contrary, both in Italy and in Germany the proportion of fascist sympathizers and backers was smallest in the industrial and financial classes. It is equally untrue that \u2018big business\u2019 profits from fascism; of all the classes it probably suffers most from totalitarian economics and Wehrwirtschaft.\u201d Calling Fascism a Capitalist ideology and saying that Fascists are Capitalists is even more inaccurate when you consider that many Fascists are economically left-wing. Economically left-wing Fascists, such as National Bolsheviks, Strasserists, and National Syndicalists, all believe in Fascism, but with left-wing economics. It is completely inaccurate to brand these people as \u201cCapitalists\u201d, considering they advocate for a planned economy and for workers to seize the means of production. As such, Fascism is certainly not a Capitalist ideology. Although Fascist countries such as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy did believe in relatively free markets, private initiative, and private property, this does not make them Capitalist, as they distinctly rejected Capitalist philosophy.
