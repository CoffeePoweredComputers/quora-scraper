            "answer_text": "Since the United States is not a Marxist state, no. Do you feel a window washer (substitute any job, no matter how skilled or unskilled) should make the same as a mechanic (again, substitute any job) who works the same hours? If the mechanic is one that has the only skillset to make a $5 million 1938 Bugatti run well, then his wages may well exceed that of most lawyers. Marxism is based upon the idea that every man is an equal member of the collective, owes all to the collective (state) and has no individual right to exceptional wages no matter how skilled. It does not take long for Marxism to fail to live up to its ideals of utopianism when the best and brightest are brought down to the lowest common denominator. Marxism has to be enforced as it begins to falter. Neither the human mind nor body works its best under subjugation, only under freedom. Under Marxism, the shoe shiner, the farmer, the mechanic and the lawyer make the same. It does not take a genius to predict that skillsets and production will diminish over time as it is just not worth the extra work to make nothing extra. The United States market is one that is based upon the individual\u2019s skills or products that they can market to the public, with no limit. If that skill or product is novel and desired by the public, the sky is the limit on how much money they can make. That is why Sam Walton and Jeff Bezos, each basically running a general store, were/are among the richest, if not richest men of all time. Their use of capitalism brought the prices of goods down so that more people could enjoy them. Marxism never brought anything good to anyone but the elites in charge of the state. ",

            "answer_text": "No, because then we would have an excess of car mechanics and not enough lawyers. Becoming a lawyer takes years of training without pay. There are a limited supply of them. It all comes down to the free market system pricing. By allowing prices to fluctuate freely, incentives are created where needs are most dire. If we have a great deal of need for lawyers, the price of lawyers goes up and, if there are too many lawyers, then the price of lawyers goes down. Price fluctuates to draw people into the career or out of the career naturally. The same is true for mechanics. If we have too many diesel mechanics, then the price of diesel mechanics goes down. Not enough hydraulic mechanics? The price goes up. Not enough electrical mechanics within affinity for electric cars? Price goes up. Too many? Price goes down. The price signals to individuals to change and make life decisions accordingly, naturally drawing people into careers where society's needs are greatest. This is what is also known as the invisible hand. The free market system of pricing naturally increases prices where needs are most dire, causing people to shift and change their behaviors to meet those needs. why do you think it is so many people go work on oil rigs, and hard to work environments, away from your family and working 16-hour days? The answer: money. It pays well because higher pay is required to drop people to the jobs. In other words, it is encouraging ethical behavior (in this regard) by incentivizing people to take careers where demands are greatest. It's not a perfect system, but it's a pretty good system. It has been shown to lift millions if not billions out of poverty as well as achieve enormous social and economic progress in a very short period of time. At the extremes, it can be oppressive, but the core concept of the market system of pricing is a very good concept and works excellently in the day-to-day pricing of goods and services. ",

            "answer_text": "Water seeks its own level. We pay people what we feel is commensurate with their worth and we have set up a society that determines the value of their work. In a society where the threat of moving paper is far, far more consequential than the fear of breaking down on the highway the lawyer would always command a premium. We\u2019ve set up society that way, the same way we artificially inflate the price of diamonds by creating a shortage off them. Supply and Demand works. The kind of demand you create depends on the supply and the value of that supply that we\u2019ve attached to it. We call demand that stays the same regardless of price \u201cinelastic\u201d. For example, a diabetic who can\u2019t survive without insulin is going to pay whatever the price is to get it because he doesn\u2019t want to die. When your car breaks down you don\u2019t have a big threat of going to jail but enemies pushing paper can do you a great deal of damage including putting you in jail so the demand for lawyers, while usually much less frequent than that for mechanics, tends to be more valuable. Therefore the lawyer can command whatever price the market will bear. A good mechanic will always get paid more than a shade tree mechanic; the guys working on Formula One cars are not making the same money as the guys working on a Honda Fit in a greasy garage by the Interstate either. In a capitalistic society we let the market decide and only use regulators to insure that within the same sphere the rules are the same. But there is no real way to normalize the value of a mechanic and a lawyer or a doctor or a grocery clerk and so on. So it is almost always wrong to try to \u201cassign\u201d comparative values to salaries. However in a situation where the supply of labor continues to grow while the supply of jobs continues to shrink, water will find its own level. Labor will flow to the area of highest pay based on the capability of the worker - unless acted upon by the employer who seeks to take advantage of the excess supply by lowering the wage to the point where people will no longer take the job. Then he raises it just above that amount and gets all the workers he wants at the lowest price. It\u2019s one reason we need to have minimum wage - because desperate people will suffer almost any ignominy to get any amount of money to survive. They have been inculcated by a system that strives to teach them about the morality of legally obtaining money so they don\u2019t need a lawyer to keep them out of jail while at the same time they are being cheated by the employer who does not care about their needs or suffering. He is taking advantage of their moral training and fear of jail to keep wages low because anyone is replaceable. Mark Twain wrote about this humorously in his book \u201cLife on the Mississippi\u201d. In the book, he learned to pilot a riverboat because the money was so good. However, so many men began to do this that the owners had their pick of Captains and so they reduced the wage until the Captain was making less than a deck hand or the Engineer. In order to fix this, the Captains formed a Union that restricted then number of Captains that could be available for work for a length of time and thus were able to stabilize the wage of the Captain. Nowadays we use \u201cminimum wage\u201d as an inadequate substitute for Unions, whom we have taken a turn against over the past decades. Unions have their own inherent problems. But the entire salary of comparative worth has been discredited many, many times and anyone who espouses it is a true communist and we saw what happened with communists. However, the other end of the spectrum, unfettered capitalism, is just as bad. Remember: Minimum Wage means Minimum Effort. ",

            "answer_text": "Rather than answer this question, I\u2019m going to make a suggestion for how you answer it for yourself. I suggest that you get on a plane and visit Cuba, or North Korea. My wife is half Cuban. She has tons of family still in Cuba. We have visited twice. We haven\u2019t been back since 2017 because Trump\u2019s made it harder to get in. In 2016, I was in Cuba when Fidel Castro died. I remember driving at night from Matanzas to Varadero, three nights before he was announced dead, and discussing, \u201cI wonder when the old man is going to kick the bucket.\u201d When he died, thousands and thousands gathered at Versailles in Miami to celebrate. In Cuba, the Cuban government had police patrolling the streets, so they could arrest anyone caught partying. My wife\u2019s second cousin is a lawyer in Cuba. She makes the same number of CUCs per month as her husband who drives a cab. He drives a 1946 Pontiac that has a Mitsubishi replacement engine. He actually makes more money because he receives tips from foreign tourists. They get the equivalent of about $25 US per month. Which can\u2019t really buy anything at all, outside of a government store. I\u2019m writing this on an iPhone XS. Before I had an iPhone 7 Plus. When I went to get the new iPhone, my wife insisted that I not trade in my old 7 Plus. We found a way to mail it to the son of my wife\u2019s second cousin in Cuba. He was so happy that a few months later, when it was his birthday, they baked him a cake that looked like the iPhone. They don\u2019t really have much. What they do have, are plans to get out of Cuba at the nearest opportunity. Many have mixed feelings about leaving family. One relative died of a heart attack during Irma because he couldn\u2019t change hospitals. Go check it out. Speak to the people who live there. Ask them how they feel about everyone making the same money, after the government took everything in the 1950s. Sooner or later, hopefully, something is going to give and the Communist regime in Cuba topples. You may not have forever to see what it\u2019s like. But go see it. It\u2019ll answer your question. One thing that\u2019s interesting is, Cuban immigrants to the US, vote straight up conservative Republican. (I\u2019m not saying every single one. I\u2019m talking about the voting bloc in Florida.) Why? Because of where they came from. Cuban Americans are as anti government take as it gets, from what I\u2019ve observed. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve worked with many in both fields (even trained lawyers) along with many others. Lawyers have a more effective medieval guild protection of their fees and wages thanks to their overrepresentation in state legislatures, Congress, regulatory agencies, local and state governments, not to mention being the source of judges, they\u2019ve been able to require the use of lawyers and steadily expand the work at premium billing rates for only lawyers. When the government has to require your use, you\u2019re probably not that useful to your clients (that\u2019s the reverse of value offered in a free market.) Auto mechanics have a larger body of knowledge to master that changes much faster than the law in significant ways with many advancing technologies all interacting in new cars and trucks (heavy truck and heavy equipment mechanics are paid more than car mechanics btw.) They already earn in many cases what a basic lawyer from most law schools in general practice earns (comparing law salaries for top law school grads going to work for 1,000 lawyer firms as minions billing $350\u2013500/hr on enormous projects is very far from the reality for most lawyers, like comparing top Hollywood stars\u2019 pay to the tens of thousands with a theater degree who wait tables. For brains, the average IQ\u2019s are actually pretty close except in lawyers\u2019 self-estimation just as mechanics are self-deprecating after being told endlessly they must not be very smart with a reliance on their hands. The mechanics have been wading into much more IT from vehicle software to diagnostic computers under the hood and in their shops as well as PC/Tablet-based software so a much wider variety than what a lawyer uses (word-processing almost entirely) as well as having a deep and functional knowledge of mechanical, electrical, electronics engineering that they develop continually. Unlike legal work it\u2019s much simpler to test auto mechanics\u2019 diagnostics, problem-solving and solution implementation with the physical reality (rather than a judge\u2019s opinion) and that\u2019s a feedback loop most clients wish lawyers had too. With overproduction of lawyers since the 1970\u2019s as author Martin Mayer was pointing out then in bestselling books while even the American Bar Association noticed that by the early 1980\u2019s and steadily fewer people going into auto repair as complexity and manufacturers\u2019 choices (software, diagnostic equipment in the six figure cost, replacement parts sales, etc.) eliminated thousands of independent auto repair shops and raised the barriers to entry far beyond most businesses. So auto mechanics pay is already getting into the $100\u2013125,000/yr range as of 10+ years ago while lawyers\u2019 pay descends, hiring paralegals for half the cost started in the 1980\u2019s and comparable work but a lower billing rate, are converging rapidly. I frequently run into people with a law degree and some experience who fled that work but the only auto mechanics I\u2019ve run into who no longer do that work (many, many fewer) were ones where injuries or cumulative wear and tear (back injuries, bad knees, carpal-tunnel syndrome or arthritis in their hands, rotator cuff injuries, damage from oil and gas fumes, etc.).

            "answer_text": "I think a person should pay what the market bears for a mechanic or a lawyer and what they feel is objectively \u201cfair\u201d for the services they\u2019re receiving. We\u2019re not going to get into cost-fixing here. Mind you this could become a slippery slope. For instance, we take out the word \u201clawyer\u201d from your question and then we replace it with the word \u201cdoctor\u201d. So now what? Mechanics (good ones) perform hard and sometimes dangerous work. It\u2019s ironic actually that I was asked this question, as I went through automotive school in Chicago in the early 90s (don\u2019t ask why I didn\u2019t stick with it). I went through many months of school and paid a good deal for automotive school. However, think of how long it takes to get a law degree, passing the bar exam (only offered twice a year and not cheap), and all the costs associated with becoming a lawyer. Myself, I drove 90 miles each way to attend law school at night, 3 nights a weeks for over 3 years\u2026while working a full time job. When someone goes to a mechanic, with some exceptions, the solution to the problem is generally known and predictable. With the advance of computers in cars and fancy diagnostic tools, a mechanic can figure it out rather quickly. Law, on the other hand, is not so simple. When a client comes to the lawyer, the possible remedies are very fact-dependent. Sometimes the issue is novel and that makes things more difficult. Also, the stakes are higher. With a car if the part replaced is faulty\u2026you put in another part. With law, my client could be incarcerated, have their kids taken away, go bankrupt, etc. Should lawyers make more than mechanics? Maybe. ",

            "answer_text": "It's an interesting idea. It is possible, in a simple society of say, 100 people on an island, that the lawyer\u2019s contribution to the community is just as valid as the car mechanic\u2019s and they both deserve the same share of the rewards such as food, fresh water or coconuts etc. The issue is we don't live in small, pure communist societies, where everyone adheres to the principles, everyone works and everyone fairly shares the rewards. These have nothing to do with communist nation-states, where despite the good intentions and fairness on-paper, human nature results in those in power taking more than their share of the wealth, amongst other transgressions. You also have to appreciate that right or wrong, the more cerebral and brain-oriented work activities are some of the most rewarded, though this is not universally the case. It is scarcity related, in that, an extremely intelligent, educated person cannot be replaced as easily as someone who\u2019s skills take less time, and intelligence to learn. It is also true that the more educated people, in a money-oriented society tend to remain wealthier, as they manage their wealth better. They also - whether deliberately or not - via the system ensure that they stay wealthy and the poor stay poor. One example is poorer people having to borrow more to pay for things, which means they pay interest that the richer person does not, and when they do they find a way to offset that interest against their tax liability. As someone once said, I cannot afford to buy cheap shoes. The issue with the notion that everyone should share the rewards equally is that this amounts to communism, which has been tried and failed in many instances. China is a notable exception but are we to believe that everyone in China works for the same reward independent of their role? No. ",

            "answer_text": "There are multiple others who have pointed out that you\u2019re really asking the generic: should all jobs be paid the same? Should a pizza delivery person be paid the same as an electrical Engineer? Should a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer be paid more than a sales clerk, a farmer or a mechanic? Perhaps better asked is what is the value added for that job? On the other hand, American companies are famous for taking \u201cjobs\u201d, automating them, and then hiring some basic skill operator who they can pay less than the skilled workers they had before\u2026 Whereas in other societies (Japan for instance) when they replaced skilled workers with automation, they hire or train even higher skilled people to maintain that equipment so it doesn\u2019t go down. Several years ago, I was working for a utility. I\u2019d started in the field making things work, but had moved myself into working for operations and maintenance in a high-tech facility, where I had an office and the ability to play lots of computer games on company time. The industry went through \u201cde-regulation\u201d and the \u201ccut fat\u201d edict went out. Outside consultants were called in and they interviewed everyone working for the company, asking them basically to justify their job. When asked to explain what I did and why I should keep my job, I thought about it and told the truth. Most of the time I do nothing. I show up in the morning, and go into the control room for a cup of coffee, and to listen to what has been happening, find and fix little problems before they become big problems, and eventually get in to my office where I may play a game or read a book. There are a multitude of little things that I do, strictly in that if they aren\u2019t done, they will eventually become a problem, but that\u2019s only a few hours a day When they asked me why my job should be maintained and if my job should be maintained, I told them \u201cI\u2019m not paid for what I do, I\u2019m paid for what I know. This facility has a lost cost of $25,000 per hour. When something goes wrong, the additional cost for the company is that amount. Me, you\u2019re paying $50,000 a year. All I have to do is save you 2 hours per year of down time - and you\u2019ve broken even. Ask around, and see what management, operations, and maintenance thinks of me - do I save that amount of downtime? When something goes wrong, how much does it save to have me here, readily able to troubleshoot and correct problems and how often do I do it? A few years later, I left that job and company, going to work for a company that did work with them. I had to go back for a job about 6 months later, and ran into my ex co-worker who had the same job title, work requirements as I had. He was never the \u201cgo to the control room and get a cup of coffee\u201d type of guy, and told me that before I left, he really had no idea of all the \u201clittle\u201d things that I\u2019d done without needing to get \u201cdirection\u201d to do so. He said that after I left, his phone rang all day, every day, and when he asked why things were going bad so much was told that I had always just taken care of them before they were a problem. ",

I was gonna say compare Macs and Doctors ,\u2026BUT doctors like teachers in my mind can be grossly UNDERPAYED for the great work that they do!

            "answer_text": "Do all lawyers make the same amount of money for working the same amount of hours? 90% lawyers find it tough to make enough money for leading a comfortable lifestyle. The remaining make decent money but a very few lawyers make genuinely obscene amounts of money. Every profession in the world is like that but yes on an average some professions are more remunerative than others and a great part of this inequality stems from demand and supply and the ease of entering a particular profession. If a lawyer wants to become a mechanic he can probably become one in maybe a year or even less. However, even a college graduate would need to clear an entrance exam then study for 3\u20135 years in a law college and then pass the bar exam to even qualify as a lawyer. How long it would take for him to start earning anything at all is another issue altogether. The more difficult it is the higher the Income. Doctors get paid a lot because it is very difficult to become one. But even amongst doctors a heart surgeon will get paid double what a paediatric practitioner would get or a general physician. Power associated with a position also matters which is why doctors who deal with life threatening diseases like cancer, heart attacks, trauma surgeons etc make more money as compared to other doctors. Even in IT since data analytics, machine learning, system analytics etc are tougher fields which is why specialists in these fields get paid more. It is similar when computer science is compared with other disciplines. Every year in the US a lot of students who get admitted in computer science change their major after a year into the course because they find the going too tough for their taste. This results in a perennial shortage of IT professionals in the US which is why generally a CS undergraduate will end up getting 25\u201350% more than other engineering graduates. The demand exceeds the supply. But even then 99.9% computer science graduates will retire without making even 1% of what a Satya Nadella or a Sundar Pichai makes in a year and remember they are professionals and not entrepreneurs. Even in a socialist system where income disparities aren't probably as glaring, a motor mechanic and a lawyer won't ever make the same money. If mechanics were to start earning much more then everyone would start training to become a mechanic and then in a couple of years there would be so many mechanics that the wages would start falling and half of them wouldn't get employment. In a dynamic system every profession achieves its own equilibrium. In fact if mobility of labour was not an issue then possibly mechanics in US would start earning the same as mechanics in China which would be still lower and probably computer professionals in US would get paid less but their counterparts in China or India would also start getting paid much more. Outsourcing would end and no one would prefer to migrate to the US. ",

            "answer_text": "Back in the 1980s, I began my first role as a human resources executive. During those years, an activist movement called \u201ccomparable worth\u201d arose. Its agenda was to combine all the factors that contributed to women\u2019s pay outcomes in almost any disadvantageous way. This included job content. The market for elementary education teachers, for example, has rarely been able to assimilate every year\u2019s roster of new EE majors graduating. An oversupply of peers depresses everyone\u2019s pay who wants that specific job. Other job specialties that attract more women than men also have their pay depressed due to a chronic oversupply of candidates in the workforce. The \u201ccomparable worth\u201d movement called for pay rates to be determined by some method that overrode market forces. If enacted, it would be wildly inflationary. Why? Because the market effects would set pay rates for high-paying specialties requiring years of training and decades of experience and some administrative entity with the force of law would raise pay rates arbitrarily for other jobs that had become favored by the decision to create mandatory market overrides. The cost of goods and services would either remain high or be artificially raised, producing universal disadvantages to consumers. This question repackages the comparable-worth argument. \u201cSomeone should choose and dictate pay rates, job by job, according to some formula that ignores market forces.\u201d The comparable worth movement went nowhere, even when it had the moral impetus of women\u2019s advocacy for their preferred roles in society to pay higher on the basis of \u201cgender equity\u201d. The women\u2019s movement failed with comparable worth. Based on that experience, it\u2019s a fair bet that people will be less sympathetic to either car mechanics or to lawyers than they were the last time comparable-worth arose as a social engineering brainstorm.

            "answer_text": "Hmmm. My lawyer bills at $300/hr, so I hope not. Seriously, both are essential, if you need them. But here are the differences that come to mind. Mechanics need knowledge and the best have some certification, but much of what they do can be done by the owner from a UTube video. Meanwhile, lawyers have 8 years of college and must pass an exam for licensure.While mechanics may need a cashier, some electronics and some labor, Lawyers need paralegals, secretaries, computer systems, office equipment and a pretty expensive office.Mechanics wear overalls and drive work trucks. Lawyers wear suits and need decent cars to transport clients etc..Lawyers will often be 35 years old before they are making good money. A mechanic could be 19.The point is that these things are similar to the basis for how much any profession charges for their services. Education, Support, Overhead and Demand. Lawyers make similar incomes to Doctors. Mechanics make similar incomes to Electricians. No offense here is intended to anyone. One of the smartest men I ever knew is a mechanic. He reads and studies all the time, but he didn\u2019t finish high school. He is a great guy with a wonderful family. I spent many hours in the woods with him working with the Boy Scouts, but I am not going to pay him $300/hr to change the plugs in my old truck. ",

If what he produces is not valuable to the consumer or if his contribution is not enough he gets paid very little (or not al all). It is not the hours or the sweat that matters. Some jobs, especially at the top like CEO are hard to evaluate. Would one o=worker produce more widgets a day is easy. Would a different CEO make better plans for the future? That gets tricky. Still that is the calculation. So it comes down to is the mechanics production worth more to consumers than the lawyers? Yes, if he is the only one who can fix the machine or there is no one to sue.

That is, the lawyer must be able to rip the fruits of his labor and not be concerned if he/she can still pay for the car he/she is using So as the mechanics tools and equipment depreciates overtime, the cost of its depreciation must be covered by the payment he/she receives from the client. So as his/her labor must be paid for. But the amount that the lawyer needs vs the amount that the mechanic needs isn\u2019t the same. Suppose the lawyer needs $50 to live for food and transport each day, while the mechanic only needs $20 for food and he doesn\u2019t have to commute because he lives just beside his garage. It would be unjust if they are both paid $35 a day. For the mechanic it would be $15 too much, and for the lawyer it would be $15 short. Suppose the lawyer is in his office evaluating contracts from clients and notarizing them. He/She uses his $10 pen to sign these documents. He/She usually gets at least 10 clients a day. This gives him/her headaches and stress. He/She earned $10,000 in a month. Meanwhile there\u2019s a mechanic who just got an engine overhaul job order. He/She used most of his/her tools the cost of which is unknown, it was inherited from his/her father. Then spends the whole day, maybe the next day too, to do the job and give a pristine output. He/She was only able to cater to one client because of this, and was paid $50 per hour. The mechanic was exhausted, and decided to rest for half the day, no customers then. Then here comes a fisherman, who built his canoe from a tree he cut down in his backyard. Bought a $14 fishing net, paid $10 for tax duties and government permits. He went to the sea and fished caught a handsome amount of fish, which he then sold for $500. Next few days he didn\u2019t catch anything. Is it fair? Is it just? ",

I have the time and ability to do that myself, so I do not value that service. If life changes to where I no longer have the time or the ability to clean my house, then I will pay for that service. I am only willing to pay market rate however. If there is a ready pool of persons willing to do that job for $20 an hour, I will not pay you $100 an hour just because I might earn that much. There could be circumstances where I pay a car mechanic more than I would a lawyer. There are some services I might pay a lawyer for something I could theoretically do myself. I would not value those as much as things for which I am totally unqualified. With a modern vehicle there are very few services that I am able or willing to do myself.

If there\u2019s a high demand for a certain car mechanic skill and few mechanics that can competently perform the work (say, rebuilding a Lamborghini engine), that mechanic with the skillsets can charge a high price. It doesn\u2019t matter how many hours it takes to do the work; it\u2019s the market demand and labor supply that determine the wages. If there\u2019s a high bar to a career entry that means that most people can\u2019t qualify for the job and a high demand for the career\u2019s skillset, the market will favor the person making more money than many others while working the same amount of hours. A statistician who can navigate FDA bureaucracy, for instance, tends to fetch a high price. If you impose Marxism, in reality, no one works, nothing is made well, and those with skills that can fetch a high price elsewhere flee. I\u2019m in Miami. You can stop random people and ask about Marxist experiences to validate this notion.

Some of the lawyers I know cost $300\u20131000 per hour. The lower end would be for interns doing the grunt work, or for lawsuits of lesser value. However, if you are being charged with murder, you\u2019ll probably want to spend a lot more on a good lawyer with a strong reputation for winning. Such a lawyer can command $1000+/hour of their work, to keep you out of prison for 25 years. But who is willing to spend $1000 for the best car mechanic in the world? Nobody. I doubt anyone would even spend $300/hour unless it was a collector car worth millions. My local dealership mechanic charges $120/hour but I can find one for as little as $60/hour at a small mom&pop mechanic store. The number of hours worked does not mean the work holds the same value. Much like a surgeon working a 12 hour shift and saving 2 people\u2019s lives in the operating room is not the same as a someone who washes cars for 12 hours. ",

            "answer_text": "One reason for lawyers to do more is that their training costs more and takes more time. You have enough high-school grades to take a 4 year Bachelor\u2019s degree in some relevant subject. Having that degree is the minimum educational requirement for admission into Law School.You have to pass the admission test for your chosen law school.You have to earn a \u201cJuris Doctor\u201d Degree.Finally, you have to pass the \u201cBar Examination\u201d.With two degree programs that you have to ace - the cost of becoming a lawyer is pretty big\u2026and there are FOUR exams that you have to pass. To become a car mechanic - you probably have to fritz around with cars for a while in your spare time - or perhaps take a high school class in auto-repair then (probably) you\u2019ll need to get some kind of internship/apprenticeship to build enough experience to get a proper job in the industry. Since you can be earning money the whole time - and those steps don\u2019t cost you anything - and there are generally no formal examinations to pass\u2026it\u2019s *MUCH* easier and cheaper to become a car mechanic. But what determines wages is the law of supply and demand. If there are a lot of car mechanics seeking work - and relatively few lawyers - then the supply for car mechanics is higher and the wages are less. Theoretically, that should cause more people to try to become lawyers - but the cost and intellectual demands of that job mean that most people simply cannot do it. ",

Do you think a lawyer would want to spend all that money and time on college only to be paid as much as a mechanic? heck,, it would be easier for the wannabe lawyer just to be a mechanic. Now having said that, I think mechanics are getting ripped off, I seriously doubt that a dealership that charges $95 to $125 an hour and then pay their mechanics $17 to $25 an hour have that much overhead, no it\u2019s mostly profit at the expense of the mechanics. Then out of that measly pay that a mechanic makes they also have to pay for their own tools which can cost an average of $30,000, which most mechanics pay a loan shark operation called Snap On, or one of the other loan shark rolling tool gangster trucks. I think mechanics should be getting between $19 to $35 an hour and the shop keeps their shop rate the same, the dealer would still make a killing in profits, and those profits don\u2019t even include the very high retail cost they charge the consumer for parts.

Oil changes, rotor replacement, gaskets, valves, etc. Most cars are hooked up to a computer for diagnostic purposes and the mechanic does what is needed. An attorney on the other hand, and especially one that specializes in estate planning or criminal defense, will face different circumstances quite frequently. The attorney also has to deal with an opposing attorney in some cases, a client, and a judge and/or jury. And the attorney has to know how the laws apply to every case and how to proceed based on the evidence or merits of the case. An attorney may spend weeks, months or years dealing with one case. No auto mechanic will spend more than a day or two on a repair job. I do not think the professions are comparable at all. ",

If it goes to trial you pay additionally for the court costs , depositions , expert witnesses , and any other court related costs. Should you win and there is an appeal , you bear those costs as well. That all comes out of your 60 percent. If you\u2019re lucky you may end up with 20 percent of the final award.

Heck, I see that guy Scotty in Houston has a YouTube channel website with 3.3 million subscribers. Now that\u2019s a fan base. There are lot of things lawyers used to do - like give you legal forms that now are done by Joe Average (he went to one of those Internet websites for legal forms) because there is no reason to pay somebody $200 per hour to file a lawsuit when you can do it yourself. Of course, without training you will probably screw up your lawsuit big time. ",

Law firms help people to collect large sums of money for rightful gain, misconduct, illegal activity, misappropriation, fraud, harm, etc. An auto shop charges a small amount of money. A law firm helps someone to get tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars back to a rightful owner that is being held captive by someone else and in exchange for being able to get the money back to the rightful owner, the lawyer collects a nice commission. It's not whether a mechanic should or should not. Its a matter of the lawyer simply is working with larger sums of money and is capable of getting that money. Additionally, being a lawyer requires a lot more schooling, intelligence, and skill than a mechanic. ",

I don\u2019t see how someone that can work without any education and/or training can get an hourly wage me the same as someone who spent $250,000 to get a degree in order to be able to work. Now, if the mechanic opens a business, and is now a business owner, that\u2019s a different story. Think about journal electricians. They have to meet certain education and experience requirements.

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a little story. I was working for IBM with a job similar to a car mechanic (punched card machine service). I then got more training and my salary increased, modestly, over time. Eventually I realized that my knowledge had increased more than my pay. I was working along side of college graduates, but actually had more knowledge than some of them, who were making more money than I was making. I decided to go to college at night and get my bachelor\u2019s degree. After I got the degree my salary started increasing to the point that I doubled my salary in just a couple of years. Times may have changed, but I suspect that a college degree still demands more pay, especially if you do it with your own money. Same hours; more money. Don\u2019t get me wrong. You still need to back up that degree with marketable knowledge and performance. I had one IBM education class manager share this: In a job interview he had a guy brag about his PhD degree. The manager said \u201cwe won\u2019t hold that against you, as long as you don\u2019t let it get in the way of your job performance\u201d. ",

Both are semi-free choices. They are free to pursue either profession. Whether they have what it takes to actually make it into the profession is not necessarily free. Some mechanics make more than some lawyers. An independent mechanic can make $75/hr if he has developed a good reputation. And they can work as many hours as they choose. This can put them close to $200k/year if they want. Or you can be a mechanic working for a national chain making $15/hour. What is fair is making the money you agreed to. If you don't like $15/hr, you are free to pursue something that makes $100/hr. ",

It was also declared medical doctors get paid $20 per month. Why? Sweeping the streets is outdoors, it is a hot and sweaty job. It is dirty. Being a doctor is inside in air conditioning. It is in a nice easy clean environment. Becoming a medical doctor requires years of hard studying. It requires a lot of brains. There are a limited number of people who can do it. The average person could not be a doctor. It is rare enough, challenging enough that there must be additional compensation to attract and retain those few individuals who can do it. That is the law of supply and demand. On the other hand, sweeping the streets, while important and valued, does not require that level of training nor skills. One does not even have to know how to read to perform the job. Most everyone would be capable of doing the job. The law of supply and demand says there will always be plenty people who can do that job. So, what has happened? Without extra compensation, students have not become medical doctors. There is no financial motivation. Others, have fled to the United States, where they get paid more than those that sweep streets. This is Economics 101. If you do not fully understand it, you have a severe lacking in your education, or even basic logic and thinking. ",

But before I get started here, I want to say that I think everyone who works full time should make an actual living, like where they can pay their bills, eat food, live in thier own apartment, afford basic transportation, and even have a little money to live, like having a few beers on the weekend or going to the movies once in a while\u2026even if they work at McDonald's. I get why somebody who works at McDonald's should not earn as much as a lawyer or a mechanic: anybody could do it. But I still think any job should make you a living and pay all the bills. Now getting back to the mechanic and lawyer thing: I think they should. They both perform skilled work that the average person can't do. And in general, neither of them could easily trade careers with each other. I'd say most mechanics can't do lawyer stuff and most lawyers can't fix cars. So why is one more valuable than the other? if you have an answer, I'd like to hear it. But if you say lawyers are way more valuable, I'd have to ask why you think so. I bet you've needed your car repaired more often than you've needed a lawyer. In day to day life, mechanics are more vital to a functional society. ",

Our value to an employer and the measure of our value to the economy, is determined by the degree to which we prepare to earn a living.

If they are skilled, in limited supply, and in high demand, they will be paid accordingly. ",

The value the lawyer provides is in accordance with the capability and opportunities of the lives, people, contracts, and arrangements that he is able to enable. This is like comparing the output of a dump truck to that of a conveyor belt - the mechanic can deliver a discrete capability that can do a job - the lawyer can deliver a system of contracts/capabilities that allows a massive quantity of value to continually be delivered. On the market, the lawyer\u2019s time is worth more because the value delivered as a result of his activity is greater. Take this moral from it: it is always better to arrange and manage the rules of a value production system - like a lawyer or programmer - than it is to specific work on specific components - like a mechanic.

An expensive lawyer can charge $300 per hour and up (and under the right circumstances, the client would think it was a bargain). So lawyers potentially add more value than mechanics.

Not even close Is an excellent carpenter worth more than a \u2018good\u2019 chef? Probably the point is how long dies it take to become a good mechanic as compared to a good lawyer. Do the same thing with a physician to a good lawyer? My point should be clear- the mandatory education just to simply become an entry level lawyer is far greater than a mechanic. We pay for that added effort, It does not work 100% of the time since a Michelin chef\u2018s income easily can exceed the norm- but we are only really addressing the standard amount of time to become reasonably skilled.

Lawyers are well established but have to learn much longer. Their number in courts etc. is the only presence whereas mechanics are everywhere. So there is distribution wealth accordingly. Perchance if an individual is earning same amount (mechanic and lawyer), that would practically be possible but rarely. Thanks for reading. ",

Many leave the field as they cannot afford the cost of the office , etc etc. and the malpractice insurance. I don\u2019t know the going rate now but in 1991 it was 12k a year. This presumes no car mechanics makes good money. Just not so. I\u2019m going to use the example of my BIL. Not a mechanic but a body repair worker. I was blown away when I saw his restoration of an old Torino. He was always looking for a way out of body work He had no college. He had talent. I told him\u2026 Do what you know, do what you do well He did his first restoration in his garage of a rental house. Then he found a 3 car garage to rent. Now his restoration company is on 36 acres. He built a mansion for his family, the kind where the kitchen table seats 14. His property has a school house, an office, an additional 4 bedroom guest house and his business. You can\u2019t bring a car there for under 100,000 k , up front. So, I believe we work to our potentially and reap the rewards of our efforts. Clue, I don\u2019t live in a mansion after 37 years of practice. ",

If they work in a poor rural area, they\u2019re not going to find work if they charge New York City prices. Their level of education, training, skill and experience come into consideration. They have to think about how complex a given task may be, how long it will take, their own overhead and cost of doing business, and the risks that might be involved. The question could be asked of every job and profession, but there can be a fixed, one-size-fits-all answer. It\u2019s not realistic to compare what one profession may charge, versus what another profession charges, for completely different services. The bottom line is that people who are performing services are contracting with their customers/clients/patients and it\u2019s impossible to set prices solely on consideration of the time involved.

I think a program of internship for all lawyers, to be performed before admission would be a great plan. To be an effective attorney, one must not simply know a bunch of rules. One must be familiar with the history of court decisions in their field of law as well as the spectrum of history that relates to the procedures of the courts that have to host such controversies that we call cases. Then one must be able to take real life facts and apply those facts to the academic and legislative authorities which make up judicial opinions, and to persuasively communicate with real world, day to day people who are jurors.

Any, I\u2019ve read a few of the answers that mention Cuba and North Korea but perhaps no-one might mentioned Denmark where people don\u2019t have servants because the people that would be servants would make almost as much as the people employing them would. Does Denmark look like a typical communist dungeon? We have not \u2018created\u2019 the societies we live in, as some claim. They are the end points of historical processes and not one of us has much to do with making the society in which they live what it is. As far as morality is concerned, I\u2019d like to understand what justifies making some people live on tiny incomes for their entire lives whilst other people have more money than they could possibly use for the comparable period.
