            "answer_text": "I\u2019m hardly an expert on the topic, but I\u2019ll share some thoughts. A \u201ccultural relativist\u201d is someone who doubts that there exists any non-human value system or moral code. All such things are human inventions and, of course, standards for \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d vary incredibly depending on which society or historical period one happens to live in. Thus, since all values are culture-based one should refrain from praising or blaming the moral beliefs and practices of the past or of present societies of which you are not a member. If you, for some reason, want to condemn long dead people for something (say, owning slaves) or express your disgust at social practices in other countries today (say, female circumcision) then\u2014since there exists no universal moral code\u2014you are being \u201cethnocentric\u201d. This means that you are judging these things by your culture\u2019s values. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything necessarily bad about doing this (unless you are convinced that your society knows what\u2019s truly right and wrong and any person or society who thinks otherwise is wicked). So, to sum up: Cultural relativists are not inclined to judge the value systems of other peoples and societies at all. If they do, they know that they are being ethnocentric (and this generally makes them uncomfortable). Many ethnocentric people aren\u2019t made uncomfortable by condemning other peoples or practices because they tacitly assume that their culture\u2019s value system is superior (even if they reject morality as dictated by God or Reason).
