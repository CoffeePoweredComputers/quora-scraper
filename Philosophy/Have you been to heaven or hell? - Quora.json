            "answer_text": "We do not have to be physically there to explain it God has revealed to prophets some scenes from the afterlife We do not have enough information about the afterlife. We do not know about what God has prepared for the righteous obedient people All what is mentioned in the scripture are just examples of eternal youth and unlimited happiness There are verses to teach us that the heaven will be as wide as a universe There are many verses to teach us that people will be very happy there There are more verses to teach us that people will get whatever they wish There are more verses to teach us that people will not get bored and that they will not wish to change to any other environment Just think about the rich people who are willing to spend fortunes to stay young, attractive, and healthy Just think of the unlimited capabilities of the God who has created such a miraculous universe; do you think it is difficult for him to make an everlasting happiness as he promised? We have been warned that the good and the bad will be judged; all the deeds are recorded It will be very easy and very happy day for the obedient believers It will be a very sad and difficult time for the disbelievers and the wrongdoers God wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our faith and our deeds Qur\u2019an 27:83-85 is a scene from the hereafter, when we are asked \u2018what else have you been doing?\u2019. \u2018When they \u02f9finally\u02fa come before their Lord, He will ask \u02f9them\u02fa, \u201cDid you deny My revelations without \u02f9even\u02fa comprehending them? Or what else have you been doing?\u201d The sentence will be carried out against them for the consequence of their wrongdoings and they will not be able to utter a word\u2019. 28:65-66 is also a scene from the hereafter to warn those who reject the Prophets. \u2018And on that Day He will call unto them, and will ask: \"How did you respond to My messengers?\" but all arguments and excuses will by then have been erased from their minds, and they will not [be able to] obtain any [helpful] answer from one another\u2019 The following are some scenes from the judgement day as recorded in Qur\u2019an chapter 45 45:21 Do the evil doers think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do good deeds, and that their lives and deaths shall be alike? Bad is their judgment! 45:24 The disbelievers say: \"There is nothing but the life of this world? We live and die; nothing but time destroys us.\" In fact, they have no knowledge concerning this. They are merely guessing. 45:28-34 explain a scene from the hereafter; people will be rewarded for their deeds; all deeds are recorded. \u2018You shall see every nation on its knees. Every nation shall be summoned to its book of record, and Allah will say: \"Today you shall be rewarded for your deeds. This book of Ours speaks about you with the truth. Surely We have recorded all your deeds.\" As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their God will admit them into His mercy. That will be a glorious achievement. But as to those who disbelieved, Allah will say: \"Were My revelations not recited to you? But you showed arrogance and became a people of criminals\". It will be said: \"Today We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! Hellfire will be your home and none will be there to help you\u2019 Qur\u2019an 33:67-68 is a scene from the hereafter to teach that those who follow the arrogant leaders will be misled. 23:64-66 is a scene from the hereafter to warn those who prefer to live a luxury life ignoring God\u2019s message. \u2018But as soon as We seize their elite with torment, they start to cry for help. We shall say: \"Do not cry for help this Day, for surely from Us you shall receive no help\u2019. 46:20 is a scene from the hereafter to warn the arrogant people who did not obey but chose to enjoy a luxury life. \u02f9Watch for\u02fa the Day \u02f9when\u02fa the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. \u02f9They will be told, \u02fa \u201cYou \u02f9already\u02fa exhausted your \u02f9share of\u02fa pleasures during your worldly life, and \u02f9fully\u02fa enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no right, and for the transgressions you committed.\u201d That is similar to the wisdom taught by Jesus in Luke 16:25 17:14 is a scene from the hereafter teaches that each person will validate his records of his deeds. 32:12 is a scene from the hereafter to warn those who fail to do good deeds. \u2018If only you could see the wicked hanging their heads \u02f9in shame\u02fa before their Lord, \u02f9crying: \u02fa \u201cOur Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back and we will do good. We truly have sure faith \u02f9now\u02fa!\u201d 34:25-26 teach that everyone will be judged for his deeds only (not for the mistakes of fathers or others). \u2018Say: \"Neither shall you be called to account for whatever we may have become guilty of, nor shall we be called to account for whatever you are doing.\" Say, \u201cOur Lord will gather us together, then He will judge between us with the truth. For He is the All-Knowing Judge.\u201d 34:34 warns the people who have wealth and authority because those are usually the first people to reject the prophets. \u2018Whenever We sent a warner to a society, its elite would say, \u201cWe truly reject what you have been sent with.\u201d 35:37 is a scene from the hereafter to explain the conditions of the disobedient who wish to go back to life to do good deeds (although they are granted enough time to demonstrate their behavior). \u201cTherein they shall cry for help: \"Our God! Get us out, from now on we shall do good deeds and shall not repeat the ones we used to do\". The response will be: \"Did we not give you lives long enough so that he who would, could take a warning? Besides, someone did come to warn you. Now taste the fruit of your deeds, here there is no helper for the wrongdoers.\" 39:59-61 is a scene from the hereafter to warn the arrogant who deny the signs and revelations. \u2018Not at all! My revelations had already come to you, but you rejected them, acted arrogantly, and were one of the disbelievers.\u201d On the Day of Judgment you will see those who lied about Allah with their faces gloomy. Is Hell not a \u02f9fitting\u02fa home for the arrogant? On the contrary, Allah will deliver the righteous to their place of salvation. No harm shall touch them, nor shall they ever grieve.\u2019 Qur\u2019an 39:71-74 After the Judgement, the Unbelievers will be driven to hell in groups. When they reach there, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: \"Did there not come to you messengers from among yourselves, who recited to you the revelations of God and warned you about the meeting of this Day?\" \"Yes,\" they will answer. But at that time the sentence of punishment would have been already announced against the unbelievers.\" It will be said to them, \u201cEnter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever.\u201d What an evil home for the arrogant! And those who were mindful of their Lord will be led to Paradise in \u02f9successive\u02fa groups. When they arrive at its \u02f9already\u02fa open gates, its keepers will say, \u201cPeace be upon you! You have done well, so come in, to stay forever.\u201d They will say: \"Praise be to Allah Who has truly fulfilled His promise and gave us this land to inherit, now we can live in paradise wherever we like.\" How excellent will be the reward for the righteous? As recorded in Qur\u2019an 52:35-36 disbelievers will be asked: \u2018Were they created without a Creator? Or were they their own creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? In fact, they have no firm belief\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "We have probably all heard these stories of near death experiences where people claim they have visited heaven. Now I have no desire to try and debunk these; for one thing they almost need to be addressed case by case. But what makes more sense is to say we can momentarily experience what seems like heaven. The reason I say this is that actual heaven is not someplace one would logically want to turn away from. Leaving the real heaven where you have unparalleled freedom as well as unimaginable joy \u2026 well it would make more sense to crawl back into your mother\u2019s womb. God accepts us into heaven, pulls us into heaven, and knows we are ready for it. If you truly are in heaven a judgement has been made that is as final as crossing a veil, or leaving a world of sorrows. It is not something done with capriciousness. We could perhaps say the same for hell. Who would logically want to be in hell? It's more reasonable to say the pain of it scares us out of any fascination we might have. We only need at most a few seconds of pain to make us turn completely away from it. ",
