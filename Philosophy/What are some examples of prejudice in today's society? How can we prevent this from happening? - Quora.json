            "answer_text": "There are all kinds of prejudices, and you could probably get a list by googling for \u201clist of prejudices.\u201d My parents did a good job of preventing prejudice formation when I was growing up. My father was a Roosevelt Democrat in a region that had been troubled by the KKK in the early decades of the 20th century. His grandparents had probably had to deal with prejudices when they came over from Ireland. My mother had been deeply influenced, I think, by the fact that her mother took her on long car trips from Nebraska to Kentucky to visit the old woman who had taken care of my grandmother as a baby and child, and had probably saved her from her abusive mother who had severed the spinal cord on one of her brothers. She saw a mother whom she knew well in a close affectionate relationship with a woman who had once been a slave. My father was raised Catholic and my mother was raised Presbyterian. I infer that there was a lot of negative emotions expressed against this mixed marriage. So perhaps they suffered their own kind of prejudice, which would have further strengthened their attitudes toward imposed stereotypes. The result was that I never heard the N word or any other terms of racial abuse about any other group while I was growing up. I also saw no displays of nastiness toward members of any other group. It was also to my advantage that such disrespectful terms were never tolerated in our public schools. The prohibition against expressing racist ideas must have taken force very early because I can\u2019t remember hearing anybody using a racist term in public discussions until I entered university. Parents have a big responsibility for explaining to their children why people in the media sometimes make racist claims. My father impressed on my the idea that it takes at least three generations for people who become citizens to work themselves into a state of integration and equality (in terms of capabilities) with more established groups. Since he was third generation Irish he could have been talking about himself. ",

            "answer_text": "Prejudice is, by definition, the forming of opinions (judging) pre-vious to knowing (\u201cpre-judge.) Deciding to dislike a person without meeting that person, or doing the same regarding a nationality or \u201crace\u201d of people, or a city or anything else, without knowing, is automatically irrational. A person who says \u201cI don\u2019t like black people,\u201d is being irrational because s/he doesn\u2019t know all black people, and may not know any black people. As an aside, here, I recommend to anyone who wishes to be knowledgeable about any group of people, that they get to know some of those people in a family setting. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll see them as themselves, and not just as they are, out in the world where most of the people around you are white. Black people will not be their natural selves in a predominantly-white setting. Out there, they\u2019re subject to unexpected criticism, racial slurs, or awkward situations that embarrass and anger them. The tension will prevent your getting to know a person under those circumstances. There\u2019s a trend I\u2019ve noticed, lately, of people saying things like, \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to tell you, I\u2019m a very prejudiced person.\u201d They\u2019re bragging about being ignorant and irrational. I have misquoted how they actually say this. They say \u201c\u2026a very prejudice person\u201d without the \u201cd\u201d at the end. The trendiness of deliberate ignorance in some elements of society is a dangerous development. Soon, it will meet in a dovetailing fashion, with the demonizing of education. This makes people like Mike Pence especially worthy of being watched. I will be very surprised if he does not have detailed plans for a theocratic society, already drawn up, with religious leaders and like-minded people penciled in for positions like \u201cAdult Religious Instruction.\u201d To return to the subject at hand, we can prevent prejudice from happening, by finding out what a thing or a person is like, before making a judgment or a conclusion about that thing or that person. And we can re-think judgments or conclusions we\u2019ve made in the past, that were not based on knowledge, that continue to inform the things we think and do, in the present. ",
