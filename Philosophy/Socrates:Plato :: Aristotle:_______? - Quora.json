            "answer_text": "In terms of famous founding Greek philosophers there was no exceptional figure who was a student of Aristotle who came up with an originsl system counter to that of his teacher as Aristotle did with Plato. Part of the reason may have been that during Aristotles time therr werr stufents devoted to Plato\u2019s philosophy who rejected Aristotles ideas. Thus the Greek philosophers afterwards tended to split into two camps; either folloerrs or those influenced by Plato or those influenced by Aristotle. Also the fact that Alexander the Great emtered on a campaign of conquest instead of philosophy kinda stopped that progression. That split can be seen in the medieval philosophical debates beyween Augustine and Aquinas as well as the modern debates betwen Descartes and Locke. Hegel even viewed these as part of a dialectic so naturally according to his worldview (didn\u2019t study enough Hegel to know if he directly addressed those two philosophers), these two will be opposed to each other which leaves no room for another philosopher to come after Plato and Aristotle who could rise to as mhch prominence and influence as they did.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if Aristotle had any major philosophy students that are remembered today. But he did tutor Alexander the Great! That\u2019s the mentorship that tends to be remembered. Arguably the result was influence on the entire Roman Empire. If we want to take a long view about the influence of their respective logics, I\u2019m haughty enough to say that if Socrates resulted in Plato\u2019s founding of Western Philosophy, Aristotle\u2019s logic (which I call causal inference) had an heir in my own logical theory of objectivity, which I call non-causal inference. More on that HERE: Nathan Coppedge's answer to What is categorical deduction? There is some doubt whether Alexander\u2019s education was really taken to heart. But it certainly sealed Aristotle\u2019s fate as a major western philosopher. ",
