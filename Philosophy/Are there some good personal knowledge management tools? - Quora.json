            "answer_text": "Of course there are, many of which probably reside on your smart phone already. But the first step shouldn\u2019t be deciding if there are any good options out there, rather identifying what will work best for you. After all, a hammer is a pretty good tool until you\u2019re looking to drive a screw. I would suggest you consider a few of the following prior to looking for the right solution for you: What are you looking to accomplish? Is your goal simply to have a resource point for you to reference?Will you be sharing/collaborating with others? If so, who? Do they need access to all information or only part? How will you manage this?What types of information do you need your tool to house? Text, images, videos, PDFs, etc.?What additional functionalities do you need from a solution? Ability to chat, sort data, search for information, etc.What is your budget? Money often opens the door to more functionality, but it\u2019s not always necessary.If you\u2019ve already done your due diligence and answered these questions (or some similar ones) then kudos. If not, perhaps now is the time to start thinking about this. At the very least, it should help you narrow down some of the fantastic suggestions that have been provided here.

Nowadays the organizations work in a regulated environment so it requires a qualified tool not only from the perspective of end-users but also for the users as well. Here\u2019s is what an efficient Knowledge management tool should support Rich Authoring experience- Editing should be hassle-free. The editor should be easy to use for all technical and non-technical users. It is good to have a simple drag and drop option so that we spend less time creating codes. Intelligent Search-the knowledge base is vast and to enable quick search you need a smart search engine that picks relevant article and produce accurate results. Backup and restore- When you are working in a fast-paced environment we are prone to make mistakes, if someone accidentally deletes an article it should be recoverable. Collaboration-Collaborating and knowledge sharing are vital for any knowledge management tool. Bringing the team together on a single platform for discussion makes it easier for decision making. supports innovative ideas and process improvements. Structured content- The contents need to be highly structured, easy to navigate with a tree view structure. Categories need to be organized at top levels and articles should be carried in the relevant categories Analytics- This very crucial for any knowledge management platform, you need to gain insight into how the platform is performing, understand the knowledge gap, how to improve and update the right article. Integrations- In reality, there is no all in one tool, you need options to integrate with other third-party tools that you will use on a daily basis. Say a CRM or helpdesk tool or any other internal collaboration tools. Workflow- Roles and permissions features and extremely efficient define process flow. there are multiple users in an environment so you need to assign roles and restrict accessibility in order to avoid spamming the knowledge base. Investing ina knowledge management tool is a long term commitment, so it is wise to take a free trial before investing on the platform.

            "answer_text": "This really cannot be answered without some context to one's purpose. Using a workshop metaphor, that's like asking should I buy a hammer or a screwdriver? I suppose the metaphorical answer you want is what tools would a basic workshop find most useful. Here are some tool categories. Within these categories you can find the most appropriate solution. 1. Enterprise Content Management: tools that manage knowledge in a document-centric fashion (Alfresco, SharePoint, Documentum, etc.). 2. Enterprise Social: tools that connect people in the enterprise (Yammer, Chatter, Jive, etc.) 3. Analytic Tools: tools that analyze, interpret and report big data esp. using Hadoop ( Pentaho, Skytree, Splunk). 4. Web 2.0 Platforms: tools that allow sharing such as blogs and wikis (Opentext, MediaWiki, Page on blogger.net) 5. Collaboration Platforms: tools that allow team and project collaboration (Basecamp, Slack, Box, Huddle, etc.) 6. KM Systems: centralize data from multiple sources and serve as a knowledge repository (Kana, Confluence, Salesforce, etc). 7. Enterprise Search: aggregates and collects data across many sources for search ability (Autonomy, Coveo, GOOG appliance, etc). My advice would be to match your needs to a tool category (or categories). Then research for the most appropriate tool.  Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "One of the core tenet of Knowledge Centered Support (KCS) is UFFA. This refers to what a support person can do once they\u2019ve performed a search against your knowledgebase to answer their question. Your knowledge management tool should support the four options, which stand for: Use it. If the knowledge is perfect and answers the question directly, then you\u2019ll want some way to track that. \u201cUsing it\u201d typically refers to linking a closed support case to the article ID as a vote for the quality and completeness of the content. You can use these links to influence the search algorithm, reward the author, or prioritize review.Fix it. If there is something incorrect in the article, or it\u2019s not complete enough to totally solve the issue at hand, the support agent should immediately fix it. You\u2019ll want to have a system that allows for easy editing, as well as any peer review or oversight needed to get those fixes published quickly and reliably. Don\u2019t forget to reward edits alongside new content creation. A lot of times the edits are just as valuable or more valuable than new content.Flag it. It\u2019s possible the answer isn\u2019t perfect, but the agent accessing it doesn\u2019t know how to fix it. In that case you\u2019ll want a mechanism for them to flag the article for review. Maybe it goes up to another team, or is added to an agenda for a group discussion. You might also consider allowing public users to flag content if it wasn\u2019t successful in deflecting their case.Add it. If no answer exists, it should be easy to add it. You should incentivize, celebrate, and reward new additions. But be careful not to create quotas. The easier it is to create a new article, the better. Maybe an integration to the case tracking system auto-populates some fields. I would also suggest some mechanism to force compliance with style or quality guidelines. Pass it through the review process quickly and get it out just in time to service the customer who had that request.There are lots of other features and bells and whistles a modern knowledge management platform can offer, but if you\u2019ve got UFFA covered, it should be a good solution.

Obie gives universal access to knowledge from a single source of truth across numerous silos, including Google Drive, Confluence, Github, Dropbox, Box, Trello and more. You can conduct searches from their convenient Chrome Browser Extension. Also, this tool allows you to capture frequently reused text in snippet form for fast access without having to search sticky notes or random text files stored on your computer desktop. All of these features help people manage knowledge better without having to invest time or effort into organizing files. ",

It\u2019s a team knowledge base tool but would also work fine for a single user managing personal documentation. It\u2019s a web-based app and is pretty flexible and minimalist. You can create real-time collaborative documents and connect them instantly like a wiki, visualizing your data in a mind map. The best part is that it\u2019s free. There is also a free mobile app available in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.   ",
