            "answer_text": "If your parent is negligent or doesn\u2019t want you and your grades, (especially) attendance, and behavior at school manage not to suffer due to running away, you could get away with that. If you don\u2019t have alternative support your grades and behavior and other grounds for suspicion will arise at school. Some schools may be slummy enough that no one will care, but severe truancy almost always will get reported. If you are reported as a runaway though by your parents or by your school or by someone else, you may end up in a group home, as a state-dependent if parents deemed abusive of neglectful, as a juvenile delinquent or incorrigible (chronic runaway / truant), or a dual-label (dependent/delinquent). If someone illegally takes you in as a runaway and you are reported as a runaway and find you at their place, they could face criminal charges. There are a number of cases where someone has moved into their boyfriend\u2019s / girlfriend\u2019s / best friend\u2019s house (or their even aunt / uncle) and taken in by their parents that have gone un-reported and life has gone well, but it is taking a chance. The only way for such out-of-CPS kinship or fictive-kinship placement to be legal is to file for a voluntary assignment of legal guardianship, which is easy in some states (very easy in AZ, also very easy to revoke), but requires full consent of your own parents as well as the other\u2019s parents. For dependency (but not delinquency) CPS does seek kinship placement with other family - divorced other-parent, aunt, uncle, 21+ adult sibling or cousin, grandparent usually, sometimes willing to place across state boundaries. In many states they don\u2019t need to get themselves or their home foster-parent certified, but they will need to if they want state foster child support money. A CPS-involve kinship placement yu are still ward of the state, and CPS is obligated by law to seek reformation of and reunification with the original parents. BF/GF/BFF require a lot of things to be aligned right for a fictive kinship label (Usually want parents and children being friends, parents having more weight, to create a fictive uncle/aunt type of relationship). If there is no possibility of kinship placement you will end up in foster care, most likely a state-run group home as a teen, and your contact with your BF/GF/BFF will be notably reduced if not eliminated unless the foster parent (if fortunate to get into a family foster home and not a state group home) goes out of the way to accommodate your relationship. Early emancipation is improbable for those that seek it because of a sucky home life. Early emancipation is more appropriate for the smart and mature teens who already have substantial income that need to make deals and contracts without their parents on the liability hook or the stigma of being a legal minor. Early emancipation is often successful in cases of un-reported partial or full abandonment of where the teen has managed to support himself somehow. Early emancipation is nigh impossible if you can\u2019t show the court that you have been and can continue to support yourself without committing crimes or living off of welfare. Early emancipation is much more difficult if not impossible if your parents contest the early emancipation. If your emancipation filing court papers smell of abuse or neglect, the judge will report it to CPS and CPS may butt in and pre-empt your emancipation filing with a dependency petition filing. Foster care is generally very unpleasant particularly for teens, but if your home abuse or neglect situation is very bad, foster care may result in an improvement in quality of life. CPS will take 16 and 17 year olds with enough outside pressure, severe enough abuse/neglect case, if disability is involved, or if there are younger siblings involved in the abusive or neglectful home.

            "answer_text": "Well, you jumped on Quora and asked essentially the same question three times in a 20 minute time span. This indicates a possible lack of patience on your part. So does wanting to leave home with no real practical means of supporting yourself. So, as others have said wait until your 18. The legality of leaving before that in Texas I\u2019ve no clue of, but wait. During this waiting time, use it wisely, and determine what jobs you\u2019ll be able to do based on your education near where you live. I say near where you live as I\u2019m guessing you have no money. Having trouble finding a job is a technically a different topic and you could probably look up a lot of good answers to that on Quora. Just starting out, with hopefully a high school diploma, you need to look at labor, retail, trade unions, or the military. For best chances at long term success you should also consider going to college as soon as you get out on your own as well. It sounds as if you have a bad relationship with you parent(s)/guardian(s). Is there some way you can work on that and find a way to make your life more tolerable at home? Examine conflicts you have had from a neutral perspective, are you to blame for any of the problems? I say this because it is very rare for parents to ground someone for no reason at all. ",
