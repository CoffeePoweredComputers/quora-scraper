            "answer_text": "Bells theorm has confirmed the non locality, superposition, and interwoven characteristics of microscopic world. With that we can say that we reached the end of our rational mind. The common sense concepts of time, space and causality are just limited to even talk about subatomic reality. They are insufficient and simply we have to talk about nature of reality as beyond human perception, there is something behind sentient world of microscopic or macroscopic reality. , we have to doubt our freewill and talk about superdeterminism .we have to doubt our individuality and talk about participation in divine dance.thus quantum mechanics is not final answer but indicator of reality as divine play. #cosmology ",

            "answer_text": "That would depend on the context of the question really. Quantum physics is the first stepping stone into understanding that frequency is the key to understanding everything possible to ask a question about in the sense that looking through the keyhole is the first glance into a room. Yet, everything is both simultaneously quantum and not quantum. you must understand not only the destination but the bridges and stones between them to understand everything. ",
