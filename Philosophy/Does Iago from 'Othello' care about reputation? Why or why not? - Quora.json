Iago treats reputation contemptuously, this can be proven by his words to Cassio: \u201dReputation\u2019 is an idle and most false imposition, oft got without merit, and lost without deserving.\u2019' (2.3.269-270) As well, even toward the end of the play, where his evil deeds are revealed, he refuses to plead or explain. Iago says nothing for his situation; he does not restore his reputation. However, he uses the power of reputation to create destruction and tragedy. ",
