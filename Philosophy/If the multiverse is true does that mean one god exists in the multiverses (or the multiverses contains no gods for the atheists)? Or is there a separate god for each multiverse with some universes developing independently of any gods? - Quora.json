            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201cIf the multiverse is true does that mean one god exists in the multiverses (or the multiverses contains no gods for the atheists)? Or is there a separate god for each multiverse with some universes developing independently of any gods?\u201d If there is a God, then there can be only one. God is by definition the creator of everything. The existence of physically independent multiverses is irrelevant. Our inability to connect with other universes is a material limitation; God, being non-material, does not have that (or any other) limitation. The following statement about \u201cworlds\u201d applies to multiverses as well as to planets: As to thy question concerning the worlds of God. Know thou of a truth that the worlds of God are countless in their number, and infinite in their range. None can reckon or comprehend them except God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. \u2014Tablets of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, Tablet to Vaf\u00e1. Here is a more general description of the relationship of God to creation: Know thou that every created thing is a sign of the revelation of God. Each, according to its capacity, is, and will ever remain, a token of the Almighty. Inasmuch as He, the sovereign Lord of all, hath willed to reveal His sovereignty in the kingdom of names and attributes, each and every created thing hath, through the act of the Divine Will, been made a sign of His glory. So pervasive and general is this revelation that nothing whatsoever in the whole universe can be discovered that doth not reflect His splendor. Under such conditions every consideration of proximity and remoteness is obliterated.\u2026 Were the Hand of Divine power to divest of this high endowment all created things, the entire universe would become desolate and void. Behold, how immeasurably exalted is the Lord your God above all created things! Witness the majesty of His sovereignty, His ascendancy, and supreme power. If the things which have been created by Him\u2014magnified be His glory\u2014and ordained to be the manifestations of His names and attributes, stand, by virtue of the grace with which they have been endowed, exalted beyond all proximity and remoteness, how much loftier must be that Divine Essence that hath called them into being?\u2026 Meditate on what the poet hath written: \u201cWonder not, if my Best-Beloved be closer to me than mine own self; wonder at this, that I, despite such nearness, should still be so far from Him.\u201d\u2026 Considering what God hath revealed, that \u201cWe are closer to man than his life-vein,\u201d the poet hath, in allusion to this verse, stated that, though the revelation of my Best-Beloved hath so permeated my being that He is closer to me than my life-vein, yet, notwithstanding my certitude of its reality and my recognition of my station, I am still so far removed from Him. By this he meaneth that his heart, which is the seat of the All-Merciful and the throne wherein abideth the splendor of His revelation, is forgetful of its Creator, hath strayed from His path, hath shut out itself from His glory, and is stained with the defilement of earthly desires. It should be remembered in this connection that the one true God is in Himself exalted beyond and above proximity and remoteness. His reality transcendeth such limitations. His relationship to His creatures knoweth no degrees. That some are near and others are far is to be ascribed to the manifestations themselves. \u2014Gleanings from the Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, number XCIII. ",

            "answer_text": "The ancient world was full of beliefs about gods or a God, all with a similar intent, to aspire to power against the gods of the ruling class. Some developed into true \u2018gnostic\u2019 religions. In the society of the elites, the rulers were the gods, which led to complete lawlessness. Today there are a mixed bag of philosophy, taboos and talismans, as well as the most popular faiths, Christianity, Islam and Judaism. All the rest are conveniently located within small groups and tribes. Some of the most interesting off-shoots were people who believed in two gods, one evil and one good. Others placed faith in an object of sacredness, as they were opposed to secularism. The religion that I was interested most, was about a female cult which centered around the figurehead Sophia. The multiverse had exactly seven Universes which cycled around in succession. Each had archons which vaguely represented each (one at a time) and correspond to Jesus Christ and a female archon, which in our world would conspire to pull of a schemata of what I suppose were the \u201cbest of all possible worlds.\u201d We are likely to call that female the demiurge, who was a creator of the material. She could not be trusted to perform the most forgiving path, and some say the demiurge was a mistake. ",

            "answer_text": "One of these things being true doesn't make the other thing true, even if this is exactly how it all works. There is no reason to even think that these two things would be tied together in any way. That's why discussing things that have no evidence whatsoever and then asking how they would interact with each other is completely worthless because it's just as speculative as writing fiction. You might as well write some SciFi/fantasy rather than waste time wondering if it all could be real out there somewhere. The multiverse theory has no evidence and is not actually even a real theory, same with the God hypothesis. ",

Or is there a separate god for each multiverse with some universes developing independently of any gods? A: It depends on the god and the mythology describing many worlds. Odin is the master of the nine worlds of Yggdrasil, for instance; while the God of Christianity only masters this world and the heavens, while Hell falls under the municipality of Stj\u00f8rdal, Norway. Oh, you meant reality? Sorry, we don\u2019t know which multiverse hypothesis is true, if any; and the existence of gods is basically untestable. ",
