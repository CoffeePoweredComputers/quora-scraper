            "answer_text": "How can I possibly understand hindsight bias from everyday examples? From Examples of Hindsight Bias: On the evening of an important World Series game, your friend predicts that the Red Sox are going to win by a large margin. In fact, the Red Sox do end up winning the game, causing your friend to boast \u201cI predicted it!\u201d A letter comes in the mail informing an individual that he was accepted into a college. When he tells his mother she says, \u201cI really had a feeling that you were going to get in\u201d (even though she had expressed doubts to his father earlier that week). An individual notices that outside, it\u2019s beginning to look a little bit gray. He says to himself, I bet that it\u2019s going to rain this afternoon. When it actually does rain, the individual tells himself that he was certain that it would when he saw the clouds rolling in earlier. You are nervous to take an exam for which you waited to study until the very last minute. When you take the exam, you feel unsure about the results; however, when your grade comes back a B+, you exclaim to your friends, \u201cI was sure that I\u2019d aced that exam!\u201d and actually believe it in hindsight. On a snowy night, a police officer predicts that it\u2019s the perfect condition for a teenaged driver to get into a fender-bender. When the police scanner says that a driver who had just received her license skidded into a mailbox, the officer tells himself that he had been certain such a thing would happen on that night, of all nights. Three friends decide to bet on a horse race. One of them breaks from the other two and chooses a horse with very low winning odds, saying that he has a good feeling about that horse. The long shot ends up winning, prompting the friend to claim he\u2019d been certain of the outcome. A young lady waits for a telephone call from a gentleman she\u2019s given her number to several nights before. In spite of his not calling for three nights, he finally does on the fourth. The girl\u2019s best friend says, although it took him longer than expected, she knew that he would call eventually. When gearing up to go camping, a father says that he just knows someone is going to forget something. It turns out that his son forgot his fishing rod. \"I was sure it would happen,\" says the father. After a long night out, two friends stop at a diner. One orders coffee and the other says, \"you might feel tired now, but that\u2019s gonna keep you awake, I bet.\" It actually happens, and the second friend insists that he was sure it would. A boy sends a poem into a popular poetry journal and says he thinks he has a good shot at getting published, even though deep down he doesn\u2019t believe it. When he gets the acceptance letter, he immediately replies that he predicted it. Hope this is helpful! ",
