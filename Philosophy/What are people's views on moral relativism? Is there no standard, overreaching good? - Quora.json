            "answer_text": "I tend to feel that it's quite likely that the universe is indifferent to our moral judgments---that, objectively, there exists no absolute morality. I also tend to feel that for our *human* societies in this mutual *human* experience, moral judgments and moral behavior (ideally arising from genuine compassion and empathy rather than fear of punishment, inherited dictates, etc.) are indispensable and comprise the essential fabric of any cohesive, worthwhile, sustainable, and mutually uplifting community of *humans*.  I furthermore extend this feeling of the importance of morality to all sentient beings, primarily on the basis of my strong suspicion that suffering fucking sucks for all animals, just like it sucks for me. Objectively, my suffering might not mean shit, but *subjectively*, it makes all the difference in my life, and presumably the lives of every other being capable of suffering. To quote Kierkegaard, \"subjectivity is truth\" and \"truth is subjectivity\". I've basically reached the conclusion (though I'm always open to reevaluation) that to argue over the existence of some objective, absolute morality is to miss the point. Ethical judgment and behavior are suffering-reducing, potentially-world-saving outgrowths of our status as rational, empathizing beings. We need moral feeling and action, now as badly as ever (or more than ever). We don't need to be able to write down infallible moral precepts to be able to know suffering and feel the importance of trying not to inflict it and to reduce it where possible.

            "answer_text": "Kohlberg (1981) identified one level of moral development (a subset of group four of six sequential levels) wherein the individual practices relativism, choosing to be morally guided by what is best for them at the moment.Symbolic interactionism (SI, a type of interpretivism) seems related to relativism, and is a sociological theory indicating that ethical behavior may be dependent on time and place; and, an individual's behavior can be divergent or even conflictual, depending on the setting. SI could, and probably does impact all ethical systems, due to the survival instinct.  Kohlberg (1981) wrote that Skinner equated positive reinforcement with good, which Kohlberg identified as fallacious.  \u201cThe psychologist\u2019s fallacy or the naturalistic fallacy is a fallacy because we can always ask the question \u2018Why is that good?\u2019\u201d (p. 67).  Skinner did not deal with this value judgment, which is what classifies this theory as relativism; there is no frame of reference for good or evil, there is only that which is good for a particular individual or culture, notwithstanding the effects on other persons or cultures.  Maslow (1971) stated that he was convinced that the value-free, value-neutral, value-avoiding model of science that we inherited from physics, chemistry, and astronomy, where it was necessary and desirable to keep data clean and also to keep the church out of scientific affairs, is quite unsuitable for the study of life. (p.5)   Maslow went on to state that such relativism \u201cis not only wrong, but is dangerous as well\u201d and provided the example of Nazism (p. 20), as did Kohlberg (1981). Kohlberg (1981) devised a rather intricate moral judgment theory involving three levels, with one sub-level, and six stages extending through the levels.  The progression through these levels is an individual matter, and attainment of the higher levels is not universal.  The levels are A. preconventional, B. conventional (with a transitional sub-level), and C. postconventional and principled. Level A, Stage 1: \u201cRight is literal obedience to rules and authority, avoiding punishment, and not doing physical harm\u201d (Kohlberg, 1981, p. 409).  Stage 2: \u201cRight is serving one\u2019s own or other\u2019s needs and making fair deals in terms of concrete exchange\u201d (Kohlberg, 1981, p. 409).  Level B, Stage 3: \u201cThe right is playing a good (nice) role, being concerned about the other people and their feelings, keeping loyalty and trust with partners, and being motivated to follow rules and expectations\u201d (Kohlberg, 1981, p. 410).  Stage 4: \u201cThe right is doing one\u2019s duty in society, upholding the social order, and maintaining the welfare of society or the group\u201d (Kohlberg, 1981, p. 410).   Level B/C, Stage 4 \u00bd: \u201c[C]hoice is personal and subjective.  It is based on emotions, conscience is seen as arbitrary and relative, as are ideas such as \u2018duty\u2019 and \u2018morally right.\u2019 ... One can pick and choose obligations, which are defined by particular societies, but one has no principles for such choice\u201d (Kohlberg, 1981, p. 411). Level C, Stage 5: \u201cThe right is upholding the basic rights, values, and legal contracts of a society, even when they conflict with the concrete rules and laws of the group\u201d (Kohlberg, 1981, p. 411).  Stage 6: \u201cThis stage assumes guidance by universal ethical principles that all humanity should follow\u201d (Kohlberg, 1981, p. 412).Robb, D. L. (2002).
