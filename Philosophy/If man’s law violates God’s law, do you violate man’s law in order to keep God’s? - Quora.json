There might be two things that come into conflict where you would have to make a tough decision, but you\u2019ve chosen the wrong two things. If man\u2019s law violates our moral conscience, we should both strive to fix the law and be conscientious objectors where appropriate. If God\u2019s law violates our moral conscience, we should again be conscientious objectors where appropriate. If you belong to a church that doesn\u2019t allow people of different races to marry, you should step up and say that this is wrong. Similarly if they don\u2019t allow two people of the same sex to marry. If there were laws like in Nazi Germany, of course you should violate these laws as a reasonable conscience would dictate. ",

            "answer_text": "A long time ago when I was a young Lieutenant, a Major was lecturing my class on the duty to obey lawful orders. During a pause, I raised my hand and posed this question: \u201cWhat if an order is legal, but immoral? In Nazi Germany it was legal to shoot Jews!\u201d The Major became quite angry, and blew off my question with, \u201cOh, that\u2019s an extreme example that would never happen here. In this military, you just obey!\u201d Discretion being a great virtue, I didn\u2019t press the point.  There are situations where a higher moral code overrides any legal code. George Washington broke British laws. Martin Luther King broke segregation laws. All people must be willing to obey their consciences rather than unjust laws, for this is the only guarantee against despotism. ",

I\u2019ll simplify it as I\u2019ve flooded most of these rules and would only ask why not worship other gods and why keep the sabbath holy. In term son man I\u2019m more likely to follow it has man provides a good reason to follow is laws most of the time follow these laws or else. I wouldn\u2019t consider myself bound by either set of laws there there laws not mine and it\u2019s just the opinion though the laws of man tend to be enforced. ",
