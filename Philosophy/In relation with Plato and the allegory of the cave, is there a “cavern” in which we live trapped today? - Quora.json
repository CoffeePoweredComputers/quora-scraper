            "answer_text": "Yes, there does exist such a place. We humans labor under a perspective that our consciousness experiences our environment directly. This viewpoint is necessary so that we may orient to our environment and survive. It gives us that real-time feel to environmental interaction. But our consciousness is formed as an internal model that has been created to give us the most accurate perceptual rendition of our environment. A rendition that will allow us to develop a rational conceptual approach so that we may elicit appropriate or desired responses to the physical world. This model would be our cave. We are built to eliminate information from incoming stimuli. We are each bombarded with an indescribable multitudinous cacophony of stimuli and we need to weed out everything except the trickle that will fit the patterns we have adopted to orient and thrive. Pertinent stimuli are entertained, and we then make snap judgments about what to do with the obtained data. Sometimes we chain together logical sets of concepts but most of the time it is a \u201cfly by the seat of your pants\u201d thought process. Psychologists have shown that if someone writes a cogent paragraph and then maintains each word\u2019s length along with its first and last letter, they can put random letters in between the first and last letter and people can still read the original paragraph. This is the work of mental structures that oversee an organism\u2019s total orientation. One that starts developing from birth. Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave would illustrate a man whose consciousness divorced itself from its model and, somehow received direct exposure to all the stimuli which was surrounding his body. This can only be done as an allegory. The main difference between the Plato\u2019s allegory and reality is that each human possesses his own cave. There is no group of men living with him, except as shadows on the wall. A real human possesses an internal coherency that combines all experiences, perceptions, propensities, symbol use and agendas into a clear and malleable sensory/conceptual structure which can then be used to orient to the physical world. This is a cavern possessed by all sentient organisms. The more complex the organism, the more elaborate the cavern. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes as I understand Plato\u2019s cave allegory, there is still a similar cavern today that keeps us trapped and I feel sure that if Plato came back to life now, he would immediately recognise that in spite of our technological advancements since his time, human nature has not change one at all, and as I understand it, it does not appear as being difficult to understand. In his cave allegory, Plato claim that apparently early in life, we were chained to the floor of a cave, and forced to look at the back wall of the cave, and up above and behind us, there was a fire burning, and objects were placed in front of that fire so that the reflections of those objects would appear as shadows on the back wall of the cave, and since people had never seen anything else but those reflections, they accepted and believed those reflections to be reality. As I understand it, Plato believe that people\u2019s perception of reality was shaped by illusions of reality, and that being what other people or society was expecting them to believe to be true. In other words, Plato apparently believed that people\u2019s perception of reality was shaped by being expected to conform with what they saw, heard, and experienced from a position of being at the mercy of the world, and in this manner, people were prisoners with a flawed perception of reality that would fuel the intensity of their individual struggle in the world. It thus naturally follows that on their quest for happiness, and directly because of their flawed perception of reality, along with difficult or demanding conditions they are forced to endure, it was inevitable that people would end up making mistakes that could lead to devastating and painful negative consequences. It thus appear that people were bound to reach a point when it would become near impossible for them to deny responsibility and were forced to admit to themselves that they made a mistake, and that is when Plato apparently claimed in his allegory, that every once in a while, a person had the opportunity to unchained them self, and they could turn around and look into the back beneath the fire, in the deepest and darkest part of the cave, and there they could see a dim ray of light, and if they could make the choice of following that dim ray of light, it would eventually take them outside the cave and into the bright sun light where they would see reality with clarity. As I understand it, whenever something goes wrong to the degree that someone is forced to admit to themselves that they made a mistake, they are forced to abandon what they obviously had believe to be what was true to them, and they must look into the blackness of the unknown if they are to discover the truth they need to prevent them self from repeating the same mistakes over and over again, and it is understandable that from a position of responsibility, looking into the direction in which we might be wrong, is being on a quest for what is true, and what is true is bound to first begin to appear as a dim ray of light, which might actually be hope. What is true is that we discover a truth, whenever we discover where we are wrong. That is the way we can discover that mistakes are actually necessary opportunities to discover the most important truths we need to fully grasp and understand in order to ease the intensity of our own individual struggle in this world Indeed, in our modern time, we encourage our children to get a university degree and force them to choose a career before they can even know what they might like to do with their lives, and many government will give them student loans so that they end up heavily in debt before they even start working and it all appears that we are doing them a good turn for their own sake and success, and it is before they even start work that TV commercials will tell them what they should like and should want to buy, and if anyone does not want to conform, they become at risk of ending up in jail. Etc\u2026!!! Indeed, I believe it to be true that human nature has not changed since Plato\u2019s time, and the cavern in his cave allegory, continues to exists to this day. ",
