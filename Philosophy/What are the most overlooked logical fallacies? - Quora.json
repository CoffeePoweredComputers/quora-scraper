            "answer_text": "What are the most overlooked logical fallacies? The ones that don't matter. Every widely-used logical fallacy relating to any important issue gets called out all the time. My favorites are Because I SAID so. (Variants: Because Jesus/God/the Bible/the Qur'an/Hitler/Stalin/Donald Trump/etc. said so.) When I want to hear your opinion, I'll tell it to you. (Various churches, Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and his proud Dittoheads\u2026 The fallacies trotted out in support of Creationism, science denial in support of corporate profits, Voodoo Economics, racism, misogyny, bigotry, oppression, nativism, absurd Conspiracy Theories, and so on are discussed and dissected every day. Although You can never argue a man out of an opinion he was never argued into. Jonathan Swift we are having much better luck with the children of the deluded, by the many millions each year. Good News Wednesday: We Will Not Replace Them Their own children will, by the millions every year. with statistics. But there is a much better question. Who is most likely to overlook logical fallacies, and accept spurious substitutes for reasoning? We have scientific data on that question. The most significant answer is Authoritarians. Grokking Republicans: Authoritarian Followers, Leaders, and Doubles These are the Americans you are most afraid of, because they are not afraid of themselves. \"Authoritarianism is something authoritarian followers and authoritarian leaders cook up between themselves. It happens when the followers submit too much to the leaders, trust them too much, and give them too much leeway to do whatever they want\u2014which often is something undemocratic, tyrannical and brutal\u2026I'm going to present the case in this book that the greatest threat to American democracy today arises from a militant authoritarianism that has become a cancer upon the nation.\" We know a lot, scientifically, about Authoritarian Republicans. Or we would if enough of us were paying attention. Robert Altemeyer's work on the Right Wing Authoritarian (RWA) personality, along with other relevant research on Social Dominance Orientation and the Religious Right: The Authoritarians, available for free download from Altemeyer's Web page. \u2026research reveals that authoritarian followers drive through life under the influence of impaired thinking a lot more than most people do, exhibiting sloppy reasoninghighly compartmentalized beliefsdouble standardshypocrisyself-blindnessa profound ethnocentrismto top it all off\u2014a ferocious dogmatism that makes it unlikely anyone could ever change their minds with evidence or logicThese seven deadly shortfalls of authoritarian thinking eminently qualify them to follow a would-be dictator. As Hitler is reported to have said,\u201cWhat good fortune for those in power that people do not think.\u201d The \"Social Dominance Orientation\" scale was created as a measure of a belief in social inequality, that is, a desire for social dominance. It then turned out to be an excellent predictor of racism, one that had a low correlation, 0.20, with the RWA scale. But the two taken together predict most of racism, which neither can do on its own. Dozens of other scales have been proposed for measuring and predicting racism, but only RWA and SDO do so at all well. But it turns out that there is much more to this scale. SDO people are found in many kinds of leadership position where self-promotion is the key, but much less so in meritocracies. Their defining characteristics are amorality and a firm belief in the virtue of inequality. They tend not to be religious, but they can fake it. They are even more conservative on economics than RWAs. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a. I'll try and break down the greatest and most overlooked logical fallacy of all\u2026 Logical fallacy: Logic is the conclusion of reasoning and therefore subjective. Even tho that sounds like a reasonable assumption, nothing could be further from the truth. Logic correctly marries absolutes, whereas reasoning is an attempt at justifying a perspective. Logic is (1+1=2), therefore (2+2=4), because (1+1+1+1=4) and therefore (4\u20133=1), which must mean (3+1=4) and so on... Logic is a clinical deduction of multifaceted and cohesive facts. Logic = truth. A computer could not perform even the most menial of tasks if its binary instructions were illogical. Biological life could not reproduce and grow if its RNA/DNA sequence were bio-illogical. The space station would not be able to orbit the Earth if the basic laws of physics were illogical. A logical fallacy can be part logic and part assumption, or entirely assumption. Either way it is entirely erroneous, tho it may sound reasonable. Reasoning is a deduction of an experience or observation. The problem is that you can start with a false observation, assume it is logical because your experience justifies the assumption, then build an entire argument around this fallacy. Example: You know (1+1=2) and therefore (2+2=4). But does it really? In your experience (4\u20133=0). Everytime you put 4 cookies on the table and meticulously only eat 3, there are 0 cookies left. This doesn't make sense!? If you aren't miscounting the cookies and how many you ate, then is math wrong? Is this logical? You didn't hide any cookies from yourself. You didn't invite anyone over to share your cookies. You used your fingers to keep track of the cookies you ate. You even double checked Google images to verify you were holding up the proper amount of fingers.  Seriously! It's a doctor! He's smart! Plus clinical deduction! Totally logical! Right? It's not logical, it is deductive reasoning. Logic dictates you missed something and made an error. Reasoning can assume your observation is correct. Why? Because it happened over and over. Your eyes don't lie. Or do they? Well\u2026not about that doctor any way\u2026he's holding up the same amount of fingers as you are. Google says that's 3 (Three) fingers. So yeah! You definitely only ate 3 (Three) cookies. Logic dictates that reasoning, no matter how common, which argues against a quantifiable fact is a false assumption. I upvoted an answer to this question that basically said logic is realativism. Why? Because that is actually what alot of folks I talk to believe. They can't possibly be wrong about the things they see, hear, believe, imagine, and therefore everyone else's truth must be subjective. If only they had known\u2026  (Cookie monster via Google) \u2026that guy was living under their table this entire time!
