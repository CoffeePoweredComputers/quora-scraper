            "answer_text": "At 58 im still learning who i am. I know everybodys thinking by that age i should know but let me explain. At 6, i was molested by my uncle. At 7 i was diagnosed as add/adhd. At 15 i damaged both knees in a fall. So at 15 i became a person who has to be careful every day to stay put out of pain. Slso at that age i felt suicidal. My relationship with my parents was bad, but thank you God i met my best friend and he snd his mom got me thru it. Moving out right after high school at 19. I could barely keep a job. At 27 i went back to college at a technical school, so now im sn older student then the majority. Also met my future husband there. Graduated at 29. Got married at 31. I was still trying to figure life out. My depression was bad and was put on anti depressants. Happily divorced at 35. But had been kinda isolated during my marrizge from a lot of my friends. So at 36 trying to develop more friendship. I was still having a hard time keeping a job. Then 2001, 9/11 occured and like everyones else my world was turned upside down. At 44, i became a TSA officer. It was hard but i was good at it. At 51 i was diagnosed eith hip dysplasia. Now i have to be careful specially sitting and standing too long. Now i should say at this point i hsve been bullied all my life from other students, teachers (yes teachers), bosses and coworkers. At the beginning of 2013, i was 53, i began having problem with my meds. So the docs stas rted trying to figure out a good combination again. Two different meds caised severe side effects with 1 ending me up in the emergency room. So i had to be taken off everyyhing. Everything had been going half decent, but a new coworker started bullying me despite me assuming id gotten away from it. I kept reporting it and she was talked to but it made it worse and then she got another coworker to start bullying me too. Breaking into tears one night talking to management, they felt i needed to take a day off. And the next mrnong i had a complete meltdown. Everybody thought i was suicidal. My parents picked me and then it to h### in handbasket. My mom became even more controlling trying dictate what was going on. Mu life wasnt perfect but this time i hit rock bottom. So at 53, there was nowhere i could away from pain. A friend took me to the emergemcy pysch waiting to be seen for 8 hrs. I was not in good shape. Finally i was seen. Not only did i have severe stress and anxiety, i was bipolar. Thats when my world turned updide down again. You would think at 53 i would have some idea we ho i was but no. Now i find out ive been living with an undiagnosed mental illness (mental illness runs in the family). I tried to continue working but finally had to retire on disability. At 54, i became gluten intolerant. I kept thinking when will i finally get to a good place in my life. Fast forward 4 years, ive had to deal in this past year z manager who lied about me, threatened me if i didnt leave id be physically thrown out. He refused to get the correct till i left. Went into s full blown anxiety attack. Within 10 mins it was found that the mgr had misidentified me. Didnt help the attack tho. Moved to another branch of the company (it was a theater, i just moved to a different one). A month later a customer told a bunch of lies about me that were so ludicris i cant believe they took her serious. The cameras showed nothing of what she accused me of but corporate decided i had stepped out of bounds asking her what she had hidden in her pockets so they fired me. 4 months later i had a supervisor at a different jib kept tellong me everyday how bad of a job i was doing and threatened me everyday with my job. I made such a difference in the department that day shift coworkers, who never went in the dept because it was so bad, would tell me how excited that the dept would look so good they actually went in and would find exactly what they needed. I had proof of the day people iin my dept were hiding things instead of folding them. Or taking product i put out and hiding it in other boxes. Despite having pictures, i was the one who caught h### for the dept. I quit. 3 months later went back to work for a temp job i had had the year before and loved it. Now this job was h### because they hored a bunch of hogh schoolers who wouldnt do their work. We all had radios with ear plugs. And one 17 yr old told a manager that i called a family fat and smelly and she found it offensive and racists (they were hispanic, just a note my second fsmily is hispanic im considered one of their children). So the manager confronted me about not saying anything like that on the radio. I had not said anything like that, i had said the family was upset because we didnt have what the wanted and just giving a heads up. Left after my shift ended up with another anxiety attack. Now i have no job, barely making it and too scared to try and find a job again. Sorry this is so long. But i wanted to explain at almost 59 yrs old i still dont know who i am. Because everytime i think i know, another brick is thrown at me and i have to start over. Maybe one day ill know, but for now i just keep trying to figure out who i sm supposed to be. ",

Or that\u2019s atleast what I think now. This is not my invention, but I think that a human\u2019s task is to grow to be him(her)self. I think I\u2019ve originally picked this up from Tony Dunderfelt, a Finnish psycologist who has written about the \u201clifespan psychology\u201d (I don\u2019t know the proper English translation). (Iloiseksi.fi in Finnish) He discusses the lifespan and how the beginning of it consists of socializing of a human: parents, family, school etc all tell you how to be a proper human. You learn the rules. The outside world tells you who you are and you fit in the society. These lessons are wrapped around your true self like the layers in an onion. When youre \u201cready\u201d you\u2019re like an onion: layer after layer and in the innermost core, there is your true self. In the teenage and young adulthood you learn that you\u2019ve been indoctrinated and you rebel against that. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. The rest of your life you spend peeling those cultural norms from you, once you\u2019ve found that a large part of your identity has been built by someone else. The expectations of your family, your friends, your children, your boss, your peers. Once you\u2019ve peeled the last layer, you can see your true self. For some, that happens decades before they die and they can spend their late yeasrs as free. For some, that work won\u2019t be finished during their lives. Dunderfelt - and I - see that as sort of a misfortune, like an unfinished work. This is not to critisize that indoctrination. That has to happen: we must know how to be huimans in a society. It just buries our true self along the way. And to know who we really are, we must use the rest of our lives to see through those layers. So, I\u2019m now 59 and I feel that I know who I am. But I have, if I\u2019m luvky, some 20 years left. I\u2019m eager to know whether I still have some peeling to do. ",

Like, basically what's real and what's religious dogma. I guess having a child is when knowing the truth about myself and everything else became important. This is when the moment of clarity came when I lost my family to infidelity by my son's mother. I was forced into only visitation of my only child where the 2008 housing crisis left me unable to even have 50% custody with no home to bring my son too or even visit. Right after baptism and devotion to God I saw my life and identity as a father crumble before my eyes. This wasn't suppose to happen after I had given my life to Christ. I realized what I lost I could never have back. Just in knowing I will not wake up in the same house as my son and see him every day throught his childhood, gone. Given the responsibility to a stepfather in my absence. I also realized then that you save yourself no one can save you. This is how I learned the true meaning of \u2018awakened' ",

            "answer_text": "I was 5 years old when I began to know myself and learned to write a daily diary about my encounters with people and my relationships with my mom and dad. This diary became an illustrated one when I learned to sketch and paint at 6 years old. When Manila became flooded and the first floor of our house was flooded, I lost the ink on my diary and the watercolor of many of mymixed media paintings. I had to restart but could not really recall what i had written, so I just moved on in my writing. Most of my paintings and paint materials (paints and brushes, cardinell paper and canvas) were also destroyed by the floods. All that was harder to take. I couldn\u2019t get myself to paint beyond using crayola, but later discovered Pentel and Grumbacher oils. The art exhibit I had when I was 7 years old was followed up only 5 years later, when I was 12 years old. I contributed only three paintings , with three matching poems in English which I wrote, to a group exhibition with named Filipino artists, JDalena and Ocampo (who became National Artist). They said that was the first team up of artists of three generations. And then there was a long wait again for me. It was hard to see paintings destroyed randomly by mud and rain, during another flood rather than to just lose them and not see them again. It was hard for me to paint again. I was already 25 when I had a Hallway Exhibit of my 25 paintings at the Asian Institute of Tourism, and sold 10 out of 25 for just a 10-day Hallway Exhibit. I realized then that it was heart wrenching to part with my paintings, even if, at that time, I was raising funds for a small barangay library in the barangay where I was the topnotcher councilor. My last paintings wre those painted for that exhibit. I have not touched my brushes,my oils, my easel and my canvas since then. Doyou think this year, I will paint again? ",

I think that experiencing death through family members really helped shape my way of thinking and prioritizes my attitude on life. Then watching friends and family suffer drug and alcohol addictions, abuse and poverty makes me more grateful for even the smallest things. It also keeps me humble. And sober. And helps me be more understanding and empathetic of others and less prejudice. Its not always easy dealing with those less fortunate I'll admit that. And living among them sometimes is almost impossible. There are a lot of people with mental illnesses and they try to make trouble and pick fights but it is part of my life and I deal with it and do what I have to do. Someday I hope to make a lot of money so I can build good homes and permanant jobs and be able to help many people get back on their feet and make a good life for themselves. But anyway right now they are just dreams. But when it comes to maturity, I guess it really just depends on the person. ",

It is a lifelong event. Mainly because who you really are, always changes. The only time who you are stops changing, is when you're dead and buried. One day, the real you may be a plumber, who likes plain toast. But the next day? You might be a plumber who likes toast with nutella. The next month? You might decide to become a ballerina who likes quiche. We never really stop becoming someone different. As we age, and learn, and discover, we change who we are. Outside influences change us. Internal forces change us. We never stop. ",

May be 18 is that age only because today i know more, but my principle of life is to always keep learning. So, may be for me it will keep changing because it seems easy but it's really very hard to know yourself, to understand yourself, to be your best friend and as we grow up we learn more and realise more.
