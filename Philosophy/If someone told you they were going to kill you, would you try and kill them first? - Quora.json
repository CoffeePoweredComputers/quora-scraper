He was my estranged husband, their stepfather. I called the Magistrate, can\u2019t get a restraining order if he\u2019s not in the state. Call when he comes back to NC. I called the Women\u2019s Shelter, my daughter and I could go into protected housing. But my son at 13 was too old for the shelter and would be on his own. Against the crazy man who wanted to kill him. Nope, not doing that. I called my son\u2019s teacher. He agreed to hide my son if necessary, on the other side of the county until he could get him to a friend in the next county who would protect him with his life. I called their father, my first ex, and let him know what was going on. He came down and stayed with us to make sure we were safe. We never hated each other, just didn\u2019t agree on some lifestyle choices and got along better long distance. My former neighbor called me to let me know she saw my soon to be ex, riding with another former neighbor and heading my way. I called the sheriff, who basicly said call if he shows up at the house. As soon as we saw them riding up and down the block, I called. They did finally come this time. He claimed he only wanted \u2018his stuff\u2019 he\u2019d left when he left in February. It was August. Sheriff told him to take me to court for it. I was nice enough to get the one thing he wanted most of all. His winter coat. He left. Never saw him again. Got my divorce, and he called me once. Wanting to know if I would come pick him up at the bus station. Nope. ",

It\u2019s also quite dangerous, especially if you don\u2019t have a gun or any training with one. Going up against a killer, my odds would not be good. If escape is impossible and the threat is clear, however, I might make the attempt. Not saying I\u2019d get very far, but I\u2019d have nothing to lose! ",

But if they are close enough that the threat is immediate, they are going to die and it\u2019s going to be labeled self defense. Threaten my life when it\u2019s just words and I\u2019m going to ignore it. Threaten my life and actually be close enough to me for the threat to be real. There\u2019s nothing to talk about, you just signed your own death warrant and your monologue at me is just wasted air. ",

A few people have said they were going to kill me - only one who said it ever tried (chased me with a knife - the inconsiderate prick!) - and I ran faster than he did. So I survived. If I had killed all the nutcases who had said it (and most of them were just that - nutcases), I would be classed as a serial killer. So - as to you killing them to pre-empt your own demise - dumb idea, most people are just talk. Or unwell. A day later they don\u2019t realise what they were saying, or are sorry for it if they do remember. If you go out with a mindset that verbal threats of lethal violence needs to be met with lethal violence you are going to spend a long time in jail - or end up on death row.  \u201cYou can\u2019t do this - he said he was going to kill me\u201d ",
