            "answer_text": "Wittgenstein himself would probable ask you to explain clearly what you mean when you suggest that semantics and logic are different\u2026 Look, immediately before this passage, Smith says that what he\u2019s about to say is rough and loose, which is (perhaps) a necessary constraint on BBC interviews and Quora answers. It was that, and I think Smith also imported a bit of modern language theory back into Wittgenstein\u2019s work, which would be unfortunate, if true, but not at all uncommon. Nobody\u2019s perfect\u2026 I think a more elegant way of expressing the same idea is this: if we think of language as a logic \u2014 a set of base propositions about the world (the mathematical term for such is axioms) and all of the extended propositions that can be validly derived from those propositions \u2014 there are two interrelated things we have to recognize: There are things about the world that we cannot \u2014 or at least have not yet \u2014 put into language.There are things we can say in the logic of language which do not conform to anything in the world.To exemplify this, note that Wittgenstein clearly had Russell\u2019s paradox in mind when he was writing the Tactatus Logico-Philosophicus; he even offers a proposed solution to that paradox in one section. So Russell\u2019s paradox is this: Does the set of all sets that do not contain themselves, contain itself? Obviously if it does contain itself, it shouldn\u2019t, and if it doesn\u2019t contain itself, it should. This is a perfect corollary to the natural language Liar\u2019s Paradox, where a man who is defined as someone who always lies, says \u201cI am lying\u201d, which cannot be true (because he always lies), but cannot be a lie (because that would make it true). Wittgenstein\u2019s proposed solution to this is to suggest that our (logical) language does not have a way of expressing two different things as being different. In the first case, when we ask if the set of all sets that do not contain themselves, contain itself, the \u2018itself\u2019 is referring to something subtly different from \u2018the set of all sets that do not contain themselves\u2019; in the second case, the \u2018I\u2019 in \u201cI am lying\u201d points to something subtly different from the man who is defined as always lying. The problem, thus, is that our language is incapable of capturing this subtle problem of mixed and misplaced identity. In the terminology of analytical philosophy, we are using the same symbol to denote different real-world objects, and confusing ourselves because of it. And worse, we cannot even be aware that we are using the same symbol to denote two different real-world objects, because we can only talk about things inside the limits of our (logical) language. The only thing that points to the problem at all is the fact that we are saying things that confuse us. It\u2019s as though people could not understand the difference between pi and pie, and were constantly asking whether geometry was cherry, apple, or rhubarb. Wittgenstein\u2019s response in the Tractatus is to say we should simply note the point where things get irrational and stop talking about it. In the case of Russell\u2019s paradox, for instance, we should just by fiat define \u2018the set of all sets that do not contain themselves\u2019 to include itself on the left-hand side of the question, and exclude itself on the right-hand side (thus \u2018itself\u2019 refers to a subtly different set than the one the sentence starts talking about, even though it\u2019s supposed to be a direct referent). That allows us to stop talking about the paradox, even if it solves nothing else. In the Philosophical Investigations he starts taking a more nuanced and philosophical approach, but that\u2019s a discussion for a later date. So yes, this is merely semantics, but no, it\u2019s not merely semantics. What he\u2019s really talking about is the limits of the ability of logic to express semantics. ",

            "answer_text": "Barry Smith\u2019s explanation is this: If we have a language that describes all the arrangements of the world and all the facts of the world, take all those parts of language and think of all the possible rearrangements that are legitimate, that the language allows. Now you have described all the possible ways the world could be, not just the way that it is. Language then in describing all the possibilities there are describes the limits of reality so the limits of language are the limits of reality and the boundaries of what is intelligible are the boundaries of logic. If you stray beyond logic, you are just not making sense. That explanation makes sense to me except for one thing: how in the world does the legit rearrangements of elements of language (words) have anything to do with logic. I could say: \u201cMy dog ate my homework\u201d and that is a legitimate arrangement, it can be true or false. However, \u201cPurple ate my homework\u201d is illegitimate. What in the world does that have to do with logic? That is semantics. There is nothing in logic, particularly deductive logic, that tells me what \u201cpurple\u201d can and can\u2019t do. What did Wittgenstein have in mind here? Is he just confusing logic with semantics? **** Updating based off further research and actually providing somewhat of an attempt at an answer ***** After further research, I see that Wittgenstein is not proposing that logic is what allows some objects (dogs) to combine with some relations (eat) while other objects (purple) do not. His premise is that the basic, legitimate relationships an object is capable of are within that object. Most objects in our language are composite, but the most basic objects are atomic (I\u2019m not sure anyone knows what a good example of these are) and the relationships atomic objects are capable of set the possibilities/limits of language (and consequently the world). However, objects don\u2019t make sense by themselves, but only within a proposition. Atomic objects relate to other atomic objects in simple propositions called atomic facts which correspond to states of affairs in the world. All this is to say that for Wittgenstein, the possible relationships a word/object can engage in is just a given. It is not explained in the Tractatus. I\u2019m not sure if Wittgenstein thinks this is not his job or something that might be accomplished by elaborating a language of atomic facts or something that is just not possible. In any case, Wittgenstein offers no explanation of the possible relationships a word/object is capable of in the Tractatus beyond saying that it is the set of atomic facts. Consequently he does not claim that logic determines those relationships. Rather, he claims that as the limits of language, atomic facts, are the limits of logic. Logic just combines independent facts into complex propositions. ",

            "answer_text": "The core problem with Wittgenstein is that he operates under a nihilistic framework that has no objective anchor. This allows him to say things like this:  When he wrote this in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, he basically admitted that he was trolling anyone who read the book. He is saying that he used language to climb a ladder, and then he threw it away, because he transcended language into an area of non-reason. He is basically saying that language is fundamentally meaningless. And whoever bought this book filled with meaningless language is stating that language is meaningless. If one starts with this framework, semantics can still be done, but the results will ultimately be considered meaningless. Wittgenstein believes he does not need logic because he has climbed through them. work cited The Francis A. Schaeffer Trilogy ",
