His company finds struggling companies and takes them over and sells them off in pieces or takes as much for themselves as possible and bankrupts the companies. Leon Black - Wikipedia Nobody Makes Money Like Apollo\u2019s Ruthless Founder Leon Black Now if destroying companies for your own greed isn\u2019t your thing then you probably want to get a double major. Maybe go into psychology. Or maybe start your own religion. That\u2019s very profitable. I can make you rich but I\u2019m not giving away my ideas for free. Starting my own religion is one of my life goals. I simply lack the focus to stick with anything. :p I\u2019m too fluid. If you practice martial arts and maybe take some drama courses maybe you could be the next Patric Swayze. Or practice some comedy and be the next Richard Pryer. :p I don\u2019t know if either of these two have philosophy degrees but knowing a lot of stories may be able to connect to peoples lives and you might be able to make them laugh. :) If you get a masters or doctrine in philosophy I guess you could work as a university professor and teach people what you just learned and fuck your students. (that\u2019s a nice bonus huh!\u201d ",

Employers in the US have a preference for Philosophy majors, since philosophy students learn better than most how to ask questions and think through desirable solutions to problems. The only specific career options for philosophy majors are academic or advisor jobs. ",
