            "answer_text": "Bertrand Russell courted controversy all through his long life. When Sir Paul McCartney (then just \u201cBeatle Paul\u201d) lived in London during the 1960s, people pointed out that he lived very close to the famous philosopher and House of Lords member, Lord Russell. Paul, being a sociable fellow then as now, went down the block and introduced himself to the Earl. Russell promptly invited Paul in for tea. When Paul asked the Earl what he was up to these days, he answered that he was protesting the American military involvement in Vietnam \u2014 because this war was killing young people and Vietnamese for no good reason. Russell convinced Paul, who then convinced the rest of the Beatles. One thing that was unique about Russell in his day was how outspoken and frank he was about his atheism (well, technically it was agnosticism). Today, an easy way to break into print and become a celebrity is to take either a strong atheist or anti-atheist position and write a book about it. But in his day, it was a bold move\u2026 shocking in a day when all the peers of the realm were supposed to be in the Church of England. Russell was an atheist long before any of the \u201cNew Atheists,\u201d and his reasoning was stronger and more original than any of theirs. His book, \u201cWhy I Am Not a Christian\u201d is a classic \u2014 whether you agree with it or not. But more controversial still was his open and frank advocacy of what was then called \u201cfree love.\u201d He was not advocating having sex with a different partner every night. But he was a strong advocate of more-or-less monogamous couples experimenting sexually \u2014 with of course the benefit of birth control, also controversial at the time \u2014 before deciding to commit to marriage. Interestingly enough, such a view is probably very close the consensus of what is the current accepted morality, in America, England, and Europe these days. But in the early to mid 20th Century, this was not a position that any serious ethical philosopher took. Russell was among the first to say that sex outside of marriage was not automatically a sin in his view. ",

            "answer_text": "He wasn't having an affair with the Prime Minister's wife, if that is what you mean. He was controversial in the sense that OTHERS thought he was, because he was a \"public\" intellectual not just an egghead, thus his statements got attention, whether about agnosticism/atheism, open sexual relationships (he cheated on at least one wife and was married 4 times) or pacificism. Hard to imagine anyone paying attention to philosophers now. ",
