            "answer_text": " Conservatives and materialists tend to have a bias toward their own worldview. They believe the status quo is \u201crealistic\u201d while something different, especially something that corrects inequalities or injustices is \u201cidealistic,\u201d and unrealistic, childish, and naive. By this standard during the period of slavery in the U.S. abolitionists would be considered naive and idealistic, because \u201ceverybody knows that blacks are natural slaves\u201d and that anything else is overly idealistic. Rubbish. Some have called Marxism idealistic. It\u2019s not. Marxism is based on scientific analysis of the objective nature of capitalist relations. It is not based on some idealized utopia. It is not wishing for something humans are incapable of realizing. That is where conservatives get it wrong. The reality is that humans are evolved for communism. Humans lived in communist societies that were moneyless, stateless, and classless up until the Neolithic Age, which was 12,000 years ago. Humans are evolved for cooperation for survival in harsh climates. The selfishness inherent in capitalism, the competition, and the private ownership of the means of production are unnatural to humans. That is why there is so much loneliness, depression, and atomization. Capitalism demands selfishness because people will go bankrupt by not remaining competitive. For example, if a CEO refuses to relocate a factory to Mexico to save on labor costs he or she will be fired and replaced by someone who will. The system is larger than individual actors. Interesting how the \u201crealists\u201d that call for a more equitable world always happen to be the upper middle and upper class guys who have always benefited the most from the economic system. But they believe they \u201cearned\u201d this status due to their inherent superiority of logic and skill. Reality is a mix of realism and idealism. Capitalism is no more realist than it is idealist. Consider the capitalist dogmas that have been disproven over and over, yet they are incessantly regurgitated. \u201cThe free market has brought more prosperity than anything else\u201d\u2014it hasn\u2019t. Just as Haiti, Russia, Ukraine, and other nations that embraced capitalism and are in economic ruins. Capitalism destroyed Russia. Mass emigration, negative birth rates, labor stagnation, deindustrialization, inequality, and reliance on natural resource exports have done little to create a middle class, which doesn\u2019t exist. The oligarchs swindled their way to the top and sat on their piles of money, and that is it. Here\u2019s some more realism for capitalists:  And the wonders of the free market and capitalist creativity:   ",

Epistemologically, Idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. Wikipedia n philosophy, Idealism is the group of metaphysical philosophies that assert that reality, or reality as humans can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, Idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In contrast to Materialism, Idealism asserts the primacy of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of material phenomena. According to this view, consciousness exists before and is the pre-condition of material existence. Consciousness creates and determines the material and not vice versa. Idealism believes consciousness and mind to be the origin of the material world and aims to explain the existing world according to these principles. Idealism theories are mainly divided into two groups. Subjective idealism takes as its starting point the given fact of human consciousness seeing the existing world as a combination of sensation. Objective idealismposits the existence of an objective consciousness which exists before and, in some sense, independently of human ones. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas\u2014especially beliefs and values\u2014shape society. [1] As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. [2] Idealism thus rejects those physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind. The earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece. The Hindu idealists in India and the Greek Neoplatonists gave panentheistic arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as the ground or true nature of reality. [3] In contrast, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, which arose within Mahayana Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE, [4] based its \"mind-only\" idealism to a greater extent on phenomenological analyses of personal experience. This turn toward the subjective anticipated empiricists such as George Berkeley, who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against materialism. Beginning with Immanuel Kant, German idealists such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and Arthur Schopenhauerdominated 19th-century philosophy. This tradition, which emphasized the mental or \"ideal\" character of all phenomena, gave birth to idealistic and subjectivist schools ranging from British idealism to phenomenalism to existentialism. Idealism as a philosophy came under heavy attack in the West at the turn of the 20th century. The most influential critics of both epistemological and ontological idealism were G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, [5] but its critics also included the New Realists. According to Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the attacks by Moore and Russell were so influential that even more than 100 years later \"any acknowledgment of idealistic tendencies is viewed in the English-speaking world with reservation\". However, many aspects and paradigms of idealism did still have a large influence on subsequent philosophy. [6] ",
