            "answer_text": "From an ethical standpoint doing more good is better than doing less good. So for example if I have $100 I would like to donate. I have many options of charities I could donate it to. However, some charities would make more effective use of it. Which in terms of ethics would imply that my $100 would reduce more suffering with that charity organization then it would with another. In order to determine which charity is most effective I would have to analyze and critically think about it. If we don't think critically, our good intentions may cause more harm as we might not factor in all sorts of ramifications and consequences that our well intended actions might lead to. ",
