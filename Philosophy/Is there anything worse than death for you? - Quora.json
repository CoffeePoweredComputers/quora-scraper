            "answer_text": "A2A: Is there anything worse than death for you? I think that for most people, myself included, severe never-ending pain would be worse than dying. But the questions asks for death, which is not quite the same thing. I assume then that the question means a permanent death, as in no afterlife, which is what we should all expect anyway, given that there is no objective evidence to suggest that there is more. Okay. If I were forced to live forever giving lip service to an egotistical sadistic all-powerful needy entity, totally bored out of my skull, doomed to forever be in the company of a gigantic crowd, each with a perpetual silly grin slapped onto their face, now that would certainly be a fate far far worse that being dead forever. I would choose permanent death first. But then again, if I went to the other place, there would be an awful lot of wonderful intelligent people there (if they still were people)? I could learn so much. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad there? I hear that the weather is hot, so I might need some heavy sunblock. Maybe I'll just stay indoors? Not to worry. None of this ever going to happen. ",
