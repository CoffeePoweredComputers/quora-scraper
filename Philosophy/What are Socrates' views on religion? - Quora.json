            "answer_text": "Socrates regarded the traditional Homeric religion to be false and morally destructive. In his discussions (Republic, Laws) of politics, he seems to regard religious myth that promoted ethical conduct as necessary to social stability. He also claimed to hear the voice of a \u201cdaimon\u201d a divine sign that told him what not to do (Apology), which was understood by other ancient writers (like Plutarch and Cicero) to imply contact with a personal divinity. In his death scene (Phaedo) Socrates claims not to know for certain whether there is an afterlife, but hopes for one and he thinks it more probable than not. It is arguable that the singular source of value and intelligibility that Socrates describes as the \u201cForm of the Good\u201d (Republic book 6), the contemplation of which is the ultimate achievement of the philosopher, is an attempt to replace the immoral and anthropomorphic gods of Homer, with a kind of rational monotheism.

            "answer_text": "The greek intellectuals have rarely confused popular religion (which sometimes were only superstitions and sometimes just a poetical way to name things/concepts not-understood (like thunder/Zeus)) with theology or metaphysics, which were just conceived as fundamental \u201cscience\u201d. Plato and its followers were both mystics and rationalist, and science was not separated from religion and experience. They were aware apparently that betting on any unified reality is betting on some transcendence, something beyond us. Religion was an ideal goal, and science was an ideal mean for it. Socrates was very wise and very cautious, he only asked questions, and demolished easy answers, and less easy one, and impressed, I guess, more Plato by acting like this than by some offering of a precise definite theory or theology.
