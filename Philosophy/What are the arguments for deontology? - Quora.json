            "answer_text": "The primary argument in favor of deontology is quite simple; the ends cannot justify the means. Deontological ethics is based on the fundamental tenet that actions are inherently morally good or bad, that this moral character of a potential action can be determined by logical reasoning, and that the moral character of the action is universal in scope and applicability. The competing theory, moral relativism, pretty much rejects all of this; actions have no intrinsic categorical moral quality, the moral quality of a specific action is dependent upon situational and societal variables that cannot be perfectly predicted beforehand, and as such the moral nature of any one specific action cannot be adapted as a universal standard of judgment of the act in general. Most variants of moral relativism tend toward consequentialism; a primary indicator of the goodness or badness of an action is the actual or predictable outcome of taking an action in the context of the broader situation. The oversimplification of that, trending towards nihilism, is that \u201cthe ends justify the means\u201d; the outcome of an action is a net good, therefore the action itself must be good. This is very commonly a criticism of consequentialist theory, with notable counterexamples containing actions that would shock our \u201ccommonsense morality\u201d, but resulting in a net good, therefore judged as \u201cgood\u201d under a purely consequentialist standard. One obvious example is Thanos\u2019s decision to eradicate half of all life in the universe, to ease the strain on its finite resources. Half the fossil fuel consumption, half the deforestation, half the pollution, half the hunting and fishing of depleted herds and schools. Earth (and many other worlds in the MCU) can recover, heal, replenish resources. Net good, right? And yet the destruction of 3.5 billion people with the snap of a finger was the most evil act perpetrated in the MCU, and it would, very rightly, be similarly judged in our real world. Deontological morality is thus fundamentally opposed to any such judgment of individual actions based on the observed outcome. Actions are to be judged in isolation of their specific consequences in any one context, instead either reasoning logically based on a generic context, or based on the action (or restraint from action) being a \u201cuniversal maxim\u201d that everyone followed. This has several benefits when squaring logic with what is ultimately an emotional response in the human conscience: The action itself, the \u201cmeans\u201d, is judged, and not the outcome or \u201cends\u201d, allowing us to say that what was done was a bad thing even if good ultimately came of it. Consequentialist morality fundamentally connects the action with its consequences, therefore if the outcome was overall \u201cgood\u201d, so by definition was the action.Because we can reason toward a general acceptance or condemnation of an action or inaction, we can codify that judgment as law, theoretically before it ever even happens (assuming we can predict that it will). Pure consequentialism as a system of law would have us examine every action in hindsight, only determining the action to definitely be a crime long after it was committed.Providing a predetermined logical reasoning that backs our commonsense morality gives us a sense that our conscience is based on a superior quality of humans that transcends purely animal desires or emotional connections. This was a key struggle of early moral philosophers, to define the human sense of right and wrong and thus segregate it from animal behavior (hedonism, a form of relativism, is commonly criticized as \u201canimal morality\u201d).To be clear, it\u2019s definitely not perfect. The most common criticism of deontology, in a sentence, is that \u201cevery rule has an exception\u201d. Strict categorical morality rejects this; an action is always good or bad. Counterexamples, however, offend our commonsense morality as much or more than those used to criticize consequentialism; is it morally wrong to lie to the Gestapo about the whereabouts of your Jewish neighbors, knowing that your telling the truth would likely result in their deaths? That\u2019s a specific context, perhaps not common overall, but it illustrates an important exception to the rule. It may be wrong to lie in the general case, however we can reasonably predict that the societal harm inherent in this one lie is much less than the harm caused by the truth. Strict deontological reasoning would (and does) reject this argument, instead seeking a more general logical reasoning that resolves the obvious cognitive dissonance without resulting in infinite variation of moral theorems based on the presupposed situation. The difficulty then becomes finding the line. Edge cases and corner cases are and always have been the Achilles\u2019 heel of ethics as an application of formal logic, and they abound in all proposed systems of \u201cethical calculus\u201d. ",
