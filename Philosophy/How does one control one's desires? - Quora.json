            "answer_text": "How does one control one's desires? Fighting desire doesn\u2019t work. It only strengthens it. It\u2019s like trying not to blush. You actually blush less if you accept it. Learn to accept your desires as a natural part of being human. We all have them. Acceptance helps you to relax. Relaxation is a more resourceful state than the tension of fighting desire. From this space of relaxation, you can begin to notice the thoughts and feelings that feed this desire. Practice observing these thoughts and feelings dispassionately. The more you do this, the more the mind will quiet down and the feelings will subside. The best way to do this is through mindfulness. Find a class in mindfulness and learn how to do it. It will take a while to be able to be with the thoughts and feeling without judging them. Be gentle with yourself. When you have a thought that feeds the desire, substitute an empowering thought for it. This can be anything that is meaningful to you. Notice how this changes your feelings. For example, if you are craving chocolate cake, replace that thought with how much better you will look and feel when you lose weight. If that seems too remote, alter the image in your head to make it more compelling. Make sure it is in color and in full size. See your new slimmer self in the future. Imagine how you will carry yourself. You may want to add some people in this image to talk about how good you look. If you are not conscious of an image, hear the voices of others admiring the slimmer you. It is your imagination, make it work for you. Dedicate yourself to this goal. Tell yourself that you are dedicated to achieving this goal. Notice how this makes you feel. Create a gesture to symbolize your dedication. This gets the tactile sense involved. The more senses you can involve the stronger will be your resolve. Each time the desire returns, do these practices. Be gentle with yourself. Over time you will develop mastery over desire.

            "answer_text": "Though I appreciate Buddhism and so much of its teachings, this \u201cdesire\u201d issue is a dilemma in that philosophy, IMO. As you mention in your question: How can your desire be to: not desire? Of course that\u2019s a conundrum\u2026an oxymoron. It is as if Buddha\u2019s philosophy path was like a train and he got off his train too soon, at the train station named Desire\u2026.or maybe like the movie\u2026.A Streetcar Named Desire (a woman\u2019s flirtations toward her sister\u2019s husband).  IMO, the answer is that perverse desires are unhealthy but virtuous desires are essential in a healthy life. Zoroaster realized this and monotheism promotes this philosophy\u2026..Jesus actually died as a display of his desire for virtue/love. So you actually do want to keep away from perverse desires (unhealthy ones) but you actually want to deliberately increase your desire for virtue (in your beliefs, thoughts and behaviors). So desire is not the profound dilemma (like an evil) some think it is. The battle within yourself is actually between perverse desires (leading to inner chaos and division) and virtuous desires (leading to inner peace and unity).  Carl Jung stated there is a shadow/id inside of us which is the unknown animal instinctive and irrational \u201cdark side\u201d of our personality which is prone to psychological projection. Jung wrote that if these projections remain hidden to us, they have the power to manipulate us. These projections insulate and harm us by acting as a thickening curtain of illusion between us and the real world (like the Wizard behind the curtain in Oz). IMO, arrogance, dominance, rebellion, diversions, blaming, self-righteousness, meekness and submissiveness are all tactics (and outcomes) used by our shadow to control us: to keep us from becoming more completely human. But we can be internally set free from these tactics if we face our shadow. I use this process\u2026.  There is a struggle in each of us that involves three voices in of us: a loud, emotional and vocal DNA-driven survive, thrive and reproduce shadow (I, me, my, mine) that resists discipline\u2026this is often a fear-mongering, defensive, arrogant and lying voice.a quiet seed of a beautiful, altruistic, self-disciplined, virtue-driven hero/heroine\u2026this is an honest and truthful voice\u2026love lives here and is waiting to give us the gift of transcendent love.an initially naive, curious, adventurous \u201cchild chooser\u201d that can select either 1 or 2 (or a mix of both but care must be taken to choose wisely such as when physical death appears imminent).I believe the purpose in life is for #3 to increase in wisdom and virtue. With that increasing understanding, spend more time listening to and following #2 while paying less and less attention to (by disciplining) #1. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings! In order to control one's desires, first you need to separate your desires from your needs and realise that only your needs are required to be fulfilled and your desires are just the longing of mind for certain physical objects which will temporary satisfy your want and will lead you to be restless and frustrated in the long run. You need to comprehend that when you will meet your physical desires, your emotional and other associated desires will also increase and will ruin your peace of mind and contentment. It has been observed that the desires of mind are unquenchable and they never gets over because it is a vicious loop in which one desire end and other begins. So, it is extremely necessary to curb this unfavourable tendency of mind in the beginning to be really happy and peaceful in life. Not all the desires are bad especially the ones which are intellectual and aimed towards self-improvement and development, actually this are the desires which should be replaced by physical and emotional ones as this desires are essential for us to prosper in life. Have the desire to be become better than others, more appreciated than others, more successful, powerful, wise, knowledgeable than others, initially this desires would seem to be superficial but they are very important for our social and psychological wellbeing because a healthy ego is what we need to adjust in our surrounding. So, the technique is to cultivate higher intellectual desires instead of lower physical ones and finally if you can sow the seed of highest form of desire that is spiritual desire, in the presence of spiritual desire all other desires extinguish and only one burning desire remains which is to become self-sufficient in all means and attain supreme peace of mind. If you still can't pacify the desires of the mind then you should follow the other way which is to satisfy your desires in moderation and learn to be contentended in life with what you have because contentment is the greatest wealth as it is written in scriptures of various religions which is indeed true as we see rich people never get satisfied and go on to acquire more on the cost of health, relationship, peace of mind and what they get nothing except more desires which are aimed at happiness and a comman man who is moderate in all his undertakings is happy without desires. So, the main concept is you can be happy without any desire as pursuit of happiness is the main reason to why we hold on to our desires. Hope you like the exposition!

            "answer_text": "Desiring, wishing, and willing are all things we humans regularly do. Each of these activities can be fun and rewarding when done to the right degree and in the right direction. They can also be damaging and destructive when undertaken too vigorously or pursued in wrong directions. They can veer into dangerous waters when we over- and under-estimate what is in our control. We can end up not just frustrated but profoundly disoriented and even alienated in our own lives. For help understanding these activities in order to avoid their more destructive forms. I defines that desire as wanting to feel, to have, or to do what presently is not felt, had, or done. Desires can be about anything. We desire material goods like cars, houses, a good meal, etc. We also desire immaterial goods such as relationships with others, acceptance, happiness, success, etc. The line between material and immaterial is not always hard and fast; one may physically desire another person in large part because of the love she has for him or her. Physical desire may also increase love. Desire can increase when we want more than we presently have and it can decrease when we no longer want what we have. My point about desire is there\u2019s always a gap between the wanting and the having. While in many cases the gap between wanting and having is traversable, the gap can increase when one is not attentive enough to both the strength and direction of desires and how those desires fit with what one already has. Paying more attention to what one wants rather than what one has may lead to a dissatisfaction that may only continue to grow. we wish when what we desire is accompanied by a sense that it cannot be attained or achieved. Wishing is defined by the sense that one cannot realize her desires. There are all sorts of reasons why someone\u2019s desires cannot be met and those reasons are not created equal. I wish I had won the $2 billion lottery drawing, but the odds were astronomically staked against me. Wishes like this are not bad or dangerous and in fact can provide a welcome flight of fancy. Who didn\u2019t wish they\u2019d have the opportunity to quit a job, pay off debt, help friends, etc? Problems begin when the reasons for something not being met or achieved have to do with me or what\u2019s in my control. I can wish until the cows come home that I will get the promotion at work. I can wish that tomorrow I will stop drinking or using drugs. I can wish to the point of pining for the partner of my dreams. Great troubles may follow when my wishes become wrapped in expectation. When expectation takes over, my focus becomes less on what I am doing and more on what I deserve. Putting on the \u201cI deserve\u201d lenses entails we are unable to clearly see the relationship between our inactions and our desires not being met. There\u2019s a good reason why many people in recovery define an expectation as a future resentment. That resentment is almost always directed at other people or more vaguely, \u201csociety.\u201d We fail to recognize that our inactions in many cases play an important role in our desires not being met. We will when we believe we can achieve what we desire and we take action. Willing necessarily requires action. This is what distinguishes wishing from willing. When a person wills, she recognizes that she is in a position to actualize something that she desires. In most cases, willing is a necessary condition for us to realize our desires. If I want the promotion, then I better work hard and finish my projects by the specified deadlines. If I want to stop drinking or using, then I need to take some action such as driving home a different way to avoid the liquor store or place where I usually buy drugs.Willing is a necessary but not sufficient condition to realize desires. Each of us has plenty of examples of acting in ways to realize our desires that fall short, go haywire, or bring about the exact opposite of what we want. It simply is not a matter of my will alone that I will get a promotion. Too many other factors are at play that are beyond my control. There may be equally hard working people vying for the promotion or the job description is not a match for my experience. Stopping drinking and using is not fully a matter of my will; I may need medications to curb cravings. When I assume that realizing my desires is completely a matter of my will, frustration and overflowing resentment usually follow. If I am convinced that I am doing everything right and still I am not getting what I desire, then I might just keep pushing myself to do the same thing only harder every time. One definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly but expecting different results. I may start to resent those same results and the people who seem to get different results from doing the same things I am. When we will too much and try to force the world to bend or we will in the wrong direction\u2014say at controlling that which is so far beyond our control--we will be unhappy. The solution is not to stop willing since that throws us back to the unhappiness that comes from unrealized wishes. Rather, we need to recognize what is in our control and what is not and then calibrate our expectations and act accordingly. That\u2019s simpler said than done. ",

            "answer_text": "How can a person control desires and keep away all desires? As a Muslim who only really started practising after I was mature, I am no stranger to desire and its effects, as well as how difficult it is to battle it once it takes hold. Desires are only possible to prevent, by trying to remove what will initiate them from source. So don't associate with junkies, don't watch porn, don't go to parties, don't expose yourself freely and unnecessarily to that which may be a source of an unhealthy desire etc. Prevention is always better because once desires are aroused, it becomes much harder to get rid of them or channel them into healthy outlets, because they will keep reappearing, and if one actually acts on them, they will keep escalating into worse forms, and might eventually become addictions. They then progressively take over control of the person's reasoning and the person tries to find ways to justify his craving for indulging in that unhealthy desire and leaves off every pretence of ever abandoning it. Since outright prevention gets progressively more difficult in today's hedonistic society; where license to sin is considered a freedom and a human right; the best alternative way to prevent this is to remind yourself constantly of the consequences if such a desire overtakes you, and the subsequent end result of indulging in such a desire. To most reasoning people, this will totally eliminate the attraction that it may have for them. But it takes a lot of control over oneself, and hard work. ",

            "answer_text": "Before you get into this materialistic non-sense. First contemplate all that you have now.Then contemplate the type of person you want to become if you manifest what you want. Caution comes into play at this point. Desires can be very dangerous, as they have everything to do with the five senses and the stimulus those results bring to you and how much you fall in love with them, once you have lived with them for a while. They are called the seven deadly sins in all religions for a reason. Sorry to be such a downer, but there are tons of people in hell, because of their failing to see the results of getting the things they love most in life. Life\u2019s purpose is to grow spiritually. We all are only one step up from any animal that lives life by their instincts. As well as equally placed between the heavens and the hells. You are a person and the difference between you and an animal is that you have a intellectual mind to know the difference. Falling in love with worldly things without controlling one\u2019s self, can easily have you turning away from the higher being you are meant to be. With that being said, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS keep the goodness within you, as your most important power. These things you want to manifest are all temporal. At least the worldly ones or physical ones. You won\u2019t be taking them with you, except in your memory. It is the spiritual ones that are eternal, so concentrate on them. Love and Selflessness. Can you see how these two traits are eternal and have the highest value as they pertain to your spiritual path UPWARD????? ",

Choose what\u2019s really important to you and you aim for it. You kill your desires - You stop your desires by controlling them. This means your desires exist but you forcefully stop yourself from doing it. People call this self-control. Not recommended. Read next. You overcome your desires - through knowledge, wisdom and self-awareness. Follow a mentor, read a book and know what life means to you. You don\u2019t have to become a saint. Just be human.

With repeated fulfillment of a desire, our dependency increases, but so our tolerance. We depend more and more upon its fulfillment while deriving less and less satisfaction from it. More unsettled and more dissatisfied. To enjoy the worldly pleasures one needs wealth. Therefore, intense efforts have to be made to acquire it. And the satisfaction of these desires only makes them multiply. It is impossible to destroy them. Money is a big snare! Even the very affluent are troubled by it. Have you ever come across a person truly satisfied and not hankering after money? \u201cHe who with complete faith engages himself in the service of his Guru, the Lord is indebted to him always. No one can view him with evil intentions. \u201cHe who does not waste even half a moment and who has a liking for the worship of the Lord and the Guru, will give him infinite or perpetual happiness and enable him to cross to the other shore.\u201d Blessed are those devotees of Sai, who have this firm belief, and are without fear, that Sree Samartha is their protector and nothing can touch them Listening to this Satcharita or reciting it regularly will result in the feet of Sai Samartha removing all the difficulties without any delay.

However, if we have hatred within us or if we do not have love, then we have to remove hatred and develop love for others. Development of love will lead to control all bad wishes. If we had no idea of love, we could not develop it and if we had no idea of hatred, we cannot try to remove it. All of us have some idea of love and hatred from our birth because we are born with parental or family love. All of us want love from others and all others want love from us. This is a reality of life. Life is not possible if we are alone. We must have a community to live. And to make the community life happy, there must be love within the members of the community. Hatred causes unhappiness and love causes happiness. When we understand this we will start cultivating love and removing hatred. It will lead to development of good wishes and control of bad wishes or hatred. ",
