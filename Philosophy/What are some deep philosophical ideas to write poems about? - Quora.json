            "answer_text": "The idea that human thoughts and behavior are more than animalistic. The idea that humans claim to be smarter than they actually are. The idea that mental IQ is valued more than \u201csocial IQ.\u201d If IQ has real value, it should be valued less,. The ability of people, even philosophical geniuses, to fool themselves into thinking that one individual\u2019s painstaking efforts is more legitimate than another\u2019s painstaking efforts. The naive discounting of all the discoveries that led to a revelation coupled with the naive glorification of the individual who happened to reap the opportunity of revelation that previous discoveries made possible. The idea of commonly valuing delusions more than reality. Inherent attitudinal bias. ",

But I would avoid writing about \u201cdeep, philosophical ideas.\u201d Those tend to result in very, very boring poems that are tedious to read. Write about \u201creal\u201d things\u2014relationships, observations around you. If you write well about actual things, you will end up revealing \u201cphilosophical\u201d truths.
