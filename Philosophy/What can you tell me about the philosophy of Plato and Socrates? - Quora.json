            "answer_text": "\u201cKnow that you don\u2019t know \u201d To know thyself is to really study the subtle ways of the self and how it mesmerized one into believing that there is a better moment , a better now you can be in. Sounds like insanity? Once there is a realization of the deceptive nature of thought and belief , the concept of self improvement which is seeking a better version of yourself , is seen to be contradictory and a futile endeavor . F\u2026.* it, \u201c forget the tyranny of being a slave to yourself \u201c and live Psychologically Free, be anonymous . Everyone is so busy pleasing their own tyrant self that they have no energy left to care about others , i\u2019m sure you have met people , so self absorbed that they can only talk about themselves. Forget yourself ! no need to prove yourself to yourself, and no need to seek approval from others. Sounds like a life free of stress? a life free of all problems? Too good to be true? What will be left in life? the \u2018most important of all : Joy, Peace, Beauty , compassion and practical living and caring about functionality. Body tired you rest, body hungry you eat, thirsty you drink. You need money , you work. Need a place to live , you find a place and move.There is no need to live from knowledge , which is behavior acquired through your education and experience ( the past), life is always new, you can\u2019t meet with it with the old.The past belongs to the personality. In facing life without taking anything personal is to be open to Life. In this openness there is Intelligence Sensitivity and wisdom. There is nothing personal about this Intelligence and Wisdom.The response [ Response-ability]. arises from the situation and dissolves with the situation, leaving no residue. There is freedom from any personal point of view , no need to believe in anything the mind projects , because mind cannot know what it means to be the living in the New moment, the creative timeless Now. That is how Socrates or Lao Tzo lived, (not sure about Plato ), definitely Diogenes , lived that way , free from societal norms and conformity, the only highest Goodness , was love of Truth , at any cost. in fact Death is not a problem for a free man, Socrates was wrongly accused of corrupting the youth at that time and was sentenced to death by drinking the poison hemlock; he died in front of his students , fearless and at peace.
