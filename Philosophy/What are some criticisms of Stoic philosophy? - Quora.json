            "answer_text": "Just the criticisms of Stoicism as it actually is, or also the ones of Stoicism as it\u2019s often seen (i.e. based on misinterpretation)? Either might be useful, so I\u2019ll look at both. Legitimate Criticisms (based on a correct understanding of Stoicism) The claim that a person can achieve eudaimonia exclusively through virtue\u2014without any dependence on externals\u2014may or may not be true. Since the Sage is not someone that\u2019s claimed to be common, it\u2019s virtually impossible to verify. Other schools of thought like Peripateticism and Epicureanism included other factors in the pursuit of eudaimonia.Response: various ascetics throughout history (Cynics, Buddhist ascetics, etc) seem to have been perfectly happy with it; granted, this doesn\u2019t take it to the fullest extent (e.g. torture), but it\u2019s something. Regardless, even if our claim isn\u2019t true, training oneself to approach that capability to the extent possible certainly isn\u2019t going to hurt.From the other end of things, permitting the enjoyment of preferred indifferents\u2014simply waiting your turn, as opposed to turning it down altogether, per Enchiridion 15\u2014can be argued to be detrimental to the pursuit of virtue. This would be the challenge from the Cynic perspective, which held askesis, training (asceticism), as a requirement rather than the Stoic approach of simply recommending it from time to time.Response: it\u2019s definitely not as good practice for temperance and fortitude to indulge in preferred indifferents, and we freely admit that Cynicism is, per Epictetus, the shorter path to virtue. However, accepting a pleasure is not equivalent to intemperance, and it is possible to do so without mistaking the nature of the thing (preference, rather than desire).Stoicism\u2019s references to Nature can be ambiguous or difficult to justify. Does Nature refer to nature as we use it today? Then it\u2019s very difficult to draw any morality from it. Does Nature refer to Divine Nature, Logos? Then it works fine if you\u2019re a pantheist in particular or a theist in general, but makes Stoicism reliant on theism. Does Nature refer to the individual\u2019s ideal nature (which is how I interpret it)? That\u2019s broadly workable, but we don\u2019t know that that\u2019s actually what it means.Response: there isn\u2019t a clear-cut answer here, but Stoicism is a philosophy, not a religion, and can therefore be updated in response to challenges. It is no issue for Stoic practice to choose the \u201cideal nature\u201d interpretation, where the ideal nature of a human includes rationality and altruism.And for a more extreme version of the first point: is virtue relevant to eudaimonia at all? Hedonist philosophies, for instance, would say otherwise. Even Epicureanism, which did see virtue as valuable, used it only as a means to an end (the wise person will be tranquil\u2014the goal being tranquility, not wisdom).Response: many, many examples suggest that virtue provides for more lasting happiness than pleasure. Many hedonists find themselves self-destructing, or at the very least their happiness is fragile (if they lose their pleasures). For virtue, on the other hand, we can point to many examples of happy ascetics\u2014and none that come to mind of those who are both wise in the Stoic sense and unhappy, or at risk of losing their happiness.Virtue ethics in general are impossible to apply to other people. I can say my own conduct is right or wrong, but I can\u2019t say the same of yours. This very point is repeated throughout Stoic texts, like in Enchiridion 45 (\u201cDoes someone bathe quickly? Then don\u2019t say he bathes badly, but that he bathes quickly.\u201d).Response: why do we need to judge other people? We can act for the common good without passing judgement, and if correction is needed, we can act with the aim of preventing and correcting harm rather than of punishing erroneous behavior (restorative vs retributive justice\u2014the former generally being far more effective, and the Stoic approach).Misunderstandings Stoicism requires practitioners to be emotionless or to suppress their emotions.Response: Stoic doctrine does not teach us to attack emotions directly, only at that level to moderate them if necessary (i.e. don\u2019t let anger make you hurt someone). Rather, we approach it at the origin, correcting our false judgements so that problematic emotions do not arise and do not need to be suppressed. And this is not emotionlessness\u2014Stoics have no issue with joy, for instance. We merely avoid false judgements, and the resulting passions (fear and anger, for instance, arise from the false belief that externals can be bad).Stoicism is overly masculine or male-centric.Response: \u201cmanliness\u201d in the translations is an alternate translation of \u201cvirtue\u201d\u2014and that\u2019s just phrasing. Are you claiming that wisdom is a masculine characteristic? That seems doubtful. This is one of those bizarre arguments that implies that men are more rational than women.Stoicism teaches apathy and that its practitioners should accept injustice/not be politically active.Response: Stoicism teaches that we shouldn\u2019t be troubled by externals. It does not teach that we shouldn\u2019t act\u2014in fact, there is an imperative to act in the virtue of Justice. Stoics are required to act for the common good, but to do so in a calm and rational way. And has this not been shown to be more effective historically? MLK, Gandhi, Nelson Mandela\u2014all approached politics with moderation and discipline. Those who took a less restrained approach? Unless outright war was necessary (revolutions), they are historical footnotes, interesting people who didn\u2019t accomplish very much.(I\u2019ve read all three of those from the same person, some Cambridge philosopher who can\u2019t possibly have actually read the texts of the philosophy she\u2019s criticizing, or else she\u2019d know those are all incorrect).

            "answer_text": "Stoic philosophy has 3 parts: physics, logic and ethics. Crticisms of physics (there are many) may relate to discoveries we have made about our world since Stocism was founded 2,300 years ago, and also that the Ancient Stoics believed in a creator. I am not familiar with critiques of stoic logic - what I know about their logic is that it is pretty reasonable. Criticisms of Stoic ethics may be more interesting for us. Among these: it isn't funit is too hard to practice (for the average human)it is actually impossible (for a human to become a Stoic sage)it doesn't work (Stoic suppositions about emotions are wrong)it is unsatisfactory from an eschatalogical perspective (Christians might say this)Leaving aside both the eschatalogical critique and the lack of fun point, a practicing Stoic might respond: \"Yes, it is hard. So what? I am taking responsibility for my feelings and emotions. It's worth the effort. \"It may be impossible to fully become a sage, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. The benefits of miving in that direction are worth it. \"And it does work. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is empirically proven to work, and it is essentially applied Stoicism.\" ",
