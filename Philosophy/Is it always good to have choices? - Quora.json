            "answer_text": "Not always. It's good to have choices and options available but not always. That's what I think cause sometimes it can become confusing for the person what to choose and sometimes end up choosing the wrong thing and they regret that later. And if somebody doesn't have a choice then they know that they \u201chave to do it\u201d so in some cases it can be good not to have choices. But only in some cases. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Yes because at least you have the option to choose which one you want. No because sometimes when u are not left with any choices, you have to choose it no matter what. Having choices is also confusing. Deciding which one to choose can also make you feel stress and pressure. ",
