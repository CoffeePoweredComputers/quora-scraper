            "answer_text": "\u201cThere is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance.\u201d Does this quote from Socrates entail that there is no true evil in this world? I suspect that you fail to appreciate just how evil ignorance can be. It accounts for every massive blunder humans make and every massive problem they create needlessly, and those blunders and problems in turn account for a great deal of their suffering. It also accounts, of course, for the difficulty they encounter in solving problems, and that in turn accounts for the rest of their major suffering. Would there be racism in the absence of ignorance? Would women be disadvantaged and mistreated? Would tribalism hold sway, and carry the threat of war, including catastrophic war by means of WMD, as it does? Would bad government take hold? Would the environment be ravaged? And so on indefinitely. To a small extent, maybe, but only to a small extent. On the other hand, would cancer continue to destroy lives? To take it further, to the point of controversy, would aging run people down and strip them of their possibilities? No, because our inability to date to solve problems like these\u2014assuming that aging is a problem\u2014is due, of course, to our ignorance of the solutions. And if you think that aging is not a problem, perhaps that is precisely because it appears to be largely beyond control, due to ignorance, of course. Will the future be better than the past? Well, there is a good chance of that. Why? Due, of course, to advances in knowledge and understanding, which is to say, the elimination of ignorance, and at bottom, due entirely, or almost entirely, to that. In my opinion, the words you quote do not get it quite right, for suffering is the true fundamental evil, or negative value, not ignorance, and joy the true fundamental good, or positive value, not knowledge. But ignorance is indeed the fundamental practical problem, and knowledge the fundamental solution. My answer, then, is no, Socrates meant that in the final analysis there is one genuine and grave evil, an evil as profound as can be, in the form of ignorance. ",

            "answer_text": "If Socrates wanted to say there is no true evil in this world he would have said it just like that. And then he would have listened with great interest to what his listeners had to say about his comment. This quote on its own does not state at all that there is no true evil in this world. What this question says, clearly, is that Socrates believes that ignorance is the only evil. The belief of a thing does not make it so. Socrates knew this, and probably would go into the whole issue if this question on Quora were posed to him. But he would then go back to the original statement, \u201cignorance is the only evil,\u201d and say it out loud. In the face of a follower\u2019s instinctive disbelief, Socrates might then go on to ask a few questions that would elicit a follower\u2019s new understanding in much the same light that other people answering this Quora question have indicated. Socrates didn\u2019t say he was right. He only said \u201cignorance is the only evil\u201d. If a student questioned this, by saying something like, \u201cBut what about murder? Isn\u2019t it an evil?\u201d he would then proceed with a series of questions for the student to answer about his own objection. It might go something like this. Could you define murder as a belief on the part of the murderer that he/she has a right to kill another? A brave student might say, \u201cBut no one has a right to kill another person.\u201d (Insert Q&A discussion of \u201crights of a person\u201d here.) Socrates would likely ask then: \u201cWhat if the murderer is better than the person s/he kills?\u201d (Insert Q&A discussion of the meaning of better than here. Some student would likely mention that it is better to kill one person than a hundred\u2026 or some other worse fate. What is meant by a \u201cworse fate\u201d would be questioned and answered, and who gets to choose, etc. etc.) Eventually, Socrates would then go back to the brave student\u2019s original opinion and ask: Is the murderer, always, then, ignorant of what his rights over other human beings are? And finally, the brave student would just have to say \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got me, murder is obviously an act of ignorance.\u201d Could you define evil of any sort you can think of as an act of ignorance? The point is, with Socrates, to look at what he says as both what he believes to be true, and as an opening gambit to get a reaction, and then, by examining the student\u2019s own reaction (through him asking the student very cleverly designed questions), to have the student change or even contradict their original opinions. This method of opening the student\u2019s mind through clever questions based on the student\u2019s own answers, ethics, and logic is called \u201cThe Socratic Method\u201d of teaching. Trust me, if you were a student of Socrates, you would certainly come to believe, that there is indeed true evil in this world, and that it is indeed ignorance. (Though you\u2019d have to go on a whole other voyage of discovery about the concept \u201ctrue\u201d first.) ",
