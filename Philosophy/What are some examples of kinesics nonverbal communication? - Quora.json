            "answer_text": "In the world of communication, we interact with others through our 3 major senses - sight, sound, and touch (smell and taste are the lessor senses, rounding out the 5 senses). Kinesics (noun), or kinestethic (adjective) refers to the touch (including movement) category. Since your question is on nonverbals, not verbals, let me respond to that. Examples of nonverbal communication that express meaning without saying a word are numerous; a hug for affection, a pat on the back for comfort, a light touch on the arm or hand for instant connection, a handshake upon greeting, etc. Then there\u2019s all the examples of self-placating and body movement that communicates much: a finger on the temple, rubbing of the chin, tugging of an ear, playing with one\u2019s hair, itching one\u2019s nose, steepling one\u2019s fingers, clenching one\u2019s hands into fists, biting one\u2019s lip, swinging one\u2019s leg, crossing one\u2019s leg, etc, etc, etc. It\u2019s a long list. Most important is not only noticing the nonverbals, but then understanding the communication signals that are conveyed. For example, what do different handshakes say about the other person entering into a meeting with you? What does your handshake say about your feelings towards the upcoming interaction? Are you happy? tenuous? nervous? withholding? insecure? hopeful? timid? When should you use a light touch on the arm, or better yet, on the hand (skin to skin)? What does it convey? Nonverbals make up the biggest part of communication, because they are hard to fake - the body automatically flashes the truth; words can lie. The science of body language is a fascinating look at the mechanics underneath the subconscious behavior that we all convey, intentionally and unintentionally, through our nonverbals. ",
