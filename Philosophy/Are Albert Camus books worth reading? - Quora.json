            "answer_text": "I will tell you about him and his books, you decide for yourself whether his books are worth reading. In an era of branding life as not worth living, Albert Camus wanted to rebrand the worthlessness as the worthiest thing in life. He questions the setup of the society, he questions the social protocol and his novel, \u201cThe Stranger\u201d is one of the best examples of Ad Hominem fallacy but that is not the only best thing about the novel. He was awarded Nobel Prize in the year 1957 \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times.\" If you are against the herd mentality, you will totally love Camus.
