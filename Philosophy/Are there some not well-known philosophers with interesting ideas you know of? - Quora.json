            "answer_text": "Yes, many. Robert Kane is relatively obscure. Yet he seems to me one of the greatest of contemporary philosophers. He was born in 1938, and he is still alive though retired from academia. Kane is the foremost exponent of the incompatibilist/indeterminist view of free will. Just call it \u201cin/in\u201d for short. The idea is that (a) we should hope that the universe, and especially our own actions, are somewhat indeterminate. This need not involve a transcendental soul \u2014 simple randomness can be involved. But indeterminism would be good news because it is necessary to make sense out of our intuitions about moral responsibility, etc. Determinism is incompatible with those important intuitions. Also, the in/in view says (b) that indeterminism is also the fact, our a priori hope is satisfied. The in/in position was perhaps first maintained by ancient atomists and Epicureans, when they spoke of atoms \u201cswerving\u201d randomly. In modern times, it was set out by William James in a famous essay, \u201cThe Dilemma of Determinism.\u201d It was also expounded by at least two other Big Names since James \u2014 Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper. Robert Kane is not as eminent as any of those folks, but he has been competently carrying the baton for these ideas in recent years. ",

The one philosopher who is not very well-known but who has truly worthwhile ideas is Ayn Rand. If you are wanting to read her work, start with Anthem, then Philosophy: Who Needs It, then The Fountainhead, and then Atlas Shrugged. They will change your life. ",

Sometimes I found him self contradictory but, that too, can help you to think for yourself. Perhaps it was one of his teaching tools. A good book of his is \u201cFreedom From The Known\u201d. You might like to have a hardcopy but you can also read it on-line via this PDF. https://selfdefinition.org/krishnamurti/Jiddu_Krishnamurt_Freedom_from_the_Known.pdf ",
