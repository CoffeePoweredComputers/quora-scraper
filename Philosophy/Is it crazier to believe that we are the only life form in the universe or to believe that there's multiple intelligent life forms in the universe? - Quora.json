            "answer_text": "Multiple intelligent life forms when? You mean, like right now? Because when aliens exist is just as important as where aliens exist. I believe there is no other intelligent life in the galaxy - perhaps no other life at all - in this same exact tiny sliver of time we occupy. Humans are so impatient, assuming that if we exist right here, right now, then surely alien life must also exist right here, right now. The expected lifespan of the universe is 100 trillion years (that\u2019s a mind-boggling one-hundred-thousand billion years, of which we have completed just 14.6 billion). Imagine 1 million spacefaring species come and go during those 100 trillion years. Surely, you could say intelligent life would be very common by that measure. But that would come out to one civilization every 100 million years. It\u2019s possible aliens just visited us in the recent past, or will in the immediate future - say, 100 million years either way. By comparison, the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. Life and intelligent life may be so rare in our microscopic time scale that it never exists in more than one place at the same time and there may be immense stretches of time (by our perception) when there is no life, anywhere. But in the time scale of the universe, intelligent life may be very common. Just not as we perceive things in our minuscule time scale. Both things may be true at the same time. Human beings have been around what, 100,000 years? Yet that\u2019s just one-billionth of the expected lifespan of the universe. We exist at a very tiny scale, both in terms of time and distance. Just 10 billion years after the universe started, we know life evolved on Earth. But the Earth has had intelligent life for just the past 1/30,000th of its existence. For aliens to find us, they would have to exist in the same teeny blip of time we occupy. To communicate with alien civilizations under these circumstances, the best we could hope to do is have them find one of our automated probes. So far, just one has barely left the solar system. Spacefaring civilizations may pass each other like trains in the night, with trillions of miles and hundreds of millions of years separating them. Not only are their planets incredibly far apart, but they don\u2019t even coexist in anywhere near the same time frame. The chances are much greater that an asteroid will crash into Earth and cause a mass extinction. We know for a fact one of these \u201calien visitors\u201d comes by very frequently - every 60 million years or so - and we\u2019re overdue for one but strangely, no one is too concerned about that.

            "answer_text": "She raises an excellent point. Both can be said to be equally crazy depending on what metrics you're using. If we go only with our current observations, we have nothing to suggest we're not alone in the universe. No signals have been sighted that could come from other species, but our own behaviour would seem to suggest we should expect some. Belief in aliens then would seem to be based entirely on faith, making it fundamentally irrational. But then on the other hand we have statistics. Hard science, also supported by observation as being a decently accurate way to predict conditions and events that we can't directly observe. And statistical models state with near certainty that mankind can't be the only civilization in the universe, and furthermore explains that the lack of signals can be explained by the vanishingly low chances of us being in the right place at the right time to pick up any signal that might come from another species. Ignoring a statistical model with that level of certainty is also fundamentally irrational given that we've observed such models are rarely wrong to the point they'd need to be for mankind to be the only intelligent species. Personally, I subscribe to the statistical model, as the difficulties of observing space and the short time we've been doing it makes me inherently wary of our observations. But I can't fault the people who choose to base their belief purely on observable evidence either. ",
