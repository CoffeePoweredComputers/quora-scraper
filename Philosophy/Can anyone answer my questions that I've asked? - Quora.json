            "answer_text": "\u201cCan anyone answer my questions that I've asked?\u201d They might be able to, John, but it might help to specify which of your questions in particular you would like answers to. I would point out that a lot of them would be quite easily answered by pasting them directly into Google. These are not the sort of questions that Quora is for, really. Some of your questions would be more likely to receive answers were they to be more clear and better edited: for example, \u201cHow did Iran lose azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Dagestan, inguesshetia and Crimean and Central Asia the whole of it to Russia?\u201d or \u201cHow were the Persians not well equipped and not better equipped unlike the Greeks who were better equipped and well equipped and well trained too and Persians weren't any of this at all?\u201d I note too that Quora is adding topics to your questions. It might help your quest for answers if you were to add topics yourself when posing a question. Finally, you might consider filling in your profile. People like to know something about the person posing a question - and perhaps reassurance that you are not just seeking homework help for, for example, a course on Ancient History! ",

Good Luck! There may be other ways, but if you\u2019ve got specific questions that are escaping answers, this may be one way to advertise. ",
