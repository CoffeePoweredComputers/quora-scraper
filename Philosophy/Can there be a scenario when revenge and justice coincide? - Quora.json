            "answer_text": "You might have heard about \u201cball tampering\u201d scandal. This scenario proves the coincidence of revenge and justice. I will tell you how. After the scandal both Warner and Smith were convicted of guilt. They were subjected to ban for two years, one year respectively. But many senior players had expressed that the decision to ban them for such a long time was really harsh and it might even destroy their careers. But,what made Cricket Australia take such harsh decision. Before six months of ball tampering scandal there was a strike by the Australian cricket team led by Warner and supported by captain Smith urging the cricket board to hike their salaries. They even threatened the board that they will not be playing the Ashes series if there plea for salary hike is not considered. Eventually,the board came down to hike their salaries. The board was angry with these people from then and waiting for a chance to take revenge. Then the ball tampering took place and the board was happy that it got a chance to take revenge of the person who troubled them.Hence the ban was induced to players. In this scenario, Cricket Australia took revenge of the players and at the same time justice was done by punishing them. This reminds me of a quotation \u201c Two birds at a single shot!!\u201d. ",
