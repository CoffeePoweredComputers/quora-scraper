            "answer_text": "In some sense, the US Constitution is built on Kantian ethics, at least the procedural justice component of it. I think the law more broadly is probably based on Kantian ethics. Kantian ethics also partially served as the basis for human dignity in the Western tradition. Its also worth noting that it has value as a principle. It has a distinct track record. Ethical systems don\u2019t rise and fall simply off of its ability to deal with so called hard cases that only represent 3% or less of real life scenarios. I think it has to be understood in the larger context. Its not perfect. Its just better than the alternatives. And it makes 100% more sense than relativism does. Notions of human intrinsic value, fairness, justice, truth, and even rights are hard to communicate and compare without attention to questions of absolute value which Kantian ethics, as opposed to utilitarian ethics provides. Ultimately, its the best of all of the following are necessary to understanding ethics: Virtue ethicsKantian ethicsContractarian ethics (perhaps a subset of Kantian ethics)Utilitarian ethicsNot to mention without these tools questions of the following become much, much more difficult to resolve\u2014fairly and justly: Political ethics/government ethicsBusiness ethicsApplied ethicsRelational ethicalSomething about integrity and wholeness requires telling the truth and keeping commitments and being fair and respectful to those around us. Those are best captured by virtue theory and Kantian ethics. As such finding systems that understand this value in the utilitarian context, like rule utilitarianism (as opposed to act utilitarianism) is likely the best alternative to those who think in utilitarian terms. This best captures our moral intuitions as human beings about truth, rights, fairness, and justice. ",

            "answer_text": "Positive: Very clear in its rules and principles and can usually be easily applied to any real-life situation, similarly to utilitarianism. Also has what I would consider a good underpinning principle, which is that human beings should be treated as ends in themselves, rather than means to an end (essentially that human dignity must be respected above all). Negative: Does not account properly for the idea of a wrongdoing by omission. Kant tries to cover this with his idea of imperfect duty, which is down to the individual\u2019s discretion, but I personally do not find this solution compelling as it seems to me to be arbitrary and ad hoc. It is also fairly easy to construct a scenario wherein the solution advocated by Kantian ethics seems either wrong or unclear, and given how much importance Kant himself placed on ethical instincts this seems to me to be a pretty solid punch in the gut to deontology. Overall Kantian deontology is certainly a fine rule of thumb for making ethical decisions and is based on good ideas and instincts, but ultimately I don\u2019t think it succeeds as a complete moral system.
