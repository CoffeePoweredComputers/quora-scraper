            "answer_text": "Our understanding is not correct. Otherwise there are no issues with materialism or spirituality. In the following enlightenment story Nick is materialistic whereas as Eric is spiritual. Who is materialistic and who is spiritualistic is based on John's imagination. Imagine a person named John is dreaming. In the dream, John friends Eric and Nick are going to a movie. Further imagine, Eric knows he is in the dream of John. Nick doesn't know that he is in the dream of John. We can call Eric an enlightened person because he knows the truth or he knows the reality. Nick is non-enlightened person because he doesn't know the truth.  In the dream, Eric's and Nick's life goes on depending upon John's imagination.  Eric knows he is not an independent person and he knows he is part of John's dream. When there are disappointing situations, Eric knows it is all part and parcel of John's dream. So, Eric remains peaceful.  However, Nick doesn't know that he is part of someone's dream. So in disappointing situations, he suffers. He blames himself for those situations. Nick doesn't know that his life events are based on John's imagination.  That slight difference of understanding makes a hell of a difference in life. That is the difference between an enlightened person and a non-enlightened person.  We are part and parcel of God. We are not separate from God. We are one indivisible individual with the whole (nondualism). However, we strongly feel that we are individuals with free will. That thinking is ego. On contrary, if we think, we are one with God it generates inner peace.  So, an enlightened person knows that he is part and parcel of God. However, a non-enlightened person cannot believe it. That non-believing becomes the reason for his suffering.  In the end, neither, an enlightened person is any superior, nor, a non-enlightened person is any inferior. Every human being and everything else is part and parcel of God. So realize, God is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. ",

            "answer_text": "Materialism has always undermined spirituality. Is there more today than in past times? Are people more attached to self and materialism than ever before or are we just seeing more evidence of what has always been going on because of social media and how we all display our inner and outer goods for all the world to see? It may be the product of bias since I am interested in spiritual matters and so I see more spiritual content and more spiritually-inclined individuals on the internet but I get the sense that in this \u2018Age of Aquarius\u2019 the human race is experiencing the beginnings of a spiritual renaissance - more people than ever before are questioning life and its meaning, and are turning to spiritual solutions for their unhappiness and away from rampant materialism and even traditional religious solutions. That being said, it\u2019s as though we are living in \u2018the best of times and the worst of times\u2019. I also get the sense as many Christians may be getting that we are living in or near the end times or that the world is spiralling downward to some sort of mega-catastrophe or multiple disasters from which recovery may be very difficult, if not impossible. I need only mention \u2018climate change\u2019 as one of our swords of Damocles, and you\u2019ll know what I mean. ",
