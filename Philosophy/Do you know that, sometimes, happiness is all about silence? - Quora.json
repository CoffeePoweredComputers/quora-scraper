Example: Whenever I talk to my best friend, we often become silent and not say anything. For a long time we didn\u2019t even notice that none of us was saying something. It was after weeks of this silence that my friend pointed out this amazing thing we were experiencing. I now feel proud of this level of understanding we have attained. ",
