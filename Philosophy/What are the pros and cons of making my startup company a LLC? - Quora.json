            "answer_text": "Pros- LLC is relatively simple to set upLLC is relatively simple to manage from a legal standpointLLC offers flexibility in that you can choose how to be taxed for US federal and state tax purposes, so you can choose the form that best fits your business model.LLC offers some intangible clout that you are a \"real\" businessLLC may offer some legal liability protection to separate the assets of the owners from the activities of the business.Cons- If you are operating as a sole proprietorship or partnership an LLC  adds some additional cost and reporting obligations upfront and possibly ongoing, that you may not otherwise have.If you later want to convert to a C Corp to seek outside investors in the business, conversion can be cumbersome at best or may even be impossible.There are no tax advantages to an LLC in and of itself, although see point 3 above the tax structure you choose may offer some advantages.If liability protection is an issue you may want to consult an attorney as LLC statues are not as well established as corporate statutes are. An LLC is a legal entity established under local state laws, so those laws can vary.",
