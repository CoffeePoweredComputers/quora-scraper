            "answer_text": "Everything can potentially be false at any time. However, with regards to the standards of a scientific model of the world, nothing is considered existent until (a) you prove it\u2019s there, (b) you prove it\u2019s not something else, and (c) you demonstrate that its existence is capable of predicting future occurrences or phenomena. For instance, if I want to demonstrate that rain is the product of the water cycle instead of Zeus\u2019 mercy, I first observe rain over a long period of time so as to record the pattern it follows, I demonstrate that this pattern does not follow arbitrary whims or respond to prayers and therefore cannot be the work of a capricious, arbitrary god such as Zeus, and then I use the water cycle to predict when it will rain next and how much water will fall (an impossible feat if I\u2019m wrong, given that a characteristically jealous god like Zeus would itch to prove me wrong by forcing rain out of its patterns). Technically, in that example, the burden of proof is on the people claiming that Zeus makes rain, because I would be trying to refute a claim that was never proven to begin with. However, the introduction of the scientific standard model often requires a demonstration of its merits to be accepted, and therefore you would willingly take the burden of proof onto your shoulders so as to perform one. Also, \u2018can not be proven\u2019 is more or less a meaningless term in science. It may well be that people in the future will find a way to prove something true. Unless you have reason to believe that the problem is unfalsifiable, that the explanation inherently has no conceivable experiment with which one could potentially demonstrate truth, in which case that problem falls outside the realm of science by definition (because an explanation needs to have a potential testing method in order to be considered scientifically verified) and straight-up doesn\u2019t count.

            "answer_text": "Question originally answered: If something can not be proven to be true, can it potentially be false?  But of course. One thing that we do know about false propositions is they cannot be demonstrated to be true, so being unable to prove something true, is a sign that one should at least consider that it might be false. Now of course it does matter in which context this question is being asked. Are we talking about some claim Joe Blow made to you while drunk at the bar last night or are we talking about some proposition in a formal system of logic. If we are talking about informal claims, then the methods at our disposal to decide the matter are different than when it concerns a formal proposition in logic. In the informal case we can, beg, steal and borrow, trick, cajole, manipulate and if necessary even coerce. None of these are possible in the case of formal logic. Here we have only two possibilities, given your presumption that the proposition cannot be proven true: The proposition can be proven false, and in that case, it is of course false.The proposition cannot be proven false. In this case the proposition is called undecidable. Whether or not it is actually true depends on the specific model you choose to evaluate the proposition in. In some models it will be a true statement in others false.",

The first could be anything from, say, a 30% chance right out to trillions to one against. I have a suspicion that your question is related to the question of the existence or otherwise of God. Most Atheists will say they cannot prove God does not exist, so it is possible, but they will add that the odds are so long they discount the possibility. In my case I believe that Genesis has been proven false and so the Abrahamic God does not exist. I can\u2019t speak for Thor or Zeus but for them I revert to the standard atheist response. The chance is so small as to be easily disregarded. ",

This is an old type of inference that was already common when Aristotle was writing about logic. He identified such inferences as fallacious, and subsequent logicians named them Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (argument from ignorance). The logic of this fallacy is that no valid inference can be made from a position of no knowledge. It is a permutation of the dictum ex nihilo, nihil fit (from nothing, nothing comes). So, can a claim that cannot be proven true be potentially false? Yes, but one cannot validly claim that it is definitely false. ",

They always fail to disprove the gods they reject, or to substantiate the god/s they accept. The most common iteration is: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. I usually counter with: absence of evidence is not evidence of presence either. The burden of proof lies with the original claim, if you can't disprove a claim, it does not automatically follow that said claim is true. ",

You could argue that anything is possible, even that you will suddenly turn into a slimy monster with an insatiable appetite for cookies. And I\u2019d agree - after all, it\u2019s possible that we all just live in a computer simulation, or that I am the only one who really exists and everyone else is just my imagination. And lest you think I\u2019m making fun of you, I\u2019m not - there are plenty of philosophical debates on such possibilities. But while everything is theoretically possible, not everything is probable in practice. If you make a statement which defies the laws of physics, for example, it\u2019s highly improbable to be true. If you believe something extraordinary will happen but have no rational argument for it, it\u2019s improbable that people will take it seriously. And yet, many things we take for granted today were once believed to be impossible. The scientific method keeps pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and capabilities, so sometimes pursuing the impossible might well be worth it! ",
