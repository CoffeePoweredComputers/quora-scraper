            "answer_text": "I don't think so..There is nothing like Good and Bad, because you might see Good in something where everybody sees bad. There are bad things for you,which are good to others. Everybody has his own perspective and his moral values depends upon the Environment in which he grew up. For instance killing animals is a sin for some people, but the same thing is the business for many ones which is not a bad thing and they worship their business. So there are only Independent moral values but not Universal ones.. ;) ;) ",
