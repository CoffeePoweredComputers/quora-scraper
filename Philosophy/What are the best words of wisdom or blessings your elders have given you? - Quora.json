I am one of the unlucky ones ,to start with zero balance in both these accounts. I am sure that I am not the only one who started like this. Many or most of richest people today , spiritually as well as financially, started from scratch. Did these \u201c zero balnces\u201d effect me , yes the journey throughout was difficult but was possible. I am still suffering due to lack of guidance in the early stages of life. I am happy that my mental assets are much bigger than physical ones, which is also not bad. Let me just briefly touch upon few points of wisdom , which I picked up my self during the course of journey so far. Appreciate how wonderful this life is and people around us .
