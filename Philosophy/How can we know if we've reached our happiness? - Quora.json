            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. What helps me is remembering that happiness is not a destination, it's a byproduct of other things. Take another example like 'good health'. Being healthy is a byproduct of laughing, walking, fresh air, enjoying food, having good friends and spending time with them. Do all these things and good health will probably follow. But set 'good health' as a goal and you are always worrying and measuring and being a trial to your friends about what you can and can't eat. You become a bit of a crank. I think happiness is the same. If you pursue kindness, friendship, exercise, work you can lose yourself in and treating others well then one day you will notice you are happy. But pursue happiness and you risk spending a lot of time unhappy with your lot. And since happiness is partially a mood it will also come and go, just like our other moods. Realising this is a large part to becoming happier. But wanting to throw a switch which turns happiness on permanently will, ironically, only make you less happy. Treat yourself well, treat others well, enjoy what you've been given and happiness will be along soon enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A to A. Another great thought provoking question. My answer is that you can only individually answer that question for one's self. Personally, I do not know of anyone that has stated they have \"reached\" their happiness. I do believe most want to be happy, and make others happy as well. I do believe I feel happy everyday, sad everyday, scared everyday, etc.. since you made me think of it. Looking back, as just an observation, I believe little things have made me happier than big things in life. Happiness, for me has not ever been a \"constant\" state. I want it to be though, so I will follow this question on Quora. I am not sure it can be a constant when change occurs every millisecond that marches by. ",

I know this because once a few decades ago I tried to analyze myself few times and always failed to do so. I have given up and have felt much better ever since. The question that I asked myself is - Who am I? I will probably live for 85 yrs, and that is a speck of time compared to the billions and billions of years of this universe. Just after this speck of time, that was given to me, I am just a pinch of dust. So basically, today too, I consider myself a pinch of dust. So what is happiness or sadness for this pinch of dust? Accept life as it comes, let life lead you, and we as a human being have the responsibility to live life to the fullest at that moment of time. ",
