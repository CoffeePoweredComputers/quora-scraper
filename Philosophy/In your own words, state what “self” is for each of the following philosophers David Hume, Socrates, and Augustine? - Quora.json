            "answer_text": "I think David Moore has it right, but I wanted to expound a bit on Socrates view of \u201cself\u201d ... Socrates\u2019 paradox: Paraphrased by David as, \u201cAll I know about me is that I don\u2019t know what I am.\u201d Often misquoted as, \u201cThe only thing I know is that I know nothing.\u201d In Plato\u2019s Republic, Book II, one English translation renders Plato\u2019s words placed in Socrates\u2019 mouth this way, \u201cAs for me, all I know is that I know nothing, for when I don't know what justice is, I'll hardly know whether it is a kind of virtue or not, or whether a person who has it is happy or unhappy.\u201d This sort of argument is not at all out of character for Socrates. He was somewhat fixated (maybe obsessively) on the incapacity of any person to objectively perceive anything, and really did seem to believe that whatever we are doing (collectively) in our attempts at civilization has only ever been best guesses, along with trial and error, along with frequent revisits to our old errors, as a species. Reminding himself of his inescapable perceptual shortfalls prevented him from incautious beliefs and kept his mind considering, always, another perspective, the more foreign from his own innate sense of things, the more he seemed to enjoy it. If one looks at it from a different point of view (an exercise Socrates would have happily received), Socrates saw self as an inherently flawed perception of the entity perceiving a tiny subset of reality, and as an inherently flawed perception of the results of that entity\u2019s prior perceptions of other tiny subsets of reality, all of which perceptions are inherently grossly incomplete, and flawed by their lack of adequate scope of perception. He was certain only that he lacked the required perspective for certainty, and he was equally certain that all humans are similarly impaired by insufficient ability to perceive. ",

            "answer_text": "This has the makings of an Existential Comics strip\u2026 Hume: \u201cWhenever I think about me it gets so dark that I just go get boozed with my mates and forget about it\u201d. Socrates: \u201cAll I know about me is that I don\u2019t know what I am\u201d. Augustine: \u201cWhat I am will be revealed to me when you, O God, glorify yourself in Christ by your gracious inclusion of myself in Him\u201d. Sources: Hume: Where am I, or what? From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return? ... I am confounded with all these questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable condition imaginable, environed with the deepest darkness, and utterly deprived of the use of every member and faculty. Most fortunately it happens, that since Reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, Nature herself suffices to that purpose, and cures me of this philosophical melancholy and delirium, either by relaxing this bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impression of my senses, which obliterate all these chimeras. I dine, I play a game of backgammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends. And when, after three or four hours' amusement, I would return to these speculations, they appear so cold, and strained, and ridiculous, that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any farther. Socrates: Umm\u2026.he\u2019s summarised by his paradox Augustine: Thou hast made us for thyself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it finds its rest in thee. \u2026.plus basically all of Confessions.
