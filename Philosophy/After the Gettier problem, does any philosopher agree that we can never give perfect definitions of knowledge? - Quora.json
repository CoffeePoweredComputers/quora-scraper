            "answer_text": "You are correct in your assumption. The Gettier problem exposes weakness in the use of an unequivocal set of concepts for establishing that which is knowledge. Justified true belief is not a benchmark for establishing that which is known but it can establish that which is pragmatic and pragmatic application may be used as a benchmark for determining a concept\u2019s truth, or rather whether the concept can be considered knowledge An organism\u2019s ability to abstract perception into concepts was developed for pragmatic purposes. The organism resides in an objective world in which itself, a subjective entity, uses abstractions so that it may orient to it. Truth can be defined as \u201cthe object of assessment\u201d and that which is true is determined by an arbitrary cutoff point for how accurately the object is being conceptually portrayed. Belief is \u201cthe foundational premise of any concept that is being used to describe reality\u201d. Justification\u2019s best definition is \u201cthat which is derived from the process that is being used by the believer\u2019s inner model to determine a concept\u2019s place in the believer\u2019s conceptual paradigm\u201d. There is no such thing as a pristine judgment of \u201cjustified true belief\u201d. All knowledge is tainted by the one who judges. The closest we can get to true knowledge is by not using our ability to abstract our perception into concepts. The closest we can get to conceptual knowledge is through empirical evaluation and the objective interaction that can result from the concept\u2019s use. If we make a mistake in our conceptual assessment but the objective results occur as if our assessment was accurate, we can call it a coincidence but our conceptual assessment was not knowledge. Inaccurate renditions of the truth ordinarily yield inaccurate assessments of what the objective results will be. ",

            "answer_text": "We can never have perfect knowledge of objective items, such as a chair or a star. Our knowledge of objective reality is limited to our senses, and our senses are very limited. For example, we cannot see infrared or ultraviolet light which would give additional information on the chair or star or whatever. We cannot hear below 20\u201350 Hz or above 15,000\u201320,000 Hz, which would give other information. We cannot detect very small differences in texture with our touch, or small differences in chemical properties with our taste or smell. Therefore, we cannot have perfect knowledge about physical things. Also, because we are not at all places at all times, we cannot have perfect knowledge of the relationship of things, like the position of a cow in the field. Therefore we cannot define objective knowledge perfectly. Plato knew this thousands of years ago; Gettier just gave examples how conclusions can be correct even if the underlying assumptions are incorrect. Heck, students have known that for a while, which is why they prefer multiple choice or true/false tests - there is a chance their conclusion is correct even if their underlying assumptions and knowledge is not. Does that mean there is no knowledge of anything that is perfect, including knowledge of knowledge? I don\u2019t think so. For example, we can have knowledge of a square that is precise and perfect. We may never be able to render a perfect square (if nothing else, the thickness of line we draw will waiver as we draw, making the sides imperfect), but that does not limit the knowledge of what a perfect square is (Plato called this the Form of a square). Since we can know what a perfect square is, and since we can perform operations with a perfect square that have perfect results (such as bisecting the square with a diagonal that creates two perfect right triangles), we can communicate perfectly that knowledge to others. Since that knowledge can be perfect, that means there is at least one case of perfect knowledge. That must mean there must be somewhere a perfect definition of at least some kinds of knowledge. Whether we can communicate the perfect definition to others via the imperfect medium of language is another issue. ",

            "answer_text": "This seems like almost a non-problem. I recommend reading all of the following, but reflecting on the limited application of it in relation to the highlighted part. Gettier was design to answer JTB (this may be elsewhere in the wikipedia article). Very few have advanced or defended JTB type claims: Alvin Plantinga rejects the historical analysis: According to the inherited lore of the epistemological tribe, the JTB [justified true belief] account enjoyed the status of epistemological orthodoxy until 1963, when it was shattered by Edmund Gettier... Of course there is an interesting historical irony here: it isn't easy to find many really explicit statements of a JTB analysis of knowledge prior to Gettier. It is almost as if a distinguished critic created a tradition in the very act of destroying it. [4] Despite this, Plantinga does accept that some philosophers before Gettier have advanced a JTB account of knowledge, specifically C. I. Lewis and A. J. Ayer. [4] I acknowledge possibility that I\u2019m not reading that correctly. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer: philosophers are more confused than you would expect, for such bright people. To me, the Gettier problem (click on the link to expose the Wikipedia page, which to its credit goes into a fair bit of detail) demonstrates (a) how confused they can become; and (b) how easy it is to waste time. (I too am typing this when I should actually be working :) In brief, Gettier creates the idea that knowledge is equivalent to \u201cJustified True Belief\u201d (JTB)\u2014and then proceeds to destroy the idea with counter-examples. In other words, \u2018knowledge of truth\u2019 can be absent even if someone can justify an assertion, it is \u2018in fact\u2019 true, and she believes it to be true. Of course. D\u2019Oh.*  The problem isn\u2019t really Gettier, but epistemology \u2014 haggling about \u2018the nature of knowledge\u2019, truth, and justification. Agonizing about JTB is just too banal. The nonsense evaporates if you realise that: All of our statements about reality depend on provisional assumptions. There can be no \u2018grounded truths\u2019. If there were, logical positivism would still be around as a viable theory. (It doesn\u2019t work, or even make sense).We can never, ever prove these assumptions to be true. We can however test them for (a) internal [logical] inconsistencies; and then (b) concordance with what we observe. This makes for good Science.If our assumptions prove to be inconsistent, we need to revise them.**Even if our assumptions withstand our sharpest arrows, that doesn\u2019t make them \u2018true\u2019, or even asymptotically true. We cannot assume linear relationships (we can\u2019t step outside everything and perceive the \u2018true nature of relationships\u2019, let alone linearity) so a small perceived difference may be vast from another perspective.The above does not mean that all perspectives are equally valid. For every assertion that even appears to work there is an infinity of things that really, really don\u2019t work. Even the knowledge that one of these \u201cthings that really really don\u2019t work\u201d may in fact work \u2018in a different framework\u2019 doesn\u2019t justify the assertion of equal validity \u2018in some framework\u2019 because our chances of even identifying that framework are infinitely remote. Something that still appears to work after vigorous testing in an established framework is a precious jewel. Science\u2014for example\u2014actually works. Contrast this with Pseudoscience.It\u2019s easy to get stuck in the goo of epistemology\u2014trying to find Platonic truths, and arguing about grue. But you\u2019re wasting your time. There are simply no centaurs on Elm street\u2014and we shouldn\u2019t waste time waving our hands about them. If you want to concentrate on anything, concentrate on brick houses, and forget the Gods of Homer. Don\u2019t accord them equal value (Sorry, Quine). A definition is either provisional and testable in context, or practically useless. And that\u2019s it. My 2c, Jo. *Clearly AbeBooks appreciates how much we value our philosophers <grin> **The danger of course is ad hoc shoring up with auxiliary hypotheses. Epicycles work\u2014in a sense\u2014but we can do better if we integrate in other testing of reality. You should welcome a bit of Bayesian logic here: the first order predicate calculus doesn\u2019t cut it alone. ",
