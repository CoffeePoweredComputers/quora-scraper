            "answer_text": "Most definitely. Argument to moderation is an informal fallacy. For example, lets try a thought experiment. Lets say that one group believes that the state should enslave all people with the letter \u201cc\u201d in their name. Another group believes that nobody should be enslaved. A position in the center would be that we should enslave some number of people with the letter \u201cc\u201d in their name, but not all. Is that an ethical position for one to have? Sometimes moderation/centrism is necessary, but we must determine that on a case to case basis. Often a good position is somewhere in between two contrary positions, but there are cases where an explicit binary does exist. Another thing to consider is that often the good position is not exactly fair to both sides. It can be biased toward one or the other, while making a few (rather than equal) concessions. ",
