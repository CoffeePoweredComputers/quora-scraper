First, there is a difference  between a narcissist and a person with NPD. People often get them confused.  I do too. My favorite narcissist joke is a narcissist says    \"...Okay, enough about me... what  do you think about me?....\"   Sorry - I think that's funny. Anyway; CRITERIA FOR NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER If you have narcissistic personality disorder, you may come across as conceited, boastful or pretentious. You often monopolize conversations. You may belittle or look down on people you perceive as inferior. You may feel a sense of entitlement \u2014 and when you don't receive special treatment, you may become impatient or angry. You may insist on having \"the best\" of everything \u2014 for instance, the best car, athletic club or medical care. (From the Mayo Clinic) Sound familiar? Many narcissists like to do things to impress others by making themselves look good externally. Narcissists uses people, objects, status, and/or accomplishments to represent the self, substituting for the perceived, inadequate \u201creal\u201d self.  To reach the level of a personality disorder, the behavior must be deeply ingrained, intense, displayed in a variety of situations, and maladaptive, causing long-term difficulties in personal relationships or in functioning in society.  Some Trump quotes; \"I will be the greatest jobs president God ever created.\"  \u201cOn social media, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s beloved\"  (comparing himself to Fox reporter Megyn Kelly)    One way to tell if a public figure is a narcissist is to see if criticisms (even minor ones) nearly always bring on an impulsive angry reaction. This is especially obvious in the Twitter age, when a fast reply is so easy.  It's one thing to sue magazines or organizations. But Trump turned his fury on a New York Times author who wrote that at the time Trump \"only\" had 250 million dollars. Trump sued him for five billion dollars, accusing the author of malice despite the fact that the author had three sources.  Trump, who was building the \"best golf course in the world\" on the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, was displeased when a homeowner near the golf course refused to sell him his house.  So without warning, the tycoon put a fence around the house and billed the owner for half the cost. The owner said: \"There is no way I'm going to pay it. As far as I'm concerned it's just another attempt to intimidate and bully me \"   Lack of empathy Trump contributes less to his Trump Charity foundation and even other contributors. Plus, he has a very stingy 401K plan for employees Donald Trump Operates Stingy 401(k) Plan for His Workers  http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150731/BLOGS02/150729822/the-charities-donald-trump-gave-money-to-and-what-it-says-about-his-candidacy   Relationships largely superficial and exist for personal gain and to inflate self-esteem Trump has had three wives and several children, divorcing the second shortly before the prenup would have kicked in and given her more money. Are we ready for a first couple who met on a reality TV show? Who knows? Perhaps he loves all of them truly, madly, deeply, although his obvious infidelity with wife 1 with wife 2 caused a dustup in the entertainment magazines. I just can't help noticing that as he gets older, his wives get younger. I have no doubt that having a trophy wife is part of the brand.  So, does he have NPD? I'm not qualified to answer that... although it seems to me counterintuitive not to. However, he lives in a capitalist society that strongly values men (women, not so much) like him.     I think what makes narcissists so effective at this is their complete conviction that they are actually special and entitled. The rules are for someone else. It is always easier to fool others when you have already fooled yourself.   That to me is the real danger -- when the grits hit the fan, it will be someone else's fault. Is Donald Trump Actually a Narcissist? Therapists Weigh In!  EDIT....I don't think the DSM thinks of NPD as a disorder anymore, but as I said, I'm not qualified to say. ",

            "answer_text": " Is Trump A Narcissist? There\u2019s little doubt that Trump is a narcissist. The bigger question is, is he higher up on the DSN\u2019s list of dangerous personality disorders? Is he a sociopath or psychopath?    {Directly above is a paragraph from The Atlantic written in January 2018.} There are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of articles written on Trump\u2019s mental health. Experts from around the world agree he falls in the \u201cdangerous personality disorder\u201d range. This is something that needs to concern every single American, regardless of party. There is a reason his personality is considered dangerous and why he needs to be removed from office ASAP. Trump has exhibited 100 percent of the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d personality traits. These traits are: Entitled And ArrogantNo EmpathyNo BoundariesPathological LiarsNeed To Control EverythingManipulativeGrandioseParanoidExploitiveNo RemorseBlameshiftersDon\u2019t Take Responsibility For Their Words Or ActionsVengefulTrump\u2019s list of lawsuits and alleged crimes are tremendous. The handful outlined below, displays he has no conscience, which falls in the range of the most criminal-mind behavior characteristic of all. He has stolen from others, exploits, intimidates and has no remorse in doing so. Trump University Case - He took $35K from students. Lawsuit lost where he had to return $25 million to students. {Theft and lying}Robert LiButti, a mob member, Trump had dealings and purchased nine luxury vehicles for him. Trump was fined $200K for keeping black employees away from LiButti\u2019s table. The courts acknowledged he worked with crime families, but no \u201cdeals\u201d found him \u201cguilty\u201d except of the aforementioned discrimination suit. {No boundaries}Tenants of Central Park South said Trump turned off heat and water to get them out of units. If they didn\u2019t \u201clisten,\u201d he reportedly sued them for $150 million. { Bodily threats and intimidation}Trump paid undocumented Polish workers only $5/hour when building Trump Tower. His model agency used undocumented models, too. {Exploitive}Trump sued author of Trump Nation for $5 billion. Case thrown out, but attorneys found Trump lied more than 30 times. {Grandiose and manipulative}He also sued comedian Bill Maher, says Wikipedia: \u201cIn 2013 Trump sued comedian Bill Maher for $5 million for breach of contract. Maher had appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and had offered to pay $5 million to a charity if Trump produced his birth certificate to prove that Trump's mother had not mated with an orangutan. This was said by Maher in response to Trump having previously challenged Obama to produce his birth certificate, and offering $5 million payable to a charity of Obama's choice, if Obama produced his college applications, transcripts, and passport records.\u201d The latter showcases who Trump just doesn\u2019t care what kind of suit he gets into, he just likes to fight. And he\u2019s fought in over 4,000 lawsuits, more than most on record. If he loses, and he has many big time losses, he proclaims to public he was actually the \u201cwinner.\u201d {Delusional} Being a winner, is one of the signature traits of a \u201cdangerous personality type,\u201d as they are incapable to self-inspection. They cannot see what they\u2019ve done wrong, and rarely take responsibility for doing wrong. So, this we know. Trump, with malicious intent, is willing to steal from others. We know he was willing to put tenants and others in bodily harm leaving them without heat or water. We know he deals with known criminals; American mob and reportedly the Russian mob. We know he will not pay his bills and has left local contractors \u201chigh and dry\u201d without paying them. We know he will implement \u201cslave labor\u201d as he did with the Polish workers. We know he has demonstrated and was sued by not letting black employees near his mob friend. We also know he thinks of women as objects and has 19 different women who claim assault or, in two cases, rape. We know he regularly lies to the public as the president, and we know he calls reporters \u201cstupid, losers\u201d and \u201cenemies of the people,\u201d which is, in my opinion, an assault on the First Amendment. We know he, according to Washington Post, has lied to the world and American citizens over 6,400 times. Beyond disturbing. CNN won the right to have Acosta\u2019s press pass restored, but the president, of course, says he\u2019ll just leave the room if he doesn\u2019t want to answer a question providing the question isn\u2019t down the line he deems fit. This is chilling and just another manipulative tactic to control the media. It\u2019s also very arrogant as the American people have the right to question and know what is happening in national and world wide politics. People who have personalities disturbances have an absolute need to control everything. If they cannot control it, they undermine it, do smear campaigns and will seek revenge upon the person or establishment, just as Trump stated when he was married to Marla Maples. He stated back then something of the sort, \u201cIf it takes me 10 years to get back at those who defy me, I will get revenge.\u201d Marla Maples\u2019 bodyguard reportedly killed himself 12 years after him working with Trump and it was stated he never could get past the Trump deal. Hmmmmm. People of America and the world have to be wary of Trump. He is dangerous and doesn\u2019t care if he undermines the constitution, people in office or allies. He is a skilled manipulator, and is rocking the foundation of our democracy. ",

            "answer_text": "Does Donald Trump have NPD? Do many politicians? We badly need to understand a number of very important things about those we vote into such unparalleled power. Those somethings are all about Narcissistic Personality Disorder. People with this disorder number 6.2% of the general population (Stinson et al, USA, 2008) and are drawn to positions of power and prestige \u2013 politics being a favourite.  (Photo credit and great article on the subject at Psychologists believe Trump is showing signs of severe mental illness) People with this disorder all show consistent traits: DuplicityNarcissists have two personas \u2013 their \u201cfalse self\u201d \u2013 a charming and charismatic fa\u00e7ade designed to garner support and admiration, and a \u201creal\u201d or \u201cauthentic\u201d self that is highly toxic \u2013 wracked with deep self-loathing and chronically low self-esteem, motivated by a completely different set of drivers and emotions that normal people. They are the classic Jekyll & Hyde split personalities written about by Robert Louis Stevenson. Pathological LiarsGiven that their entire public personality is a lie, so they are pathological liars in every walk of life \u2013 and will lie about anything as required to reinforce their fake persona, to garner support and to hide the monster that lies beneath the mask. It is for this reason that they will lie on the campaign trail, making all kinds of promises that they feel an electorate will like and buy, anything to get them a vote and into power. They feel little if any self-generated obligation to fulfil these promises once in office, however. Lack of FeelingsAlthough this may sound unbelievable, narcissists are incapable of feeling certain emotions including empathy, compassion and love. Brain scans indicate that the part of the brain responsible for feeling these emotions, the amygdala, simply has not developed properly. To compensate for this, narcissists carefully study neurotypical people and the way they display such emotions, and then mimic them as best they when appropriate. Doing so convincingly is a key part of the charade. So whilst many people may care about a range of issues \u2013 global warming, ecological collapse, law & order, healthcare, education etc \u2013 the sad reality is that narcissists have no genuine feelings about these issues at all, hence the hollow promises and inaction. Sense of EntitlementNarcissists feel they deserve preferential treatment from others, from the system and from life in general. It is for this reason that they fiddle their expenses as much as they do, they are so predisposed to bribery and corruption, and feel that they above the law. Self InterestWe erroneously believe that politicians act in the best interests of society and the constituencies they represent. In reality a narcissist will act entirely in their own self interest, saying anything and doing anything to get themselves ahead. They have a distinct lack of moral compass when it comes to anything outside their own benefit. LabileNormal people usually have genuine and profound views. Narcissists do not, tailoring instead their apparent opinions to their current audience, saying anything that they think will win them greater popularity, influence, power, wealth etc in the moment. Their views will therefore vary from day to day, depending on who it is they are talking with (or at). Serial CheatingWhilst crippled by lack of self-esteem, narcissists desperately what is termed narcissistic supply, or fuel, to feed their weak sense of self. For many of them their apparent attractiveness to the opposite sex is a key indicator and boost to their fragile ego. As a result they are constantly on the hunt for new conquests. Their inability to feel any love, empathy or compassion, not to mention guilt or remorse, leaves with with little or no emotional bond to their current long-term partner \u2013 if they have any. MachiavellianPathological narcissists are Machiavellian to the core, regardless of how effective their \u201cfalse self\u201d is in persuading others to the contrary. They will manipulate facts, people and ideas to meet their objectives without a care in the world for any adverse impact that this might result in. Indeed, they harbour intense jealousy towards anyone who enjoys normality, joy or abundance (because they will never have these attributes), and derive sadistic enjoyment in causing other people pain. ChaosA narcissist is desperate to be significant, important and influential. In business and in their private lives, their ways result in chaos in the present and a trail of destruction in their wake stretching throughout their past. They are unable to hold themselves accountable however, dodging any kind of responsibility or blame. They will never apologise for the pain and anguish they cause but instead deflect it with a range of techniques. Psychometric Testing It is ridiculous that most people applying for any kind of job need to submit to psychometric tests, and yet the most powerful people in the country and not subjected to personality profiling before they are able to run for office. Sadly pathological narcissism is so endemic in politics throughout the world that we are rapidly moving into the point of no-return. It is easy to see how the vast majority of countries and federations have political systems that are so broken and corrupt that they are not fit for purpose. It is why humanity now faces so many existential threats, and with such political willpower to resolve the problems. Exceptions to the Rules Once in a while it is possible to encounter politicians who break the rules and exhibit normal range emotions. These are the ones driven by the greater good, and end up proposing sensible policies \u2013 some of which can appear radical. Jacinda Arden of New Zealand is one such example. Back to Donald Trump Is he a pathological narcissist? Over you to decide. But the next time you vote, please just consider whether you are contributing to the problem by putting such self-serving, back-scratching, toxic characters as pathological narcissists into power. The Direction of the World I\u2019m passionate about the direction the world is going in, and fear people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are leading us over the edge of a precipice. I write exclusively about NPD \u2013 please help me raise awareness and understanding about it by follow me here for a start. ",

            "answer_text": "Tens of thousands of psychologists and psychiatrists now say that Donald Trump himself has made it possible for them to determine his personality. His constant, often obsessive, daily tweeting give them the means by which they can see the consistency and extent of his narcissistic behaviors. Trump\u2019s most lavish praise has always been for himself. He has sycophants who survive until the first disagreement and then they are booted out the door. His administration is rife with dissension and has the highest rate of turnover of any presidency. He cannot hold his own ship afloat. Others have to do it for him. He has no constancy of political opinion. Whatever works in his mind to allow him to \u201cwin\u201d is what he espouses. Pro-this one day, anti-this the next. He is known to lack the ability to prepare for and be fully vetted on key points and doesn\u2019t read daily briefings because he knows better than anyone about all issues. He also makes up his own foreign policy on the fly and former allies, like Germany, have now decided that with Trump as President the US is no longer to be trusted. His lack of empathy toward anyone he perceives to be \u201clesser\u201d\u2014and that pretty much includes everyone other than his small inner family circle\u2014is well known. If you are not high status or helpful to him personally\u2014in fortune, constituency, ability to work the system, etc.\u2014your views and needs are entirely dismissible. His supporters have not yet had the pleasure of learning just how unstable their \u201cstable genius\u201d is. They may have an opportunity to learn that all too soon. There is already speculation that a loss in November will be too big a narcissistic injury for Trump to endure so that he cannot allow it to happen. If it appears he could lose, Trump will attempt to delay the election, claim it to be fraudulent, refuse to relinquish office, literally anything to continue as the \u201cwinner.\u201d A narcissist will also never accept being found at fault or to blame. If there is a loss, Trump will loudly proclaim that it was everybody else\u2019s fault but his own. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there is a measure of narcissism in every politician, including those who aren\u2019t politicians like Trump. But the disorder requires a measure of functional impairment, and that can either be social, or in relationships, or in employment. Trump\u2019s personal life appears pretty sound. People who know him say he\u2019s charming. His former wife says he\u2019s a wonderful guy. He has a great family, who appear to find him agreeable. It is hard to find people who say he has an explosive temperament, which in every NPD I\u2019ve ever treated, is a common feature. Arguably, he\u2019s been able to build a business and be successfully employed for decades, so it\u2019s probably not a disorder, unless you are a dishonest observer. No functional impairment, or at least not to the level of treatment. Now, I don\u2019t doubt he has narcissism, probably more than the average person. But that\u2019s not a disability, and in politics, it\u2019s a career requirement. If you want to start diagnosing people from a distance, let\u2019s look at Hillary Clinton. The Paranoid Personality Disorder lists these traits: Doubt the commitment, loyalty, or trustworthiness of others, believing others are using or deceiving themAre reluctant to confide in others or reveal personal information due to a fear that the information will be used against themAre unforgiving and hold grudgesAre hypersensitive and take criticism poorlyRead hidden meanings in the innocent remarks or casual looks of othersPerceive attacks on their character that are not apparent to others; they generally react with anger and are quick to retaliateHave recurrent suspicions, without reason, that their spouses or lovers are being unfaithfulAre generally cold and distant in their relationships with others, and might become controlling and jealousCannot see their role in problems or conflicts and believe they are always rightHave difficulty relaxingAre hostile, stubborn, and argumentativeI wonder if she\u2019s just as likely to be affected by paranoia as Trump is by narcissism. But again, although I\u2019m a retired professional, I\u2019m doing this at a distance with only public information at hand, and I am aware it\u2019s pretty subjective. ",

            "answer_text": "trump has thrust the United States nearer to succumbing to be what is known as a \"mafia state\" to portray the sort of despotisms America and the world are witnessing leaping from the previous Soviet Union. The president\u2019s close to home interests and the interests of the country have become isolated. trump has been open about his deference for Putin, the leader of a ground-breaking mafia state and indeed, regularly acts like a mafia don. But, under all the highfalutin bullshit and his inflated feeling of self-significance, there is a profound necessity for inordinate adulation and deference. With a slew of disconsolate relationships behind him and an absence of sympathy for other people, his veil rarely slips. Yet, when it does, exposed is brittle self-esteem that is powerless against the slightest analysis. For the most part, trump is despondent and bewildered when he's not given the exceptional favours or reverence he believes he deserves. He regularly discovers his relationships are unfulfilling, and others don't particularly enjoy being around him. trump becomes anxious or irate when he doesn\u2019t receive unique treatment. He has significant interpersonal issues and effectively feels insulted if questioned. He responds with blistering fury or hatred and attempts to deprecate other individuals in order he appears unrivalled. Yet, the underlying factor is that he often feels insecure, often shameful, vulnerable and humiliated. He is fundamentally out for himself and will indecently request inconvenient favours as we've now become aware. He is known to have taken out several loans that he will never reimburse, and has burned through a multitude of long stretches of government time, grumbling or playing golf. He's a well off show off who is liberal with his \"toys\" as long as he gets to call the shots. Narcissists like trump are emotionally isolated and profoundly doubtful of others. Perceived dangers can trigger fierce rage while accomplishments can bolster sentiments of grandiosity. Although reliant on his devotees, he burns with a raging desire to be adulated and orders they feed his confirmation and idolisation. Nevertheless, when individuals react positively to trump, there are still threats. That is on the grounds that charm is a double-edged sword. It encourages both closeness and detachment. And as he appears progressively confident, trump turns out to be increasingly unconstrained. He feels free of restraints. Ideas stream. He believes he's invincible. This vitality and conviction further rouse his die-hard supporters. But the very hero-worship trump expects can have an erosive impact. He listens even less to expressions of caution and guidance. All things considered, he believes he is right even when others have their doubts. Instead of attempting to convince those who contradict him, he feels justified in overlooking them, thus creating further detachment. The outcome is glaring risk-taking that can prompt a crisis. In the political domain, there is no more a clearer case of this than trump. Regardless of any warm sentiments his charm may summon, he is typically not happy with his own emotions. He\u2019ll listen only for the sort of information he is looking for and bruises easily when he is denied. He cannot tolerate criticism. Truth be told, he is abrasive with those who doubt him and even more violent with subordinates who have spine enough to confront him. He requires a gathering of yes-men and as the more independent players leave or are sacked, government progression turns into a specific, troubling issue. trump knows who he can use and is ruthlessly exploitative. For that reason, despite the fact that he believes without a doubt he has \"star quality,\" he remains unlikable. Historically, narcissists in leadership have been confined to sales positions, where they use their persuasiveness and imagination to best effect. Nevertheless, a narcissistic leader, even the most profitable of them can self-destruct and lead their associations and the nation hideously off track. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: only a professional is qualified to diagnose Trump; only an official diagnosis can give a definitive answer to this question. Trump\u2019s behaviour during the campaign and since the election gives us enough circumstantial evidence to suggest he might be. 1. Has a grandiose sense self-importance. 2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. 3. Believes that he or she is \"special\" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions). 4. Requires excessive admiration [regularly fishes for compliments, and is highly susceptible to flattery]. 5. Has a sense of entitlement. 6. Is interpersonally exploitative. 7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling [or, I would add, unable] to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others. 8. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her. 9. Shows arrogant, haughty [rude and abusive] behaviors or attitudes. 6 Signs of Narcissism You May Not Know About How well does this list apply to Donald Trump? He certainly has a grandiose sense of self.He has made his fantasies of power and unlimited success real.He campaigned on the basis that he was special.He is excessively vain and defensive. He has demanded that the media not print unflattering pictures of him.He does not feel like obeying the same laws as apply to others.He has cheated his subcontractors and refused to pay taxes.His campaign showed he lacks empathy for others.He is clearly envious. He said that he would only accept the election results if he won; and now that he has won, he is behaving as though an election recount were a formal impeachment. He has argued that the liberal media were out to get him.Haughty, rude, and abusive? Search for Trump\u2019s campaign. You will find more examples than you could shake the proverbial stick at.I cannot tell you whether Trump has narcissistic personality disorder. I can tell you that he behaves as if he does. ",

            "answer_text": "In order for a person to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) they must meet five or more of the following symptoms: Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal loveBelieves that he or she is \u201cspecial\u201d and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)Requires excessive admirationHas a very strong sense of entitlement, e.g., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectationsIs exploitative of others, e.g., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own endsLacks empathy, e.g., is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of othersIs often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or herRegularly shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudesDonald Trump certainly appears to fit most if not all of the above criteria. Although given his position as president of the United States then some of those characteristics are valid. He will have a sense of self importance but that is understandable considering his current role. He is a very successful person as well and has accumulated huge wealth so it\u2019s not fantasy for him. However these traits aren\u2019t necessary for his position and aren\u2019t just related to this. I have a feeling he would still have a huge sense of entitlement even if he had limited or no success. The rest of the traits are unrelated to his position and in fact will and do have a negative impact on how he handles his current role. It\u2019s not a very good thing to be in charge of a country and lack empathy or to behave arrogantly towards others. Jealousy and envy of others will also have a detrimental impact on his leadership and will result in bad judgements and decision making. Also worth noting he will have shown these traits long before he was elected president but we can now see them more as he is more visible to us. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, this answer is going to be devoid of pop pseudo-psychology so it\u2019s probably not going to be very popular. But there is very little chance that Donald Trump has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. NPD, contrary to folk belief, does not simply mean someone has a big ego, or is vain, or places an unhealthy importance on superficial traits like physical appearance and intelligence; someone can be vain, big-headed, and obsessed with looks or intelligence and not have NPD. NPD is a disorder, and that means someone with NPD is not only vain and preoccupied with looks and/or intelligence, grandiose in his or her expectation of treatment by others, and wildly delusional in many cases, but that these preoccupations and delusions impair the person\u2019s ability to function normally around other people in society. It\u2019s a very serious illness that gets trivialized whenever someone makes an NPD armchair diagnosis, which is exactly what\u2019s going on here with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a shallow liar, a 12 year old child trapped in a 70 year old man\u2019s body, and an enormous embarrassment as president of our country. But he does not have NPD. Miraculously and unfortunately, this individual can function just fine, almost too well in some cases. Also, I would suggest you read about the Goldwater Rule before asking questions like this, Goldwater rule - Wikipedia Professional psychiatrists aren\u2019t going to weigh in here. ",

Watch to see what happens. Original answer unchanged: The most useful answer seems to be, \u201cYes, and so what?\u201d Was Barack Obama a narcissist? A thumbnail sketch might portray the US has having exchanged a passive-aggressive narcissist, Obama, for an active-aggressive narcissist, Trump. Narcissism is typical among psychological terms for its vague criteria and its undefinable boundaries. Allen Francis is the psychiatrist who led the team for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV. As editor of DSM 4 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for psychology), he wrote the definition of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Francis overtly hates Trump. However, he points out that (in his negative opinion) it doesn\u2019t fit Trump because he lacks two of the five criteria. He even wrote a letter to the New York Times excoriating those who seek to gin up some psychological disqualifier to pull the rug out from under the Trump presidency by some extraordinary use of psychological jargon. The first link below is to a doc-to-doc analysis including great world leaders who did clearly suffer from psychiatric illnesses\u2014Lincoln and Churchill. Francis seems to be trying intently to get the body politic and the media off their crusade to turn psychology into a martial art and then use it to flip Donald Trump on his butt and break his neck in the process.

I would also argue that Washington was a narcissist, based on his actions during the French-Indian War, but eventually gained a more sober, grounded opinion of himself by the time he reached the Presidency, as is evident in his attempts to refuse the position. Simply put: you do not say \u201cHey, I can convince a majority of voters that I am the best person to be running the Country, and I feel I can do a great job at it!\u201d and not be, at least a bit, \u201cnarcissistic\u201d.

            "answer_text": "He is a classic example of a narcissist. People like this have several things in common: They do not accept blame for wrongdoing. They will always blame their mistakes on others. You\u2019ve seen Donnie the Connie do this time and time again.They think they are holier than God and believe they are the most intelligent people on earth. A narcissist will not interact with anybody who they believe is less intelligent than themselves, and in this case, that\u2019s everyone but them. Hence narcissists typically have no friends.They absolutely have to be the center of attention. People who are narcisstic will do anything they possibly can to make sure they are front and center on anything. You\u2019ve seen that occur with Trump (remember when he shoved a prime minister\u2019s partner in order to be in the exact center of the photo with world leaders at the NATO conference?)Narcissists often appear charming and lovable. Trump showed this during the campaign. Of course, his actions since becoming President (illegally, i might add) have proved he is anything but.They hold grudges. Do I need to list the people Trump has criticized and mocked since he entered the race, and after becoming president? Narcissists also have zero tolerance for being criticized themselves. You\u2019ve seen how he has acted any time someone has said something bad about him (and all those comments are well-deserved.That\u2019s just a short list.

            "answer_text": "Ripping small children away from their parents is one of the most egregiously evil acts I can ever recall a US President making. He has shown many, many instances of being completely devoid of empathy besides this, too. He\u2019s stiffed companies who\u2019ve built his buildings for millions of dollars and he\u2019s a relentless serial sexual assailant and abuser of women who actually has bragged about it publicly. My guess would be that he\u2019s WAY up on the anti-social scale\u2014possibly an out and out sociopath with many prominent and overtly narcissistic traits. Even my outrageously sexually predatory ex-husband was more covert than Trump is. But then, he\u2019s highly intelligent and smart enough to know he\u2019ll get more \u201cwins\u201d if he hides his predation. Trump, on the other hand, brags incessantly and glorifies his own lack of interest in literature. He barely reads and his vocabulary and sentence structure is on a 4th grade level. What\u2019s terrifying to me is that roughly half of all Americans think he\u2019s great. That\u2019s so appalling that it literally scares me half to death. So I\u2019ll be at a demonstration later this AM and I encourage anyone else who\u2019s neurotypical and possesses a conscience to make the effort and show up to be counted. I agree with Christina Hepp below: he is a cancer and it\u2019s spreading from the US to the rest of the world. But one thing at a time\u2014let\u2019s get those little kids in metal cages back to their frantic, grieving parents and show the Sociopath In Chief that he cannot get away with outrageously cruel tactics like this one.

You could literally observe a suicidal, hallucinating person that makes disoriented moves and has crazy temper tantrums, but yet you still cannot diagnose from afar. Politics-wise, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s Hitler, Stalin, Gaddafi, Trump or whatnot. You cannot diagnose from afar. Diagnoses must be made by a trained clinical psychologist, in accordance to the guidelines from the DSM-V, ICD-10 or some other respectable manual of diagnosis. In all cases, it requires the psychologist to be directly interacting with and observing the patient. You cannot diagnose from afar. The American Psychiatric Association has a rule called the \u201cGoldwater rule\u201d, and it basically states that psychologists should only comment on what is supported by formal diagnostic examinations with regards to public figures. Once again, you cannot diagnose from afar. On a side-note, it is fine for psychological professionals to voice concerns over a public figure\u2019s mental health and to recommend consultation. However, it stops there. If the individual rejects treatment, that\u2019s that. You cannot diagnose from afar. I understand that this seems to be quite redundant on a single point, but really, this is an important issue. Too often, people will throw around mental illness as an instrument of insult or derogation, and frankly it\u2019s rather unethical. It adds to the already tremendous stigma surrounding mental illness, and that can have greatly negative consequences. It\u2019s an illness like all other illnesses, and must only be diagnosed by a professional in person. You cannot diagnose from afar. This really strikes a nerve in me, not only in politics but even in the interactions of daily life. Too often we\u2019ll hear people informally diagnosing people, especially with illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder or anorexia. It is well documented that the mere mention of a disorder can already lead to what\u2019s called a \u201cfactitious psychological disorder\u201d, where the subject unknowingly (or intentionally) creates psychological or physical symptoms for themselves, leading to great emotional strain. Imagine what a fake or incomplete diagnosis can do. Do not diagnose from afar. Most importantly, diagnoses are always made with treatment in mind; diagnoses inform the course of treatment, with the ultimate aim of helping the individual. If one does not have bona fide intentions for the wellbeing of the individual in question (which I am almost certain is the case with diagnosing Donald Trump), one should not be diagnosing anyone, especially not from afar. There are great implications for all diagnoses made in clinical psychology; let\u2019s make them good implications, and not negative ones. We can start by taking mental illness seriously, and treating diagnoses as formal tools for the benefit of the individuals, so that they may get the help they need. Oh, and remember, you cannot diagnose from afar. ",

            "answer_text": "I only have two things to offer for consideration: 1: An egomaniac doesn\u2019t do things like this, in an effort to humbly stand with a fellow colleague:  2. Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams answer to this question is spot-on: Scott Adams' Blog How to Spot a Narcissist Donald Trump is the most famous narcissist in the world. That fact probably seems obvious to you, given Trump\u2019s continuous self-promotion. Mental health experts agree with your assessment. Trump hits most of the checkboxes for the diagnosis. The biggest tell for narcissism is a belief that you are better than other people. For example, if Trump believed he could run for President \u2013 with almost no political experience \u2013 and dominate the Republican party in only a few short months, that would be an example of\u2026 Okay, wait. That one doesn\u2019t work. Apparently his self-image was spot-on in that one specific case. It was the rest of us who got that one wrong. But still, Trump obviously has an inflated self-image. For example, there was the time he thought he could transition from being a real estate developer to being a best-selling author of a book about negotiating, but then\u2026shit. Okay, that example doesn\u2019t work. Okay, how about this example: Remember when Trump thought he could transition from developing real estate and being a best selling author to becoming a reality TV star and then\u2026okay, forget that one. That sort of worked out for Trump. Um\u2026okay, I have one. Remember all of the Trump real estate and casino businesses that failed? I think there were a handful of big failures. That\u2019s a terrible track record when you consider Trump\u2019s hundreds of successful projects that\u2026shit. Okay, that example doesn\u2019t work when you put it in context. But the ego on that guy. For example, Trump thinks models are attracted to him. Models! Ha ha! And they are, but my point is that I forget what my point is. Something about his ego? Yes, that\u2019s it. Anyway, Trump thinks he is smarter than most people just because he has a high IQ and went to great schools. Usually that does mean you are smarter than 98% of the public, but in this case it was probably just luck, because obviously all of us are smarter than Trump. I mean, look at his haircut! Narcissists also seek attention from others. That is Trump all over! Compare his attention-seeking ways to other people who license their brands for a living. Those other people like to stay quiet or maybe say their brand is not so good. That is what good mental health looks like. But narcissist Trump actually promotes his brand every chance he gets, which is gross. Sure, it makes him a lot of money, but capitalism is about more than that. For example, something about the Fed. Anyway, unlike Trump, the other candidates for President of the United States do not seek attention. Okay, technically they are seeking it as hard as they can, and failing. But to me, that seems exactly the same as not trying. Narcissism is more than having an over-inflated ego and a need for attention. Narcissists also lack empathy. That\u2019s Trump all over. He has no empathy whatsoever. Sure, he says he loves wounded veterans, underemployed Americans, and even the undereducated. But you know all of that is lies. How do you know? Simple! You know because you are far smarter than normal people. You might be an unrecognized genius, given your modesty. Maybe you\u2019re not the test-taking kind of genius, but you are definitely a beacon of common sense. For example, you know for sure which candidate would be the best president while idiots like me can only guess. In fact, you are so smart that you can peer into Trump\u2019s soul from a distance and see his lack of empathy. Impressive! And, I might add that you are an ace at diagnosing mental conditions despite your total lack of training in the field. You, my friend, are indeed better than other people because you see Trump for the over-inflated, uncaring buffoon that he is. And unlike Trump, you do not seek attention. So don\u2019t leave a comment below to showcase your brilliance. Narcissism is definitely a thing. But we also need a name for the mental condition in which you believe you are so smart you can diagnose narcissism from a distance. I won\u2019t call you a narcissist unless you state your opinion in a public comment forum and insult other voters and commenters as if you have no empathy. So don\u2019t do that. Beyond that, I don\u2019t know. Try asking him. Testing shows that one way of identifying narcissists is to simply ask them, and that they\u2019ll answer truthfuly. ",

To have the power and be admired (which presidency is the most extreme way to do so)he gaslightsHe has grandiose fantasieshe boasts of his achievementshe lacks empathyshows disregard for others feelings (making Hispanic children have poor quality lives, his public insults and worse examples)he exploits others and cheats to gain for himselfhe\u2019s about status.Of course there can be another cause\u2026 No one can definitively say. For all we know, this can be some tactic he used to scare others off, and this all can be an act and he\u2019s not even like this at all\u2026 But I would say it is more likely (not saying it\u2019s definite he has it) than other famous figures who have been labeled. I would also be inclined to say histrionic personality disorder may be likely comorbid, or it can be what he has.. No one, not even a professional can say with 100% certainty without having met him, I again, will remind you. ",

I lean over as we\u2019re talking and I realise everything he\u2019s looking at is an article about himself. In fact at several points in the conversation Donald got so excited about what he was reading about himself that he would pick up the magazine and hold it up to me and say, \u2018Look Randal, do you see that The Apprentice was number one in the ratings last week, isn\u2019t that great?\u2019 Now, why on earth would Randal need to lean over and wonder what Donald was reading, if , even at several point in the conversation, Donald would show him himself ? So i think, the story is manufactured. Now, you will not hear me say Trump\u2019s not a narcissist. According to popular definition everybody is a narcissists in the US anyway. But i will say out loud that journalists - who are not psychiatrists by far - should shut up about peoples personality issues, because they have no clue what they are talking about. And even psychiatrists, who have never talked to the man in person, let alone seen him as a patient have no right (not even speaking about professional morals here) to diagnose anyone. Do i like Trumps ideas ? Not at all. I think him becoming president of the USA will be a very sad thing to happen for the world. (not even that bad for the USA, they will have chosen the man after all. More for the world) But please refrain from calling people things if you do not know what you are talking about. ",

There\u2019s no need to revisit his deplorable traits/behaviors and the many criteria that fit him like a glove. But those facts alone don\u2019t mean he has narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). I\u2019ll explain. One of the indispensable elements of an NPD diagnosis is having the traits/behaviors cause great distress for the subject. In Trump\u2019s case, his many appalling traits/behaviors have not interfered with achieving the life he wants. He\u2019s wealthy, has somewhat functional family/business/social relationships, and a substantial career which happens to include holding the most powerful office on earth. In many respects, his narcissism has contributed to achieving his successes. He\u2019s often his own worst enemy, his traits/behaviors make many others miserable, he leaves a wake of destruction and despair wherever he goes, and he may get us all blown up. And again, he\u2019s a world-class narcissist. His life isn\u2019t working for anyone else. But because it\u2019s working for him, he doesn\u2019t technically have NPD. ",

Rather, they should restrict themselves to saying things like \u201cDonald Trump is a raging narcissist\u201d or, maybe, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that Donald Trump was diagnosed with NPD,\u201d or \u201cI have a hunch that Donald Trump suffers from NPD.\u201d The language of psychiatry has a specific clinal function, to be sure, and this should not be abused. But it is also a set of tools that can be used \u2014 and admittedly, abused \u2014 in making sense of the sphere of human interactions. This is often necessary, moreover, to defend oneself against certain malignant personality types. In politics, where it is a question of entrusting power to private individuals and elevating them to a special status that is almost if not altogether above the law, the common interest rests in exposing public figures to the greatest scrutiny, even if this might otherwise seem unfair. Indeed, very idea of psychological classification, one could argues, originates with Plato\u2019s Republic, and has everything to do with politics. The psychiatric-clinical discourse, in contrast, is relatively new. And while it has its place in the world, it doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on the profiling of personality and character. ",

He openly uses a language for political adversaries others only use behind closed doors and always in response to attacks and criticism of himself. He is a boss with balls and unafraid to weld any power or influence he has once he takes on a challenge and he is fanatical about NOT losing. The real question is, is he competent to do what he promised during his campaign. He will need more than four years and that is why adversaries are beside themselves to make sure he is not re-elected. They can and will roll back everything he has done in one term if a democrat is elected regardless of any platform that particular Democratic runs on. If you support the Constitution and American interests Trump may be the last line of defense from thus politicized European secular humanitarianism that has usurped a major political party and welcomes any support no matter that support be domestic enemies both political and ideological that do not share our values or respect our laws.

An image of being dumb would never be accepted by a narcissist.  Also NPD shouldn't be taken lightly. It comes in a package. If one or two symptoms match with an individual's behavior it cant be classified as NPD. It may come under Melanie Klein's theory of hatred or envy. Also putting Trump under one disorder would be an injustice to the other sub branches. One should also not forget that our mind too plays tricks. Any absurd things said by politicians/ celebrities is something which lasts longer in our memories. We exactly give them what they want. Trump just needs attention and we all have eyes on him. ",

Needless to say, I have had way too much person experience with their characteristics and abuse. In my (extremely strong) opinion, of course he has narcissistic personality disorder. It is obvious in every tweet, every speech, his body stance and facial expressions, his incessant refusal to take responsibility and to blame other people, his boasting and posturing, his constant lying, and his destroying our society just because he wants to show how powerful he is. America is the victim to his narcissism and is in the devalue, demean and destroy phase. Dangerously, the more we criticize him, the more threatened and vengeful he becomes, and the more he will lash out and be even more destructive. He has powerfully reactivated the C-PTSD acquired from my previous abuse by narcissists. I was on the verge of freeing myself. He won\u2019t be satisfied until our country is a third world dictatorship with people begging and dying in the streets. He is incurable. He is evil. And I am afraid. ",

When Trump repeats something, it is because it is important to him and he wants people to understand. Keep in mind, all Presidents are narcissists. Who but a narcissist would declare that they are capable of running a large country like the US? A humble person or a person with self doubts would never throw their hat in the ring hoping to become President. Obama had strong narcissistic qualities as does Trump. Obama really didn\u2019t have many past experiences to brag about since he really never worked at a job, was a community organizer and a Senator who voted \u201cPresent\u201d most of the time, but still he was narcissistic enough to declare a run for the Presidency. He still brags about what he did as President. He and Trump, as do most Presidents, both have the same narcissistic traits. ",

But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism. A narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life, such as relationships, work, school or financial affairs. People with narcissistic personality disorder may be generally unhappy and disappointed when they're not given the special favors or admiration they believe they deserve. They may find their relationships unfulfilling, and others may not enjoy being around them. Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy (psychotherapy). Symptoms Signs and symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and the severity of symptoms vary. People with the disorder can: Have an exaggerated sense of self-importanceHave a sense of entitlement and require constant, excessive admirationExpect to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant itExaggerate achievements and talentsBe preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mateBelieve they are superior and can only associate with equally special peopleMonopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferiorExpect special favors and unquestioning compliance with their expectationsTake advantage of others to get what they wantHave an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of othersBe envious of others and believe others envy themBehave in an arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentiousInsist on having the best of everything \u2014 for instance, the best car or officeAt the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they perceive as criticism, and they can: Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special treatmentHave significant interpersonal problems and easily feel slightedReact with rage or contempt and try to belittle the other person to make themselves appear superiorHave difficulty regulating emotions and behaviorExperience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to changeFeel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfectionHave secret feelings of insecurity, shame, vulnerability and humiliation",

Narcissism is better seen in Bill Clinton, who used 20yr old interns to pleasure him in the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton, who thought the presidency was owed to her, Obama- who got a Nobel Peace Prize just for being elected, and accepted it, and loved pictures of himself with a halo around his head, as well as Biden, who thought the world owed him and his family a huge living, loves to plagiarize other peoples\u2019 words, falsely magnifies his academic achievements, loves to talk about his leg hair, and can mystically tell who is black. President Trump has actually done things- like got elected, fixing the economy, tamed the coronavirus, changed the trade deals, got NATO to pay up, is building the Wall, got a boatload of judges confirmed, rebuilt the military, attained energy independence, defeated fake probes and an attempt at a silly impeachment, all against the headwinds of a hostile media and the active sabotage of the political establishment.

I don\u2019t remember ANY U.S. President that had a temper tantrums, regardless of how bad they were in other ways. His self promoting speech at the U.N., making claims as to the support he has in the U.S. His claim taht he would be able to tell if Kim was a liar within a few minutes of talking to him, just by looking on Kim\u2019s face. Really, he could read minds? I saw every Republican debate. He lost control in most of them. To be fair, the news people were equally out of control. When they questioned him, it was like narcissist versus narcissist. His unedited Tweets. His refusal to listen to daily Intelligence reports. His daily reading of tabloids. His ad hominem arguments. His refusal to place his businesses in a \u2018blind trust\u2019. His continuance of real estate dealings even while he is president. His initial insistence that Mexico pay for the Wall. ",

Is he charismatic and likable at first? Does he have to  be in charge? Is the conversation always about him? Is he a name dropper? Is he the victim blaming others for his failures? does he get off on glitz and bling? Can he handle criticism? Will he make an excuse for every mistake? Has he left a pile of misery behind when he exits a business? Does  he think he is a narcissist? I\u2019m not making any of this up folks.  This is your candidate for the highest office in the land.  Will he really think about the little guy or will he increase his wealth at the expense of the little guy?  If you want to know what the future will be, look at his past. ",

Depending on who is conducting an assessment of Trump\u2019s behavioral traits, this President presents as a sociopathic-malignant narcissist associated with an authoritarian personality. While the Psychiatric DSM chart might include such personality disorders as NPD, BPD, or ASPD, it remains the case that Donald Trump represents a clear and present danger to the well being of our society as well as our democratic way of life. Pathologically devoid of empathy to the level of sociopathy, Trump has already been responsible for an untold number of deaths related to his inability to adequately address our national health crisis on an emotional level. In appalling fashion, our President is willing to sacrifice lives in an effort to serve his own personal interests, which are focused on getting re-elected. ",

He just lost half his protection in congress, he may not say it, but he shows it, he is worried, stressed out. What did he really gain, three senators? Wow, he lost the house. He may not be get impeached and convicted but he can be exposed as a fraud and conman, shown to his own supporters that he is a leper messiah. Embarrass a bully infront of everybody and they disappear. Maybe we'll get lucky and he will resign. Crap that leaves Pence. There are reports Mueller is about to drop something big. He just hired a new temp. AG, but may have been illegally done. And if he fires Mueller the house will just call him and his people into testify after January, so whats the point. Times are about to become real hard for him, I just hope that he don't try dragging us down with him, you know, since he never makes mistakes it's always someone elses fault. Oh is he a narcissist?

The thing is: some of his issues are pretty obvious and out there. However, in general, high office seems to attract some pretty negative personal characteristics. For example about half of all presidents have had significant substance issues(likely alcohol use disorders). I think Trump displays traits associated with Narcissism. However, I feel we have had a lot of other presidents than have been concealed narcissists. I wish that examination by a clearly non-partisan team of mental health professionals was part the process of vetting POTUS candidates.

This man too, loved to flaunt his wealth by building grandiose structures. And this man too had a private aircraft.

Many people have narcissistic tendencies, it\u2019s doesnt make them a narcissist. I know he is many things. I think many will say he is a narcissist. To me a narcissist is someone who seems very nice and charming, but he is two persons in one. Someone who is a totally different person in reality, then who he seems to be to everyone who meets him. And as far as I know, the majority of people have bad things to say about him, his honesty, his person. How is this a hidden two faced personality then? But then there is also the narcissist who is more in your face about it. Maybe he is supposed to be this kind of narcissist? I don\u2019t know. but he for sure is nothing like my covert narcissist ex. Who no one has anything bad to say about, except if you find out what he does behind closed doors with the curtains shut, and when finding out all the other secret things. Then he changes his whole person, and he will turn into someone you didn\u2019t know existed. A monster appearing from the darkest place there is. While as long as you have no clue, he will feel to come from a pure and wonderful place. ",

Meanwhile, Evangelicals have changed their stance on lies, adultery, gluttony, etc. just for him. They\u2019ve caused millennials to leave the church in droves due to blatant hypocrisy. He has left hundreds of ppl unpaid after they completed work for him and his companies. He\u2019s taken advantage of every loophole he claims to be against. He also mocked a differently-abled reporter, bragged about sexual assault, lies consistently, called Mexicans and Blacks everything but children of God. To answer your question, I don\u2019t know why Donald is so narcissistic, but all of the above probably contributed to it. ",

You may want to read the book, \u201cThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump\u201d by Bandy Lee, M.D. 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts assess him. Everything he does is most importantly for him to look special and get constant attention. If anyone else benefits it is secondary. Repeating himself is not indicative of narcissism however, more a possible early symptom of dementia, but I am not a professional in the field. Check out the book. I found it fascinating. ",

He is a severe, malignant, pathological narcissist. You don\u2019t need to have a medical degree to see this. It directly affects his behavior, and often his political decisions directly. It is one of the most concerning parts of him being president. I\u2019ll even go further, and say that it presents a danger to the country in a number of ways. Don\u2019t confuse malignant narcissism with confidence, or arrogance, and certainly not strength, even though he is incredibly arrogant. This is something much deeper, and much more problematic. He is an extreme example of why temperament really does matter in a president. ",

So, whether it is instinct or skill, you can\u2019t deny that Trump has well-honed interpersonal skills - no one could possibly become President without them. Given that, his public appearance must be an act to some degree. ",

Donald Trump believes he is infallible, and that he is the greatest at everything, including stuff he has never done (preventing a mass shooting) or been (a 5-star General). 2. According to the Multiverse theory, there is a universe out there in which a Donald Trump is indeed the greatest at anything anyone has ever attempted to do. 3.

He is also charming in person and succeeded, during his campaign, in getting the news media to give him more coverage than the other Republican candidates, often on his terms. These behaviors can be observed by anyone, no professional training needed, and debated in political forums. They make sense in plain English, no need for fancy words like \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Whatever his faults, he is a real person, not a page in a psychiatric textbook. ",

If you really want to know if Trump is normal or NPD it would be more useful to compare him to his peers or people who have found themselves in similar positions of high status. If you compare Trump to rulers like Hitler, Moussalini, Churchill, Clinton, Napoleon, Stalin, Caesar, etc.. Does he really standout as exceptionally narcissistic among people of his profession? Hes actually tame and humble in comparisson. But comparing the President to average Joe Sixpack is imbecile. ",

However, I have some reservations with Trump as he seems a little too thick skinned. We can harder perceive what it would be like emotionally to take the kind of vitriolic attacks he does on a daily basis. A full blown narcissist would probably not be able to handle this kind of image reflection. A narcissist is more focused on image than substance. Trump is substantial. I think what drives him more than narcissism is accomplishment, getting what he pursues and winning! So, I will pause here to review a thum-nail definition of a narcissist and an antisocial. Narcissists relate with people primarily as \u201cmirrors\u201d. Antisocials relate with people primarily as \u201dtools\u201d. Therefore I believe Trump has more antisocial qualities than narcissistic. I think what drives him is obtaining what he pursues and desires. He uses people to this end. The fringe benefit from this also satisfies any narcissism present. Accomplishing, obtaining and winning makes Trump look good to Trump and makes him feel powerful. Therefore Trump is more antisocial with megalomania tendencies\u2026 and sure throw in some narcissism. ",

            "answer_text": "Best answer without saying the clinical N word is this article SNL portrays Trump as a buffoon. Is there any reason to believe he has average or above average intelligence? . Some people misinterpreted his authoritarian attitude ( to put it mildly) as strength. They liked his direct, say what you think rhetoric , put downs His dismissials of anyone's freedom of speech. A grandiose manner mistaken for being a strong businessman. He made the most of people's dislikes and fears and knew how to manipulate that attitude in these political circumstances and climate. This question deserves a far more in depth answer but this piece written above for me gives the answer which is in alignment with my thought processes. Its a most definitely yes from me. Going back and editing this I realise I meant to include also this answer:- Yona J. Hilderband's answer to SNL portrays Trump as a buffoon. Is there any reason to believe he has average or above average intelligence? ",

Additionally, he seems to have no regard for the violence and division his lies have created in the country he claims to love. ",

I\u2019ll applaud when he does good and criticize him when he does bad. Enough said. You know that politics has entered the twilight zone when I can even bring myself to vote for the Libertarian candidate. Thanks for the question and I hope you like the non-answer, answer. ",

I might be ranking in the Narcissism category, but that\u2019s because I was a victim and I\u2019ve spent the better part of four years now learning everything I can on the topic and passing it on.

The fact that you yourself found and included information regarding how he is a Narcissist means you answered your own question. You really think I\u2019m a narcissist? ",
