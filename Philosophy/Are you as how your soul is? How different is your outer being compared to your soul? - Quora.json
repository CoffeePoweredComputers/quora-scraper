            "answer_text": "I think all my life I would never know how to perfectly describe how my soul is. On the inside, I am an adventurous young lady, I am pretty wise compared to my friends. I think about how the universe works sometimes and I have a bunch of weird questions/things in my mind that I wish I had somebody to tell without them thinking I\u2019m crazy. On the outside, my freedom is limited. I wanted to travel and try new things but due to financial problems and strict parents I can barely step out of my city. Sometimes my friends would say something to me that makes the situation really awkward and I would reply them things that are not me. I don\u2019t want to change how I present myself just to please them. I wanna be able to tell them that they are wrong and they should do the right thing even though it is not about me (ex: racism, body shaming, making fun of others, etc\u2026). I am nowhere near who I actually am on the inside but I\u2019m trying. I just need lots of courage. ",

            "answer_text": "The word soul is a roman word. The greek translation of the word soul is psyche. Psyche is a greek goddess, her husband is Eros. Eros translates into the roman word Cupid. Cupid and Soul or Eros and Psyche. Psyche was a human girl. Earthlings called her Venus because she was pretty, they worshiped her. Venus got mad and sent cupid to get her. Cupid fell in love with her and married her. Venus got mad at both of them and said they couldnt be together unless Psyche became a goddess too. The only way to become devine is to go to hell and back. She did. And then soul became real. There is only one soul it is her. She loves him. Even enough to go to hell for him. He loves her enough to quit life in heaven to be with her. When she went to hell he went with her. Read the myth of Eros and Psyche. Its my favorite story. We have no soul on our own it is something bigger than we are. The soul chases love and love chases the soul. Love and Soul are alive and have a mind of their own. People had this religion for thousands of years, who are we to disagree.  ",
