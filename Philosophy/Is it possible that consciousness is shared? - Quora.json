            "answer_text": "I believe consciousness is rooted in the physical world. Which means that it is an energy pattern, like a wave, that can be described with information. It's a very particularly structured energy pattern. The physical component requires that there is actual physics involved. Physical processes rely on particle/ wave- like entities and connections. Especially for an information processing system, the connections are crucial. The physical properties of the connections matter. For example: transmission speed. The human brain contains a consciousness, in most cases. The human brain is also a very tightly integrated entity, with connections in the trillions. Very close-knit, physical connections in close proximity. Like a graph with many dimensions wrapped into a small space. It stands to reason that consciousness uses this dendritic network of nerve cells. Two brains that belong to different people are generally not physically connected in the same sense as the brains of a single person. Except for some Siamese twins. If shared consciousness exists, I would ask the question to a pair of Siamese twins with interconnected brains. OK, there are 'memes', things we exchange and things we are conscious of. But I don't think consciousness is the sum of all that we're conscious of. The message is not the messenger. Shared consciousness needs a much tighter integration of brains than the fact that we share cultural memes. These memes are not shared in a way that they are all connected to a single instance ('deep link') but are copies of the same thing in many brains ('shallow link'). Making a copy of something is definitely not the same thing as shared consciousness. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote a long answer to this, then re-read it and decided it was going to come across as rambling madness. So I\u2019ll keep it short. If you try to figure out a model for how the universe might work from an idealist perspective (\u201cthe universe exists in our minds\u201d), then you could say that physical reality is a shared part of our consciousness. Since we don\u2019t actually experience the entire universe all at once, in fact the bit that\u2019s shared could be relatively small in terms of actual data size. You could argue that we are one consciousness, but this consciousness has a number of different experiences of what we call the \u201cphysical\u201d world that make it regard itself as many separate entities. In fact this is vaguely reminiscent of how physical matter is treated in quantum mechanics. Especially, I think, in the decoherence/many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. The problem here is that, since we lack any coherent model of how shared consciousness would work, much less any model we can validate via experiment, we can\u2019t really say anything more than \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but what would it actually mean, and we don\u2019t have any evidence that it\u2019s true in any sense.\u201d There doesn\u2019t appear to be any kind of data transfer going on between separate conscious entities, except via what we call the physical universe.
