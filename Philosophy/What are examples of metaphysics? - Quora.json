            "answer_text": "Oh there are millions of examples of metaphysics since the metaphysical is related to conscience, love and spirituality. Many musicians are inspired to music by the metaphysical, many inventors has been too. Animals are in contact with it when they sense fear, humans are in contact with it when they feel inner peace, true love and a platonic, Apostle Paul like awareness. Metaphysics is anything non-physical which moves the physical, such as conscience, spirituality, motivation, faith, thoughts and even love. The metaphysical can be anything from something big like the ability to predict the future, or something more common such a inner peace felt through meditation. Motion is an example of metaphysics, so we see it\u2019s effects constantly, the physical is not alive so it can not move by itself, it has be set in motion by a metaphysical process (in other words something living and aware).Have you ever done or felt anything you were not taught by anyone, which you knew was not based on a physical need or instinct? The truly aware has many such experiences, and they are clear evidence and proof of the metaphysical. Every one of us see examples and evidence of the metaphysical daily, it is just very few who are aware that they are daily witnessing miracles and evidence of this world existing, because they try to explain it by some absurd magic of the physical making the metaphysical (life) as a random cause and effect which there is no evidence of, or something coming from nothing. Which is impossible and utter nonsense. LIFE itself is metaphysical. So you are yourself a living example of metaphysics, for without the metaphysical, the physical such as your body or Earth can not be set in motion. Every action has a reaction, and every motion must be set in motion. What IS in motion is the physical, what sets it in motion is the metaphysical ;) It is far more simple than the mumbo jumbo we often hear from religion, atheists or agnostic scientists who over complicate things by inventing concepts, ideas, theories and traditions which has no connection to the REAL world.The REAL world of what we experience is in fact far more from the metaphysical than the physical, we just have difficulty measuring, quantifying and proving the metaphysical to others and so we often give it less attention, either falsely concluding that truth is subjective (magical) or that there is no explanation for conscience though it influences everything we experience all the time. Science can often explain many truths and concepts except conscience, however conscience is the biggest part of the equation to the human experience, that that in itself shows us how much we are influenced by the metaphysical, and how little we really know.

            "answer_text": "What are examples of metaphysics? The cream of the crop metaphysicians of all time listed from the top down are: David Hume Arthur Schopenhauer Immanuel Kant This opinion is based upon understanding Hume\u2019s complex opinion that metaphysics is to serve art and [noticing] that his did indeed serve art. And because the art served is the heaviest of mankind, Smith\u2019s social science and Darwin\u2019s evolution, the mind [primed, oriented, set] with this complex impression has the power to destroy any and every other contrary or competing opinion. If what the human mind knows in the way of important complicated truth is a matter of right mix of experience whereas the mix of concrete led to the right mix of abstract or those experiences from reading, then I feel like I have hit the jackpot experience that causes [right] understanding wise. We can\u2019t experience the same things. Some of us are going to get lost and some carry in the right direction. It is the responsibility of those who are not lost to help those that are. It is your real experiences that determines what you will ingest into your mind by reading. It is simply a fact that some minds will not read but what answers pressing questions. Some people become interested in central questions. Because the mind was designed by the force to build wholes of understanding, those that begin optimally have more rounded wholes and this allows them to extend the whole outward farther. My mind is a humongous circle and it is perfectly round too. I\u2019ve got a real beauty but because we can only understand our kind it is going to be hard to expose to those that are ugly. If the reader will read along in Hume\u2019s introduction of TN I will help it enter into Hume\u2019s feelings of how metaphysics serves art. Hume makes a series of critical points: Humans get their important/useful understanding from art.The best artist get their understanding from the best metaphysicians.Because metaphysicians are abstruse they are commonly hated by minds proud of their common sense.Hume understands this perfectly yet he makes it clear that metaphysics is too important to not work with. You have to have method in selecting the correct metaphysicians and this takes you back to his first point; art is connected to metaphysics and because it is [easy, obvious, pleasing] the abstract principles that support it are made easier to understand; they are seen in their purpose. And this purpose is seen as part of a bigger purpose.As a critical example, Hume explained \u201creason is a slave to passion\u201d in its purpose or why nature made us this way and he clearly understood the bigger purpose it was a part of. Adam Smith exhausted this. The fact that very educated men and women can be understood as oblivious to what Hume instigated and Smith exhausted, examples of drab minds and very at that, is critical proof that metaphysics (and art itself) has gone to the dogs. When abstract metaphysical principles are observed in their \u201creason to be\u201d it points to a logic that [is] that was only appreciated after Smith with Darwin [or] Schopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics, which I need to repeat a thousand times, as it was at the work of correcting Kant and humiliating Hegel. To explain it differently, the abstract principles of Hume that served economics and evolution of the human mind were not appreciated in this by Kant and the long string of his followers save Arthur Schopenhauer. That is why there has been no organic development by metaphysicians but all metaphysicians are separated into unique supercilious idiots. These unique idiots are so because they are uniquely blind of or even contrary to central art. Organic as I use it above means; characterized by continuous or natural development. Some do serve some specific science but because they are detached from critical art/knowledge they tend famous scientist to think stupid things/say stupid things. This is from the feelings of the prepossessing mind. Arthur Schopenhauer is to be praised as a human being that actually approached godly probable reason in his complaint that Kant\u2019s screw up of ethics led to terrible ignorance. And he explained it was going to get a whole lot worse before it got better. If you will read me on the best examples of metaphysics, I am just getting started, your mind [will] become alluring. Then you can read Schopenhauer and understand an incredibly rare genius. He has not been properly recognized yet. He can\u2019t be until we understand [all] of our critical problems is caused by our shoddy ethics from his criticism on why it [is] jerry-built indeed. It is because he has turned out to be compatible with Hume, Smith, and Darwin, ideas he couldn\u2019t be exposed to because life is short or simply hadn\u2019t been thought yet, that proves his worth and likewise for the others. In-spite of his screw up Kant is a critical metaphysician. In his youth he was compatible with the others and with the greatest art of mankind. The problem was because of his great status he was pestered by the capitalist, the mindset that relegated Smith to a tax collector, for an impotent ethics. Hume\u2019s ethics that Smith adopted and that all more or less recognized for its \u201ceasy on the eye\u201d was distasteful to the dismal corporate spirit. It was a matter of old age and the lure of benefits these minds could offer that led Kant astray. Schopenhauer is complete in this. The reason on one has gotten it is strictly because of the ugly mind phenomenon and not that it is was not given. ",
