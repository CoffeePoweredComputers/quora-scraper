            "answer_text": "Most of the proofs come from Brahmin's literature\u2026 Greek Megasthenes wrote a lot about Indian teachers, philosophers, Kings, and others in his book (ref. The Historical Setting of Megasthenes' Indica)\u2026He didn\u2019t mention Chankaya at all\u2026someone raised the point of \u201cwhite lies\u201d\u2026How come\u2026?\u2026 So Megasthenes planed way long back about this situation\u2026and didn\u2019t mention Chanakya\u2019s name in his writing\u2026 Even not in Alexander\u2019s literature\u2026In fact, It is mentioned a Jain Muni { Kalanos, also spelled Calanus (c.\u2009398 \u2013 323 BCE) was a gymnosophist (literally \"naked philosopher\"), a philosopher from Taxila } met with Alexander and Alexander got impressed with him\u2026and took him to Bacteria\u2026but Alexander got died in midway\u2026That Jain Muni is a well-known personality in Greek literature... None of the Buddhist scripts talks about his name\u2026Only and only one Jain script (written by Jain writer Hemachandra) has his name which was written in 12 century after Tirupati / Bukka-Raya Sandhi\u2026Probably a compromise and a way to save themselves from mass massacre done by ManuVadis and accepted their supremacy ( It is written\u2026more than 8000 Jain Munis were assassinated in a single day by ManuVadis and later this killing kept going till the time they completely wiped out Shraman Sanskriti from South\u2026captured more than 1000 Jain temples and other Buddhist temples as well\u2026)\u2026Well, this not a topic we are discussing here but it is required to expose the intentions of doing the fabrication of real History\u2026! *Mudrarakshasa was written around in 10 century ( as it has the endorsement of Huns invasion\u2026definitely not a composition of Gupta era )...Not a composition of Gupta period\u2026Not a strong proof that can prove his existence. It is a Drama composed of that time\u2026 Not a book that can be trusted for historical facts\u2026In fact, it is written in Mudrarakshasa that ChandraGupt Maurya was a Shudra ( fabrication by ManuVadi Bramhins )\u2026but in reality, He was from a ShakyaVanshi clan, which was part of Gautama Buddha\u2019s clan\u2026got separated when King of Kaushala attacked Shakyas\u2026Lived in PippliVan which was famous for Peacocks (Moore)\u2026that\u2019s why they called Mauryas\u2026well described in several Buddha & Jain Granths like MahaBodhiVansh ( \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092c\u094b\u0927\u093f\u0935\u0902\u0938 in DevNagri language ), MahaParivibbasutta( \u092e\u0939\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092c\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924 in DevNagri language ), Divyavadant( \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0935\u0926\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924 in DevNagri language ), DeepVansh( \u0926\u0940\u092a\u0935\u0902\u0936 in DevNagri language )\u2026As far as MahaVansh( \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0935\u0902\u0936 in DevNagri language ) is a concern, It is purely a malfunction narration as there are several incidents mentioned which are doubtful to accept\u2026& another thing\u2026Buddhism is harmed by those Brahmans also who accepted it & were translating Buddhist literature into Bramhani literature\u2026There were many Brahmans who moved to Sri-Lanka from Tamilnadu-AndraPradesh-Kerla\u2026When it was the time of 19 century when all lost Granths-Purans were being translated into Nagri-Hindi\u2026At that time they played with the real history\u2026were creating fabricated copies of Buddhist Buddhas-Bodhisattvas-Nayakas-MahaNayakas stories\u2026If you read Buddhist Jataka tales( 547 stories & many more in other Granths..), you will find all the Hindu characters\u2026like King Harishchandra, Bodhisattva Ram, Agastya muni, Matang muni, Shraman Kumar, MahaKapi, Arjun, Vidur, Visvakarma, Kanha-Krishnaa and all others mentioned in Hindu tales\u2026all stolen from Buddhist literature\u2026 Now more important thing is, In Buddhism there are 28 Buddhas mentioned born on land on JambuDeep\u2026But Hinduism destroyed Shraman Sanskriti & included Gautam Buddha as an incarnation of VISHNU..whereas there is no VISHNU concept in Buddhism\u2026How come a Buddhist God has a new Hindu God appearance\u2026??? None of has any text about Chanakya-Kautilya\u2026!!! ARTHASHASTRA is not proof of his existence\u2026It is a collection of political diplomacy principles\u2026Not historical facts\u2026 None of any foreign visitors from China / Greece / Persia / Persia / Morocco / and even those who studied in Nalanda / Takshila mentioned such a huge personality named Chanakya\u2026! Brahmans always have been playing the game of patriotism\u2026They created Chanakya just to cover up the massacre done by Brahman Pusyamitra Sung\u2026Pusyamitra Sung has been highlighted as a protector from Greeks\u2026Greeks had been conquering Asia since Alexander but they had a pact with Magadh (Chandragupt / they would never attack Magadh\u2026)... King Malandra I conquered Punjab which was not part of Magadh at that time ( after the death of Ashoka, most of the GanRajyas-states declared themself free from Magadha when they got the advance knowledge of iron - metals & other things\u2026)\u2026 Brahmans Highlighted King Malandra I as invader because he became a Buddhist later\u2026This is how they play the patriotism card\u2026every time there was someone who was invader & they were protecting Bharat from that Invader\u2026 hence proves and questioned the existence of Chanakya\u2026!
