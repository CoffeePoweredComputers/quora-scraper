            "answer_text": "Before I answer, let me make 2 things clear: 1. I am a huge fan of LF (maybe because my parents are both enterpreneurs). I will keep my answer as objective as possible, but you should know this fact in advance. 2. Some countries in history almost reached LF, but there was actually NO country with truly LF economy, so we can only guess what it is. I will base my view of LF on Austrian School of Economics (almost no taxes, goverment providing only infrastructure, justice and army, so it is not libertarian society from Rothbard books, but there is almost no goverment in life) Cons: As we know from game theory, markets are right in most cases, but not ALWAYS. In some rare cases, regulation is better than conplete freedom (for example on which side of the road you should drive).We now have access to research with potential to destroy human race and it might be a good idea to regulate it somehow. I still believe that goverments are far less responsible than private investors, but this situasion is new and we should procees with great caution.Capitalism is not suited for waging wars. This is a great fact, but even when just 1 militaristic country exists on the world, it can exploit this weakness (yea, game theory again). In time of peace, there is no demand for army and no army exists in LF society. It just take too much time for LF country to produce weapons, soldiers etc. and react to invasion.It would be harder to finance some BIG projects like visiting the Moon. But look at Elon Musk nowdays, private sector can probably handle even that.Pros: There are too many pros, so I will just mention some that appeared on my mind instantly. You dont subside another people with your money. It is sad when factory is closed and workers loose their job, but I can see no reason why should I give them MY money for \u201creeducation\u201d and \u201cunemoloyment benefits.\u201d Dont get me wrong, I know very well how hard manual labour is (even now, I sometimes do hard physical jobs like working in lumber mill), but that is precisely why I invested almost every single penny to my education. They had the same opportunity, but they didnt choose the same path.Some public services, like public transport, would be better and cheaper. Dont get the wrong idea, it is definitely not \u201cfree\u201d even if the goverment says so.Education would be far less theoretical and more practical.It would be easier to find a new job without all the \u201cemployees protection\u201d laws.It would be much easier to start a new business.There would probably be no economic cycle without all the central banks interventions, but you dont have to believe this one.There would be no economic potential wasted on bureaucracy, tax optimalisation and other non productive jobs like that.There would probably be no corruption at all. Why should you corrupt a politician who have no power?Edit: I didn\u2019t expect so many views on LF question. Nice to see people interested in liberty and freedom. You are all great! ",

            "answer_text": "This can be examined only in the proper context. You must hold that a human being is born free and his natural state is to be free from coercion from other people and from the institutions like the Government. You must acknowledge that every human being has (individual) rights that he simply came with; just because he was born a human being. You must agree that all people are different individually, and each has to make his own way through life; win or loose, rich or poor, handsome or not, fat or lean, each individual has to be accountable for his own life. You must acknowledge that while we all choose to live in society, each individual is still essentially an individual, with responsibility for himself and not to anyone else. You must further agree that while people may voluntarily help each other, collaborate and cooperate in every imaginable way, still, each individual stands alone and bears no intrinsic responsibility to another person; If you agree with all of this, laissez-faire capitalism is only the socio-economic structure that allows all of the above. There is no other way to achieve this kind of society. This is the only way: Leave people alone! If you want a society predominantly determined by the principles described above, a society where each person bears responsibility for his own life, laissez-faire capitalism has only advantages for you. No disadvantages whatsoever at all. You must hold that no matter what, all men were not born equal in wealth, intelligence or social status and that it is society\u2019s job to make sure that there has to be a leveling of people. Your position has to be that something has to be done to make sure there every individual in that society must get decent housing, food, medicine, education, entertainment, and other necessities of life. What\u2019s more, you must agree that every individual must get all of this irrespective of any personal ability or meritorious effort; as if they are entitled to these. As a corollary, you must hold that since people are different, some people will always have the ability to earn much more than basic necessities while some will struggle to reach that basic line - and that this constitutes an enormous social injustice. You must hold that in order to create a more egalitarian and class-less society, all social assets need to be pooled and then redistributed among all people. You have to understand that this means taking stuff from the people who are highly productive, people who create much more than the baseline and giving it away to the people who do not. That\u2019s the only way to do it. If there are no people who produce more than the baseline, what would you redistribute? Can all of this be achieved using by leaving people free to lead the lives they wish to leave? No way. You have, first and foremost re-educate them to move them a little away from personal goals and closer to your social agenda, you have to to monitor and regulate them, control their output, pool their output, set expectations with regards to what they can each get from the state, then distribute the common assets, and lastly you also have to make sure they the people who do not completely agree with you, really do not speak too much to other or sow seeds of dissension that would undermine your dream of an egalitarian society. You cannot achieve this using the principle behind laissez-faire at all. This is a society where the Government has to educate, monitor, regulate and redistribute and represses dissension- where it has intervene in the lives of the people. In this scenario laissez-faire has no advantages at all; only disadvantages. The point is: laissez-faire is the foundation of acknowledging individual rights and therefore freedom from government coercion. Its advantages or its disadvantages depend on what kind of society you are talking about. ",
