            "answer_text": "Q: Can there ever be an entirely self-contained and thematically consistent philosophy that provides answers to everything (i.e. metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, and aesthetics)? A: Yes, and there already is. Systems Philosophy. It includes Systems Science, Systems Thinking, Systems Theory. See this book, by Laszlo (1972): StoryAlity #70C \u2013 Systems Philosophy (Laszlo 1972)More here: On Systems Theory and Evolution StoryAlity #70 \u2013 Key Concepts in Systems Theory, Cybernetics & EvolutionStoryAlity #70B \u2013 The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision (Capra & Luisi 2014)StoryAlity #70C \u2013 Systems Philosophy (Laszlo 1972)StoryAlity #70C2 \u2013 General Systems Theory: Problems, Perspectives, Practice (Skyttner 2005)StoryAlity #70D \u2013 The Evolving Self (Csikszentmihalyi 1993)StoryAlity #70E \u2013 On Human Nature \u2013 and Evolutionary PsychologyI don\u2019t have time to go into it in depth - but - it has all that. i.e. metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, and aesthetics. eg Here\u2019s a diagram.  In the diagram above, you can\u2019t have the things above without those below. So, no Biology without (organic) Chemistry, Geology, Planets and Stars, etc. Or, looking at the top, to have: Culture (eg Philosophy), you need all the things under that, first. Then Culture can emerge from all the other complex systems. (Culture = symbol systems! Like say: Philosophy! Or - Languages, Movies, Art, Science, Dance, Technology, etc) Culture = Ideas, Processes, Products. aka Memes, or units of culture. In the diagram above, Maths (at the bottom) underpins it all - because, due to probability, we\u2019re probably all living in, a sim. (As crazy as that sounds. Yes; I know it sounds crazy. See The Simulation Argument) And another one: Showing systems. That are each a part, and also a whole.  For more details, see many of these books (eg Philosophy of Biology. And other Systems books in there. Scroll down to see the book Covers/Titles.) StoryAlity #71 \u2013 On Consilience and Creativity\u2026 Note - Ecosystems are just: Systems. Humans are just: Systems. Plants are systems, animals are systems. Again - Ecosystems are Systems. A lot of older Philosophers had anthropocentric views; that humans were the top of a Great Chain of Being, the best thing ever, etc. We now know that\u2019s not: realistic. (If ecosystems collapse - so do living things. Humans are highly-evolved animals that depend on ecosystems to survive, as does everything.) We also know animals and plants have less-evolved (less developed, less complex) emotions and cognition. This has huge implications for the ethiocs of how we trat plants and animals. See Homo Deus (Harari 2017) and Sapiens (Harari 2015) (Emotions are just: evolved, `shortcuts\u2019 (short circuits) for, rational cognition.) When Emotions evolved - they kept alive the lifeforms that had `survival-promoting\u2019 ones. (eg Mammals love their young, reptiles not so much.) But this is all just a systems process. Evolution is a systems process. It happens naturally in: ecosystems, also in artificial environments when we (humans) set it up that way. (See: Artificial Selection, eg breeding cows for milk, sheep for wool, dogs for certain traits, etc) Anyway - it\u2019s all there. As for Aesthetics, for example, see: Dennis Dutton\u2019s The Art Instinct (2009) It shows how: human aesthetics have evolved. Side note: Human aesthetics aren\u2019t necessarily: the best. (Our input and processing systems [mind, nervous systems] are designed a certain way, by evolution (and not designed very well; evolution is a satisficer, not an optimizer) to find certain things: aesthetically pleasing.) Computers change things, somewhat. See Harari (2017). More on that here: StoryAlity#141 \u2013 The Robo-Raconteur \u2013 a StoryAlity Theory Artificial-Writer ie Computers can now (deliberately, using pre-designed algorithms) paint paintings, that a consensus of humans find: beautiful / pleasing. And they can also do a lot more. As for Ethics in groups; chimps have ethics. So do: many social animals. They evolve (emerge) due to group dynamics; if certain ethics aren\u2019t in place, the group can implode - or otherwise be destroyed. It becomes more complex with conscious beings in (social) groups, but the core principle underpinning the system\u2019s operation is the same. Anyway. Look to Systems Science, for more. Read Laszlo (1972). It (basically) all starts there. In fact it starts in the 1950s with Bertalanffy, but; whatever. Trace it backwards or forwards through Laszlo. You\u2019ll see some Arthur Koestler, on the way. You\u2019ll also see things like these, which again are underpinned by Systems Philosophy: toryAlity #137 \u2013 Culturology \u2013 and, the CES (Cultural Evolution Society)StoryAlity #138 \u2013 Darwin on the evolution of words and languagesStoryAlity #139 \u2013 On the evolution of Darwin\u2019s `Tree of Life\u2019 DiagramStoryAlity#140 \u2013 The Evolution of the Systems Model of Creativity (Csikszentmihalyi 1988-onwards)Anyway - really great question! It indeed was a hard question (in all cultural domains, not just Philosophy) until Science progressed to the point where, systems science became obvious as a `Universal Explainer\u2019, LOL PS Side note = For example - as for Epistemology, it\u2019s Evolutionary Epistemology (Popper, DT Campbell, D K Simonton etc). Which - is the same as The Systems Model of Creativity (Csikszentmihalyi) See these 2 articles/chapters for how it all links up. StoryAlity #144 \u2013 The structure of the meme, the unit of culture (in: The Encyclopedia of Information Science & Technology, Velikovsky 2017)StoryAlity#132 \u2013 The holon/parton structure of the Meme, the unit of cultureThe one above, (the 2016 book chapter) was the Appendix to my PhD.

The finite nature of humans vs the infinite/undefined nature of the universe means that a truly consistant philosophy that answers everything is impossible. There will always be things that exist outside of our knowledge structures. A creature with limitation cannot know all that there is to be known, by definition. A creature without limitation has no form, or structure, with which to engage in philosophy in the first place. One annoying property of this is that my original absolute \u201cNo\u201d makes this a circular argument and a fallacy. Ha. ",

My response to the above \u201cquestion\u201d (well, it reads like one, but it feels like it is leading to a certain definite conclusion so it may be a question only grammatically not syntactically) is another question, why do you need to ask this, what motivates you to formulate this assemblage of words and meaning? Is this a version of bubble theory, that we want the most economical way to answer every question? Seriously, what interior urge / thought chain would manifest as this question, which implies you think there is something missing, as if humanity needs such an all purpose way to think? It looks like supermarket wishful thinking, you know, everything you need in one store. I\u2019m not convinced we need such a service. ",

Yes, truth in philosophy is possible, for TRUTH itself exists. The closest anyone has come to this is probably found in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. One caveat occurs. A willingness to carefully and constantly study his meaning is required. If he is incorrect in a fact, then the time that he lived should be taken into account. But any failure of reason, after careful examination, can indeed be taken as an authentic failure. Let us call to mind that this PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY has existed for many centuries, there are many contributors to it, and that there exist many differing opinions but no disproofs of the central propositions. The only disproofs seem to be fact based, not procedure based. ",
