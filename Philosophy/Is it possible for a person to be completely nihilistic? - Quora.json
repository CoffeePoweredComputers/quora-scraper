            "answer_text": "I'd say no, and for the same reason I believe it's impossible for a person to be completely altruistic: there has to be something in it for them. A nihilist believes in nothing, and can find no purpose to existence. I have to believe that the moment a person achieves true nihilism, they would have to commit suicide. As long as they can find some reason to continue existing, they aren't quite a complete nihilist. ",
