            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by a void. There can be two ways of interpreting a void: A place where the concentration of a certain substance is less than the normal value in normal conditions.A place where nothing is present. Literally nothing! So, if it's the first option, then yes. There is (are) such voids in our observable universe.  It's called the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or CMB. It reveals the difference in the temperature of the empty universe and in turn gives us the amount of photons in various areas of the universe. This anistropy is due to gravitational collapse, dark matter and dark energy and various other celestial reasons.  Now, if it's the other option, then sorry mate, but it's not the case. You see, the average temperature of CMB is around 2.7 K. What does this mean? Whenever there is a temperature, there has to some energy associated with it. At 0 K , there would be no kinetic or vibrational energy because there is no heat associated with the particle(s). And thanks to the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (HUP) , there is always some energy associated with the particle and in turn, it produces heat energy if it's not in thermal equilibrium. HUP: \u0394E . \u0394t \u2265 h/4\u03c0 This is the second equation of HUP. It means within a certain time interval, there will be some kind of uncertainty in the energy of particle. The more the time interval, the less the time uncertainty. This uncertainty signifies that energy of individual particles can't be zero. So, where there is energy, there has to be something associated with it. Virtual particles or stuff like that.  Even empty space has energy! It of the order of 10^-120 J! Very less. This arises from the quantum fluctuations arising in the empty space. Fun fact: empty space has a particle density of about 5 atoms per cubic meter. TL,DR: there is nothing like a void in our observable universe. Hope it helps\u2122 :D Satvik ",
