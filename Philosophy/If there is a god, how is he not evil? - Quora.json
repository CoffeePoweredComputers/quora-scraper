            "answer_text": "Depends on how you look at good and evil. When you talk about something there is a need to have the same \u201clanguage\u201d or the same way of transferring data/information. When you bring up a being known as \u201cGod\u201d or whatever that is, define it. There are two definition of \u201cGod\u201d that I know/understand, which are: All powerful/The greatest/The highest/etc.This idea requires certain requirements, which are that the being must be:1. The strongest,2. The wisest,3. The smartest,4. Don\u2019t lie,5. Being responsible.Powerful/Great/Mighty/etc. (Not necessarily the highest)This idea have a requirement, which is that the being(s) must posses power(s) that is/are unique and unparalleled among the equal category of the power(s).I\u2019m going along with the Bible for the 1st definition of God. Let me start by writing, \u201cIF YOU DON\u2019T TREAT GOD AS A GOD, DON\u2019T EXPECT TO BE TREATED AS A HUMAN.\u201d God is just. An eye for an eye is the most fair rule of all.If you kill, you deserve to be killed. If you steal, you deserve to be stolen. If you hurt people, you deserve to be hurt. A just law isn\u2019t cruel nor kind, it is just. The old testament Law is about fairness and justice. But God himself put emphasis on kindness. Why would a God put emphasis on kindness? Can\u2019t he just make everyone good? If he does then he\u2019s stupid, which he isn\u2019t. The point of creation of human being is there on Genesis 1 : 26. \u201c'And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. ' Genesis 1:26\u201d The point of creating human is to be like God. What does it mean to be like God?Law abiding, healthy, smart, etc. The human right that God acknowledge is the right to choose, that is free will. And since then, they chose not to follow the law and went on, drunk in the wonderful taste of flesh(lust, greed, etc) then they complain because of the consequences. The consequences were death, plague, suffering, famine, so on and so forth. Why would God do this? It\u2019s what you deserve. Human brought slavery, torture, and many other horrendous stuff that is very un-resembles the image of God. And like that, you don\u2019t deserve to live. Human\u2019s purpose was to be close with the image of God. Don\u2019t complain when you get what you deserve, love Isn't a right. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll assume your Q is based on the following premises: If there is a God, he must be all-PowerfulIf he is all-Powerful, then the fact that the world is evil means he likes it that way, OR he doesn\u2019t careIf he doesn\u2019t like it that way, and he cares, yet evil persists, then he must be powerless, and therefore not God.Did I get that right? Well, here\u2019s another option that many overlook: God exists, is all-Powerful, hates the evil in the world and feels bad that innocent people suffer BUT he isn\u2019t stepping in right now for a reason, but will do so in the future.That option is the one that the Bible teaches, with these basic facts God created a peaceful world full of good thingsAn angel who was created good misused their free will to mislead the first humans. The first humans misused their free will to rebel against God and came under the rulership of the wicked angel, and he rules the world to this day.The wicked angel claims that he is a better ruler than God, and most of mankind agrees with him in principle by choosing to ignore God\u2019s laws and do whatever they want to do, calling it \u201cfreedom\u201dGod is waiting for the matter to play out until it proved to all intelligent creation that mankind can only flourish under God\u2019s ruleThen God will step in, remove the rebels off the scene, fix all damage caused by the rebellion and restore the earth to its original condition, and bless faithful mankind with everlasting life.You can learn more about what the Bible says on this subject, and also learn what you can do to benefit from God\u2019s permitting of evil: Why Does God Allow Suffering?

            "answer_text": "God is very different in each world. In this world, God might or might not exist. God might have abandoned humanity if he does exist in this world. Some think that God lets humans decide if they want to commit morally wrong things. Others think that God didn\u2019t create us but rather send us to this world without our past memories because we were evil. Gods are not really considered evil or good. Gods, unlike humans, decide their destiny. ",

            "answer_text": "Think about it. Why do people suffer unless God allows it? Hindus believe in the transmigration of souls. They believe there is a method to this madness. That seemingly random good and bad things happen to people for a reason and that reason is the law of karma. This is the only logical explanation that made some sense to me individually. However it opens up even more questions that are so varied and detailed that I would struggle to address them here. However, the law of karma is a starting hypothesis that helps explain why the world is like it is, at least to some extent. ",
