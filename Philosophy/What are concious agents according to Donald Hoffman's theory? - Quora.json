            "answer_text": "First, some context. In Hoffman\u2019s theory, conscious agents are the primitive constituents of reality. The objective world consists of conscious agents and their experiences. The world of elementary particles and fields are merely icons in a user interface of human conscious agents. But humans are just one complex type of conscious agent. In his article \u201cConscious Realism and the Mind-Body Problem,\u201d Mind & Matter Vol. 6(1), pp. 87\u2013121, Hoffman explains, First, a conscious agent is not necessarily a person. All persons are conscious agents, or heterarchies of conscious agents, but not all conscious agents are persons. Second, the experiences of a given conscious agent might be utterly alien to us; they may constitute a modality of experience no human has imagined, much less experienced. Third, the dynamics of conscious agents does not, in general, take place in ordinary four-dimensional space-time. It takes place in state spaces of conscious observers, and for these state spaces the notion of dimension might not even be well-defined. In his paper with C. Prakash, \u201cObjects of consciousness,\u201d Frontiers in Psychology, 2014. Hoffman provides a precise mathematical definition of a conscious agent in terms of a set of experiential states X, a set of actions G, and maps that relate these to each other and to states of an objective world W (which itself is composed of conscious agents). The maps can be understood as defining the structure of perception P, decision D, and action A. Based on this definition, he constructs models of interacting conscious agents and derives predictions from those models.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hoffman\u2019s agents are a way to simulate consciousness, the conscious agent has rules of reaction when it meets another c. agent. Hoffman claims that consciousness can be represented through a model which includes c. agents and the interaction of them. His target is to explain conscious phenomenas in mathematical terms. It very reminds me of the simulation called VITA where agents have survival rules attached to their social proximity to other agents. The increasing of rule\u2019s number increases dramatically the system\u2019s complexity, allowing an association of conscious functions to the resulting collective behaviour of the agents. It appears from his words, that in asymptotic zones, the equation representing the agent\u2019s behaviour is similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave equation. ",
