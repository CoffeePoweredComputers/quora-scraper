            "answer_text": "That is the general idea, when the context is a determination as to whether a conclusion is True or False. If something concluded to be false, is to be regarded as \u201ctrue\u201d in the context of an altered argument, it can only be thought to be true, if there is an argument which objectively shows it to be true. The fundamental distinction is \u201ctrue ever\u201d or what is designated \u201ctrue\u201d. True is eternal. That which is true is not false. In other words, it would not be consistent with a discipline in Logic, for a conclusion proven false, to be regarded as true as a conclusion derived from previous premises. So, consider Argument A. Argument A is proven logically to be False. If another opportunity presents itself to suppose Argument A is True, can it be done logically? No. For Argument A to be ever identified as False, it is forever False. But if the context is changed, and another argument is offered, can A be true? Then A is not \u201cA\u201d. A has been changed to B. B can be true, because the premises can be altered. All of which serves to show why the Law of Identity is such a powerful law when the pursuit of knowledge is conducted.  However, this is not a blanket denial that truth is determined in a context, and that there may be other contexts in which an argument does not bear out as \u201cfalse\u201d. But nothing is \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d merely for the fact that someone \u201cthinks it to be so\u201d as is evident in so many of the questions seen on Quora and in the public media. There are many people who offer questions, in the confused understanding that if they ask it, there is a suggestion that it is \u201ctrue\u201d. Unfortunately, questions are not arguments, and questions are not regarded as proofs, or what is called \u201cprobative\u201d of anything. In an objective context, a question can be understood as a rather explicit declaration of an ignorance, rather than a knowledge. Questions, as \u201cconditionals\u201d are only useful for the pursuit of a knowledge. A truth, must be published as a Declarative, a statement, and never a question.  So there can be a dynamic in which there is an interaction or \u201cplay\u201d or correspondence between a Relativism or a Relativistic conclusion, and an Absolute or Absolutist conclusion. In fact, a great deal of human conversation and dialogue is demonstrated to be such an interaction, although much of it does not seem to clarify the issues to a satisfactory degree.  The Mind in dialogue, can do strange things, such as violate Aristotle\u2019s Three Laws so as to arrive at a false conclusion and declare it a deductive proof. Argument A, if false, still remains Argument A, and False. In other contexts, and using other premises, it may be that Argument A can be changed and shown to be True; but a changed argument is not Argument A, is it? Now it is Argument B. The Law of Identity would indicate: A = A, a = a, B = B, b = b, False is not equal to True. Therefore, one should not allow the thinking to get \u201call\u2014caught\u2014up\u201d in some kind of confused muddle that is an entanglement involving The Excluded Middle. In the Middle you see, Argument A is slightly changed in our thinking and we may feel pleased because by slightly altering our premises or conclusion, we have an answer that is proposed as a True answer. But all we have done in that operation, is introduce The Excluded Middle and called it Argument A. All of which serves to show, that to clarify all of our thinking, we need to identify, regarding anything we have for a subject (called an Identity) its polar opposite. We cannot think clearly if we fail to identify Two Extremes and a Mean Value. This becomes almost a \u201cmantra\u201d or \u201cchant\u201d for the logician or thinking person. \u201cFind the opposite!\u201d \u201cFind the opposite!\u201d \u201cFind the opposite!\u201d . ",

            "answer_text": "No, not in every circumstance. Think of this hypothetical.  A white room exists with nothing in it.  One man who enters the room incorrectly claims that a ball exists in the room, yet another man later enters and can justify (with sufficient evidence) that there is no ball in the room.  It is therefore proven false.  Yet, only days later someone enters the room and places a ball in it, thus forcing the second man to change his conclusion and \u2018make true\u2019 what was originally concluded as false. Somethings are a matter of time. ",
