            "answer_text": "I did it and no one has been able to present a cogent argument against the paper that I wrote on it - A Participatory Universe Does Not Equal a Simulated One and Why We Live in the Former. I look at and analyze all the pro arguments in its favor and destroy each one with actual physical evidence and factually based counter arguments, as to why each pro-argument is baseless. I wrote my paper in the wake of the 2016 hype about simulation hypothesis and Elon Musk\u2019s statements. In fact, I look at Elon Musk\u2019s much quoted statements and answer his rhetorical question - head on, about what\u2019s wrong with his pro-simulation argument.  It\u2019s around 40 pages with over 100 references. So far as I can tell, it is the ultimate commentary on the simulation hypthesis question. It proves conclusively that the simulation hypothesis is a house of cards that only fools those with a digitalcentristic outlook, but completely falls apart, once that bias is removed. ",
