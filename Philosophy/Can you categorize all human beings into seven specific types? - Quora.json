            "answer_text": "Can you categorize all human beings into seven specific types? Of course I can. So can you. Anyone can. There are seven-point-eight billion people in the world. So the real question is, can we devise a typing system that can usefully guide us in how to deal with an individual whose type we know? Because I tell you, Myers-Briggs has 16 types, and the two ISTJ\u2019s I know are nothing at all like each other. Their type is no useful guide at all. So I don\u2019t see the use in jamming 7.8 billion people into one of only seven types, and pretending it tells you something useful about any one of them. No type would help you deal equally with the billion or so people contained therein, as if they were all the same in important ways. People in my experience are far more individual than that. They make and take exception to whatever generalities, boxes and labels, types and groups you try to draw around them or classify them with. We can come up with type trait boxes for groups of people and plug in those group traits for whoever we meet, but this is a very old invention. It\u2019s simply prejudice: to judge in ignorance of the individual, in advance of knowing the individual. Usually by assignment of group traits. Sure, if you think fast and keep an open mind you can knock out trait after trait you discover they don\u2019t have - but where was the advantage of the (stereo)type then? You could more easily and naturally have faced them with an open mind. Let them plug in the traits they do have, from what they actually give of themselves. Anyhow. It doesn\u2019t strike me as something I\u2019m likely to do, but yes. The answer to the question is yes. Of course I could. In fact I\u2019ll go you five places better. There are two types of people in the world. You, and everybody else. ",

Every one is a type looks just like no other person\u2026 less you have biological twin identical look.. but their landscape and personality can be wholly different. Type casting ethnicity is a social game of grope at stereotyping\u2026 few humans are pure ethnic DNA \u2026 if so, there is and was much related family interbreding over many generations of intercourse between direct kin. Applications asking your ethnicity YOU KNOW THE LIST\u2026 IS about stemming or data profiling workforce or political and social potential discrimination Or may for medical issues serve possible diagnosis of possible inherited genetic traits make us all more or less subject to physical or biological predispositions to disease immunity factors and so on. In the same misconception the idea of there are different races of humans is propagandists rhetoric\u2026 humanity is one single race species lifeform. RACISM is the ignorance of thinking it be otherwise\u2026 the act was invented to note unjustify some idea of reason to sustain segregation to just retain and restrain threat to self interest control of gainful advantage over economics to maintain superior posturing out of fear of others equal ability of intellectual and its substance be intentionally debased with no veracity of validity justified\u2026 might compete be stifulled. These Q types only propagate that stupid fallacy. The continued master/slave idea one works for another\u2026 as opposed one works WITH another for mutural gain of need and potential wants. RACISM is the attempt to monetise one's value and worth an analogy. This my POV. ",
