            "answer_text": "Yes, but you may have to reconsider your concept of perfection. With the evolution debate, we have contrasting ways of viewing reality. I have been telling others about a new theory of evolution which presents a picture of each kingdom descending into physical matter and form, and then ascending out of that form when a new kingdom arrives on earth to replace it. This theory (Blavatsky 1888), presents evolution as if the kingdoms are rungs on a ladder. I named the kingdom more evolved than human: Girasas. The environment that each evolving kingdom lives on earth with is composed of angels which involve instead of evolve. This theory says that evolution from one kingdom to the next occurs over a period of time equal to seven rounds of seven globes. We are told this current position is the fourth globe and the fourth round and that we are the fifth race. Three races descend through animals, one race exists in form with no other evolving kingdom present, then three races ascend through Girasas. When we reach the seventh globe on the seventh round, we are perfect. We have completed evolution as a kingdom. However, that just means we have graduated into the next kingdom, so humans will be Girasas when the life moves to a new series of seven globes and seven rounds. It would also seem to be perfection, when we learn to work with the higher kingdom on our ascension so well that we don\u2019t make any mistakes. The Girasas were human before and since this is a human form and environment, they should easily know how to live perfectly within it. It becomes a matter of the human not blocking the Girasas from acting, but the girasas is more intent upon reaching their own goals, and so it becomes a situation where human ascension and the descent of Girasas occur simultaneously. Do you think perfection could result from the two cooperating on something? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the world itself is perfect. Imperfections are nothing more than an illusion within the comparing/discriminating human mind. In nature plants seed in different ways, some by the power of wind and others by fruit and still others by burrs. Which way is perfect? They all work for the particular plant and so each and every way is perfect. Everything is interconnected and inseparable. It is balanced and in harmony. If it wasn't then life would cease to be. But it is and so it is perfection. Stop thinking (comparing ) and end your problems. \u201cWe cannot know the Tao itself, nor see its qualities direct, but only see by differentiation, that which it manifests. Thus, that which is seen as beautiful is beautiful compared with that which is seen as lacking beauty; an action considered skilled is so considered in comparison with another, which seems unskilled. That which a person knows he has is known to him by that which he does not have, and that which he considers difficult seems so because of that which he can do with ease. One thing seems long by comparison with that which is, comparatively, short. One thing is high because another thing is low; only when sound ceases is quietness known, and that which leads is seen to lead only by being followed. In comparison, the sage, in harmony with the Tao, needs no comparisons, and when he makes them, knows that comparisons are judgements, and just as relative to he who makes them, and to the situation, as they are to that on which the judgement has been made. Through his experience, the sage becomes aware that all things change, and that he who seems to lead, might also, in another situation, follow. So he does nothing; he neither leads nor follows. That which he does is neither big nor small; without intent, it is neither difficult, nor done with ease. His task completed, he then lets go of it; seeking no credit, he cannot be discredited. Thus, his teaching lasts for ever, and he is held in high esteem.\u201d \u2014 Tao te ching, chapter 2, Stan Rosenthal. ",
