            "answer_text": "There are inherent biases and perspectives for every individual that come as part of being an individual. You cannot 'escape' or 'ditch' them, but you can correct for them.   If you are aware, for example, that a particular situation makes you disproportionately angry, but you cannot justify why, you can feel your anger without acting on it. Acknowledging an emotional state is like acknowledging being tired, or dizzy. You can know your limitations and either mitigate them or limit your actions based on their constraints. The better your awareness and knowledge of your limitations, the easier it is to avoid and correct for them.  ",
