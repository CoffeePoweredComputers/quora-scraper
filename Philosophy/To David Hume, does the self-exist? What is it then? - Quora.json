            "answer_text": "Q: To David Hume, does the self-exist? What is it then? This essay might help you with your question: Ego versus False Ego According to Sigmund Freud, the ego is the psychological component of the personality that is represented by our conscious decision-making process. Fredrick Nietzsche views that the concept of ego, reason and consciousness has resulted from the breakup of human existence from a more natural state- - a state in which instinctual activity dominated the human life. For Carl Jung, it is much simpler - the ego is the mind. Freud, Jung and Nietzsche were psychologists and philosophers. Freud and Nietzsche were atheists while Jung believed in a vague, mysterious God. While Jung believed in spirituality, his definition of the ego is similar to Freud and Nietzsche - an intangible by-product of neuronal interactions in the brain. Because all of them only study the nature of the mind and the brain, their understanding of the ego was limited, if not totally wrong. Most people\u2019s idea of the ego is equated with arrogance, self-entitlement, hubris, over-confidence, self-conceit or narcissism. Sometimes we hear or say, \u201cThat guy has a big ego.\u201d \u201cArtists are egotists.\u201d \u201cHis humongous ego put him in a difficult situation.\u201d This oftentimes creates some problems or disturbances in our lives and people surrounding us. We often want others to be fair and honest, points out their faults, but we don\u2019t want them to see and point out our own weaknesses and shortcomings. This is prevalent in all sectors and areas of society, in our own household and neighborhood, community, and in our own selves. Sometimes we are unconscious about it or sometimes deliberate, trying to put-down or outsmart others (in a negative way). This is a kind of psychological shackle that prevents us from pursuing higher ideals of spirituality, or even an ideal member of a peaceful society. It clouds our mind and intellect believing that we are better than anyone and we are always right, but oftentimes insensitive, condescending, reckless and destructive, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. The real EGO is the spirit soul, the consciousness, the \u201cI\u201d, the self, the seer and perceiver of our individual existence and experiences. It is a higher and a distinct energy from matter (our physical body), intelligence and mind. We, the ego is the one watching our dreams and nightmares when our body is asleep, like when we watch a movie from a distance. We are separate and distinct from our mind. We are the one watching the intuition, the hunches, the sudden memories, feelings and emotions bubbling up from the \u201cpond\u201d of our mind. We are the one thinking of helping others with compassion or empathy, or plan sinister plots. The ego, the self, is like the fisherman sitting by the bank of the river watching all kinds of things carried along by the river. We are the conscious ego watching the stream of mind-stuff flowing incessantly in our minds. We are the one annoyed by the incessant mind-chatter. There is a semblance of Ego that most of us identify with, and that is the FALSE EGO. It is the most subtle material energy higher than the mind and intelligence. It is identifying our self to something that which is not. When we think we are the physical body and its labels, that is false ego. We are neither the physical body nor the mind. The body and the mind constantly changes, but we, the spirit soul are eternally the same, undying, invisible, indivisible, immeasurable and remains constant. When we take a selfie and post it on social media, we think \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m beautiful, handsome, pretty, young, old, etc.\u201d Our friends and family who view the picture undoubtedly think we are it. They may praise our good looks, criticize or ridicule - all pertaining to our body. Many of us compete with others and envy those who are \u201cmore beautiful\u201d or \u201cmore handsome\u201d than us. Many get depressed and committed suicide because of this false bodily identification that breeds insecurity and unhappiness. That\u2019s why camera \u201cfilters\u201d was invented to mask our \u201cimperfections\u201d so that we feel and look much better, at least in pictures. Falsely identifying ourselves with the body is the reason why many of us are miserable. No matter how hard we try to satisfy the desires of our body and mind, we are still empty inside. We are still unhappy as if all our efforts are futile and wasted. Definitely, we experience some flashes of \u201cheavenly\u201d pleasures and happiness, but they are fleeting, short-lived, not enough to fill the enormous vacuum, the expansive and gnawing emptiness in our hearts, especially when we are all alone. Why? We are feeding the false ego and not the real ego, like cleaning and polishing the birdcage neglecting the bird inside. Material sense enjoyment doesn\u2019t reach the spiritual self. They are distinct like oil and water, like apple and orange. Some people believe we are nothing, as in non-existent. They say we don\u2019t really exist and everything is just an illusion. They say we are just like a random air trapped in an earthen pot that is tightly closed. That random \u2018air\u2019 is trapped in our physical body. The goal is to break the earthen pot, the vessel of the body through meditation so that we can be freed from entrapment and merge into the great void or nothingness again. This is the effect of false ego. Another face of false ego is believing we are the Supreme God. This is the greatest influence of illusion. There are philosophies that teaches this kind of idea. They believe we were originally one person, God, but we chose to divide our self into all the fragments of this universe, to assume individuality and enjoy the theater of life. We are like millions of tiny fragments of the same broken mirror. But, they say we have forgotten that we are God and we are now miserable, so, in order to remember and reinstate our Oneness and be happy again, we all need to meditate to unify our consciousness and be One God again. We are neither God nor non-existent. God means omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing) and omnipresent (present everywhere at the same time). We don\u2019t have those qualities in full. God is fully in control and fully independent, we are very limited in our ability. We are controlled by so many laws and factors, seen and unseen \u2013 we obey spiritual, natural and social laws, we are controlled by time, modes of nature, law of karma, and even our own mind and senses. We can\u2019t do anything about birth, diseases, old age and death. We can\u2019t even understand all the workings of our own mind and those of others. We may not be certain whether other people really exist, but we cannot deny our own existence. We are conscious and aware that we exist. We even know we exist even while our body is asleep because we recall watching our dreams. We see, feel hear, taste, love, fear, worry, and understand things. Cogito, ergo sum - \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d \u2013 Rene Descartes, French philosopher. This is a sample proof of awareness of our existence. If we don\u2019t exist, who is trying to convince us that we don\u2019t exist? No one? If we punch someone in the face, will \u2018no one\u2019 say nothing or that \u2018 no one\u2019 will punch us back? Is it just a result of chemical reaction? We always see two people get into a fight for whatever individual disagreements they have. It will not happen if \u2018no one\u2019 is inside those bodies. There is no one in inanimate objects like stones. You can bang them together until they break, but no one will complain, react or retaliate. But, there is someone in living organisms, and that is the ego, the consciousness, the spirit soul. Understanding and realizing the difference between the spiritual self (ego) and the material body (false ego), we can become free from the effects of illusion and misery. But, we should also understand that by our intelligence and efforts alone, we will never unshackle the chains that binds us from worldly predicament and the cycle of birth and death, which is borne out of false ego and ignorance. God alone can erase false ego and free us from its entanglement, under the guidance of a bonafide teacher who is totally free from false ego. Lord Jesus Christ is free from false ego, and he gave us the secret through his first and foremost and greatest commandment: \u201cTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?\u201d Jesus replied: \u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u201d - Matthew 22:36-40. If our heart and mind is full with this love, there will be no room for false ego anymore. If the spaces in our heart and mind is filled with 50% love for God, then the other 50% must be filled with false ego. If no love for God occupies them, then, 100% false ego dominates. It depends on where our consciousness and interest lies. That is our free will and our individual responsibility. \u201cWhen the soul is under the spell of material nature and false ego, identifying his body as the self, he becomes absorbed in material activities, and by the influence of false ego he thinks that he is the proprietor of everything.\u201d - Srimad Bhagavatam 3.27.2. Thus situated in the highest transcendental stage, the mind ceases from all material reaction and becomes situated in its own glory, transcendental to all material conceptions of happiness and distress. At that time, the yog\u012b realizes the truth of his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He discovers that pleasure and pain as well as their interactions, which he attributed to his own self, are actually due to the false ego, which is a product of ignorance. - Srimad Bhagavatam - 3.28.36 ",
