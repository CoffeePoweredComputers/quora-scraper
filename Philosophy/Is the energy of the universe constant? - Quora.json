            "answer_text": "Yes, most probably. The constant will equal exactly zero energy. It would be 50% negative energy, and 50% positive energy. The balance point between the forces is light speed itself. The only way that this could happen is if the universe itself is like a particle. This particle must be negative outside, and positive inside. The barrier between the negative and positive forces are the light speed itself. Negative energy has the property of repulsive gravity.Positive energy has the property of attractive gravity. The interaction between this forces makes the universe cyclically undergoes Big Bangs, and Big Crunches. If you then makes an illustration of how this happens, it would look something like this.  V=C represents a new Big Bang. This big bangs will always follow directly from a Big Crunch. If you are looking at only one cycle independently, it could look something like this.  Mass and matter is created when the universe is expanding, then mass and matter lumps togheter, and at the same time accelerate outwardly. All mass and matter is accelerating back to the light speed barrier between the forces and charges. This outwardly acceleration of positive mass, initiates the inwardly acceleration, or compression of negative energy outside the universe. When I finished this model I cam up whit this. The universe has zero rest energy and zero time. I looked this up in Wikipedia, and there was a particle that equaled this terms. It was the photon. I sourced for photons at the internet, and I was able to find a image of real photons in the vacuum speed of light. This is the image The first ever photograph of light as both a particle and wave I could us my model of the universe to tell in which direction the photon was moving. I could us my model to tell that there must be a solid spherically part inside the photon. I also could tell why the photon has to change size as it moves, and what\u2019s happening related to this. Of course I could tell a lot more. At the same time, I could predict how the universe was functioning, and where the dark energy is located. What gravity could be and how it is functioning. It could also imply something about particles, and how mass and matter is up built. How the nature forces works, and how they are related. Theoretically and hypothetically of course. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the energy of the universe likely is constant. In fact, I am guessing that the energy of the universe is zero. I respect the other answers in to this question, and several of them have a firm foundation in theory. But the total energy is tricky to define in theoretical physics; it is typically done using the mathematical approach devised by Emmy Noether (look up Noether\u2019s theorem) but that approach fails when you are considering the entire universe. The reason I favor zero energy comes from an old semi-classical calculation that shows that if we include the negative binding energy of gravity, then when the universe is \u201cflat\u201d (that is, over large distances, we have Euclidean geometry with the sum of the angles of a triangle actually adding to 180 degrees), then that binding energy exactly cancels the positive mass energy of the universe, yielding zero. And the recent results of cosmological measurements show that the dark energy provides just the right amount to make the geometry of the universe flat. In this picture, the only reason we think we see net energy (from gasoline, from wood, from nuclear bombs) is because we are insensitive to the negative binding energy that accompanies them. We are sitting deep in a figurative well, and not aware of the negative energy of that well. We only see the variations around that negative energy. What I really like about this picture is that it allows the creation of the universe from nothing without needing to posit violation of energy conservation. But I emphasize, this is not physics theory. It\u2019s the kind of speculation we physicists like to play with when we are relaxing. Some day someone might figure out how to turn it into a real theory, one that makes predictions that can be verified, but until that time, think of it as what physicists think about, not when they are working, but when they are playing.
