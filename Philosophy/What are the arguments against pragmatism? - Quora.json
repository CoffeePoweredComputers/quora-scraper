            "answer_text": "Pragmatism as practical\u2026as logical\u2026as utilitarian and the most reasoned out perspective and useful action\u2026hinges on what you see success as being. What is the goal being worked for? - Ultimately, the greatest good for the most people is hard to argue against\u2026unless your imperfections and failure to live up to the common expectation designates you as disposable and worthy of sacrifice so those who deserve to live have more space, and things to do it with\u2026as you will no longer have any use for them. Kindness is often impractical. Empathy sucks and slows us way down. Sparing feelings just furthers delusions and love abandons our own responsibility to survive, if dying would help the one we put above our self\u2026 Pragmatism is pure mind that has the heart in chains. It might make everything better, but caring ruins it again. ",
