            "answer_text": "It\u2019s important to remember that RJ starts with the accused admitting at least some involvement in the offence. Both accused and victim should have the RJ process fully explained to them, and are encouraged to think what it would be like for them and for each other, and what they hope it will be like. They may want to ask each other questions (transmitted by the facilitators - \u2018shuttle diplomacy\u2019) before they decide . (Many people think it best if the facilitators work in pairs.) Details like who will be present, seating arrangements and the order in which people come into the room are settled. Then if s/he and the victim both wish to go ahead, they come into the room, the facilitators explain the ground rules (it\u2019s voluntary, anyone is free to ask for a break or to leave, use respectful language even when expressing strong emotions, etc) and ask each person in turn a number of questions. The basic ones are: What happened, who was affected, what is needed to make things right, and who should do it. There may be supplementary questions for clarification - different facilitators have different ideas about how rigidly to keep to a script. They may ask, for example, What were you thinking at the time? What were you feeling? What was the worst moment for you? The conversation may continue with little or no input from the facilitators. There is no \u2018right\u2019 outcome - for some, the conversation itself is the outcome, others may want reparation or an apology, but this is for them to work out; the facilitators should not try to steer them towards any particular conclusion. Often there is a handshake or even a hug. Most issues of the newsletter Resolution, published by the Restorative Justice Council (restorativejustice.org.uk), contain a description of an actual case.
