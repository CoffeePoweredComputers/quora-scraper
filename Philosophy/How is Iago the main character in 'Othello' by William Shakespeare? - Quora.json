            "answer_text": "A friend was just explaining that to me some weeks ago. Othello can be seen as coming out of the tradition of revenge plays, and in a normal revenge play of Shakespeare\u2019s time the fellow who takes revenge is the main character. He announces his plans, he confides in the audience as his plans proceed, and in the end he gets his revenge. In Othello, it\u2019s Iago who does all that. Shakespeare turns the tradition on its head, though, by presenting Iago as a diabolical figure rather than as a noble one. ",

Macbeth goes crazy and murders the king and his best friend, while Macduff leads an army to stop him. Even in other literature, in Gone with the wind, Scarlett might be sometimes seen as the protagonist, but she is an antagonist and a terrible person. ",
