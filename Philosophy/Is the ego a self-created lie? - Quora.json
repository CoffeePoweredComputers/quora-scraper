            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \u201cthe ego\u201d? If the ego is a self-created lie, then what self created the lie and who is it lying to? Scientists have long since shown that our first person perspective on experience is not associated with a single brain structure. \u201cThe Ego\u201d does not refer to a physical entity. The first person perspective on experience results from the whole brain working together. And we can tell that the first person perspective is something generated by the brain on the fly - as \u201csoftware\u201d - because of the kinds of things that can disrupt it and the ways that it can be disrupted. An accurate and useful way to describe such a phenomenon is given by John Searle. The first person perspective on experience is ontologically subjective and epistemically objective - it\u2019s mode of existence is subjective but there is not doubt that it is real for you while you experience it. Of course you don\u2019t always experience it. And indeed it is possible to be conscious without a strong first person perspective on the contents of the conscious state. Unlike a hallucination or delusion, the first person perspective helps us navigate the world and interact with other people. Although again we do have another mode where we can do these things without a strong sense of first person perspective (although this is rare and sometimes pathological). ",

            "answer_text": "The ego is synthesized like fingernails or hair. Or a carapace. It's a crucial tool for communication and integration of response in a hyper-social primate like humans. But it's not a \u201cself.\u201d It has no permanence. And the arising of consciousness in the present moment can be directly witnessed, without the ego filter, without the microsecond edit we usually all add into the perception stream. The ego-self is what chops the world up into bits and makes the delusions of permanence and selves. chapter one of the Tao The Ching talks about this: Tao (The Way) that can be spoken of is not the Constant Tao. The name that can be named is not a Constant Name. Nameless, is the origin of Heaven and Earth; The named is the Mother of all things. Thus, the constant void enables one to observe the true essence. The constant being enables one to see the outward manifestations. These two come paired from the same origin.But when the essence is manifested, It has a different name. This same origin is called \u201cThe Profound Mystery.\u201d As profound the mystery as It can be, It is the Gate to the essence of all life. ",
