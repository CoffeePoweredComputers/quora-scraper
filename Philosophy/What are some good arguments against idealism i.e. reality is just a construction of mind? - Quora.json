            "answer_text": "Problems with Ontological Idealism How can two people ever perceive the same thing? Common sense demands that two students can perceive the same tree and the same Mount Everest, but ontological idealism seems to dictate that they never truly perceive the same thing, since they each have their own distinct ideas. Materialism explain it, immaterialism no. If there is no mind-independent object against which to measure my ideas, but rather my ideas help to constitute the object, then how can my ideas ever fail\u2014how is error possible? Ontological idealism push beyond common sense to the view that objects are exactly like our thinking of them. We cannot actually conceive mind-independent objects, that is, objects existing unperceived and unthought of. Why not? Simply because in order to conceive of any such things, we must ourselves be continuously conceiving them. Supposedly there are no trees when no one is there to perceive them and there is no furniture in my office when I leave and close the door. But unperceivable objects, lurking behind the scenes and continuously supporting that which we can perceive or conceive, sound a lot like the material substances which ontological idealism so emphatically rejects. Materialism explain it, immaterialism no. Why does rationality as the defining normative authority impose moral actions to yourself? You willing an end no necessarily imposes rational actions to yourself. We can act against our better judgement: We can spend on luxuries worth a month's income, we can fight to quit smoking. The normativity of coherence is merely apparent, or may be merely a standard of proper functioning without giving anyone reason to comply with it. The rationality of evaluations doesn\u2019t entail any particular conclusions about what we really do: One can be irrational without having any intentions based on false beliefs. One could fail to intend the means believed necessary for one\u2019s ends because other motivations, or one actually devalue the reward that comes later, which don\u2019t necessarily involve any false beliefs. Our ideas cannot exist in God when not perceived by us. If our ideas exist in God, then they presumably exist continuously. But God cannot literally have our ideas. Our ideas are sensory ideas and divine impassibility entails that God has no perceptual knowledge at all. Nor can our sensory ideas be copies of God's nonsensory ones. When a patient is afflicted with Alzheimer dies, can ontological idealism explain if something survive, what survive if precisely, most of his memories have already been lost? If mind survives, how does the mind have experiences similar to what you would have if the mind doesn't have a impaired brain? How is possible that after death the mind can perceive without sensory organs? Our sensory organs seems to be involved in every activity we try to describe even though we have tried to imagine a mind existing without it. If minds are immaterial and have no spatial extension, how can they be separate from other minds? It would be far from clear what the mind exactly could be if it is not identical to the common sense brain. Can ontological idealism explain what kind of a thing an immaterial substance is, such that its presence explains the unity of the mind? The problem is how to relate, say, the visual field to the auditory field, producing a unity of perception, that is, a total experience that seems to be presented to a single subject. Whether one believes in the ontological idealism's immaterial model of mind, what is the explanation of the unity of the mind? How are acts of conceptualising, attending to or willing with respect to perceptual contents to be conceived? These kinds of mental acts cannot seem possible to be treated as atomic elements in a unity. Materialism explain it, immaterialism no. Against Ontological Idealism An ontological idealist or a radical skeptic could say that we will never be warranted to choose between empirically equivalent rival theories concerning what underlies the observable reality, between common sense and a reality beguiled by an evil demon, or can say that we are brains in a vat, connected to a supercomputer, or can say that reality is just a construction of mind. The notion of empirical equivalence at play in skepticism and ontological idealism unduly neglects explanatory considerations, by defining the notion of empirical equivalence strictly in terms of hypotheses making the same predictions. Even though, by construction, the radical skeptical hypotheses or ontological idealistic hypotheses make the same predictions as the hypothesis that common sense, they are not equally good explanations of what they predict, the skeptical or idealistic hypotheses are considerably less simple. Explanatory considerations have a role in determining which inferences and theory we are licensed to make. We might be warranted in believing in just one of a number of hypotheses that all make the same predictions. We can invoke abduction in arguing against Cartesian skepticism and against ontological idealism theories. Abductive reasoning is a form of logical inference which goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the observation, ideally seeking to find the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. Abductive reasoning is inference to the best explanation (see Wikipedia). What is the Justification of Abductive Inference? At the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was discovered that the orbit of Uranus departed from the orbit as predicted on the basis of Newton's theory of universal gravitation and the auxiliary assumption that there were no further planets in the solar system. One possible explanation was that Newton's theory was false. Given its great empirical successes for centuries, that did not appear to be a very good explanation. Astronomers instead suggested by abductive reasoning that there was an eighth planet, as yet undiscovered planet in the solar system provided the best explanation of Uranus' deviating orbit. Not much later, this planet, which is now known as \u201cNeptune,\u201d was discovered. Every newly recorded successful application of abduction, like the discovery of Neptune, whose existence had been postulated on explanatory grounds, adds further support to the hypothesis that abduction is a reliable rule of inference, in the way in which every newly observed black raven adds some support to the hypothesis that all ravens are black. This type of inference is entirely familiar, frequently employed in everyday reasoning. It may be so routine and automatic that it easily goes unnoticed, as why we trust in other people's testimony: our best explanation for why a testimony asserts something is that he asserts something for duly responsible reasons. Another example: decoding utterances is a matter of inferring the best explanation of why someone said what he said in the context in which the utterance was made. We use the best explanation of a speaker's utterance whenever the content of the utterance is off-topic, or implausible, or otherwise odd or inappropriate.

            "answer_text": "The best argument against idealism is to look through Occam\u2019s Razor. The fewest assumptions are made by assessing consciousness as a subjective entity integrating with an objective world. Considering consciousness as an extrapolation of itself is not as simple as considering consciousness to be the product of a machine made to assess and interact with its environment. Consciousness is a relationship to something that is already there and this is why we are forced to live in a very specified manor. We must drink, eat, defecate, urinate, breath, sleep, etc. and being chained to this specific conceptual paradigm makes more sense as a need to integrate with an environment. It is more logical to believe an objective world\u2019s scientists are discovering stimulus response processes than it is to believe that somebody\u2019s individual consciousness is making up scientists as part of its game. The choices are 1) it is unknown why our universe is here but it is 2) our consciousness is spawned as a product of the universe 3) our consciousness has specific manifestations which can conceptually be explained as integrations with the universe. Or 1) it is unknown why our consciousness is here but it is 2) our consciousness is spawned as a product of itself 3) it is unknown why our consciousness has specific manifestations. There is no conceptual foundation for the consciousness that chains itself to this second paradigm. ",
