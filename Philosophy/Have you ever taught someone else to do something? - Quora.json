So since I was on the swim team this year, I had to teach kids how to swim as apart of fundraising for our uniforms, transportation to competitions, e.t.c. They were about 3 or 4 years old and some of them were pretty scared to go in the water. However after some coaxing and high-fives, they finally gave in and they are pretty efficient swimmers. This other time, my friend came up to me and was like I need help to pass my finals. I gave her a few tips and told her to study the stuff she doesn\u2019t know or remember. I told her if she gets really good grades on her finals, I\u2019ll treat her to coffee. Well, that motivation worked because she got really good scores and her semester grades went up. Plus, both of us got coffee so it was a win-win situation. ",

            "answer_text": "Now approaching 70, I can look back on a life of trying to teach others new skills new knowledge, new habits - I can remember teaching English (well an Australian version of it) to a new migrant Dutch boy named Bert. We met in primary school and remained friends for two years. I moved to the city when I was 11 years old. I became a student sports coach to my own team in high school when I was 15 - it helped that my dad had been a champion and he taught me the game skills of rugby football and I passed them on to my team mates. We won the schoolboys grand final two years in a row. Also in year 12 we had eight members of our school team selected in the State Schoolboys Rugby team - me included. In the same two final years of secondary school I was a platoon sergeant in the military cadets and was responsible for 3o cadets. At our graduation parade my platoon won a commendation from the inspecting Brigadier. It was not a complete surprise that I became a teacher. I also became a parent and father. Lots, lots more teaching and now at the end I realise my best lesson was to believe in myself. This was also the best lesson I was able to teach to others - for others to believe in themselves. It was true for me, my wife, by children, even my grandchildren. Along the way, many thousands of students. When they get it, their potential is unlocked. There lies true destiny. ",

My few neighbours used to beat monkeys when monkeys come to street n at house. I had forcefully asked them not to beat monkeys. We had few fights as well over this issue. But I am happy that I was succeeded. ",
