            "answer_text": "IMHO, close but no. Of course, these lists are subjective \u2013 one online roster has Bill Russell at 6, another at 35. Do you do it by raw talent, team contribution, overall skills, effect on the evolution of the game)? So, props. Hakeem won two championships, the Dream Shake was a great move. Hall of Fame. Approximately 22 points and 11 rebounds over his career. And ESPN ranks him at number 10. In no particular order, here why I would put Hakeem within my top 15, but not in the top 10. Centers: The best-of argument usually boils down to Wilt / Kareem / Russell as the top three (I am not counting George Mikan, who was the pioneering big man but not in their competitive league). I would add Shaq over Hakeem. So, that\u2019s 4. Guards: MJ, of course, and Magic. I\u2019d slide Kobe in, and, on my list, at least, Oscar. So, even leaving off Jerry \u201cthe Logo\u201d West, that\u2019s another four, for 8. And that\u2019s without all-time assist leader John Stockton, or Steph Curry coming up on the rail. Two slots left, and no forwards. Forwards: LeBron, Bird, Tim Duncan. I think Kevin Durant has shown us something. So, that\u2019s 11 or 12, without Charles Barkley. Close, but save the cigar for (older b-ball reference) Red Auerbach. ",

            "answer_text": "I know this is all subjective and I like Hakeem but a top 10 GOAT? I will say no. Hakeem was a great player. But he is often overrated by many simply because his two year run. This is not a knock on Hakeem. He was indeed a great player but he gets overrated a lot. How can a player who played EIGHTEEN good, but NEVER great, seasons, be somehow considered any more than somewhere around TENTH all-time? And by GREAT, I mean a stand-out season. Where are his 30 ppg seasons? 15 rpg seasons? .540+ FG% seasons? NEVER an extraordinary season. True, he had TWO brilliant post-season runs. And even one of those was over-rated. It\u2019s hard to overlook his eight 1st round KOs in the playoffs. His supporting cast wasn't as good as other superstars but it wasn't that bad. He had guys like Thorpe, Floyd, Smith, Maxwell, etc. They are no stars but they were good role players. Four years that I thought Hakeem would take them further.. 1)1990 playoffs where they lost to the Lakers 3-1 and Hakeem only averaged 18.5 points(and his FG was only 44%) which was the 4th best in his team. 2)1989 playoffs where they again lost 3-1 to Seattle. That year both Thorpe and Floyd had decent series against the Sonics. 3)1996 playoffs getting swept by the Sonics. No need to explain any further I'm thinking.. Yes, only 4 decent playoff runs. These are 86, 94, 95, and 97. He either lost in the first round or 2nd round(Semi-finals) the rest of his career. I can say that beyond his two year run. Hakeem did nothing that separated him from his contemporaries(Barkley, Jordan, Malone, Robinson) Before David Robinson suffered a terrible back injury that changed his career David was considered the better player. He also had a quadruple-double(like Hakeem), won league MVP, DPOY, and something Hakeem never won, a scoring title in 1994. Hakeem was great but saying he is a definitive top 10 GOAT is overrating him. I have seen some that have Hakeem rated in the top 5. That\u2019s pure revisionist history. ",
