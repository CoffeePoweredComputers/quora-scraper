            "answer_text": "Just to be sure: Those numbers are real, they are printed or displayed somewhere and you just happen to notice them more often? For this, there is a very benign explanation. First of all, our brains are designed to recognize patterns and repetitive numbers belong to the simplest patterns there are. Secondly, there is this phenomenon, which is probably a variation of cognitive bias: Ever discussed a certain topic with a friend or thought about something - just to see it pop up everywhere you go? Imagine you\u2019re looking for a laundromat and can\u2019t find one - and a few days later they seem to be on every street corner? What you observe could be something similar. Which leads me to the question: Are you still in therapy for your depression? Have you talked to your therapist about this phenomenon? At the moment, though, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. From what you write, you just notice these numbers more often than usual - but they don\u2019t \u201cthreaten you\u201d and you are not looking for their \u201csecret meaning\u201d. You\u2019re aware that this is not normal for you and you\u2019re taking steps to deal with it. And while asking Quora may not be your best option, it certainly shows the right sentiment. PS: For me it\u2019s pandas. I just happen to love these cute black and white animals and I am currently writing a book about one. Suddenly they are everywhere: In every newspaper, in every second YouTube channel etc. They have always been there. I just happen to notice them more. ",
