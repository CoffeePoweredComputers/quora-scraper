            "answer_text": "From : Pneuma - Wikipedia In Stoic philosophy, pneuma is the concept of the \"breath of life,\" a mixture of the elementsair (in motion) and fire (as warmth).

[9] In its highest form,pneuma constitutes the human soul (psych\u00ea), which is a fragment of the pneuma that is the soul of God (Zeus). As a force that structuresmatter, it exists even in inanimate objects. [10]\u201d So there's the link - we just need to consider the term consciousness as the modern equivalent to soul/psyche. ",

There are levels of consciousnesses, and if you breathe out the negative and breathe in the love you change your energy.
