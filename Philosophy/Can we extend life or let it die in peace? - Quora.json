You may want to die you may not, but, my dear, we humans have no say in this. We cannot decide the time we spend on this earth. It's your Karma that decides your destiny and time you will spend on this earth. So stop being afraid of DEATH. Leave everything to GOD, the supreme power. He knows what is best for us. Live your life to he fullest until your time to leave this earth arrives. DON'T WAIT FOR DEATH, LET IT COME AT THE TIME IT IS SUPPOSED TO. LEAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE PEACEFULLY AND BE CONTENDED. ",
