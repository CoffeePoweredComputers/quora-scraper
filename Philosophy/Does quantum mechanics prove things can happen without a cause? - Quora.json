            "answer_text": "Does quantum mechanics prove things can happen without a cause? Definitely not. Ignoring that science doesn't \u201cprove\u201d things (which is a really important point but the argument is flawed enough as it is), as you say, deterministic interpretations do exist. These may not be popular, but they are certainly possible. Theists assert everything has a cause. However, some Atheists claim radioactive decay is an indeterminate quantum event and thus uncaused. Some atheists may say that, none I've ever heard of but some might. Still, it is the theist making the claim here, and the atheist suggesting a possible violation. \u201cEverything has a cause\u201d is a positive claim. Burden of proof is on the theist. Yet the one providing evidence is the one not making the claim. If one holds to a deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics can they dismiss that claim by the Atheist. Where does quantum mechanics stand on causality. No, it is irrelevant. It casts doubt on the theist statement (that they haven't proven). The burden of proof should be on the theist - so they have to prove both that this counter example is incorrect and that the general statement is true (which is not dependent on QM).Quantum mechanics respects conservation laws, however Noether's theorem shows that energy conservation does not need to apply at the big bang, because an obvious lack of time symmetry. Clearly the big bang is special.There are a number of ideas for a cause of the big bang which do not include God.Cyclic cosmology - mostly discredited by observation, but not entirelyBig rip cosmology, in which each point in a universe becomes a new universe thanks to dark energy ripping it apartquantum fluctuations inside another universe (quantum fluctuations happen, regardless of whether you interpret it deterministically or not)Cosmological natural selectionEternal inflation (i.e. the universe has always existed, and different points randomly expand into universe throughout eternity).ekpyrotic cosmologyetc.Causality may apply now, but not at the formation of the universe. Similarly to the conservation laws. Causality can be seen as conservation of information.What about God, did that not have a cause?",

            "answer_text": "Quantum mechanics says that certain events occur with a probability and are not wholly determined. That doesn\u2019t mean they have no cause, just that they have no complete cause. For example, if you see a ball at the bottom of a hill and ask \u201cwhat caused the ball to be there?\u201d The answer is because it rolled down the hill. If you ask \u201cwhat caused the ball to be there, as opposed to another spot that is also at the bottom of the hill?\u201d, well then (if we assume non-determinism just for the sake of the analogy) there is no complete answer. Gravity caused the ball to roll to the bottom, but it didn\u2019t cause it to roll to that particular spot as opposed to another. That\u2019s why when you drop a lot of balls down a grid of spikes for them to bounce off into holes at the bottom, they land in a bell curve (named for it\u2019s shape, not the physicist I mention below). We can reliably say that each ball has such and such a chance of landing in each hole and we can predict the shape made by all the balls together. But we cannot say why any one ball landed in any particular hole (again, this makes some untrue assumptions about the macroscopic world that I ask you to accept for the sake of analogy, those assumptions hold in the quantum world). So now, moving away from this analogy, and without getting into detail, it should be noted that in Newtonian (and relativistic) mechanics, it is more or less possible to calculate the exact final position of each object given its initial conditions, this is NOT true in quantum mechanics. Those who said that quantum mechanics is or even could be considered deterministic are wrong. I have seen this from physicists making an error in philosophy and philosophers making an error in physics. They have two separate arguments and both are wrong. First, the error made by physicists, even brilliant ones like Hawking, is that because the Schrodinger Equation evolves deterministically, quantum mechanics is deterministic. No. The space of all possibilities is deterministic. Which actual result we observe is not. There is no utility to calling this determinism. This is often associated with the Many Worlds view of Quantum Mechanics. It isn\u2019t necessarily the same, but for simplicity of explanation, I will discuss it as if it were. The same logic holds even without that assumption, it\u2019s just a little harder to explain. In many worlds, you presume that every possible outcome of a quantum system happens and each time a quantum system collapses from a superposition where many contradictory things are true at once (the electron is here and there, for example) into a concrete system where you actually measure a result, the entire universe splits into one world where there was one answer and another world where there was another answer. Leaving aside the many problems with this (chiefly the probability density issues and also that it is more complex than necessary), in what way should we consider that to be deterministic? We live within a single universe within that multiverse. Our universe has evolved in random ways and will continue to do so in the future with no possibility of prediction (except probabilistic predictions), even if we knew every possibly variable. How is that different from indeterminism? Just because there are other possible worlds in which other things could have happened (and did happen in those alternate universes) doesn\u2019t mean OUR universe is determined. It doesn\u2019t help with any of the traditional reasons philosophers like to discuss determinism and so it is simply not the relevant definition of the term \u201cdeterminism.\u201d It is A definition of \u201cdeterminism\u201d but not one that matters. Second, for the physical error common among philosophers (and often physicists who don\u2019t study this particular area much): Many who study this only get as far as Bell\u2019s Theorem and Bohm\u2019s view. Rewinding a bit, Heisenberg proved that quantum mechanics has inherent indeterminism based on the variables it calculates. Einstein showed that this indeterminism violates relativity unless you have hidden variables. Bell proved that you can\u2019t have local hidden variables, in other words, any hidden variable theory would also violate relativity. Bohm came up with a hidden variable theory that was non-local. That\u2019s where most people stop. However, the problems with Bohm\u2019s view are not trivial. It is non-local, which means it violates relativity. It is inconsistent with Quantum Field Theory (a relativistic version of quantum mechanics that is the most accurate theory ever tested by people). Bell showed that you can make Bohm\u2019s view consistent with relativity, but only if you give up determinism (which of course defeats the whole purpose. But other, more advanced work by theorists and mathematicians including Kochen, Specker, and Conway have resulted in a much stronger statement. (Note that this is my view of the Conway-Kochen Free Will Theorem. Their formulation misunderstood what free will means, which isn\u2019t surprising because their expertise is in math and physics, not philosophy. For my formulation, I change nothing in their math or physics, only the philosophical analysis of it.) Their work shows that determinism in quantum mechanics is only possible if there is a grand conspiracy in which every possible set of data, no matter how unrelated or random, is correlated perfectly with any measurement that can be done on a quantum system of the type used for these experiments. Basically, the setup is that you run a huge number of trials of a different experiment very far apart from each other. You decide whether to do this or that to one particle based on a set of random numbers that can be generated any way you want (recently, someone did it by generating the numbers from information gleamed from stars whose light had not yet reached the other particle in the experiment). Then, faster than light, you do a corresponding measurement of the other particle that is too far away to have had any effect. Once you bring your results together and compare, you see that the two particles were correlated in a way that violates the predictions based on any sensible classical deterministic theory. The only way that determinism could be saved is if that light coming from the distant star which contained a random process was already correlated with what the other particle that had not yet interacted with it was going to have done once an experiment had been done to it before any of this started, as in back to the big bang. Now if you are a theist, this may not seem so far fetched. The idea that everything is pre-planned by a Supreme Being is often part of the deal. But it is worth noting that this works with ANY set of random data, whether it is digits of pi, the square root of 2, the weather, decisions of human beings, anything. All of it would have to be pre-designed to correlate to all possible results of experiments of this type that would ever be done. Otherwise, there has to be at least a little indeterminism. (BTW: If you\u2019re curious what Conway and Kochen actually said themselves, it was that \u201cif people have free will, then so do electrons\u201d. The reason being that if people have free will, then the variables that go into the experiment are freely chosen and therefore the results can be truly indeterministic, or \u201cfree\u201d. And they took human free will as an assumption. I found that to be a poor philosophical application of otherwise brilliant work.) ",

            "answer_text": "Probably. In classical physics, there is the notion of cause and effect. There is the model that if we had perfect knowledge of the particles\u2019s positions and velocities, then a correct mathematical model could predict what happens next. Quantum physics isn\u2019t like that at all. It is literally impossible to gather perfect data, we cannot ever know the position and velocity of a particle. Stuff behaves in a stochastic / probabilistic way. Rather than a rigidly deterministic way. And there are event which occur at unpredictable times, seeming for no reason. This suggests a non-deterministic, model for the cosmos at these scales. For a given input state, different output states can follow. Of course this lack of predictability could be interpreted in two ways. First is that the universe genuinely is non-deterministc. At the fundamental level, outcomes are driven by causeless events that follow the rules of probablity, but are not linked to prior events at all. Second is that we simply don\u2019t understand the mechanism. It merely looks random because we don\u2019t know the causes. Bell's theorem -, which is widely accepted, says the first model is true. The universe is genuinely non-deterministic. There is an elegant experimental test of this. Framing this in terms of theism / atheism is odd. A purely deterministic classical universe, is problematic for religion because it clearly nullifies the notion of free will, which a great deal of theology relies upon. In a universe where one moment must follow the next, then all actions and repsonsibilty derive from the initial moment. And the idea of judgement is moot. A non-determinisic universe lets God off the hook. And assuming that he does not have prescience, means that events are unfolding in real time. But non-determinism does not restore free will. Because decisions determined by random quantum events might be unpredictable but are certainly not free. ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum mechanics is causal. Modern quantum mechanics, also known as quantum field theory, is based on Einstein theory of relativity and it shows consistently how every observer, no matter how fast he moves, will conclude the same order of events as long as those events are time-like, meaning that if one event could have caused the other one, all observers would agree which is the cause and effect. Radioactive decay appears to happen without a cause if relativity is ignored. For example, beta ray decay seems to happen completely randomly. Once relativity is included, the picture changes. The neutron beta decay happens when a down quark interacts with the vacuum surrounding it and breaks into an up quark and [math]W^- [/math]particle which later decays into an electron and anti-neutrino. Our ability to predict precisely the average half lifetime of this process shows that this is not an arbitrary action. Physics also explains why bound neutrons in most atomic nuclei will never decay while other types of nuclei have a limited lifetime and therefore are radioactive. Yes, the actual decay moment of a specific free neutron is random however the wave function predicting this event is 100% deterministic. That randomness might be our ignorance or more likely the limit of our ability to observe the quantum wave itself. Despite the above I find it bothersome that religious or atheist arguments resort to the weirdness of quantum mechanics to promote their case. QM is non-intuitive because events at that minute scale cannot be explained using analogies to events we observe at the human scale. They can\u2019t prove or disprove any religious argument. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that modern (post 20th century) is mostly false. I only respect Schr\u00f6dinger equation because Schr\u00f6dinger said it describes the motion of the electron in the potential well of the proton. Others have said that the wave equation (Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s) gives the probability of finding an electron in a given location at a given time - this is where indeterminism came in. But many scientists have concluded that QM is deterministic. You mentioned radioactive decay being probabilistic. That\u2019s because probabilistic tools are used to arrive at the result but it\u2019s still deterministic. Consider the fact that nature allows half the atoms to decay in exactly one half-life which is characteristic of the radioistope. This implies that radioactivity is deterministic. Just because we don\u2019t have all the data available to us to prove that it\u2019s deterministic, doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t. Similarly, just because the probability of finding an electron is used to plot orbitals doesn\u2019t mean that electrons don\u2019t revolve around the nucleus. I also differ with the mainstream on the structure of nucleons: they claim they\u2019re made of quarks and I claim they\u2019re made of positrons and electrons. I\u2019m glad you brought in radioactivity because that\u2019s where my theory shines. The quark structure of the nucleons means that no elctrons or positrons exist inside the nucleus. So to explain beta decay, they invented the weak force to enable some quarks to change flavour and emit an electron or positron. Because my theory states that the electrons and positrons are already in the nucleus via the nucleons, the electron or positron is expelled from the nucleus and this only happens when there are too many neutrons or too many positrons in the nucleus. Another decay mode when there are too many protons, is electron capture. Before I describe it from my theory\u2019s point of view, let me describe how a nucleus is formed; when a proton and a neutron combine to form a nucleus, they do so via their orbitals forming nuclear orbitals like atoms form molecular orbitals when atoms combine i.e. via the electromagnetic force. This means that the nucleus has a negatively charged envelope which keeps the shell electrons from entering the nucleus due to electron degeneracy pressure. But, when the attractive force is strong enough, it overcomes the electron degeneracy pressure and enters the nucleus into the nuclear orbital where it roams freely. It also reduces the positive charge on the nucleus so that it reduces the chances of another electron getting captured. In mainstream theory, the captured electron\u2019s character is destroyed, but it\u2019s reinstated by the emitted electron neutrino. Sounds like sloppy science to me. In my theory, the captured electron\u2019s character is NOT destroyed and the neutrino probably serves a different purpose like balancing the angular momentum. Furthermore, the expelled electron or positron are emitted with high speeds. What gives it that speed? In my theory, the electrostatic repulsion which imparts an acceleration. Does the weak force impart the necessary acceleration onto the emitted particles? If so, how? You see, mainstream explanations of events are disjointed because they\u2019re \u2018epicycles\u2019 to a false theory. So, scientists are not in a position to say what is probabilistic and what\u2019s deterministic when they come up with jumbled up theories that are counter-intuitive and then say that nature itself is counter-intuitive. Richard Feynman accused nature of being \u2018absurd\u2019. He\u2019s right, because QM, that\u2019s used to describe it, is absurd - nature isn\u2019t. ",

I say that because it is based on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and as far as I am aware, no physicist has ever shown that to be false. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is quite deterministic; if you know psi, you know it under any change of circumstances. The problem generally is there is no agreement on what psi means. Now the Uncertainty Principle means you can never know certain variables precisely (although I would argue you can in principle know the action, which determines the phase change per period of the wave) but that does not deny causality. The argument about radioactive decay is spurious. In a chemical reaction, the reaction of a specific molecule is statistically determined, but it has a precise cause. The statistics apply because we cannot know when that cause will apply because th system is too complicated. Radioactive decay follows the same equation as first order kinetics. Just because we may not understand nuclear decay, that does not mean there is no cause. Theism or atheism is irrelevant. Surely you do not believe a God is overseeing and manipulating every particle in the Universe? ",

How can this be? Well, first we have to understand where \u2018cause\u2019 comes from. Cause comes from life. Life needs cause to exist. Life creates cause and effect to exist. Physics, and quantum physics are dead. Every living thing works - lives, grows, reproduces, and evolves by creating and using \u2019cause and effect\u2019. A living cell somehow causes it\u2019s internal processes to maintain themselves. If it fails to \u2018cause\u2019 life to carry on, it dies, and the cell line dies out. The definition of life is something that can \u2018cause\u2019 things to happen successfully. Without life, things happen without cause. They just happen. Without life, there are no causes, and no effects. Cells actively monitor and maintain their internal environments, and make use of their external environments by creating and using the concept of cause and effect. But it\u2019s not so simple. As the number of cells grows, they form communities. Living cells, in communities, compete with each other. But to become more successful, communities of cells discover cooperation. They create reasons to cooperate - be-cause it helps them to survive, and thrive, and reproduce and evolve. When cells learn to cooperate - a higher level cause and effect emerges. And the result is living tissues. Living tissues have higher level causes than single cells. And higher level effects. Living tissues can and do choose to sacrifice some cells - at the bleeding edge of the tissue, for the good of the tissue. Living cells cannot rise to this \u2019cause and effect\u2019 level. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Living tissues compete with each other, but\u2026 It doesn\u2019t take long for living tissues to learn to cooperate. When living tissues learn to cooperate, they create higher level entities, like lichen, and fungi, that have higher levels of cause and effect. Lichen and fungi survive and grow and thrive and evolve when living tissues learn to use cause and effect to cooperate. Living things like lichen and fungi can eat and out-compete simpler living things - like simple cells and tissues. And then, fairly quickly and easily, living tissues segregate. They learn (through competitive evolutionary processes) to cooperate even more. They form into limbs, and organs, and more complex bodies. These limbs have different causes, and cause different effects. The organs have more complex causes, and more complex effects. It\u2019s easy to see what comes next. Limbs and organs - that are in the same body, at first competing for attention - learn to cooperate with each other, to create and use new levels of cause and effect. They create systems of limbs, and coordination of limbs. They create systems of organs, that cooperate and effectively use cause and effect together - in ways that no single cell, no single tissue, no single limb or organ could use cause and effect. They take cause and effect up another level. The complexity of the body rises as limbs and organs develop, as we get plants, and then animals. The complexity of cause and effect rises as the complexity of life rises. The organs don\u2019t stop at digesting and excreting food, they also develop senses. They turn the plant\u2019s leaves towards the sun, for better gathering of energy, without eyes. Gradually, tissues and organs work together to create more powerful sensory organs. A nervous system - another organ - develops to allow these many sensory organs and limbs to cooperate at a higher level, based on what is sensed in the environment. Nervous systems don\u2019t just sense. They soon learn to calculate and to anticipate. Not just to use cause and effect, but to predict the effect they will have. To make more conscious, more effective choices. The sensory systems and the nervous systems develop spirit and mind. The mind and the spirit emerge from the competition and cooperation of sensory systems and organ systems. Their causes and effects rise above the direct causes and effects of the sensory systems and sensory organs. They learn to anticipate and plan cause and effect as well. Every plant and every animal is a hierarchy of cause and effect. Quantum physics is still dead. But living plants and animals enable and use cause and effect at the cellular level, at the higher tissue level, at the higher limb and organ levels. Eventually, we get to humans. Humans take cause and effect to another level, the competition and cooperation of humans. We use cause and effect to create language and to communicate (and to lie). We even use language and communications to ask philosophical questions about \u2019cause and effect\u2019 as if they exist in physics, without life. When we do that, we\u2019ve missed the point. Without life, there is no such thing as cause and no such thing as effect. That might seem strange. But let\u2019s take a trivial example. Let\u2019s suppose that a huge rock is travelling through space. And another larger rock is also travelling through space. And they attempt to travel through the same space at the same time. They crash, and one damages the other - and one destroys the other. Which one was the cause? We can raise our view to an abstract level, and suggest that the collision was caused by those rocks \u2018attempting to travel into the same space at the same time\u2019. But they were not \u2018attempting\u2019 anything. They just were. On the other hand, we can add life, to change the view of cause and effect. If rock #1 is dead, and rock #2 is the Earth, we might say that Rock #1, or the collision of rock #1 caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. But if rock #1 is a spaceship, and rock #2 is dead, we might say that Rock #2 caused the death of everyone on the spaceship. In truth, in physics, and in quantum physics, there was no \u2018cause\u2019. Cause only exists when life makes a judgement. ",

            "answer_text": "The time of a radioactive decay is uncaused in the precise mathematical sense that, if it has not decayed at a time t, then it\u2019s probability of decaying in the next small time increment, dt, is just some constant (the decay rate for that atom) times dt. It is independent of the time t so it can\u2019t be modeled by any deterministic process, it is a stochastic process called a Poisson process. There are arguments that this depends on there being a device that detects the decay and so long as there is no detector the state of the atom is a superposition of decayed and not-decayed, which inspired the example of Schroedinger\u2019s cat. Determinism of a kind can be saved by saying that when the detector detects the decay, this means the wave function of the Schrodinger equation of the atom+detector has split into orthogonal parts which represent separate universes - the one where you are an you\u2019ve seen the detector fire and infinitely many other ones with different copies of you which see the detector as not having fired or having fired earlier. This gets around the randomness at the expense of having many copies of \u201cyou\u201d and the apparent randomness that each one observes just arises because \u201cyou\u201d don\u2019t know which one \u201cyou\u201d will be. This goes by the term \u201cfirst person indeterminancy\u201d in the multiple worlds interpretation. The only other way to maintain determinism in quantum mechanics is superdeterminism due to t\u2019Hooft. This is the idea that everything, including which experiment you will chose to do is already fixed at the beginning of the world and it is fixed to give the appearance of obeying the consistent randomness quantum mechanics predicts. This is somewhat like the idea that God just created the world a moment ago with fossils and photons and everything else perfectly mimicking the world as though it were 13.8 billion years old. Note that \u201cuncaused\u201d and \u201crandom\u201d are ambiguous. Radioactive decay is caused in a sense by the availability of a nuclear state with lower energy. But that doesn\u2019t mean the time of decay can\u2019t be random. ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum mechanics does not have a single stand on causality. Interpretations of quantum mechanics . It takes various different stands, either explicitly or implicitly. Many physicists are not particularly concerned about interpretations of QM but only with the hardcore math, which is the same regardless of the interpretation one subscribes to. The equations are used to make predictions, not the interpretations. What physicists are agreed on, for the most part, is the invariance of the speed of light. This invariance is built into the special theory of relativity. This means that if one does believe in causality, which most physicists do, then the cause of an event must be located at a distance from that event no greater than that light is able to traverse to enable a cause-effect relationship to exist. This says nothing about whether causality does or does not exist. It says only that if causality exists then certain space-time relationships must also exist. This gets into the arguments about locality versus non-locality and all their repercussions. Bell\u2019s theorem addresses these issues. The truth of the matter is that we don\u2019t yet know the whole truth about the nature of space-time. The fact that indeterminate events occur also has nothing to do with causality. What is indeterminate could be either causal or non-causal. Indeterminate simply means we do not know. What is so difficult about admitting ignorance? ",

In the Copenhagen interpretation, quantum mechanics only predicts the probability of events, and so radioactive decay has a certain probability of occurring in a given time interval. So in this interpretation quantum mechanics just tell you what possibilities there are and the probabilities of each. On the other hand, the newer Many Worlds interpretation says that all the possible outcomes actually occur. you can think of them occurring in parallel universes if you like. In that case, the equations that tell us how the universe changes with time are completely deterministic. An interesting corollary of the Many Worlds interpretation is the Anthropic Principle. This says that there is a sort of natural selection for the parallel universes, because the ones that evolve in a way that would preclude the existence of intelligent life will never be observed, and this effectively increases the probability of intelligent life existing.

Just because we\u2019re unable to find out some fundamental details about the movement of particles, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re unable to know them in principle. I\u2019m not sure what this has to do with theism, however. As stated, i\u2019m an atheist. I - and many other atheists, i\u2019m sure - find determinism to be entirely compatible with my worldview.
