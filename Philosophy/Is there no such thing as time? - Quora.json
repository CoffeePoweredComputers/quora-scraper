            "answer_text": "Of course there is. Time is probably more real than space, and a scalar, so without using a starting point,, because time is never zero, the Universe passes through that point and reveals itself in practice. Make time a thing you never can grasp completely. and give yourself permission not to \u201cget it.\u201d There is nothing else like a book to pursue a comprehensive treatment, and nearly every topic has a book like that.

            "answer_text": "Who has time for questions like this! Lol. Practically speaking, I think time is a concept we cannot do without. The very idea of motion requires it. I am not a physicist, though. I am, however, currently rereading Carlo Rovelli\u2019s The Order of Time. It is an excellent read, in which he seems to be suggesting that our perception of time might be better understood from a psychological rather than a physical point of view. I don\u2019t understand everything he is trying to say, particularly how Boltzmann\u2019s understanding of entropy removes the distinction between future and past. He says it is because of a kind of blurring, but I just don\u2019t get it. I recommend the book, though, as a starting point for understanding this question. : -) ",
