            "answer_text": "Actual paradoxes: \u201cparadoxes\u201d. Just look them up. There are many examples. Each example of a paradox is a paradox, and paradoxes are an invention of philosophy. A paradox to philosophy is like irony to literature, but more complex. It is almost like a math problem, but that won't help. They are traditional or new problems which are ironic, difficult, contradicting themselves. For example, a shoe that won't tie itself is like a stupid paradox. The real ones are more respected, although sometimes they sound stupid and are not. It helps to know that philosophers are sometimes seen as respectable fools. But not really fools, wise men who act like fools. A paradox is one of the most philosophical things, like having an unsolvable problem that you are honestly-honorably concerned about. People respect you (traditionally) for being concerned with the problem, but they don't talk about it. They just say \u201che's being philosophical\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s incomprehensible\u201d something like that. Many of the most famous paradoxes are actually thousands of years old, grom the time of Zeno of Elea, who wrote 40 pages of them. It was a long time before anyone tried to be more prolific. A version of Zeno: Paradoxes of Zeno The closest example I could find from my own work is: Problems and Solutions ",
