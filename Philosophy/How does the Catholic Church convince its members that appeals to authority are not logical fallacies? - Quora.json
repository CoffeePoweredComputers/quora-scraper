            "answer_text": "Appeals to authority are not inherently fallacious. Being asked a question on theology and citing St. Thomas Aquinas as a support for your argument, for example, is not fallacious as he would be an authority that has real expertise in the area. So, to answer your question, they don\u2019t really need to. But I feel like this question is more loaded than people are willing to admit\u2026 I see clearly something behind this question. Do you? Let's tackle the claim that Catholic adherence is, above all, illogical or based on fallacy. I. First and foremost, many arguments purporting to depict Catholic faith or Catholic perseverance as illogical are often fallacious. The arguments are made presupposing that Jesus is not real, that His sacraments are not efficacious, that faith is inherently irrational. The first two points are important, because if you begin to try and argue why Catholic faith is bogus from a place where\u2026 Catholic faith is bogus, you clearly do not get anywhere. No matter what. If troubled Catholics look for help from the sacraments, from prayer, from the clergy, but those sources of help are already deemed to be fake or non-legitimate then there really isn\u2019t a meaningful conclusion to be had. You have to start from one of two places. One, the basics are assumed true in which case your argument aims to point out a weakness or contradiction which, if successful, would be significant and yes, deserves to be made. You could then send mail to your local Archdiocese and maybe finish that PhD in philosophy or theology you were probably doing. Two, there are no assumptions made about the truth or untruth of these religious principles. You would probably then have to work at disproving the Catholic tenets. The thing is, nobody really does a good job of that around here. Saying, \u201cthere isn\u2019t enough evidence to believe\u201d is already setting the standard of belief such that it is presupposed to be more reasonable to not believe than it is to believe. This brings us to the third point mentioned above, that it is often assumed that is inherently irrational or unreasonable. This is wrong. If it were the case then it would be unreasonable to accept anything that doesn\u2019t have irrefutable proof available and known to the individual making a decision. You have a big problem, and you confide in your mother. You have faith in your mom that she won\u2019t go out of her way to divulge your personal problems to the neighbors or that she won\u2019t go out of her way to make things harder for you. You don\u2019t have any proof; you have evidence, observations, and a predisposition to trust your mother. Seeing as nobody\u2019s taking a time machine to the future to evaluate how your mother handled things, you don\u2019t have proof. Only faith based on evidence. Conflating faith with blindness or an unwillingness to consider evidence is itself a fallacy and has no place in intelligent discussion about faith, religion, and truth. II. Secondly, many people mistakenly believe that Church teachings and Church principles are made without credible attempts at being logical. Yes, many papal documents in the end are meant to be sources of authority. But often contained therein and about are many arguments and explanations that lift Catholic teaching above and beyond authoritative statement. Have you read Theology of the Body? How about anything Thomist? Do you know why St. Thomas\u2019 theses are important? Have you done the due diligence in reading Catholic works to really say, \u201cCatholic teachings are merely unsupported opinions, enforced under the guise of heavenly authority?\u201d III. Thirdly, I\u2019d like to talk about my own experience. I converted to the Church from a state of atheism. I had no interest in becoming Catholic. I didn\u2019t like that Catholic values were in clear opposition to my own reasoned values. I didn\u2019t see how believing in some god made any of these values truly appropriate for modern life. Somebody very close to me was and is Catholic. For over 3 years we \u201cagreed to disagree.\u201d In year 4, as I became more serious about marriage and a long(er) term relationship, I decided to do my due diligence in figuring out exactly what the hell this Catholic thing was really about. At the very least I can understand better the place where this person comes from. I owed it. I converted in large part because I found the Church and her teachings to be reasonable, acceptable, and observable in my own life. I read. I thought. I compared. I lived and experienced. I chose to become Catholic after all of that. My adherence contains faith, logic, and reason. It is based on evidence, although not \u201cproof.\u201d I hope this answer was informative. Places on the internet seem to turn into echo chambers where people, believing themselves to be reasonable and logical, allow themselves to fall into fallacy en masse. You are given the right to disagree, but sometimes it helps to take a closer, rational look at what\u2019s really going on. ",

            "answer_text": "They don't really need to. This is a bigger question than it may seem, and requires some diving into the operation of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is not founded upon logical arguments to gain and keep members. While of course there are logical Catholics (FYI my mum is Catholic), the reasons for people staying with or joining Catholicism are almost entirely emotional. Like most Christian sects, the main reasons for people joining The Catholic Church are: Being raised as a catholic (parents are catholic)Seeking forgiveness or recompense for bad deeds (real or perceived)Seeking comfort against death or in strifeLoneliness or a desire to belongThe Catholic Church manages to appeal to the latter three groups very well, and due to long running stances on birth control maximises the first. While most of the methods used: promise of eternal happiness; close knit community with strong in group identity; simple process of joining; etc. are all pretty simple, they are also incredibly efficient. Once someone is a catholic, it is immensely hard to leave (there's a joke that goes \u2018if a good catholic joins the Taliban then they become a bad catholic\u2019). The famous \u2018Catholic guilt\u2019 is possibly the most effective method, as any questions against the church or Christianity are usually buried by those that have them out of guilt and fear. Confession serves as another important method for ensuring those questioning stay within the church, as the at risk members can be focused on and reassured or guilted into staying. There are a million methods besides this, including several forms of subliminal control (including, but not limited to, the repetition of key phrases, the use of songs and chants, and even the habit forming caused by the consistency of when mass occurs). If someone is insistent upon logic, then it can be provided. Arguments such as Pascal's wager, the cosmological argument, and others can be employed. Without access to known counter arguments (a lot Catholics almost exclusively are close with other Catholics, especially in counties like Ireland, and would be encouraged by the church not to speak about their crisis of faith to those outside the church), these will seemingly be superior to the argument against the use of logical fallacies made by the person having doubts. Note: at this point you may believe this is an attack against the Catholic Church, it is not. Almost all religions, as well as other institutions such as militaries, schools, and even counties employ the exact same tactics. Now, to get to the main question, here's how it is likely to go down: A catholic gets thinking and realises that a lot of the church is based on appeals to authority, which makes it seem illogical. Realising these negative thoughts are \u2018bad\u2019, they try to suppress them. In the event they are too strong to keep away, they turn to their priest. The priest offers seemingly logical counter arguments, and reassures the person that the way to salvation is through Catholicism. While this person may have doubts again, they want to believe, and fear the social and emotional repercussions of leaving the church. Thus, they satisfy themselves with the arguments given by the priest. This is even assuming they can detect the appeal to authority as a logical fallacy in the first place. It's one of the, if not the hardest one to spot. After all, we believe scientists when they say the earth is round, we believe chefs when they tell us how to cook, we believe doctors when they tell us what is healthy, why shouldn't one believe priests when they tell us about God? And indeed, surely we should believe the omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God when he tells us anything, as he supersedes all. Believe this answer, Jake Williams said it, it must be true. ",

Saying \u201cthe six days should be taken as symbolic of much longer periods of time, because the Catholic Church, given an OT exegetics crash course by Jesus, said so in 1994\u201d is however a fallacy; you prove that there are innumerable bishops and writers between the Apostles and 1994 who have taken the six days as symbols of longer periods first, else you might want to reconsider if Wojtyla and Ratzinger in 1994 really represented the Catholic Church.

The Catholic Church is based on the bible, and was, in synthesis alongside the Orthodox Church, the first and only true total Christian faith. If there were any authority that has the right to define what the bible is, what it means and how it should be interpreted, why would it not be the very people who wrote the bible and defined Christianity? In this case, appeals to authority are valid. The bible, and the real-world aspects of Christianity, are not automatically able to be understood. Thus, just as an author discussing a book they wrote is considered authoritative and beyond challenge, so too is the authority of the Catholic Church maintained. It is one of the two churches that have existed since the time of Jesus Christ, and thus may define all of the parameters that make up Christ\u2019s proper church. ",
