            "answer_text": "One of the major theses of quantum mechanics is that the major features of the universe (space, time, energy, etc.) are not continuous as classical and relativistic physics suggest, but rather come in discrete units (quanta). Assuming that the universe is in fact infinite in extent (about which quantum theory is silent), it must have the structure of the integers (in each dimension). Thus, Godel's theorems apply directly, giving the result that there are facts about the universe that cannot be derived within the mathematical system that we're using to model it. But in practice, this really doesn't matter, as the whole universe is too big to model using the techniques of quantum theory anyway. Practical application of quantum mechanics involves small, finite subsystems of the universe, such as single molecules. The incompleteness theorems do not apply to such finite systems. The linked article in L. Davis\u2019s answer is an interesting mathematical result concerning a problem in physics, but the math involved has nothing to do with Godel's theorems. ",
