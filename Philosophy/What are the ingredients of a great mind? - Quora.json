            "answer_text": "Thanks for the answer. However I don\u2019t mean it exactly like that. I will try to explain. Let\u2019s say every person has his own hardware, his mind! The hardware can be good or can be bad. If it is good you have the potential to be smart if it is bad you don\u2019t. By smart I mean IQ. I know that there are various forms of intelligence. And someone might be an amazing painter but he may can\u2019t even speak and socialize. So in order to help, let\u2019s say that the person we are picturing in order to analyze what the ingredients of a great mind are, is someone like Tony Stark on the hardware level! So as a fact you have the perfect hardware. Let\u2019s talk now about the software! What ingredients, on the very basic level, would someone need on the software side to be like that? What you would work on the very basic level in order to build strong foundations? If you where able to go on a machine and jack up some characteristics what would they be in order to be like that? I would put on the machine: Clear Thinking: The step-by-step reasoning. Good thought process.Memory: for obvious reasonsImagination: in order to combine different memories to produce opinions and smart ideasEmotional Control: for good decision making, minimum stressConfidence: Firstly because we can say on the very basic level that confidence is the opposite of fear since when you don\u2019t feel confident the core is fear on something. Secondly because is the most important ingredient in order to tie everything up and externalize our thoughts, ideas and actions.I try to figure out some staff so it doesn\u2019t mean that what I am saying is correct but by reading the above you may grasp what I am trying to say and help with your opinions!
