            "answer_text": "Determinism is planning a course of action and ensuring that it is followed through. freedom is the ability to alter or discontinue with the pre-determined plan. As far as I\u2019m aware Determinism is the state where every action one takes - In fact every movement of the universe has been pre-determined by something. You reading, or not reading this sentence has been decided at the dawn of time. freedom is the ability to make choices and move one way or the other. The problem is; how does one prove that your free choice was not in fact predetermined? Because your upbringing, environment, learned beliefs are what drives your choices and behaviours. And those states and experiences themselves arose and were determined by inter generational ideologies and forces, that are themselves determined by preexisting states and attitudes, that in turn arose from the environment and available resources\u2026 ad infinitum - to the instant of creation. Nietzsche\u2019s idea of the eternal recurrence shocked him profoundly. That the universe is set on \u2018Repeat\u2018 continuously. That we are destined to relive our history and our lives exactly as they are - for eternity. For a man such as he who lived through a sort of emotional (as well as physical torture), it was a horror to contemplate.

            "answer_text": "Causal determinism has a clear definition: every event has a cause. Freedom has multiple definitions. Some people claim that determinism and freedom are incompatible. In any case, they are different types of concepts, so do not need to be differentiated from each other. ",
