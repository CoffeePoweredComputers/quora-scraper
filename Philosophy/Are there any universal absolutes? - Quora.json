            "answer_text": "No idea (number, form or meaning) can exist apart from the capacity to Know it. No idea can ever change, for if it did it would be a different idea and not the idea it is. Every idea takes its meaning by reference to other ideas that take their meaning by reference to still more ideas that together form the set of all ideas. Knowing-all-ideas is an attribute of Consciousness. Awareness of Knowing-specific-ideas arises as the ideas are imaged via sensations (colours, feelings, odours, flavours and sounds). Elephant! Until the image of the word appeared was there any Awareness of Knowing or not-Knowing the idea associated with the word? Plainly, the meaning is not in the image, for otherwise it would be impossible to experience illiteracy. Plainly, the idea is in the Knowing\u2026 in Consciousness. Sensing-sensations and Knowing-ideas is Awareness, which is One with Consciousness. Consciousness is Awareness (this Sensing-sensations [colours, odours, flavours, feelings, and sounds] and Knowing-ideas [number, form and meaning]) with the Power to manifest sensory images that accord with ideas to create the momentary ever-changing appearance of \u2018my body\u2019 and \u2018my thoughts\u2019 and \u2018my feelings\u2019 and \u2018my surroundings\u2019 within Awareness\u2026 that together tell the story of \u2018my life\u2019 (whichever person I now appear to be). These are absolute truths\u2026 though the words that express them are truly meaningless. They are like signposts to a waterfall. To recognise the indescribable reality that they reference, One must look to where they point. Where they point is \u2018out of this page\u2019 (to this Awareness that perceives the apparent words and all else now apparent) and back to the appearances that are inseparable from this Awareness in which everything appears. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Look straight ahead. Notice the visual field appears like a circle with an indefinite edge. Without moving the head or eyes, notice that \u2018beyond\u2019 the \u2018edge\u2019 is neither black nor white\u2026 simply nothing. Notice no body is apparent. Now \u2018look down\u2019. Notice that only the front of the torso and limbs are apparent (distorted by the \u2018laws of perspective\u2019)\u2026 but no head. Where the \u2018head\u2019 should be, the whole world appears (or at least that bit perceivable from the perspective of the person One appears to be). This is called the \u2018Single Eye of God\u2019. It is the Eye of Consciousness\u2019\u2026 the only Eye there is. Everything that appears in it is an illusion\u2026 coloured images appearing to be \u2018things\u2019 and \u2018events\u2019\u2026 as in a dream. See for yourself: Hold the thumb close to the eye. Notice it appears to be orders of magnitude larger than things Known to be bigger than it. A thing that is really smaller than other things cannot also be larger than them\u2026 it can only appear so. Such appearance can only be an illusion. Or, stand looking along a straight road. Notice the edges appear to converge towards the horizon. A thing that is apparently converging cannot be a thing that is parallel. It can only appear so as the idea of \u2018parallel\u2019 is associated with the \u2018converging image\u2019. Consciousness is ever unchanging\u2026 all change is apparent only. This is the absolute universal unchanging truth. ",

Quantum mechanics touches the veil through its discovery that everything is a function of probability. That which is behind the veil animating Probability is Possibility. ",

All of science is based on inductive logic. Not a single Universal claim of science can be true. An absolute statement cannot be made about entities that are in a constant state of change. ",
