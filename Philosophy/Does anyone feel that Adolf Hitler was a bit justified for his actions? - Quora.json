(Context: I am an American Jew, but I have no familial connections to the Holocaust\u2014my relatives had left Europe long before). Why? I put it this way: if you took America, and subjected us to a treaty which, while arguably fair, was certainly harsh and well-designed to cripple our economy; put us into two extreme depressions in rapid succession; sold us a lot of propaganda about how our military had been betrayed in a war we should have won; crippled our military; and threw in an existing, and common at the time, prejudice; what do you think would happen? We\u2019d go to war is what would happen (and we\u2019re not exactly known for placing nice as it is\u2026 see Vietnam, Iraq). Oh, and judging by our track record with the Japanese (the American ones, I mean)\u2014we\u2019d probably also have a Holocaust. So, while Germany\u2019s actions were clearly abhorrent, they were, I think, little different from what many countries at the time would have done under similar conditions. Actually, put it this way: Donald Trump stands a viable chance at getting elected, with an alarmingly fascist and nationalist platform, under circumstances far less extreme than what Germany faced. I rest my case (that an angry populace easily turns to fascism\u2014I\u2019m not saying Donald Trump\u2019s America would be fascist). Note: I am not saying that Trump in practice would be fascist, and it is his followers I am referring to, not him (stands a viable chance at being elected, not just running). However, many of his statements\u2014more to the point, many of the statements supported by a concerning number of Americans\u2014include aspects which are authoritarian, populist and nationalist, i.e., fascist.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. The only possible justification was the Versailles Treaty. And Hitler used it because it was so unpopular with the German people. Even some non-Germans saw it as too punitive. There were some including important figures outside of Germany who also saw it as too punitive. There are, however, some important aspects to remember. As Clemenceau said after World War I , \u201cBelgium did not invade Germany.\u201dAspects of German policy was to impose upon others what they claimed was unfair. Notice the terms the Germans imposed upon France after the Franco-Prussian War. Some of the very same actions they objected to when imposed upon Germany. Franco Prussian War - impactActually the Versailles Treaty was MILD compared with the peace the Germans imposed upon the Russians (1918)\u2014the treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918). Again the Germans did not really objects to the terms, the only problem with Versailles was that it was imposed upon Germany. They wanted to do the imposing.http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww1/misc/ww1-bl.htmlGermany objected to Germans being ruled by non-Germans while at the same time in the east, Poles were being ruled by Germans. And the Austrians were a small minority in the Austrian/Austro-Hungarian Empire. The only German majority area detached permanently was the Sudetenland (former Austrian territory) and Danzig (turned into an international city). Versailles called for a series of referendums where the locl population decided on their future. The problem for the Germans was that they were a minority, so most of the referenda went against them. What the Germans wanted was special rules for themselves and the right to rule other people. .Compare German World War I occupation say in Belgium to Allied occupation. The German Army in Belgium seized the food supply and left the Belgians to starve. This was only prevented when America stepped in to feed Belgium. The very limited occupation after Versailles meant that the Allies arrived with food.Germany food shortagesWorld War I Versilles Peace Treaty ",

            "answer_text": "Hitler was not a German nationalist and did not care about Germany, He was an Austrian moving to Germany at the outbreak of World War I. When he died at his own hand in 1945 he told the German nation - in no uncertain terms - that he condemned them to total destruction for having disappointed him endlessly. He certainly did not love Germany. As somebody who could not love himself (he subsconsciously knew that he was inferior in Adler\u00b4s inferiority complex fashion and hadto overcompensate with lies) love (also patriotism) had left his life for good. Versailles was a curse that he could and did use for his self-aggrangizement and overcompensation purposes. France especially had used Versailles to revenge herself on Germany for the victory of 1871. Germany\u00b4s (Wilhelm II\u00b4s) stupidities and greed had contributed to the outbreak of World War I. But there was no sole culpability for a war that was a powder keg of imperial controversies and conflagrations that just needed a tiny spark to explode. Versailles was unfair and its reparations broke the back of post-Wilhelm II Germany and tainted whatever real democracy the Weimar Republic had established, The cultural blossoming of Weimar Germany was astonishing and impressive but could be wiped away by a countermovement far too easily. Versailles had established Weimar Germany but had not cared about guardians and sound development principles. Hitler was the proverbial confidence-trickster - the carpet bagger, quack physician, fraudster and mobster: a con-man. So he invented an Aryan identity that never existed and found stupid Germans in search of an aristocracy of the genetic endowment (Wilhelm II had deserted Germany for his Dutch exile after 1918). Then he hooked on what could be called a Warfare Keynesianism: Run up deficits to restart the industrial machine of a well-industrialized nation. When the deficits loom large start a war so that the victims of German expansion pay for the deficit you have accrued. All this was not genius, foresight or planning. It was a con-man\u00b4s ability to use the moment for his self-aggrandizement plans. The little man wanting to be \u00dcBERMENSCH (superman) only had to find a congregation who believed his Big Man lies (\u201cI am strength personified!\u201d). Masses believing in Big Man lies in actual fact make little men larger than life and do not understand that they have made the F\u00dcHRER (leader, conducator) themselves. They adore a mirage they themselves have created by abdicating all wills of their own, all reason and integrity. Hitler was illogical, ignorant, immoral and a total disaster. That he fooled the Germans and the great Western democracies and the Eastern democracy turned evil in the Kremlin was not genius but gambler\u00b4s luck. In 1918, in 1945 and in 1990 there were regime changes: get rid of totalitarian rule and the sunrise of democracy will come about inevitably. Well, history teaches us that things do not work like that. Regime changes (say \u201cGet rid of the establishment in Washington, Silicon Valley, Hollywood and academia and the nation of little people belittled beyond belief will wake up in patriotic grandeur. Just trust in your military and in your prophets of grandeur! It is all a matter of confidence - trick or treat!) are totally over-rated. To answer the question briefly. Hitler spotted some real problems and developed a certain logic. But he was wrong in principle and totally disinterested in truth. (Why should I search for truth when I can achieve power more easily with half-truths and outright lies.) He felt contempt for the audiences he addressed. He thought they were despicably gulllible and \u201cfeminine\u201d (weibisch) in their readiness to be manipulated by his verbal tricks. Con-men are not interested in the fabric of reality but in the fabrication of reality. Give me your confidence and I\u00b4ll use it for my own purposes. ",

It was a very ill-conceived idea and was kind of a dumb thing to try and do. To separate East Prussia from the main part of Germany and then deny them access expect by the sea was nothing less than a continued taunt that they had lost the First World War. Yes, Poland needed sea access, but there were SO many other ways to go about doing it rather than take the corridor from Germany and then make it so difficult for the Germans to have land access to East Prussia. Now, with that said, invading Poland to get it back was not the answer, not the answer at all, since that action started World War II. ",

Incidentally, Hitler was not responsible for the creation of the final solution Himler was, but Himlers orginal plan was the repatriation of Jews to Palestine. He even had a special commemorative medal struck (one side swastika other side star of David).
