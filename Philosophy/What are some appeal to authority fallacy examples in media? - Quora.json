            "answer_text": "This is actually being actively misunderstood, including possibly in the answers here so far. An \u201cappeal to authority\u201d is only a fallacy, when the authority is not actually an authority at all. Therefore, believing that Climate Change is a serious concern that we need to address is NOT an example of \u201cappeal to authority fallacy.\u201d In fact, much of the opposition to it has presented the more classic \u201cappeal to authority fallacies,\u201d since opponents are so selective about which \u201cauthorities\u201d that they choose as the true experts, ignoring a majority of the people who ACTUALLY have expertise in the area of study. Perhaps that\u2019s what the person referring to them really meant to say. I hope it was. Anyway, whoever said that an appeal to authority is not fallacious in and of itself , is correct. It is the insistent misuse of authority, especially of false authority, that is fallacious. If you want to go through a list of the thousands of horrendous manipulations and deceptions currently being perpetrated on us all by people with political or personal agendas, we could do that. However, don\u2019t get carried away by the urge to declare ANY use of an authority in a suspect argument, to be an example of \u201cappeal to authority fallacy.\u201d Most are not. Some examples which would certainly qualify, are instances where someone quotes (or more commonly falsely quotes) some revered figure from History, as supporting their own thinking, and calls for you to support them in turn, out of respect for that long deceased Wise Person. Some popular anti-gun control law examples, include quotes of famous enemies of the past, such as claiming that Admiral Yamamoto, in world war two, said that \"You cannot invade mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass.\" This is quoted as support for the fantasy that it is private gun ownership that is the primary protection we have from being invaded by a foreign power. However, in addition to the fact that Yamamoto never said any such thing, there are ample examples of nations with plenty of private gun ownership being invaded many times, without the invading army having any concern whatsoever about the privately owned firearms. The main thing to watch for, in order to tell when someone is trying to use authority in a fallacious way to support their arguments, is when they cite the authority with the specific purpose of getting you to DENY CONTRADICTORY, BUT OBVIOUSLY REAL FACTUAL INFORMATION.

            "answer_text": "Examples of the \u201cappeal to authority\u201d fallacy in the media are many. They include climate change, rogue waves, the diving reflex, the risk of worsening hurricanes, vitamin minimum daily requirements, the health risks of smoking, high cholesterol diets, and many many more. Keep in mind that an appeal to authority is not, in and of itself, a fallacy. This form of argument can be valid when the purported authority does, in fact, have an undisputed body of objective evidence that supports a given position. Also, the media\u2019s role in perpetuating \u201cappeal to authority\u201d fallacies is probably due to little more than their attempt to keep the various issues simple enough for their readers to easily grasp. Overwhelming readers with piles of complex data to substantiate claims and assertions is generally not helpful. Keep it simple. So, the media provides us with shorthand versions of the facts, such as, \u201cThe majority of experts agree\u2026\u201d, \u201cNine out of ten doctors recommend\u2026\u201d , and my personal favorite, \u201cIt has been widely reported that\u2026\u201d. I saw one politician chuckling over how easy it was to dupe the media by simply leaking a fabricated story - which would then be picked up by other media outlets, until, eventually, the media could rightly state, \u201cIt has been widely reported that\u2026\u201d. And public perception is shaped by an underlying assumption that any \u201cfacts\u201d that are widely reported must be true, because, as we all know, reporters diligently check their facts before releasing anything. Right. For example, it took decades and untold needless \u201cdrowning\u201d deaths before the diving reflex (a physiological response to immersion in cold water that slows the heart and decreases the need for oxygen) was generally acknowledged as an exception to the authoritative position that humans cannot survive without oxygen for more than six minutes or so. Over time, a growing body of evidence demonstrated that people could survive after being submerged in cold water - in some cases, for as long as 30 minutes, followed by no pulse or respiration for up to 2 hours. Gradually, the evidence for the diving reflex was sufficient to replace the older expert knowledge. And, of course, the media eventually bowed to the new authoritative position. Unfortunately, it takes time and effort to check out every \u201cappeal to authority\u201d claim made in the media. Most of us don\u2019t have that time and are not inclined to make the effort. Ans, so, the \u201cappeal to authority\u201d fallacy is likely to plague us for a long time to come. ",
