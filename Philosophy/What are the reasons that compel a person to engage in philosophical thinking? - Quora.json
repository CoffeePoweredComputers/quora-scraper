            "answer_text": "Everyone engages in Philosophical thinking. It's a matter of whether or not they do it well. It's a skill. It's like driving, most everyone does it, some do it better than others, and for different reasons/rewards. There are universal rewards to it though as there are universal rewards to learning or mastering any skill. One reward is that you are less likely to be manipulated or persuaded, bullied or intimidated. For example, most people start with a truth in their first premise which makes you more likely to believe their second premise. It is in the second premise where most arguments become irrational or lies. You feel less guilty about the choices you make and whatever the consequences may be of your actions. Ideally, you observe the alternatives and the consequences of all other possibilities, and you choose the best one you can. You're less perfectionistic because you understand (ideally) that because of chaos and ignorance there is no perfect decision, but there are many better and worse decisions. You are more able to and willing to recognize your own mistakes because you are striving for truth more than happiness. You're able to be happier with the problems you have because you better understand the problems others have. You can evaluate risk and reward more accurately. You tend to ask better questions. You're able to exhibit more self-control because you can better predict the outcomes of each action, choice or event, which will provide you more certainty and control in your life. Honestly Philosophical and Critical thinking used to be what Universities and most forms of education focused on until the industrial revolution happened. Wonder why\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is in your question\u2014REASON. But the terms PERSON and COMPELS are what makes this question controversial\u2026and interesting! Socrates said to Theaetetus, \u201cPhilosophy begins in wonder\u201d (155c) and that would be a great answer. But, children wonder and many educators are quick to point out that adults lose that sense of mental inquisitiveness as they grow older. But wonder is not endlessly asking questions\u2014as anyone who spends time around children has discovered\u2026\u201dAre we there yet?\u201d Likewise, chimpanzees (non-persons) are rather curious beings too, are they not? Humans are often compared to them as sharing a high percentage of genetics (there are remarkable similarities), but a significant discovery is found by simply asking, \u201cHow are We Different?\u201d After all, no ape claimed that \u2018philosophy begins in wonder\u2019 so being a PERSON is necessary for philosophical thinking!  But children don\u2019t simply ask questions, do they? They INQUIRE. Whatever obstacle that grows to this human feature as persons age is the moat educators are trying to bridge. Here\u2019s an example of childhood reasoning: Children wish to know the logistics of Santa Claus\u2019 yearly pilgrimage. How are all the toys made? How does he know what each child wants? How does he know if all the children have been good or bad? How does Santa fit down a chimney? How does he do this all in one night? It doesn\u2019t matter if this is fantasy. That feature of reasoning could easily become: Why do developed countries have greater economies than developing countries? How could these developing countries compete on a global market? Who determines what \u2018they\u2019 need? What role does political stability (or ethical and just laws) play in determining economic growth? Where and how would they gather both resources and training for development to achieve fruition? How does one humanely meet the present needs, as growth will not occur over night? Now there could be multiple reasons for such reasoning to occur. Perhaps there are less than altruistic motives for such grand endeavors, such as notoriety, exploitation, etc. But that wouldn\u2019t explain the actions of all, which often reach beyond benevolence to being sacrificial. Now, note that there\u2019s a distinction between what is natural in the human person as in an inclined act that seeks truth and goodness, and what is natural for a human person to do, as in an autonomous act that seeks advantage and self-interest. For example, there are few who would argue that many people often seek their own advantage and interest\u2026colloquially some would say that\u2019s natural (hello Hobbes). But some would also rightly claim that to seek truth and goodness are in the human person\u2019s nature, even if at times that is misguided or entangled in other drives (hello Aquinas). So, this truth (just note everyone seeks the \u2018good\u2019, be it a perceived or genuine good\u2014the former is simply selfishness) is a primary inclination of the human person (not so with chimps by the way)\u2026and when coupled with mankind\u2019s social nature, COMPELS her or him to pursue all those \u2018goods\u2019 for the developing counties, even and often if it comes at great personal sacrifice.  This does require you to agree that the human person has an immutable nature with an inclination towards truth and the good\u2026and today that is CONTROVERSIAL!! But if you do and can add to this compelling nature the aforementioned quality of personhood, you have the reason for philosophical thinking\u2026that ought to make you WONDER! ",
