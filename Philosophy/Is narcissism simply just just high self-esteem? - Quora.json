            "answer_text": "No. It is a pathological, psychological, unfounded belief in one's own perfection. It includes a total lack of empathy, an inability to comprehend that other people have needs and feelings. It also entails a pathological need to control everyone and everything around one, and the belief that other people only exist to provide for one's own needs. The narcissist believes laws and rules only apply to other people, that such restrictions do not apply to themselves. Narcissists firmly believe that whatever they do is fine, because they are the ones doing it. Narcissists also require someone else to always take all responsibility and blame away from them. And they require adoration and adulation from everyone. Anyone who does not think as highly of the narcissist as the narcissist thinks of himself or herself is defective in the narcissist's opinion. It is not high self-esteem, but the opposite. Narcissists are extremely insecure. This is why they require others to build them up constantly. ",

            "answer_text": "I have unintentionally un-masked quite a few narcissists over my lifetime. I mistook an arrogant attitude for high self-esteem, or self-confidence. Over time, I realized what I thought was \u201chigh self-esteem\u201d was really a mask that hid grandiosity, defiance, and arrogance, which people often mistake for confidence, as I did. Hidden underneath this mask of confidence is actually low self-esteem. Sure enough, while studying narcissism, many authors and experts document that narcissists are insecure people who are always on the look out for what\u2019s known as \u201cnarcissistic supply\u201d. Narcissistic supply is provided by people who praise, and enable, the narcissist\u2019s toxic behavior. The narcissist and the enabler form a magnetic co-dependent relationship\u2026because their deficient personalities attract each other like a magnet. Each has what the other needs, or lacks. This magnetic-type relationship becomes very difficult for each to break free from. The co-dependent needs someone to take care of, because they lack self-esteem, or self-love. This has been termed \u2018self-love deficit disorder\u2019, or SLDD \u2026 source: Ross Rosenberg in The Human Magnet Syndrome: The Codependent Narcissist Trap. Updated edit on 4\u201323\u20132019: It has come to my attention that the term \u2018codependent\u2019 is also synonymous with the term \u2018empath\u2019 in these instances. Codependents and empaths have many of the same personality traits. End of edit. The narcissist is the perfect candidate for the co-dependent\u2019s \u201ccare\u201d, because they have a toxic need to be taken care of\u2026.meaning they want people who are like a \u201cgroupie\u201d, or a \u201cYes Man\u201d, who caters to their every whim. As long as the narcissist wears the narcissistic mask to hide their real feelings and personality, they appear to have high self-esteem. However, when the codependent enabler begins to set boundaries with the narcissist, the mask eventually comes off. The true personality of the narcissist is revealed and that can become frightening. The rage of a narcissist is highly toxic and damaging to the people around them. The narcissist\u2019s mask of false high self-esteem and false confidence begins to melt and the narcissist\u2019s toxic personality is revealed, or un-masked. ",
