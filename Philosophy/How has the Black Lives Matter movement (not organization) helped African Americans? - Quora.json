We\u2019ve lost Uncle Ben\u2019s rice, Aunt Jemima pancake mix, and Mrs. Butterworth\u2019s pancake syrup. \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is printed as legal graffiti on public streets and NBA basketball courts. Confederate statues have been torn down. Christopher Columbus statues have been torn down. Even statues of 19th century abolitionists have been defaced. Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant. And AOC is calling for the removal of a priest who saved Hawai\u2019i from leprosy because he was a white dude. The Washington Redskins, which was seen as a thing of \u201cpride\u201d for most native Americans, has been scrubbed. Streets and high schools renamed. To what end? Racism is a thing of an evil heart. What has helped American blacks? Conservative policies which have led to the best economic situation in decades, if not ever. #BLEXIT.  ",

            "answer_text": "The Black Lives Matter movement has galvanized the anger and frustration that people of color have in this country with regards to their treatment by law enforcement, and by many white people. While the treatment, in general, may not be as brutal, or crude as it was 60 years ago, attitudes and stereotypes still exist that one would have thought would have become rare by now. BLM is putting that anger and frustration into protest, ideas, and action. If we continue to ignore what they are saying to us, if we continue to be dismissive or condescending about what they tell us, then that action will intensify. ",

White people in my neighborhood have BLM lawn signs. Does that help black people? I doubt it but I\u2019m white so can\u2019t speak with authority. ",

It started with an acknowledgment that they have a problem. The chairman of the board then met with the black leadership in the company and heard our comments. Next, senior leadership laid out about seven changes as a start and committed to more. This was a couple months ago. Now, we\u2019ll need to see if the commitments materialize. That will take time. I hope they do. ",
