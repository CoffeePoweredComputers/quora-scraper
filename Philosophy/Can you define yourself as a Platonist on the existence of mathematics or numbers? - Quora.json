            "answer_text": "I looked through a list of philosophies of mathematics (Philosophy of mathematics - Wikipedia) and Intuitionism came the closest to my view. For the most part, I don't care about the underlying reality of mathematics. I care about when can I use mathematics and when would particular mathematics lead me astray. Math does not need to be real if it helps me understand the real. I like the theory that geometry grew out of surveying land in ancient Egypt. The Nile River flooded every year, leaving silt on the land that maintained its fertility but messing up the boundaries between different plots of land. The Eygptians had to renew those boundaries every year. They could not use stones that could be moved by the flood. They could not use streams that could diverted by the flood. They had to use immobile landmarks and distances. They could stretch out ropes in straight lines to measure the distances, and thus had a practical use for straight lines. Straight lines made clearer boundaries between different plots than wavy or bent lines, so they would use straight boundaries. They could also use circular curves, since that could be measured by a rope, too. Counting occurred even earlier. Humans like to be fair, and dividing quanities evenly is a significant part of fairness. If six harvesters of a village gather 32 apples, then they see that they can give 5 apples to each harvester, with 2 left over to be given based on other factors besides the evenness of the split. Such sophisticated manipulation of quantities would create all the details of arithmetics: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication. The granaries of Bablyon led to methods of writing down numbers for inventory. Practicality created mathematics. It does not need to exist except to be used. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of Platonism. Mathematical Platonism is the form of realism that suggests that mathematical entities are abstract, have no spatiotemporal or causal properties, and are eternal and unchanging. This is often claimed to be the view most people have of numbers.\u2014Philosophy of mathematics - Wikipedia In that sense I am, like \u201cmost people,\u201d quite definitely a \u201cmathematical platonist.\u201d Can you define yourself as a Platonist on the existence of mathematics or numbers?
