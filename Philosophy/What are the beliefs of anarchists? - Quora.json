            "answer_text": "An anarchist is someone who believes that the burden of proof lies upon those who claim hierarchical privileges for themselves or others, and if they cannot justify their claim of hierarchical privilege to the satisfaction of those it is claimed upon, that claim is illegitimate and it\u2019s application should be abolished. That is to say that if someone claims to be your King, your boss, or anyone else who holds power over you, they must justify this to your satsifaction. And if they cannot, or wont, their position is illegitimate and should be opposed. Through this philosophy, anarchists hold a couple of default opinions: Opposition towards state.A state can not, and will not, justify it\u2019s position to the satisfaction of everyone it is claimed upon, and is therefore opposed by default.Opposition towards capitalism.Capitalists can not, and will not, justify their claims of private ownership to all those that it\u2019s practised upon, and is therefore opposed by default.If an individual owner of non-personal property has to justify their claim of ownership, that ownership would by definition be social (socialist), not private (capitalist)There are capitalists who have taken it upon themselves to declare themselves anarchists, however as the founder of their ideology eventually confessed; \u201d[capitalists] are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical.\u201d[1]Opposition towards organized religion.Organized religion relies upon indoctrination of children, and submission to religious figureheads. Through this it is incompatible with the philosophy of anarchism, and is therefore opposed by default.Footnotes[1] Are Libertarians \"Anarchists\"? | Murray N. Rothbard",

            "answer_text": "The four most prevalent definitions are: No rules. This is the characterization offered by the authoritarian media (and usually celebrated by oppressed teens feeling the promise of their adulthood for the first time.)No leaders. This is the no hierarchical definition \u2014 that everyone is equal. It usually requires discussion around whether it is wise to eschew leadership due to character or competence (e.g., leadership from doctors or engineers)No rulers: This definition means that no one has life and death ownership control over your body, whether he wears a crown, or was chosen by the Volcano God, or his name came out of a ballot box.No unchosen rulers: This definition inserts the idea that rulers may exist, but that for someone to be the ruler over your body, you must individually consent to it. (No one may consent for you.) Left anarchists usually mean #2, but apply it narrowly to business management. Anarcho-capitalists usually mean #3, to emphasize that each person has full ownership over her own body and that no one \u2014 not even a ruler \u2014 has a superior ownership of her. Voluntaryists usually mean #4, to emphasize that one could, by exercising her own full ownership over her body, voluntarily consent to submit to a ruler. Authoritarians usually mean #1, to try to poison the well away from any consideration that maybe their rulers are not necessary. By conflating rules with rulers, they hope that you can only imagine chaos and death were you inclined to send their rulers packing.  Unfortunately the use of quite different definitions for the same word make for quite confused discussions where everyone is talking past one another. :(  See Related: 0788: What are the relative sizes of the various libertarian segments? 1180: Why is anarchy impossible in a civil society? 0943: Are all libertarians anarchists? 1235: Is an \u201cAnCap\" a type of libertarian? 0572: Are anarcho-capitalism and voluntaryism the same? 1092: Is voluntaryism the same as anarchy? 1178: Why don't anarchists move to stateless societies to live their dream? 0482: Why is anarchy misunderstood as chaos?  \u2192 More essays on <Voluntaryism, Anarcho-Capitalism, and Anarchy> by Dennis \u2192 Return to the <Table of Contents> for Dennis\u2019 Libertarian Essays <, Voluntaryism,> ",
