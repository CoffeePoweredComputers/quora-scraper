            "answer_text": "If a human being can describe a methodology to solve a problem, then that same human being can write some code which solves the same problem. At this moment in time, what we lack is a generalized machine solution which can autonomously ingest the problem space and derive a solution all by itself. There are reasons why this has not been done yet. But there is no particular reason to think it cannot be done. Roger Penrose is a mathematician who believes there are things his mighty mathematician brain can do which cannot be done by a Turing-machine style computer. He argues that Godel's theorem proves this\u2014although his argument seems weak. For Penrose then has to answer: How can a brain made of meat do things that a machine made out of semiconductors cannot? Is meat magic? Penrose backs away from a supernatural solution, instead suggesting that some spooky quantum physical phenomena are involved in brain computation. Of course, if that were the case, there'd be nothing to stop Intel from adding quantum microtubulin-enhanced processors to their next-generation line-up. ",

For a human to solve an undecidable problem they would have to offer a proof for the general case, we know they can\u2019t do that because the problem is known to be undecidable because there is already a proof that it is.

I think that in principle it should be possible: just stick the locations of all the atoms in some brain into the computer and run the laws of physics! It should work, right? And if this should be possible, then clearly whatever a human brain can do, a Turing machine can also do (albeit probably a lot slower!) So, what do you think? Can a Turing machine simulate a human brain? ",
