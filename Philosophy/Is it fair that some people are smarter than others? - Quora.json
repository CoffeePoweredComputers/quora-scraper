            "answer_text": "The question can be considered nonsense because \"fair\" and \"unfair\" apply only to the behavior of moral agents as they are moral judgments. The universe is not a moral agent, thus it cannot be categorized in the terms \"fair\" and \"unfair\". So no, nobody should be handicapped as there isn't even any basis for it. And, as has been mentioned here by several others, if you DUMB everyone down, then everyone is just that: dumb, and now NOBODY can create any advancement. To make the question make sense, you'd have to evidence a claim that the universe is some form of moral agent, which would mean showing the universe has a consciousness. It doesn't. Or, you have to evidence or advance a claim that the universe is this way due to the actions of such a moral agent. If you believe in a God, you could then ask whether or not it was \"fair\" for God to make a universe that way. But this depends on what you think of God, since nobody can prove or refute any claims as to the nature of God, or even whether or not a God exists (at best, you can eliminate some possibilities -- such as the \"miracles-on-command\" God some people wish is out there, but not all, and in the \"proof\" direction, no scientific test has affirmed the existence of a God, and even if we found something that might, how do we know it could not some day be explained naturalistically?). You should consult with the texts of whatever religion you believe in for guidance on this matter, if that happens to be the case. If you're an atheist, then obviously such God-talk is irrelevant to you and there is no need to pursue it further. Also, for social-related issues, this seems from my experience to be a better solution: Rather than handicapping the smart, or otherwise trying to equalize the capacities of people, we should instead work on creating a less-EVIL world, which means we need to work on changing and standardizing new global cultural values, norms, and social structures which will permit the full and complete development of whatever capacities individuals have. It is not a tragedy that someone was born with less \"intelligence genetics\" than someone else. It IS a tragedy when someone with better \"intelligence genetics\" does not get to DEVELOP that intelligence to its full potential due to failings of the world, such as to provide an adequate educational environment, or so that the parents' cultural values are such that they received adequate discipline and parental involvement in their education. \"Genius\" is at least as much VERY HARD WORK as it is genetics. (I wish I really understood this in my youth years. I don't know if my genetics were the greatest, or \"genius\" level but I know that had I understood this, I could've been MUCH further ahead of where I am now than I am at this point in time) The East Asian cultures -- China, Korea, and Japan -- get the discipline and parental involvement in education down better than the West does, and it's no surprise that they hit the top spots on international educational rankings. They also have an overall culture which values that kind of thing. Hopefully, with the rise of China as a major world power, we may see more of that cultural influence invade the West and other areas which need it. On the other hand, the Western culture does seem to emphasize creativity more. Perhaps, then, what we need is for a fusion of these two types of values to occur, emphasizing education and discipline, but doing so in a way which also allows for creativity. In short: what we need to do is make the world which IS indisputably under the control of moral agents, moral agents we have power over, that is, the world of the culture and decisions made by US HUMANS, fair. That world is not fair yet we can make it so, or try to approximate fairness, anyways. ",

            "answer_text": "The smartest people are the ones that make technological and social advancements that benefit all members of society. To handicap them would also handicap those members of society with average and below-average intelligence.  Think about it - would the average person really be better off if we reduced the abilities of medical researchers to make discoveries that improve public health? (I see that the question has been edited - it was originally more focused on the idea of handicapping smart people. To address the question more directly: No, it's not fair that some people are smarter than others. It's also not fair that some people are physically stronger than others, better looking than others, taller than others, more charismatic than others, or more socially adapted than others. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and it's better to allow everyone to play to their strengths rather than attempt to even things out so that everyone is at the same level of weakness) ",
