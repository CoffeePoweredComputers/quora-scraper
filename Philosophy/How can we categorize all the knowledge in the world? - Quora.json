            "answer_text": "We can\u2019t categorize all knowledge in the world, because we don\u2019t have access to it all. For example, it sometimes seems that you can find anything by running an internet search. But in fact many scholarly sources are not indexed publicly, so they will never show up in a search. Similarly, a significant portion of human knowledge is not stored in any form that can be indexed or accessed by others. We have oral traditions still that have yet to be recorded, and of course there is a massive amount of personal experience that is never shared. Businesses often have proprietary databases with knowledge of their own processes, discoveries, and research that are not open to the public at all. Since we can\u2019t find it all, I\u2019d say we can\u2019t categorize it all. Your question would be clearer if it asked \u201chow can we organize available information so that it maximizes accuracy, efficiency, and relevance of searches\u201d for example, but I\u2019m not sure if that is what you meant. Ultimately, how you categorize anything depends on how you want to use it. You probably have some experience with this at home, on your own bookshelves. I organize mine by language first, then subject, because it helps me find the book I want when I want it. With electronic storage of information, we have the opportunity to change how we categorize relatively easily. Library information science is concerned with this question because it aims to deliver accurate, relevant knowledge as efficiently as possible. The development of this area of information science is ongoing and tremendously important. Many methods are being used to improve it, such as collecting data on how people search and how satisfied they are with the results. Deep learning algorithms are being applied to massive data sets to discover and index relevant relationships. The level of organization, and the categorization process that it relies on, would have been impossible without the invention of computers, and its current complexity is a challenge which draws on the top computer scientists in the world. To understand the current state of the art, you may want to reference Google\u2019s story (How Search Works). ",

            "answer_text": "Categorisation of knowledge? God! It\u2019s an insurmountable task by itself; how did you ever conceive such a notion? I can tell you about an easy categorisation, you can categorise knowledge into three categories - (1) Knowledge that makes you earthly richer / opulent. (2) Knowledge that makes you spiritually richer. (3) Knowledge that strives to understand the nature of earthly things that could lead to understanding of spirituality, i.e. somewhere in the realm of higher sciences like relativity, anti-matter etc\u2026. I can\u2019t come up with any other plausible ways to categorise knowledge, because that would be like counting the exact number of stars in our universe and sorting their names alphabetically. To categorise all the knowledge, you first need to know all the knowledge, which is impossible, because knowledge is like entropy, ever-increasing and unique to each organism. As such, the above categorisation might be the broadest way to come up with such a categorisation. ",
