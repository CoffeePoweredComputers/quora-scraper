When we ban these things, burn these things, tear these things down, history, good or bad, is lost to us. If we forget or deny our history, if we refuse to teach real history, history as it really happened, If we refuse to teach history at all, we are doomed to repeat it. We are doomed to fall prey to anarchists. ",
