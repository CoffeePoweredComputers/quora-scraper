            "answer_text": "Early in his adult life, Jung proclaimed: \u201cKant is my philosopher\u201d. When he was in his psychiatric residency he had hardly any free time and said in frustration: \u201cThe only time I have to read Kant is on Sundays\u201d. So Jung took Kant very seriously. Kant proposed innate categories of experience (among them: time, space, and causality). This means that we can never know the true properties of objects because we always see them through the prism of these categories of perception and cognition. However, it is only through knowledge that we receive from our senses (material/empirical knowledge) that we can begin to move towards cumulative knowledge. Inner experiences (and hence all of metaphysics) were excluded from the domain of our quest for knowledge. Kant did believe that there was a \u201cspiritual world\u201d that was always present in the background of our being; it\u2019s just that we can't know anything about it from our experience. Likewise Kant believed there is a God, but we can\u2019t know about God directly. Part of Kant\u2019s objective was to shear away the cloud of occultism and esotericism that hung over the emerging scientific enlightenment but without giving up on religion and descending into nihilism and meaninglessness. Jung was of course quite taken with Kant\u2019s notion of \u201cinnate categories of experience\u201d. He fully embraced the opposition to John Locke\u2019s proposition that the mind is a blank slate at birth. He extended and added a new dimension to the Kantian notion of formative and form-making patterns preexisting in the mind by eventually proposing innate patterns of imagination, i.e., the archetypes of the collective unconscious. In proposing this, many felt that Jung was flirting again with metaphysical notions. Freud, in particular, believed that Jung\u2019s thinking, was descending back into \u201cthe black tide of the occult\u201d. This resulted in the abrupt and permanent severance of their relationship. Jung\u2019s development of the idea of archetypes did in fact revive the reality of spiritual experience, but Jung considered his investigation of these experiences to be psychological rather than otherworldly. We might say that Jung replaced Kant\u2019s background of the spiritual world that we can\u2019t know anything about with the archetypes of the collective unconscious that we can know something about. He continually insisted that his psychology had nothing to do with metaphysics. Jung was quite offended by any suggestion that he was a mystic, and always insisted that he was purely an objective scientist. The truth is that he was was somewhere in between. To get at the subtlety of this debate we have to ponder really hard about the limits of the domain of science and what we mean by the word \u201cmysticism\u201d. Kant\u2019s critique of pure reason, and his exclusion of metaphysical or intra-psychic epiphany, left a gaping void in the question of morals. If we are only to rely on our limited reason, derived from our inherently constrained sensory experience, then how are we to distinguish right from wrong? What about the question of values and the meaning of life? Kant\u2019s solution (and I am guilty of radical simplification here) was to propose that we rationally conceive of a community of ends. This would be an idealized community of beings existing in the spiritual world where every member contributed to the betterment of every other member based upon the near universal religious principle (\u201cdo unto others\u2026\u201d), which Kant presumed to be a rational principle of communal behavior. This is a rational image of a moral ideal to strive for. Moral guidelines (Kant\u2019s \u201ccategorical imperatives\u201d) are deduced from this image. Note here that the religious imperative of faith is replaced by a rational ideal resulting in effectively the same moral prescription. So for Kant there is an ideal image of a heterogeneous community of human beings with diverse tendencies coordinating into a coherent and synergistic whole based upon the rational goal of a community of ends. By holding fast to this ideal of our participation in and commitment to this community of ends we are able to make rational moral decisions. It is noteworthy that Kant did believe in a spiritual world, which is where this rational and speculative community of ends is located (given the absence of space and time the word \u201clocated\u201d isn\u2019t quite right) ; yet he insisted that we could not have any legitimate or credible experience of this spiritual world. This is how Kant dealt with the problem of morals and meaning and that is why is he is referred to as an \u201cIdealist\u201d philosopher. Jung believed that morality was innate in human beings, and he believed that the individual psyche itself was a plurality (it could even be said to be a community of personified beings). At any moment the fragments of our individual psyches are more or less dissociated from one another but the process of growth is a movement towards wholeness. One could I suppose call it an implicate psychological propensity towards a harmonious community of ends. The psychological objective (the meaning of life) was inclusiveness and involves the process of transcending opposing tendencies of the psyche (conscious/unconscious; masculine/feminine; shadow/persona; etc.) moving towards the distinctiveness and wholeness of each individual human being. Jung\u2019s word for this developmental process in \u201cindividuation\u201d. Individuation mandates a movement away from the collective and the socially normative but eventually involves the imperative to contribute to the enrichment of culture. This \u201cindividuation\u201d is a concept that was used repeatedly by Schopenhauer. Discovering Schopenhauer was revelatory for Jung. This notion of reconciliation of opposites is more Hegelian than Kantian. Jung was also a proponent of the radical empiricism (phenomenology) and pragmatism of William James, the great American psychologist and philosopher. Jung certainly embraced the essential idea of James that an inner experience (e.g., a religious experience) could be considered phenomenologically real and could be validated by the effect that the experience has on a person. In doing so, Jung was straying far from Kant. It also is clear that Jung\u2019s psychological ideas are partly derived and/or inspired by Goethe, Nietzsche, and the neoplatonists. For Jung, Kant\u2019s voice was a particularly strong one in a diverse philosophical chorus. ",

            "answer_text": "Jung was certainly influenced by Kant, although he had other philosophical influences as well and calling him \u201ca Kantian\u201d may be considered too simplistic. There is most obviously a resemblance between the Kantian \u201ccategories\u201d (the concepts integral to the understanding as it grapples with the outside world) and the Jungian \u201carchetypes\u201d (the images and patterns derived from the collective unconscious of our species). The archetypes too, are integral to human understanding \u2014 filters through which unknowable stuff passes to become knowable and indeed known. ",
