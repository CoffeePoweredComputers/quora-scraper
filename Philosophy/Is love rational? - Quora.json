            "answer_text": "You are lucky if you fell in love.Love is a reminder. You will see that you really do not want to be next to the girl you love. You want it, but that's not the end,everything is not reaching her. Then you will see that, in fact, that was not the girl who you loved.  You will see that she didn't and could not deserve that your real love. She is not to be loved, not in that quality, no one can be. Then, the real question comes, who were you in love with, she was only a meaningful thing to remind you of your loving capability, you noticed your capacity of loving ? Did you learn now learn who you really loved, and do you see that by being reminded of your loving capability you have been given a big credit thinking that most humans die before even loving once. Enjoy this real love. Love is rational but it is much more than rationality. ",

            "answer_text": "Dr. Who said  \"love is not an emotion it is a promise\"This is completely rational.It encompasses the love between family and friends.Love defined as the passion between sexual partners is irrational.This is emotional and physiological and nothing to do with reason.It is animalistic and natural and we try to find reason for it because as humans we have convinced ourselves that we base our decisions on reason but most of our decisions are instinctive and we rationalise them in order to convince ourselves that we are in control.
