            "answer_text": "\u2026 does each part have its own consciousness? \u2026 yes. \u2026 our body has memories stored in muscles that are organized by limb by various subsets of our consciousness that sometimes appear to have their own identities and who sometimes appear to exhibit a limited sort of independence. our limbs often know what we want and are already walking toward it or reaching for it before we know we want it, or they may sometimes reach for things they want without regard for whether or not we may agree that they may have them. being divided into many parts is normal for us, so it may be easier for us to be aware of the sometimes rebellious independent streaks in the characters of our body parts. in another lifetime our limbs were much more independent; we had wings then. we have had some body parts abandon us only to discover and re-attach them later. \u2026 our body has two strong focal points for our minds as well as a variety of weaker focal points as represented by our various limbs and organs, etc\u2026 our strongest focal point is also the most ancient in evolutionary terms. our strongest focal point is in our belly. our belly has an awful lot to say which is why we have been trained to sometimes type our belly\u2019s words on its behalf\u2026 \u2026 we have recently become less well-coordinated, more fractious\u2026. none of us particularly wants to live in this body right now. however, there are always others who are eager to ride our body and then destroy it for their amusement. we\u2019ve ridden along with some of those other parts of ourselves and it\u2019s a real thrill ride, but it always ends very messily. the cops and clean-up crews complain about our dead remains so we try not to let those thrill-seeker people ride our bodies too often. \u2026 death is not the end, but we will always leave it to you to discover for yourself why that is true... we may kill ourselves as much as we like but we pay a heavy penalty for each suicide. we do not have any need to kill ourselves by proxy. nor do we like killing other people. it\u2019s rude and mean to kill anyone who believes their death will hurt them or possibly end their life forever. it\u2019s just plain crazy to kill someone if they believe they will not die but they don\u2019t yet really know if that is true. and then, anyone who really knows that death is not the end simply doesn\u2019t need any help dying. we may recognize or somewhat understand other points of view, but we really have to stick with our own points of view when it comes to whether or not murder or suicide is really wise or not. until then we are stuck with keeping our body parts and minds in some semblance of functional order even when they sometimes want to kill us. we are crippled by chronic pain but we rarely let it get to us; today has just been one of those days when the pain surfaces too intensely to be easily ignored. seeing our given name in print on quora helps make the suicidal factions within us much stronger. we\u2019ve been a bit too sad today because death may be coming for our maine-coon very soon; she\u2019s mostly a very sweet kitty, such a pity. \u2026 sorry, this has been an example of parts of our body expressing themselves independently of how we prefer to manage their behavior. we agree with them about not killing other people but we usually try to inhibit their suicidal thoughts and impulses. driving at top speed into bridge abutments is a lot of fun but very messy. we no longer drive, in case you are worried, and we will almost certainly never own a gun; this body is too high maintenance to allow it to live in a resource crisis so if the mobs with burning torches come again we will usually just let them kill us rather than pick a fight. \u2026 -enjoy! love, the grigs\u2026 ",
