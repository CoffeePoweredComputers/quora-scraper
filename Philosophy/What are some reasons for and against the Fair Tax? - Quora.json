            "answer_text": "First, a primer on the Fair Tax: The Fair Tax's primary objective is to reduce the cost basis for manufacturing products in the US, without compromising our labor and environmental laws or reducing minimum wage. It does this by removing all taxes - Payroll, Income, Capital Gains, etc - from the entire production supply chain in the US, from mining of raw materials to assembly of finished product, and placing an equivalent tax on the finished product at its final point of sale. Its intent is to be revenue neutral, not to reduce the tax burden or govt tax revenues, merely to shift them. One thing most economists agree on is that you should tax consumption not income, and \u201cbads\u201d not \u201cgoods\u201d. The Fair Tax attempts to do this by shifting the tax burden from production to consumption and reducing the tax burden on the \u201cgood\u201d of real wealth creation via manufacturing. For example, if you look at the supply chain for a US-made car, and assume for the purpose of illustration that it is 100% Made In USA, this is what it looks like: Raw materials mined from the ground. Mining company subjected to Payroll, Income, Cap-Gains, tax/compliance-related fees, etc.Raw materials transported by trucking company to processing facility (steel mill, chemical plant, etc). Transport company subjected to Payroll, Income, Cap-gains, etc.Raw materials converted into base products (milled, rolled steel, processed chemicals, etc.). Processing plant taxed again all of the above.Processed materials transported to parts factories, trucking company fully taxed.Processed materials made into parts (car doors, chasis, engine blocks, rubber tires, etc). Parts company fully taxed.Parts transported to final assembly, trucking company fully taxed.Final assembly occurs at car factory, car maker fully taxed.Car transported to dealership, trucking company fully taxed.Dealership sells car. Dealership fully taxed with Payroll, Income, Cap-Gains, etc. taxes.You can visualize that supply chain as an interconnected web of nodes and links (or edges in a mathematical graph), where every processing point is a node and every transportation route is an edge. In our current tax system, every node and edge throughout that entire web is subject to the same taxes, over and over again, so that every finished product is taxed many times before it reaches the final point of sale. This goes way beyond mere double taxation. The Fair Tax sums all those taxes throughout the supply chain graph and determines that 23% of the final cost of the car is due purely to Federal taxes and associated fees. So if the car sells for $100, then $23 of that was due to taxes. The Fair Tax refers to these as Embedded Taxes, meaning taxes embedded throughout the production process, that are passed on to the consumer in the final sale price of the finished product. It then eliminates all embedded taxes and replaces them with a single, equivalent point-of-sale tax on the finished product only. So without the $23 worth of embedded taxes, that $100 car now costs $77. But the Fair Tax adds an equivalent amount back at the end of the chain, at the point of sale, to the consumer or end user, in this case $23, bringing the total cost back to $100, exactly what it was prior to the Fair Tax. No difference in the final price, but a consequential difference in where the taxes are extracted. ----- Optional -----One point of confusion to clarify, the difference between calculating a tax rate inclusively vs exclusively: When you add $23 to $77 to get back to $100, there are two ways to calculate the tax rate that $23 represents - inclusively and exclusively. Calculating it inclusively means asking, what % of the final cost (production + taxes) does $23 represent? Eg, $23 / ($77 + $23) = $23/$100 = .23 = 23%. Calculating it exclusively means asking, what % of only the cost of production does $23 represent? Eg, $23/$77 = .2987 = 29.87%, or 30% rounded up. So there is some confusion and misdirection whether the Fair Tax is a 23% point-of-sale tax, or a 30% one. Proponents use the 23% number since that's lower, less threatening, and more accurately corresponds to the 23% embedded taxes it replaces, while opponents use the 30% number and accuse proponents of using accounting gimmicks to misrepresent the tax burden. But regardless how you calculate it percentage-wise, the actual amount of the point-of-sale tax is intended to be exactly equal to the amount of embedded taxes it replaces.----- /Optional ----- Now, on to the For/Against: For: It shifts the US tax burden from the supply chain to the point of sale (eg, from production to consumption), improving US manufacturers' competitiveness and making the US more attractive to foreign multinationals as a location for manufacturing operations. The net effects: 1. Goods produced in the US become 23% cheaper to produce. This, combined with our well-developed internal markets, strong infrastructure, transparent and consistent legal system, high-trust culture, relatively low corruption, and lack of requirement for foreign multinationals to partner with a domestic company, could make the US more competitive with other low-cost producers for manufacturing and production. Economists know one thing for sure - incentives matter. And the Fair Tax would create a powerful incentive to both US and foreign multinationals to set up manufacturing operations here instead of elsewhere, creating jobs, revitalizing the US middle class, recapitalizing the US tax base, and helping balance both the Federal budget and the US trade deficit. 2. The cost of goods produced in the USA stays the same when sold in the US, while becoming 23% cheaper to produce. The US tax burden is just shifted, not increased or decreased. 3. The price of US exports decreases by 23%. They benefit from the elimination of embedded taxes without the equivalent, offsetting, US-market-only point-of-sale tax being added back on. Eg, US exports become much more competitive with those of other low-cost producers. 4. The price of goods imported into the US increases by 23%-30%. Eg, imports are subject to the point-of-sale tax, but do not benefit from the offsetting US-only embedded tax elimination, and hence rise in price by the full amount of the point-of-sale tax. US-made goods become much more price-competitive with foreign imports in the US market. The upshot is that is that it becomes tax-free to make stuff in the US, decreasing production costs by 23%-30%. This makes the US a much more attractive place to manufacture goods destined for both the US market and for export to other markets. Both US companies and foreign multinationals are strongly incentivized to repatriate and outsource (respectively) their manufacturing operations to the US instead of to other less developed, low-cost producers. Over the past decade or two, many auto companies, from Toyota and Nissan to BMW and Mercedes, have realized it's cheaper to actually manufacture autos destined for the US market in the US itself, instead of shipping them here. The Fair Tax is intended to drastically multiply that effect across all industries. There are many more Fors as well, all clearly explained in the Fair Tax book: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1583673.The_Fair_Tax_Book_II Against: It effectively creates an untargeted, blanket across-the-board tariff of 23%-30% on all imports. It could also hurt the poor. It may also exacerbate income inequality in the US. 1. Imports become 23%-30% more expensive, since they are subject to the new point-of-sale tax, but not the off-setting US-only embedded tax elimination. Hybrid goods that are partly produced abroad and partly in the US, become more expensive in the US as well, proportionate to how much of their content is produced outside the US, where supply chains are presumably taxed by foreign governments). One of the problems this poses is that tariffs are usually only put in place to either protect a fragile domestic industry or to right some perceived trade wrong, such as one country dumping goods at below market prices in another, or one country violating environmental or labor standards, or WTO rules, or manipulating their currency, or any other mercantilist methods to gain unfair advantage for domestic industries. But the Fair Tax applies to all imports equally, regardless whether they violate any trade norms or treaties. The hope is that foreign multinationals will avoid the problem completely by moving production processes to the US to take advantage of the offsetting tax-free production here. But another possible outcome is that their home governments erect tariffs on US exports to their countries, neutralizing any advantage tax-free production in the US would otherwise confer. 2. Politicians from export-oriented countries that depend on the US market may perceive the Fair Tax as a blanket, across-the-board tariff on all imports, and would oppose it becoming law. And if they failed, and the Fair Tax passed and became law anyway, they may reciprocate with equivalent tariffs on American products imported to their markets. Again, it may be necessary for this reason for any Fair Tax bill to reconsider all other US import tariffs, since the Fair Tax effectively replaces them, but this is also politically difficult. 3. The poor could be harmed due to increased prices on imports. The Fair Tax implements a built-in solution to this problem in the form of the Prebate, which is a monthly tax rebate for all point-of-sale taxes paid up to a minimum cost of living. This rebate is issued in advance, at the beginning of the rebate term (monthly in this case) rather than at the end (hence the term 'prebate'), is need-blind and issued equally to all US citizens rich and poor, and is recalculated as necessary. It ensures that nobody pays taxes on a subsistence level of consumption, but only on consumption that exceeds the basic necessities of living. But economically this is unknown territory, there could be unforeseen problems with it. 4. Since the Fair Tax eliminates all Federal taxes - Income, Capital Gains, Estate, etc - it may exacerbate wealth disparity in the US. Even if it succeeds at its primary objective of attracting new business to the US and creating jobs, there is no guarantee the profits would decrease inequality rather than increase it (via increased executive team compensation and shareholder payouts without increased wages). More may be employed, but at wage levels high enough to reduce or even just freeze current wealth disparity? If increasing disparity were the result, there are no longer any tax-based tools for the US government to use to mitigate the problem. While increasing concentration of resources among fewer and fewer owners is a natural characteristic of power-law-based complex systems like national economies (positive feedback loops, winner-take-all, etc), unchecked, extreme wealth disparity has historically been unsustainable, and is correlated with (if not a primary cause of) revolutions and social instability (1789 French Revolution, Russian Bolshevik Revolution, Arab Spring, OccupyWallStreet, etc). Something of concern, especially given post-GFC instabilities. 5. Federal tax lawyers and tax accountants will have to find new work. The Fair Tax replaces the current, loop-hole-ridden, 50,000+ page tax code with a new one of just tens of pages, and with only two tax mechanisms - the tax rate, and the prebate amount. No more building careers around the Federal tax code. Tax professionals may oppose it for obvious reasons. That said, such people are highly talented and educated and their transition to other high-value careers is one of the least problematic aspects of this tax policy, though it may be wise for any Fair Tax bill to at least include some consideration for smoothing that transition. Neutral/Miscellaneous: 1. It provides two powerful and transparent tools for Congress to use to manage the economic cycle - the single Federal point-of-sale tax rate, and the monthly prebate amount. Combined with the Federal Reserve's money supply and interest rate tools, it provides a relatively simple, three-pronged mechanism for managing the economic cycle: Theoretically, during busts the tax rate can be decreased to facilitate capital formation, the prebate increased above the minimum cost of living to stimulate demand, and Federal Reserve interest rates decreased to stimulate lending and investment. During boom times, the tax rate can be increased to pay down debt, the prebate returned to the base subsistence level, while interest rates are increased to prevent asset bubbles and encourage capital formation. Unlike the unwieldy and convoluted stimulus plans we use nowadays, the tax rate and prebate are consistent, transparent, and universally applied across the whole country. Some may consider this economic policy tool a pro, others a con, depending on political leanings, but it should be mentioned nonetheless. 2. Non-US citizens or non-legal residents are not eligible for the prebate. This is intentional, and is intended to decrease the incentive to illegally migrate to the US. However, it could result in more extensive black markets among illegal immigrants where merchants don't report sales or collect point-of-sale taxes. 3. Used goods are not subject to the point-of-sale tax, regardless where they were made. Presumably they've already been taxed, and the Fair Tax does not double-tax them. Conclusion I suggest anyone interested in this topic read the most recent Fair Tax book, it explains both the primary benefits as well as a myriad of smaller beneficial side effects in much more detail than anything on the Internet could (and that few journalists ever bother to report): http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1583673.The_Fair_Tax_Book_II What\u2019s of meta interest about the Fair Tax is that it represents a rethinking of the tax system from first principles, effectively prioritizing a problem that Andy Grove, the late co-founder of Intel corp, spent the last decade or so of his life campaigning and advocating about - that America is good at creating innovation, but bad at keeping and scaling it: Andy Grove: How America Can Create Jobs The Fair Tax as conceived may or may not be politically possible, but it represents a kind of fundamental, first principles rethinking that may be necessary for the US to make real progress in redeveloping the ability to scale innovation. Finally, Harvard Econ Prof Greg Mankiw recommends tax reform that is conceptually close to the Fair Tax: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/four-keys-to-a-better-tax-system-economic-view.html In a nutshell, 1) broaden the tax base by eliminating all deductions, 2) tax consumption not income, 3) tax bads not goods, 4) Keep it Simple. The Fair Tax only partially implements #3, targeted taxes on 'bads', as it is a blind tax on all consumption while removing taxes on the \u201cgood\u201d of manufacturing, but otherwise implements Mankiw's prescriptions.
