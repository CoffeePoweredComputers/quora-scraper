            "answer_text": "I would definitely say No. Each individual should fall in love with virtue and welcome it into their heart. As a result of that, virtue becomes increasingly displayed by those individuals (because they are in love!). So that is the battle of virtue vs. perversity that occur in the heart+soul of each individual. Evil is not really \u201cout there\u201d or \u201cin them but not in us/me\u201d. Should a group of people agree and have well disclosed guidelines and consequences for misconduct which harms that society? Yes, for sure. But I don\u2019t believe in \u201cfighting\u201d evil since fighting is itself evil. Virtue is unity and love and Perversity is separation and chaos. So fighting is a tool of perverse intentions, not virtuous intentions. If you mean \u201cconfront\u201d perversity (evil), yes. That confrontation is what those guidelines with consequences do. They clearly state what misconducts will be \u201cconfronted\u201d and how they will be dealt with (which were all previously agreed upon by all those involved). If the individuals do not agree to them ahead of time, they need to be removed from society since it is unfair to have them suffer consequences when they never agreed to abide by the guidelines. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Evil and Good are not absolute, though we would like to think so. Was God evil to kill the innocent first born male in Egypt during Passover to free a specific group of slaves, the jews. Did those children who perished deserve death? Was God good to let his son die on a cross to demonstrate the divine path to salvation? Is a soldier evil to kill in the name of a cause or political position? Is a doctor that aborts a child evil to do so with medical skill versus the alternative methods before abortion? Are those that choose abortion evil, as their choice is selfish and inconsiderate of the potential of life? I can not judge evil or good, God is the only true judge. ",
