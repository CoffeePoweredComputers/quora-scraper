We will always keep looking for things that are unknown to us, like we see in space exploration. Secondly, the question implicitly assumes there is a \u2018whole\u2019 of knowledge. There isn\u2019t. What there is to know will always keep expanding (as well as things erode, fade away from knowledge (for example, the knowledge used to put men on the moon in 1969 is gone, we don\u2019t know anymore how they did it). Ther are also languages found on thing like clay tablets we don\u2019t know how to decypher. Once that was known, of course. There is no ulimate, complete body of knowledge. ",

The \u2018billions\u2019 of things we don\u2019t know tend to be those of much less immediate importance. However, many people are investigating some of those things. That\u2019s called \u2018science\u2019, and we can expect it to make our lives significantly better as it progresses. But if you think there\u2019s some important topic that we\u2019re missing out on, then by all means tell us; and if you can make a case for it, a researcher might take it up. ",

            "answer_text": "We need to question what knowledge is, and whether there are different kinds of knowledge. From the question, it seems the concern is with the total sum of knowledge available to mankind. Much of this is scientific knowledge, and that is obviously something that has mostly been developed in recent centuries, through theorising and experimentation. However, there is possibly another type of knowledge, intuitive knowledge, that is said to be a matter more of perception than intellectual analysis. Some of the early achievements of humanity suggest insights into subtle energies and knowledge of building techniques still not fully understood. Early advances in medicine, the uses of plants, metallurgy, and astronomy also point the same way. ",
