            "answer_text": "Normally I prefer to respond to questions that begin with \u201cis it possible\u201d by saying, well, I suppose anything is \u201cpossible\u201d. But there are a few formulations, word bundles that really need to be addressed with a solid No, and this is one of them, along with material teleportation and time travel. You must have heard about this concept from others or from a movie you saw, it\u2019s not really a naturally occurring thought. Now, the question remains, have you noticed that there is a big difference between the internal maps of reality in our minds and the \u201creal\u201d reality outside our minds? It\u2019s interesting to notice that immense gap between mental representations of reality, and the reality being represented. However, human beings are by nature suspicious primates, and for good reason, so to notice suddenly that those maps of reality in our minds are just maps after all this time, a whole lifetime, of imagining that the maps of reality were reality, can be quite disturbing and leave us vulnerable and gullible to paranoid interpretations of why that is. We need to navigate an often hostile environment, which is also often rich with opportunity to feed and mate. So we need those maps and we need to feel they are \u201creal\u201d or we won\u2019t trust them and we\u2019ll be paralyzed with fear. When we hear about or see for ourselves our maps are just maps and reality is something completely different, again we become fearful of that. Don\u2019t be afraid. Now, maybe you are entertained by the idea of us being manipulated for some nefarious purpose, and if so, please excuse my \u201cballoon popping\u201d crusade. But you did ask us for our opinions\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "My dear friend, you have just discovered the thought process known as solipism; the philisophical belief that nothing can be proven but one\u2019s self because we have no other basis of reality. You, reader, exist. If you are reading these words, comprehending them, or even just looking at this very website, is proof that something must exist to do something you are aware that is happening; i.e., you. Confused? It only gets worse. One generally accepted method of a basis for reality is known as empiricism, or data collection based on senses. However, if we are to treat reality as per it\u2019s definition; being the absolute truth, we need to accept that empiricism assumes. It assumes the basics of existence that is providing its own evidence. It is self assuming, and therefore is circulatory in it\u2019s thinking; I can trace its evidence back to its claim. \u201cEarth exists-I have evidence-It\u2019s from the Earth-Earth exists\u201d is one example of this. To answer your question-anything is possible, and not in the motivational way. We could be in a computer program. We could be mind controlled by aliens. You could be by yourself, drifting through the dead cosmos as you hallucinate as a coping mechanism for the fact that no one exists but yourself and one day you, too, shall die. Cheers! Hope this helped. ",
