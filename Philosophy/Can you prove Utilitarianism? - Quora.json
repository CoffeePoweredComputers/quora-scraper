            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think you can ever nail down its contentions with enough precision to prove or to disprove it. Better to focus your aim on showing its incoherence. Here is a passage written by a professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder: \u201cSuppose a person (we can call him 'Max the Masochist') suffers from some mental defect that makes him desire pain, failure, illness, humiliation, and early death. Suppose he gets these. [One important form of utilitarianism \u2014 which the professor calls DS] implies that his life went well for him. But surely his life was a wreck. He would have been much better off if he had different desires and they had been satisfied. The satisfaction of these desires did him no good. So we have this little argument: Max the Masochist:1. Max the Masochist led a miserable life.2. If Max the Masochist led a miserable life, then DS is false.3. Therefore, DS is false. P1: Look at his life. From early on, he was constantly in pain. He failed at everything he did. He was sick and ill. He was constantly humiliated and ashamed of himself and his failures .... And he died young. This is what happened in Max's life. Now, are we going to say this is not a miserable life? If you were asked to describe a life in which the person was not doing well, could you do a better job than to describe Max's? It seems not. So it seems clear that Max's life did not go well for him -- he led a miserable life.P2: But if Max really did lead a miserable life, then DS can't be true, because DS implies that Max's life went well for him. It implies this because all of these things Max got, he actually wanted! He wanted this misery. He wanted the pain, the humiliation, the illness, the early death.Maybe you're skeptical about P1. Maybe, you say, if Max really did want those things, then his life was fine. Maybe some people are inclined to think Max's life didn't go so well because they wouldn't want those things.But can you really swallow this? Suppose you had a close friend just like Max -- your friend had desires just like Max, and he was getting them satisfied. Would you then just sit back and say, \"Oh wonderful, I'm so glad things are going so well for my friend?\" No -- you'd try to get your friend some help. You'd think things would be better for your friend if he had different desires (say for love, pleasure, friendship, success) and got those things. But if DS is true, what you are saying doesn't even make sense. It doesn't even make sense to say the things he desires are bad for him. ",

I suppose you might be able to take one that is sufficiently rigorous and prove that it\u2019s contradiction-free, but that\u2019s not the same as \u201cproving\u201d in in whatever sense you imagine you mean it. There is no rule of any kind that allows you to conclude what something ought to be from what is. You instead take something as axiomatic. Utilitarianism is one such set of axioms. You don\u2019t prove axioms. You decide whether or not they correspond to how you think the world should work. The merit of the system is judged by how well you can live with those axioms. ",
