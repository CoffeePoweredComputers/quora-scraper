            "answer_text": "In order to answer this question it would be could to have some perspective. If we speak in percentages about ancient Greco-Roman Literature in specific fields such as poetry,theater plays , philosophy etc we will find that in quantity , the 97% of the best poets were Greeks .And the same percentage would be for theater plays and Philosophy. The 3% would be Romans Now , if we analise this 3 percent we will see that half of it was writting in Greek .For example .Marcus Aurelius meditations was written entirely in Greek and this was his secret diary . Which means that he was thinking in Greek. Now regarding quality The best ancient Greco-Roman theater play writters were all Greek . The 10 best philosophers were all Greek. The 10 best poets would be 9 Greek and one Latin, Ovidio , who was writing about Greek myths , inspired by the Greek Mythology Therefore the term Greco-Roman is more like an euphemism . Comparing the one to the other there was no such thing as Roman Literature , the same as there were no Roman painting or sculpture except of few examples that was either writing in Greek , or were inspire in greek themes or belonged to ancient greek schools and most of them had greek teachers ",

            "answer_text": "I know just enough about this to have formed an opinon, which is that one difference in Roman literary style and emphasis over Greek might be that Romans were more practical and personal than the Greeks, although Roman higher culture was largely derived from Greek. For example Julius Caesar may have been the world\u2019s first war correspondant, writing about what he was accomplishing in destroying Gaul as he was doing it, and in the third person, as if his POV were somehow objective. He surely knew what he was doing in aggrandizing his own achievements, and it worked. Maybe too well. ",
