            "answer_text": "That's a lot to analyse but I suppose since u ask the question u already see how theyre connected. I'd say both are humanist and greenie in view, and concerned with the destructive nature of powerful human constructs like tech / econ policy. But neither sees these constructs as inherently bad. They r just big things we made that have gotten out of hand and need to be used right. Yet they pitch at diff levels. Heid is concerned w how in touch we r w ourselves, our being, the world we naturally live in. Tech can drive us from that. Hic's concerns are more sociopolitical - poverty, sustainability. When resolved, heid has tech reflect us like a poignant life lesson, while hick has econ improve human life standards and the natural world. In a Chinese storyline, heid is the effortless daoist, hick the revolutionary confucian scholar. ",
