            "answer_text": "Hi, nicely expressed parable. I like it ! My answer will fall a bit in the \u2018parabolic\u2019 arena too.  The answer from my heart ! I do know that they can \u2018dance\u2019 together and being well familiar with that very dance floor ( I am going to even toss in \u2018Objective Understanding\u2019 into the mix). They can \u2018boogie\u2019 well, and occasionally even pull off a slow dance together. One is powered by the \u2018brain\u2019, one from the emotions, and one from a pure heart. Dance yes, become \u2018married\u2019 . . . Nope. Why? because their \u2018outcomes\u2019 will eventually supersede each other. (you know, the old searching in the \u2018underwear\u2019 drawer) deal. The friendship will then become sour. But \u2018non judgmental respect\u2019 can allow them to be able to still say \u201cHI\u201d to each other without starting a \u2018fist fight\u2019. Does that help get a bit closer to the answer you are searching for? How might I know? Well, I am married to Objective Understanding, and truly do Understand. Fist Fights used to be a part of of my/the grand finale (when I was an x-tian). Each has a right to make their own choices and it is greater to just learn how to become aware of the \u2018train wreck\u2019 damage that just isn\u2019t well paying. The birds and the trees and the sky aren\u2019t the same either . . . but they can still exist with a bit of appreciation of one another. I think that is why Hamashiach told Peter . . . you will eat with what seems non-kosher to you. Hey, You have a great day. from that damn Jew boy (: ",

If you choose a definition that is mutually exclusive then yes, otherwise probably not.
