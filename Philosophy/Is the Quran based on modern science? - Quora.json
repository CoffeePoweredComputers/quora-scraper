So called \u201cscience in Quran\u201d is example of the same principle, which is used in astrology: \u201cIf statement has an infinite number of interpretations, nothing can disprove it\u201d And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander. Qur\u2019an 51:47 What does mean heaven? Cosmos? Ozon layer? Another dimension? Sky? What does mean expand? Moving? Expansion of space? Expansion of matter? There is no strict answear. Regardless on facts, it is always possible to create interpretation, which does not contradict modern science. ",

            "answer_text": "Since modern science did not exist when the Quran was revealed, it can not be said to be \u201cbased on\u201d modern science. That does not mean that what the Quran says is not true, since very little (or none) of what the Quran says has to do with the topics and questions that modern science studies. Two books which are on totally differenttopics cannot be said to contradict each other: they are about different things. Similarly with the Quran. Before you judge an answer, make sure you know what the question was. ",
