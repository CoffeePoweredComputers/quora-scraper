            "answer_text": "Consider, first, what a straw man is. Take care to label correctly the fallacy you are deconstructing. When power is at stake, power holders sometimes hastily view any criticism as a direct assault on themselves, their position, and/or their influence. Your question hastily presupposes that all feminists put forward a particular kind of fallacy. The first weakness in the question is that it lumps all \u2018feminists\u2019 into a single category. One cannot possibly fit all feminists into this category and suggest that such an observation is valid. Your inquiry will receive more meaningful responses if \u2018feminists\u2019 were qualified in the question. Example: When small-minded people viewing the complexities of all social interactions and power structures through the lens of feminism put forward fallacious arguments about the world, what are some common examples of their arguments? Note: Your initial question is cast as a simple construction, but it seems to me that it would be better cast as a complex construction. See how the subordinate clause, which recasts \u2018feminists\u2019 with a number of qualifiers that you seem to imply, sets up the question itself. The second problem seems to be one of choice: the hasty generalization is likely to be the fallacy you\u2019re looking for. When I hear someone, who claims to be a feminist, say, \u2018Men do this or that\u2019, I immediately conclude that I am not hearing a person of reason. Of course, sometimes, when emotions overcome reasoning, we say things that are unqualified and/or oversimplified. Lastly, if you want to assume the high ground in any argument, always attend carefully to the qualifiers necessary to the construction of a nuanced claim, proposal, or prediction. The world is a very complex place, indeed, so take care to formulate your observations in a way that reflect your own deliberations and clarity of thought. ",

            "answer_text": "Men\u2019s rights activists are reactionaries. Wrong, men\u2019s rights activism is about opposing both the old and new status quo that has been, and still is heavily gynocentric. The MHRM is not a pendulum swing.Discussing male issues in a serious manner is an attempt to derail the discussion about women\u2019s rights. Wrong again. The reason why many men say \u2018well what about us\u2019 instead of \u2018about us\u2019 is due to the fact when many men do attempt the latter they get chastised anyways. Further exacerbating the \u2018what about us\u2019 trend is how many women\u2019s rights advocates push their agenda on the backs of men. Look at some crazy laws feminists have pushed for in several countries and you\u2019d get my point here.If you\u2019re not a feminist this means you don\u2019t care about women. Wrong yet again. It simply means that you\u2019re not going to confine what equality means to you according to a rigid agenda. Furthermore, it also means that boys and men face serious issues that need to be taken more seriously.(Note: I\u2019m leaving out the frequent strawman arguments I get from many feminists during my individual debates with them because they\u2019re too variable.)
