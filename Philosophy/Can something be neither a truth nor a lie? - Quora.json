            "answer_text": "Well well well. I\u2019m scratching my head at this question and the profound answers that have already been given. I am often considering a similar yet contrary question\u2014if something can be both true and false. And for that, yes a premise can be relationally true or false depending on the domain or context. Given the 24 time zones in the world, the statement that it is approximately 5:00 PM on June 21 is true for me in CST in Iowa, U.S.A. but it is utterly false for someone writing an answer in Tokyo, Japan where it is already 7:00 AM on Monday, June 22 (14 hours ahead of my time). While there is a consistent frame of reference to apply the proper time for any location, the maxim that \u201cit is 5 o\u2019clock somewhere\u201d often stated as a form of humor or jesting gives an understanding of the complex nature of Earth time. But for something being neither true nor false, I guess countless things could be this way. A lot of it would also depend on perspective, domain, or frame of reference. I can\u2019t ponder this type of question too long as before I have often taken a few days or weeks to get over the mental abyss I\u2019ve found myself in from similar questions. But one thing I can think of off the bat is some problems in mathematics. The answer to the problem \u201cwhat is a given number x divided by zero\u201d is always undefined. This is easily understood if you do a simple association(as explained by the Dr. Math FAQ link above): 10 divided by 5 would be 2 as 2 multiplied by 5 is 10. But 10 divided by 0 would be x as x multiplied by 0 would have to equal 10. Since any number multiplied by 0 would be 0, there is no answer that can ever be divided by 0. So, an answer to any number divided by zero would be neither true nor false as there is no answer to this problem. It is undefined. That\u2019s as far as I can go. Others can go much farther and back I know. But my brain is already starting to hurt. Thank you for a very profound question. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d hazard to say no. Philosophically speaking, truth is agreeing that something one makes a judgment about corresponds with reality. If I say that which is, exists, by definition that statement is true. If one claims donuts help you gain weight, by and large that is true, though some who eat donuts may have metabolisms that aren\u2019t affected as such. This general statement would need to be qualified to be completely true. Simply considering anything, like \u201cpineapple,\u201d isn\u2019t asserting a truth. Something must be predicated about that pineapple for it to be considered a truth or falsehood (\u201cpineapple juice is sweeter than cranberry juice\u201d). It is true that some truths can only be known when all is said and done: \u201ctheir marriage was, overall, a success.\u201d First of all, what does one mean by success, and then has this marriage met those standards? But things in themselves, like a piece of paper\u2014are not technically speaking, true or false. They just are. For something to be true, one must assert a judgment about it and verify or deny that it represents experience as I and others know it. This aspect of truth means that it must cohere with what is, that in this place at this time people would agree paper is flammable. So, that paper is flammable is true. Paper made with inflammable properties will not burn is also true, but that is a different statement\u2014a different reality. So far, we see that truth must correspond to what is real, and it must be coherent to experience. Even if, for instance, one believes or does not in the existence of God, it is true to say that either God does or does not exist. There is no middle ground here. The reason something cannot be neither true or false is because of the principle of non-contradiction, which asserts that something can not be and be at the same time in the same way. If my reality can be contradicted to what is really real, then I know I\u2019ve made a mistake. If my reality contradicts your reality, one of us is mistaken. Something cannot be true and false, properly speaking. If it can be neither true nor false, what is the point of communicating? What is the point of truth? ",

            "answer_text": "tl;dr: No, it can\u2019t. It can be so only if you refer to it as a superposition of states, which implies it\u2019s both. So it can be just a truth or a lie, or both. But ultimately, it cannot be neither of them. To explain my reasoning, let\u2019s mix in some quantum theory and spicy things up. In quantum theory, there is a concept named \u2018Superposition\u2019. Superposition is a principle of quantum theory that describes a challenging concept about the nature and behavior of matter and forces at the sub-atomic level. The principle of superposition claims that while we do not know what the state of any object is, it is actually in all possible states simultaneously, as long as we don't look to check. It is the measurement itself that causes the object to be limited to a single possibility. [1] Superposition is simply illustrated by the Schrodinger\u2019s cat analogy: In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger proposed an analogy to show how superposition would operate in the every day world: the somewhat cruel analogy of Schrodinger's cat. Here's Schr\u00f6dinger's (theoretical) experiment: We place a living cat into a steel chamber, along with a device containing a vial of hydrocyanic acid. There is, in the chamber, a very small amount of a radioactive substance. If even a single atom of the substance decays during the test period, a relay mechanism will trip a hammer, which will, in turn, break the vial and kill the cat. The observer cannot know whether or not an atom of the substance has decayed, and consequently, cannot know whether the vial has been broken, the hydrocyanic acid released, and the cat killed. Since we cannot know, the cat is both dead and alive according to quantum law, in a superposition of states. It is only when we break open the box and learn the condition of the cat that the superposition is lost, and the cat becomes one or the other (dead or alive). This situation is sometimes called quantum indeterminacy or the observer's paradox: the observation or measurement itself affects an outcome, so that the outcome as such does not exist unless the measurement is made. (That is, there is no single outcome unless it is observed.) [1] So there you have it. Something is neither a truth or a lie for you unless strong and logical evidence is provided to you, in order for you to decide whether that holds true, or not. Following, as long as you don\u2019t take any decisions, that \u2018something\u2019 is both false and true, it\u2019s both unless you choose it to be one of the two. In simple, day-to-day language, you could call something neither a truth or a lie (e.g. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll rain tomorrow, so \u2018It will rain tomorrow\u2019 is neither a truth or a lie), while in fancy language stating that it\u2019s a superposition of states. But do not be mistaken: it\u2019s not the universe who does not have an answer for you, it\u2019s you who has yet to decide. References: [1] What is superposition? - Definition from WhatIs.com ",

            "answer_text": "Everything we perceive simply is: it's neither truth nor lie. Truth or lie is your subjective judgment. It's a horrible treadmill to be on. Buddhism teaches to let all that mental interpretation go and simply be. I like Osho\u2019s ideas I'm simply saying that there is a way to be sane. I'm saying that you can get rid of all this insanity created by the past in you. Just by being a simple witness of your thought processes. It is simply sitting silently, witnessing the thoughts, passing before you. Just witnessing, not interfering not even judging, because the moment you judge you have lost the pure witness. The moment you say \u201cthis is good, this is bad,\u201d you have already jumped onto the thought process. It takes a little time to create a gap between the witness and the mind. Once the gap is there, you are in for a great surprise, that you are not the mind, that you are the witness, a watcher. And this process of watching is the very alchemy of real religion. Because as you become more and more deeply rooted in witnessing, thoughts start disappearing. You are, but the mind is utterly empty. That\u2019s the moment of enlightenment. That is the moment that you become for the first time an unconditioned, sane, really free human being. Osho Osho Quotes (Author of Courage) ",

            "answer_text": "A lie is an intentional statement of falsehood with intent to deceive - so clearly not all statements are truth or lies - as one can make false statements without knowing they are false, or without intent to deceive. I wonder if you are instead asking about the truth status of any given statement, which is an interesting question about an axiom of classical logic. The traditional laws of thought state that: The law of identity: for any proposition A: A=AThe law of non-contradiction: The statement: \u201cA and not-A\u201d is falseThe law of excluded middle: For all propositions A, either A is true or A is falseOne way to interpret your question is as asking whether the law of the excluded middle is true. To this we can say: it has been taken as an axiom in many logical systems for thousands of years, but by no means are we required, somehow, by nature to accept that it must be. In fact branches of logic and math called intuitionist logic and portions of constructive mathematics do not assume the law of the excluded middle holds, and see where reasoning can take them based on that. So - in this sense whether \u201cevery statement is either true or false\u201d can be thought of as a potential axiom for further reasoning, and interesting consequences arise from adopting it, or not.
