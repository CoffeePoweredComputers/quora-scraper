            "answer_text": "No. Of course not but to me it happens sometimes that I sometimes explain an opinion like a rant and then get it deleted no matter what. When I explain a simple thing that everyone knows but still get my comment removed because people didn\u2019t want to understand. This would make much more sense if I told what happened but I don\u2019t expect anyone to understand that there are extremists in every group of people. I have seen many answers here on Quora which have explained that many times. I\u2019ll hope this is inside the limits of BNBR rules and I don\u2019t mean to violate those rules but if I get my comment removed because a person didn\u2019t like me disliking liberal extremist then yeah. But no, people aren\u2019t idiots. Some people just can\u2019t see further than the tip of their nose. Eiv\u00e4t n\u00e4e nen\u00e4\u00e4ns\u00e4 pidemm\u00e4lle is what we Finns use as a saying when someone doesn\u2019t accept the obvious. ",

Therefore, I would say yes, every one is a stupid in their own special way. \u201cThe human being, in my concept, is not stupid, he only does stupid things\u201d (Istv\u00e1n R\u00e1th-V\u00e9gh. 1870-1950). \"In general, a stupid person, is the human at the time of committing stupidity, the rest of the time is a normal person, potentially stupid.\" Kuke Lito, 2018.
