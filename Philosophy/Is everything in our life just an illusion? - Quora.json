            "answer_text": "You asked - \"Is everything in our life just an illusion?\" Disclaimer I must advise you that I am a Zen Buddhist and that my answer will obviously be given from a Buddhist epistemological and soteriological point of view. So, please read it and enjoy for what it is, and accept or reject it for what it is worth to you. I make this reservation because I was once 'hammered and chastised and ridiculed' by something that I posted which offended some people of the Abrahamic faiths. I also make this reservation because there is no proselytising in Buddhism. Buddhism is not a religion. Buddhism is a personal rather than a congregational calling. Buddhism is an ancient contemplative or meditative yoga practice of philosophical enquiry into the nature of all things and circumstances. Buddhism is in essence a practical cultivation of the Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Truths are - (1) the premise that life (in the verb sense of 'living') is in broad terms 'suffering' or unsatisfactory in the overall experience of it (2) the probable main causes being 'craving' and 'delusion' [as in delusionary 'thinking'] (3) that there is a possible way to end this life of 'suffering' and that (4) this, as advocated by the Buddha, is by way of the Eightfold Noble Path. The Eightfold Noble Path can be divided into its 3 separate components :- (1) Moral or Civil Conduct :- Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood. (2) Mental Conduct or Development :- Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration (3) Wisdom Right Understanding, Right Thought [All in the transitive 'verb' sense] Introduction It looks like a very simple question but trust me, it is in fact very complicated. Why? This is because we have not defined as to whose (the subject) perspective and what (the object) is in the 'everything' that is being looked at. And then there is a further complication i.e. within which realm or dimension are we examining this hypothesis? There are infinite realms out there whether we view them as (i) the layers of an infinite 'onion' or (ii) as infinite parallel worlds (as in the movie MATRIX); all concurrent or consubstantial, endless beyond conceivability. [Refer to the inconceivable endless extant and extent of dimensions of Buddha-lands, where simultaneously one Buddha-land is in all Buddha-lands and all Buddha-lands are in one Buddha-land (the Buddhist expression is the 'Brahma Net') in the Avatamsaka Sutra and also the Brahmajala Sutra]. For the purpose of this discussion we will however restrict ourselves to :- (1) the worldly or conventional or human or experiential realm, this world of ours, this world that is 'suffering' or unsatisfactory, that is termed 'samsara' - the world of the web of deceit that subjects all in it to the immutable law of 'karma', of 'cause and effect', resulting in endless cycles of 'rebirth', due to un-expiated karmic consequences; and behind the curtain backdrop to this worldly of conventional realm is - (2) the transcendental or metaphysical or ultimate reality realm of 'sunyata' - a Sanskrit word that is usually translated into English as 'emptiness' or 'void', but that is not what it really means exactly. My own personal preference is for 'illusion' or 'phantasm'. I note that you have used the term 'illusion' in your question. The 'reality' perceived by a 'subject' of an 'object' is, we would quite naturally say, as worldly or human or experiential beings, through our mind and senses. Since 'mind and senses' fall under a broader concept or umbrella called 'acumen' or 'insight', let us use a generic term for this broader concept or umbrella i.e. - 'mind-consciousness' So whether we refer to the first - worldly or conventional or human or experiential insight or to the second - metaphysical or transcendental or ultimate insight, we will equally apply the same generic term of 'mind-consciousness' to both, to facilitate, and for ease of, our discussion. Accordingly:- (1) in the worldly or conventional or or experiential or human realm - the mind-consciousness sees and experiences the 'worldly reality' of the world of 'suffering', the world of 'samsara', the world of the immutable law of karma and endless cycles of 'rebirth', if any karmic residue remains. (2) in the transcendental or metaphysical realm - the mind-consciousness with 'equanimity' (please pause to detect the subtle difference - hint - 'like the water of a duck's back') sees the 'transcendental reality' of the 'emptiness' or 'void' or 'illusion' or 'phantasm' that is 'sunyata'. So, the quick answer to your question is as follows :- (1) as a worldly or conventional or experiential or human being, worldly thinking that you are in fact substantive in your 'ego' personae i.e. a permanent distinct and independent entity, what you worldly experience, is very real, and neither you or any other worldly being in the world can deny this, for you are what your worldly mind-consciousness imagines and sees you and everything in your life is. [Just a reminder that your worldly mind-consciousness is basically your worldly mind and its companion five senses.]. (2) as a metaphysical or transcendental being however, and seeing 'ultimate reality' through transcendental eyes or transcendental wisdom or transcendental insight - the worldly or conventional or human or experiential realm and 'everything' in it, including you, as a worldly being, is 'emptiness' or 'void' or 'illusion' or 'phantasm' that is of 'sunyata'. Explanation of Sunyata and Mind-Consciousness. Our focal point is on these twin concepts of (a) 'sunyata' and (b) 'mind-consciousness'. We will leave the discussion on 'samsara' and the immutable law of karma to some other day, even though they are integral parts of the big picture. Later on we will make reference to the word 'Self'. In Buddhism there is no 'Self' as a noun, as what is referred to as 'Soul' in Western parlance, as a substantive permanent being, whether eternal, ephemeral or ethereal. Buddhism strictly treats 'Self' as a verb, the 'thinking' of or the 'consciousness of an ego of a Self'. For the rest of the discussion I will adopt the Buddhist methodology of 'Self' as a verb. It is important and very critical that you understand and make a connection with seeing words as a 'verb' and not a 'noun' as a mind-set. Why? This is because the Buddhist explanation of the 'illusion' or 'phantasm' that is of 'sunyata' is predicated on the 'thinking' or imaging or imagination of the mind-consciousness. This premise presumes or assumes that the mental 'images' in the mind-consciousness, when it is 'thinking' (as distinct from when it is reposed like a pendulum at rest, when 'not thinking') are - (i) not ''frozen' like snapshots, but fluid and in continuous motion like a movie or virtual reality and (ii) are of a kaleidoscopic nature (** it is not necessary and therefore irrelevant to find the first cause or effect or to establish or have to prove a beginning or an end). I reiterate, focus on the verb and not the noun of a word. Buddhism is about 'thinking' (verb). Buddhism is 'thinking' (verb) about 'thinking' (verb). I know, I am beginning to sound like a broken record. But I am doing something that the Buddhist books you buy in the bookshop are failing to tell you, in terms of first principles of Buddhism, (and you will definitely thank me for being so pedantic on this point), and that is why most cultivators end up on the garden path to nowhere rather than the Middle Path of the Buddha. Here I am currently leading you to when you are 'thinking' (verb) of what the 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' means, i.e. you must and should be 'thinking' (verb) of what the mind-consciousness is doing when the mind-consciousness is 'thinking' (verb) and when it is 'not thinking' (verb). Please ponder in depth on what I have kept reiterating. Your spiritual awakening depends on it! For this is what the Buddha meant when he said that unless a person had spiritual eyes and spiritual knowledge, the concept of 'sunyata' is inconceivable, incomprehensible and ungraspable. Now a quick test as to your mental acuity. Once you start talking about a Self and a God, as nouns, you are talking the opposite to the mind-consciousness 'thinking'; for now we have humans in their 'thinking' (noun) conjunctively 'grasping' at the ego of a Self and the ego of a God-Self (or as the Hindus put Godhead). And because the mind-consciousness has been used to freeze images like a picture frame, the 'thinking' is now a noun, and therefore a falsehood for you cannot (but when you do) freeze the verb that is the 'thinking', you end up with the product (noun) of false thinking, of a Self and of a God, and voila!, the Self and the God are now suddenly conceivable, comprehensible and graspable!!! That is why in Buddhism when we say that if everything is 'sunyata' or 'illusion' or 'phantasm', then there is 'nothing' of any entity, substrate, form, concept, word or label. All these 'nouns' are 'man-made' when we presume audaciously to 'freeze' the 'thinking' (verb) and thus stop 'thinking' (verb). And this human audacity is very obvious in the ego of Self that is man. But it is a false ego if man can create and define a new noun, a new word, each to mean whatever he wants it to mean. Simply put, there is only a Self or a God because of this 'delusion' or ignorance in the false 'thinking' (verb) that the mind-consciousness can stop 'thinking' (verb) when it is 'thinking' (verb) Summing up, as we go along, so that we do not lose our flow of logic in thought - Buddhism is not about concepts or words or labels and what they mean and what their definitions are. Buddhism is basically, in a very short sentence, about 'thinking' e.g. what is the cause of suffering and what is the way to the ending of suffering?. Buddhism is therefore a meditative or contemplative (i.e. 'thinking') spiritual practice. It is about whether our 'thinking' is 'mindful' or 'not mindful', whether our 'thinking' is thoughtful or 'not thoughtful', whether it is wholesome or unwholesome, and most importantly, as I have meticulously ground it into your inner perspicacity, whether it is a delusionary 'thinking' or not. When you know that all is 'sunyata' of an 'illusion' or 'phantasm' out there, you should therefore not be clinging, grasping, longing or attaching to any noun of a 'form' or 'no form', whatever that noun of an entity, whether eternal or otherwise. Remember what I said about the 'kaleidoscopic' nature of the mind-consciousness? Even 'time' itself is considered to be an 'illusion', since there is no perceivable beginning or a foreseeable end (as we shall see later). We Buddhists take the point that there is no Self or God very seriously. That is why it hard and yet also simple to be a Buddhist! In fact, we have a saying in Zen, that if Buddha stays in your mind, kill him! It would be blasphemous or a sacrilege for us Buddhists to say that if we thought that the Buddha were a God or if we did not have the wisdom to understand the inconceivable, the incomprehensible and the ungraspable that is the 'illusion', the 'phantasm' that is 'sunyata'. And, because of 'sunyata', and here is the shocking truth or revelation, in the ultimate truth that is the 'illusion', the 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' there is no Four Noble Truths, no suffering, no end to suffering, no Eightfold Noble Path, no 'samsara', no immutable law of karma, no rebirths, no 'enlightenment' and definitely no 'nirvana' [refer to the Heart Sutra]. However those who believe in a Self behind our mortal worldly being, think otherwise, based on blind faith, religious or otherwise, as there is no scientific or philosophical logical proof. They therefore aspire that upon their death, that they can unite with their 'other side of the coin' - their omnipresent, omniscient and omnipresent God. We will now try to decipher this mysterious metaphysical concept of 'sunyata' that the Buddha described as inconceivable, incomprehensible and ungraspable by the ordinary man. (I think what he meant was by 'delusionary thinking' (verb) rather than the noun in 'ordinary man'. See even the Buddha can have a 'slip of the tongue'! Ha! ha! [Even Buddhists have a sense of humour!]. Before I begin, allow me to lead you in or warm you up as to the dialectic logic and reasoning to be used :- Illustration 1 - we have to put ourselves into a metaphysical frame of mind, where the blind can see, where the deaf can hear and where the comatose can think. Like when we see, hear and think in our dream state. Or, like when we see what we saw, hear what we heard, think what we thought at a particular time in our past, whether when young, at school, at university or more recently, other than right now. We have to think, see, hear, smell, taste and feel 'kaleidoscopically' within our mind. The mental images roll on relentlessly or we can have flashbacks but the movie show goes on! We will discuss this further as to this kaleidoscopic 'creativity' to make something out of nothing for 'dreams' are like that! We humans 'create' and 'invent' because we can 'dream'! Think about this. Even 'delusion' can have an upside! Surprise! Surprise! There is no act of God making one rich and one poor or one clever and one stupid or one pretty and one ugly. Like the moon, 'delusion' has a bright side and a dark side! It is all a dream! Illustration 2 - take the examples of the 'house and its individual windows' and the 'oxcart wheel'. There is no 'form' or substance to a 'house and its individual windows' and the 'oxcart wheel', if it were not for the 'emptiness' or 'void' that they enfold. Refer to the didactic tenet in the Heart Sutra of \"Form is Emptiness and Emptiness is Form\". According to the Mind-Consciousness School of Thought the Buddha says that the 'mind-consciousness', in its quality of equanimity of 'totally absolute' unmoving, unwavering and unchanging state of pure luminous acumen, when 'not thinking' (verb) is the creator of 'all things' when it is 'thinking'. What does the Buddha mean exactly? Not to downgrade the Buddha in anyway at all, but it is a matter of fact that the French philosopher Descartes arrived at the same conclusion, when he said - \"I think, therefore I am. [If I do not, I am not.]\". [Words within square brackets added by me for clarity of elucidation]. This is to allay any fear or pretence that the Buddha has a monopoly on wisdom. The Buddha is just another 'illusion' after all. He is only a worldly, conventional, experiential and human truth or worldly reality in the conventional world that is 'samsara'. The expression 'all things' above refer to the ever-changing never substantialising 'kaleidoscopic' phantasmagoria of all the phenomena that we each, having a mind-consciousness of an ego of Self, individually, and collectively as humanity by cross-gregarious association, perceive and live and feel the 'reality' of the worldly experience of. But the 'reality' of our worldly experience is not real because we can never find anything substantial or permanent or totally absolute that we can pinpoint and identify and grasp from one point in any moment of time to the next point in any moment of time. That includes our 'mind-consciousness of an ego of Self' or of the Buddha. And that is why this is a false 'thinking' of an 'illusory or false ego of Self' or of the Buddha! What we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, see, hear, taste, smell and touch in the 'now' and 'present' of our worldly experience of 'reality' in our mind-consciousness of an illusory or false ego of Self, is always actually already in the 'past', when you think how long it takes for our worldly 'senses' to be 'deciphered' and 'processed' and 'computed' before it is delivered as a 'present' (get the pun?) to us, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, in a sort of a 3D projection hologram (remember Star Wars plagiarising this concept through the beam-out of R2D2?) in the space or emptiness of the blank screen in or of our mind. The stars and galaxies we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, worldly see in the night sky might not be existent? Get it? This 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of what is described by the Buddha as in the 'sunyata', as in being empty or void of substance or substrate or total absoluteness in the phantasmagoria of all the phenomena that we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, worldly sense is also confirmed by applying the dialectic elliptical logic of the Greek philosophers. Everything we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, worldly know is changing and moving in 'value' as in the 'measurement' or 'determination' of it, because they are relative or subject to each other in the juxtapositioning. Take time and date, it is human knowledge based or computed. We say it is BC or AD and yet we actually do not know when Jesus was born or died. The time we set is based on the relative revolving or rotation of the sun, earth and moon, and is of use only to humans. But what about the aliens out there? So, by deduction, the past, present and future only exist in relativity with or to each other. Otherwise none of them exist. Time is relative or subjective like all things when it is dependent on this subject-object axis or matrix. If this were not true then Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is groundless. Let me give you a real life example. When you are waiting for your lover to arrive at the rendezvous, 5 minutes is like 5 hours. But when you are entwined in each other's company later, 5 hours is like 5 minutes! Accordingly, time is therefore an 'illusion'. This relativity or subjectivity or duality that all measurements or values are predicated on, means that there is nothing actually 'totally absolute' about them, which is saying that they are not of a permanent entity or substantial substrate that we can carry over from one point of moment in time to another. Accordingly, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self worldly 'thinking' (verb) - things are 'created'. At this point, I like to return to the analogy of dreams or should I say 'dreaming' (verb). Coincidentally, but it is true, the Aborigines in Australia in their folklore explains 'Creation' as 'The Dreaming'. This is an exercise in logic in abstruse logic. I am asleep and 'dreaming'. Let us say in the dreaming of the dream, I am the idealistic handsome and well endowed Casanova (unlike plain and mundane me!) performing his sexual exploits. The passion of the chase and the capture and the rapture of the conquest are all very real in the experience of it and I ended in my actual worldly being with a 'wet dream' of a dreaming. Get the picture. Let us extrapolate that it is possible that my existence is someone else's dreaming, and his 'dreaming' is also someone else's dreaming and so forth, and imagine all these 'dreaming' of dreams can be concurrent in infinite parallel worlds as indicated in the movie MATRIX! Not only that, besides the concurrence, how about the progression and the digression, that is looking at the two opposite directions of movement of the 'dreaming'? How far back? Or, how far ahead? That is why in this relativity and subjectivity there cannot be found a first cause or the beginning or at the other end, a definite terminus or termination. Now, I ask you again. What is real and what is illusory? It is all relative in perspective is it not? It comes back to the preamble - from whose (the subject) perspective and what (the object) is in the everything that is being looked at and within which realm or dimension are we examining this hypothesis? If the mind-consciousness of our worldly illusory or false ego of Self (as a collective) were to stay still like the stopping of this pendulum of thought, i.e. the pendulum at rest - the universe and all things that we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, worldly imagines or dreams - will just simply disappear. So, I think we now understand or appreciate the characteristics of this 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' that is 'emptiness'. But how do we define or visualise this 'sunyata' and transpose it to the pervasive mind-consciousness that the Buddha was referring to? First, in the 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' that is 'emptiness', the mind-consciousness that it represents cannot also be anything other than a 'sunyata'. It cannot have an ego of Self, that screams out -\"I am mind-consciousness!\". For that would be like a God! But for an illusory God in 'sunyata' to have an ego of Self is to be delusional! Who wants a delusional God? To avoid this problem in Buddhism we just say - \"mind-consciousness just is\" or \"mind-consciousness is just thus\". Second, we say that mind-consciousness is 'intangible' and 'formless' like the 'quality' of the 'reflectivity' that is the 'backing' of a mirror. This inherent 'quality' of 'reflectivity' in the matter that is the 'backing' of the mirror, unlike the physical character of form of the backing itself, is however unborn, undying, unmoving, immutable and 'absolute' in its 'quality'. This 'quality' of 'reflectivity' is also inherently pervasive in its total equanimity - it is totally ambivalent, indifferent, nonchalant and does not get involve with anything, just like a fly on the wall, for it cannot be bias in any shape manner or form. We now know that this is mind-consciousness in repose, like a pendulum at rest, is when mind-consciousness is 'not thinking' (verb). Third, we say that when the mind-consciousness, that is the 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' that is 'emptiness', that is the 'quality' of the 'reflectivity' that is the 'backing' of a mirror, emanates itself in the worldly false ego of self in the 'samsara' of suffering, where the immutable law of karma is in full steam, it does so in the 'illusion' that is the kaleidoscopic phantasmagoria of worldly phenomena, and kindly note, ever-changing and therefore not absolute. This 'illusion' is like, (in contrast to that is the 'quality' of the 'reflectivity' that is the 'backing' of a mirror, which is absolute and never moves), the ever changing never absolute 'kaleidoscopic' 'reflections' 'in' the mirror. We now know that this is mind-consciousness in animated action, in full flight, like a movie, is when it is 'thinking' (verb). Fourth, the 'absolute' 'reflectivity' of and the 'non-absolute' 'reflections' in the mirror are neither 'form' (noun) nor ''not form' (noun) and are pervasive 'thinking' (verb) or 'not thinking' (verb). And they both metaphorically relate to and emanate from the same mind-consciousness. They are the two sides to the same coin, the same mind-consciousness. The 'absolute' 'reflectivity' of the mirror is like the pendulum of a grandfather clock at 'rest' and the 'non-absolute' 'reflections' in the mirror are like the pendulum of a grandfather clock 'in motion'. In Buddhism we describe the former as 'nirvana' [the mind-consciousness in peaceful blissful repose of 'not thinking'] and the latter as the 'agitated monkey in the mind' [the mind-consciousness animated and fantasising or should that be phantasming!] But as we can see, there is neither Self or God to be identified with or grasped of related to. And that is why it is as the Buddha said of the 'illusion', the 'phantasm' that is of 'sunyata' - that it is inconceivable, incomprehensible and ungraspable. Postscript. Please do not take Buddhism too seriously or should I say do not take it religiously. You do not have to trouble yourself with the metaphysical or the transcendental, or anything publicly broadcasted and vainly advertised as spiritual and pristine, when you are young and fancy free, and able to enjoy the full flight and the full spectrum of the multi-coloured and multi-weaving intricacies of the magic tapestry that is life. Be like an intrepid explorer - go and experience and enjoy life to the full - the sunshine and the rain, the different seasons, the ups and downs, the good with the bad. But keep a copy of the Desiderata beside you. That is the only Bible you ever need. To everything there is a season, the Bible says. The Buddha was more plebeian and mundane when he said - \"The mango will fall when it is ripe.\". Go and fall in love, raise a family, look after your aged parents, that is the true Zen (excuse the pun) for life! Wait until (a) you are absolutely unhappy and have lost faith of life - when you see it as 'suffering', as a burden, as a chore, as a gross inequity or as a 'Groundhog's Day' or when (b) you have been infected with a fear of 'death' all of a sudden or when (c) you have become 'Socrates' and is verve'd to know who exactly you are, the reason for your 'state' or 'lot' in existence, basically the 'who, when, what, where and whom' of 'you'?.

            "answer_text": "Have you ever wondered while watching a 3D film in a cinema that we see the pictures as having height, width and, crucially, depth when in fact it all originates from a flat 2D screen! Theoretical physicists say our 3D world may just be an illusion and that they have found substantial evidence to support the idea of a holographic universe. The difference, in our 3D universe, is that we can touch objects and the \u201cprojection\u201d is \u201creal\u201d from our perspective. Apart from this theory there are some more theories that relates to your question; Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave: Imagine a cave. In it, there are people who have been chained and are observing a blank wall. They can see, because of the fire, the shadows of themselves and of whatever is happening behind them. The voices echo in the cave while the shadows dance on the wall thus making the shadows appear real and talking. Plato compares us to those who are chained to the cave wall in his metaphor. He points out that we believe and think we see reality by watching the shadows on the wall. Whereas, beyond our perceived reality, there lies a world of \u201cperfect\u201d forms. Everything that we see is just a shade, an imitation of how things truly are. Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 Solipsism: Have you ever experienced that you\u2019ve awoken from a dream, only to find out you are actually still sleeping? Dreams within dreams happen sometimes, in the REM phase of sleep. What if the reality as we know it exists only inside a dream then may be our minds could be confused by various deceptions. Descartes argues that if we cannot even tell for sure whether we are dreaming, then how can we know for certain any truth about the world in which we seem to live? The \u201cbrain in a jar\u201d thought experiment: Imagine that you are just a brain in a jar that is run by a higher power. How would you know? And can you truly deny the possibility that this is your reality? This is a question discussed by thinkers and scientists who, like most people, believe that one\u2019s understanding of reality depends solely on their subjective feelings. Conclusion: we cannot confirm the actual existence of anything except our consciousness. Time is an illusion\u200a\u2014\u200aEternalism: From philosophers to physicists, the nature of time has always inspired curiosity. The concept of time is simply an illusion made up of human memories, everything that has ever been and ever will be is happening right now. To answer the differences among the present, the past and the future, There are three competing theories. Presentists argue that only the present objects and present experiences are real, and we recognize this in the special vividness of our present experience. However, according to the growing-past theory, the past and present are both real, but the future is not real. The third theory is that there are no physical or objective differences among present, past, and future because the differences are merely subjective and come from us. This third theory is often called \u201cEternalism.\u201d Phenomenalism: Everyone is interested in knowing as to what happens to things when we aren\u2019t looking at them. Phenomenalism has a simple answer\u200a\u2014\u200athey disappear. Well, only because objects only exist as a phenomenon of consciousness. Quantum mechanics seem to favor phenomenalism. Quantum mechanics states that particles do not assume a specific velocity or position until they are observed. This strange behavior of matter particles would correspond with phenomenalism, since things would not exist in a definite form until observed. So, there is no existence without perception. The physical world exists only as sensory data in the perception of minds, and not as a substance or a thing in itself. ",
