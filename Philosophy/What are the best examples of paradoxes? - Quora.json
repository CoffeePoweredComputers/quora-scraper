            "answer_text": "In the 1940s and 1950s, it was common for astronomers and cosmologists to assume and speculate that the universe was probably teeming with intelligent life forms, and that our Milky Way galaxy alone probably had anywhere from 100,000 to 1,000,000 intelligent civilizations. In response to these optimistic estimates, Dr. Frank Drake formulated his famous Drake equation - Wikipedia that attempted to quantify this number scientifically. Most astronomers plugged in optimistic variables into the \u201cunknowns\u201d of the equation which resulted in estimates of (SURPRISE!) anywhere from 100,000 to 1,000,000 intelligent civilizations! This began an intense search for these intelligent civilizations, and efforts like SETI were born, see Search for extraterrestrial intelligence - Wikipedia. But as things turned out, none of those 100,000 to 1,000,000 intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way seemed to have sent out intelligent RF signals, automated light beacon signals, launched Von Neuman probes, built Dyson Spheres, etc., etc. In fact, the skies seemed \u201cdead\u201d when it came to detection of artificial, intelligent signals. Hell, some of those 100,000 to 1,000,000 intelligent civilizations MUST have developed interstellar travel by now, right? And colonized most of the galaxy by now, right? But all we found were stories and rumors from Roswell! And mutilated cattle. Or crop circles. Or supposed abductions (complete with anal probes!) Or phenomenal tales from Billy Meier - Wikipedia. But NO hard, convincing, objective evidence of aliens\u2026 So along comes Enrico Fermi - Wikipedia who dared asked the obvious question: if there are anywhere from 100,000 to 1,000,000 intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way, \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d And thus was born the corollary to the Drake Equation, the famous Fermi Paradox. But this paradox MIGHT be resolved, see Wolfgang Von Preusen's answer to What are some of the most interesting solutions to the Fermi Paradox?  ",

            "answer_text": "BOTTLE IMP PARADOX  Keawe, a poor Native Hawaiian, buys a strange bottle from a sad, elderly gentleman who credits the bottle with his fortune. He promises that an imp residing in the bottle will also grant Keawe his every desire.  Of course, there is a catch \u2014 the bottle must be sold at a loss, i.e. for less than its owner originally paid, or else it will magically return to him. The currency used in the transaction must also be in coin (not paper money or a bank cheque/check). The bottle may not be thrown or given away. All of these commands must be transmitted from each seller to each purchaser. If an owner of the bottle dies without having sold it in the prescribed manner, that person's soul will burn for eternity in Hell.  The bottle was said to have been brought to Earth by the Devil and first purchased by Prester John for millions; it was owned by Napoleon and Captain James Cook and accounted for their great successes. By the time of the story the price has diminished to fifty dollars. Keawe buys the bottle and instantly wishes his money to be refunded, to convince himself he has not been suckered. When his pockets fill with coins, he realizes the bottle does indeed have unholy power. He finds he cannot abandon it or sell it for a profit, so he wishes for his heart's desire: a big, fancy mansion on a landed estate. Upon his return to Hawaii, Keawe's wish has been granted, but at a price: his beloved uncle and cousins have been killed in a boating accident, leaving Keawe sole heir to his uncle's fortune. Keawe is horrified, but uses the money to build his house. After explaining the risks, he sells the bottle to a friend.Keawe lives a happy life, but there is something missing. Walking along the beach one night, he meets a beautiful woman, Kokua.  They soon fall in love and become engaged. Keawe's happiness is shattered on the night of his betrothal, when he discovers that he has contracted the then-incurable disease of leprosy. He must give up his house and wife, and live in Kalaupapa\u2014a remote community for lepers\u2014unless he can recover the bottle and use it to cure himself. Keawe begins this quest by attempting to track down the friend to whom he sold the bottle, but the friend has become suddenly wealthy and left Hawaii. Keawe traces the path of the bottle through many buyers and eventually finds a Haole of Beritania Street, Honolulu. The man of European ancestry has both good and bad news for Keawe: (a) he owns the bottle and is very willing to sell, but (b) he had only paid two cents for it. Therefore, if Keawe buys it, he will not be able to resell it.Keawe decides to buy the bottle anyway, for the price of one cent, and indeed cures himself. Now, however, he is understandably despondent: how can he possibly enjoy life, knowing his doom? His wife mistakes his depression for regret at their marriage, and asks for a divorce. Keawe confesses to her his secret.His wife suggests they sail, with the bottle, to Tahiti; on that archipelago the colonists of French Polynesia use centimes, a coin worth one-fifth of an American cent. This offers a potential recourse for Keawe.When they arrive, however, the suspicious natives will not touch the cursed bottle. Kokua determines to make a supreme sacrifice to save her husband from his fate. Since, however, she knows he would never sell the bottle to her knowingly, Kokua is forced to bribe an old sailor to buy the bottle for four centimes, with the understanding that she will secretly buy it back for three. Now Keawe is happy, but she carries the curse.Keawe discovers what his wife has done, and resolves to sacrifice himself for her in the same manner. He arranges for a brutish boatswain to buy the bottle for two centimes, promising he will buy it back for one, thus sealing his doom. However, the drunken sailor refuses to part with it, and is unafraid of the prospect of Hell. \"I reckon I'm going anyway,\" he says.Keawe returns to his wife, both of them free from the curse, and the reader is encouraged to believe that they live happily ever after.  \u201dBUT THERES A CATCH\u201dLike fairy stories \u201cThe Bottle Imp\u201d posits a clear contrast between good and evil, asserts the power of love and sacrifice in overcoming evil, and rewards its good characters with a lifetime of continuing happiness.Keawe rather innocently entangles himself with evil because he is so deeply impressed by the opulent house in San Francisco, but once he buys the bottle\u2014without quite realizing that he has done so\u2014he finds it difficult to disentangle himself from its evil.  The fact that his uncle and cousin die to leave him the land on which he builds his house and the coincidence that the cost of this house is exactly the sum that his uncle leaves him suggest that the evil imp in the bottle exacts a high price for his favors, but Robert Louis Stevenson does not insist on this point as the story develops. Having relied on the imp for his house, Keawe, perhaps naturally, seeks his help in curing his leprosy, but this time an important new motive has been added: Keawe would willingly resign himself to exile in the leper colony if it were not for his love of Kokua. The importance of love in opposition to evil is henceforth the main theme of the story.In Tahiti, Kokua, mindful that Keawe bought the bottle the second time because of his love for her, buys the bottle herself, willing to sacrifice her own soul for Keawe. When Keawe discovers what she has done, he resolves to purchase the bottle a third time to save his wife. This time, it is important to note, he is motivated by awareness of her sacrifice rather than by delight in her beauty; his infatuation seems to have deepened, Stevenson throughout the story emphasizes the stark reality of evil.  Lopaka and Keawe are figuratively \u201cturned to stone\u201d by the sight of the imp, and both Keawe and Kokua are cast in such despair by the prospect of an eternity in hell that they are unable to enjoy the love for which they have sacrificed themselves.
