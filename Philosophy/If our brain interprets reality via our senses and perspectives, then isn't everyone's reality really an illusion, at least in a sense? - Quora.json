            "answer_text": "In a sense, but in a somewhat narrow sense because the word \u201cillusion\u201d can also imply a deliberate effort to fool people, like a stage magician performing an illusion. I don\u2019t see any element of planning that we be this way, only perhaps a set of evolutionary advantages. We pretty much know that we are carrying around in our heads a map-like representation of the reality which is outside of our minds, and there are likely to be different versions of those representations which may make it difficult for two people from different environments to understand each other well. If we must refer to this condition as an illusion, we probably should add that it is a necessary one because it enables us to function in society. The foundation of this is the many shared narratives, especially reality narratives. To measure the power of this feeling in humans one need only test the loyalty people feel toward their favored reality narrative. Much of human history is written in red from brutal conflicts over differences in the prevailing reality narrative. We ought not underestimate the power of a favored reality narrative to garner fierce loyalty from us. Perhaps not everyone feels the same intense feeling of loyalty to their favored reality narrative, but many do feel it strongly and will defend that narrative tenaciously. This point may seem orthogonal to your question about us living an illusion, and I would say yes, but the connection between the two is via the internal discourse, where reality narratives actually play themselves out and make themselves felt, felt keenly I should add. And because the internal discourse includes the recital of shared narratives, and these shared narratives are what civil society runs on, so they are not trivial. They may or may not accurately represent physical reality, but those mental maps do serve an important purpose, which is why I am picking on your use of the word \u201cillusion\u201d. I prefer the word \u201csubjective\u201d and contrast / balance that with \u201cobjective\u201d, which describes the real world outside of our minds, the one we cannot perceive directly but only intuit to one degree or another.

            "answer_text": "This question is recurrent on Quora and starts from a conceptual error. Let us agree on the definition of an illusion: it is the false interpretation of what we perceive, or the perception of an appearance devoid of reality. The field of illusion tends to extend recklessly by replacing \"what we perceive (with the senses)\" by \"what our instruments perceive\". Reality then becomes radically different, to the point of eventually losing all substance and turning into pure equations. Does this mean that our usual interpretations of reality are illusions? Absolutely not. With two major arguments in support: 1) Evolution has made the human being and his sensory apparatus the animal most adapted to his material and social environment. Our social organization is extremely powerful. It has allowed the creation of the instruments capable of extending our senses. They are useful... only where our senses are ineffective and where we would tend to install beliefs. Not elsewhere. Try for example to find the companion for life using an electron microscope... 2) If one asserts that the reality of everyone is an illusion, then the same must be said of science. Authentic reality is an unknown. Our instruments and theories do the same thing as our senses: they put a mask on the essence of reality, without being able to know the nature of what they handle. The conception error is this: it is impossible to say that an interpretation is an illusion... by placing oneself at another level of reality. Our instruments do not see the same thing as our senses. They are designed as well. They extend our perceptions, without making false the previous ones. They establish correlations between the levels of reality. But it is not because we understand the physical functioning of vision that our eye starts to identify photons instead of people! Bringing our sensory interpretations of reality to their micro-mechanisms is called reductionism. It's a loss of power over reality, since most of its aspects are obliterated. There are no appearances devoid of reality. They necessarily have one since you realize it, and will eventually make decisions accordingly, turning a neural reality of appearance into material reality. It's the be-all and end-all of art\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many question like this,with the same premise, on Quora, all seemingly misunderstanding the difference between an illusion and a construction that can be tested and validated. An illusion based on sensory information is the result of that information leading to a perceptual/conceptual construct that doesn\u2019t really exist and you can prove that it doesn\u2019t. There are plenty of examples on Quora, or go to Wikipedia. Here a street art illusion:  You can readily test whether it is real by walking over it to sit\u2019 on the horse. Our normal construction of what is real out there based on sensory information relays on its veridicality precisely because it is subject to constant feedback (visual, tactile, auditory etc) to validate these constructs. As pointed out before in some of my answers, one sees the breakdown of this validation process whenever the normal channels of feedback are interrupted or altered as we find in hallucinations, drug induced states, or dreams.

If we both look at a scenery, both of us will have different prespective on how to interpret that scenery. That's why in every competitions and at the court, there are people chosen to be judges and in the court, we have juries. A single mind is not render valid as judge or a jury because the mind is not equip to make distinct conclusion. It is subject to make errors. Everything is subjective and no definite answers in this reality, everything is an illusion. ",
