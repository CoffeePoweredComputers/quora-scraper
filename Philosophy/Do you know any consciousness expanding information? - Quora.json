            "answer_text": "I think that the word Consciousness is all about what we perceive, how we perceive it, and what perspectives are available to us at the time. Some people grant that there must be a single universal consciousness but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case as you cannot experience the same exact experience as say\u2026 a lady bug, or a tree. Our understanding only goes so far and therefore it\u2019s an easy jump to make that we must have separate consciousnesses. Because we understand ourselves, and have the capability to do so. However, alternatively, most people have the power of sympathy or empathy, but truly these are extensions of how one imagines they would feel in the same circumstance. Thus we all have separate consciousnesses and therefore separate experiences. My reality cannot be your reality. But. our bodies are made of identical partials. So a connection does exist in the physical realm within all physical objects. Once you realize this, you can start to become more aware, and thus increasing your consciousness ",

            "answer_text": "There are those that recommend lysergic acid diethylamide\u2026. I would maintain that any \u201cexpansion\u201d of the consciousness is illusory. Psychedelics just make for different circuits to become active. Some folks recommend various meditation schemes\u2026 That there are effects seems undeniable, but as to whether these effects rise to the level of \u201cexpansion\u201d remains to be seen. ",

            "answer_text": "Information can\u2019t expand your consciousness, only experiences can. Psychedelics drugs can grant you access to different realms of reality, NDE can do the same. But you will not find consciousness expanding information anywhere. Information just doesn\u2019t have that specific function. ",
