            "answer_text": "No. Logic can only be applied if you assume some proposition to be true. However, this is no different from any calculus. You can only find that the sum of two numbers is 5, for example, if you know what these two numbers are. You may think that this is in contrast with empirical knowledge. After all, I know there is a tree in my garden just by looking. Apparently, I don\u2019t need to make any assumption or admit of anything prior to looking. And if I look, I will see the tree in my garden. Well, yes, but you will not know that this is a tree unless you had somehow learned to recognise that what you see is a tree. Empirical knowledge is essentially layers of logic so thick we cannot see through them and yet they are there. You will see a tree because of something very much like (A \u2192 B) \u2227 A \u22a2 B, only much, much more complicated. Thus, we know that (A \u2192 B) \u2227 A \u22a2 B is true without knowing what A and B stand for. We don\u2019t need to. In fact, here, they don\u2019t stand for anything at all. They are vacuous forms, and they form another form, here the form of the Modus ponens. (A \u2192 B) \u2227 A \u22a2 B, with in this metaphor, is the tree (and all logical formulas are trees). We all think we know what a tree is, and yet none of us actually knows what a tree is ultimately made of. How could we possibly know a tree if we don\u2019t know what it is really made of? So, no, we don\u2019t know what a tree is, we merely recognise trees, which only means that we are able to see that this thing I am looking at now is very similar to something else I have previously learned is a tree. So, I recognise trees without knowing what a tree is in reality. Thus, empirical knowledge works like logic: This thing is a tree if what I remember as a tree is really a tree. So, every second of our life, we have to assume our beliefs are true to be able to decide what we better do now, just to stay alive and comfortable. It works well enough for you if you are still reading this piece. ",

Possibly not - but that\u2019s my point, we can still muddle along admitting that even if we cannot be 100% certain of anything & still have pretty good grounds to assume all sorts of things are very probably true none the less. The advantage of always appreciating that we might be wrong about pretty much anything is that it keeps us vigilant with regard to any errors of judgement we may have made because we\u2019re still open to hearing that there may be something we\u2019ve missed of assumed. That\u2019s what make science so powerful & allows it to error correct: because no scientific idea is ever ever ever considered \u2018true\u2019. If there\u2019s independently verifiable evidence for it then it\u2019s considered\u2026 \u2018fact\u2019? No! Never! It\u2019s considered theory but not \u2018theory\u2019 in the conventional sense of the word like \u2018guess\u2019.

Just probably true as far as we know. e.g. Newton\u2019s Theory of Gravity, Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution, Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity etc. i.e. Science is certain of nothing & demands evidence of everything - however religion is certain of everything & demands evidence of nothing. - So which is more humble science or religion?

            "answer_text": "Yes, the truths that can be proven without any assumptions are known as validities. They are statements that hold in all models of the terms used. All statements that have \u201ccontent\u201d, in a certain sense of \u201ccontent\u201d, require premises that also have content. But validities can be interesting. The deduction theorem says that being able to prove a statement QQ from premises P1,\u2026,PnP1,\u2026,Pn is equivalent to being able to prove (P1\u2227\u2026\u2227Pn)\u2192Q(P1\u2227\u2026\u2227Pn)\u2192Q without any premises.
