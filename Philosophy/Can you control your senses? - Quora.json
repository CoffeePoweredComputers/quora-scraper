            "answer_text": "Of course, and on many levels. The ability to focus is the ability to ignore - you can decide to shut out some of your senses, and train senses to resolve more information or to discard it. \u201cMindfulness\u201d training like meditation can improve sensation, or any activity focused on one or more senses. There is mounting evidence that all perception and intelligence is learned, and that your cognitive abilities are directly related to the quality of sensory inputs particularly over your formative years from the third trimester of pregnancy to puberty. This indicates that the warped sensory information of the post-industrial age is developmentally retarding the brains of people raised in \u201cdeveloped\u201d economies full of chemical, visual and noise pollution, and those who are in locations that are environmentally degraded to serve the needs of civilization like croplands and the drought ridden deserts that eventually result when crops are sold. Staring at telephone, computer and television screens or flat surfaces with uniform color like walls degrades your vision; listening to motors, speakers and headphones degrades your hearing; industrial food chain degrades your taste and smell, as does breathing indoor air and the pollution of fossil fuels. You can conversely improve your senses by spending time off-grid in forests, canyons, jungles and shores away from roads, flight paths, marinas, shipping lanes, etc. Nature is fractal and our brains mirror the fractal complexity by growing neurons, wiring and programming them in objects with up to eleven dimensions to recognize it. Taking in only flat, rectangular images and scalar electronic sounds reduces the complexity and meaning of sensation to a tiny fraction of human potential. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, both with and without drugs. You can get dramatic effects just by sensory overload (attend rock concert and time how long your eyes ears and nose take to recover) and sensory avoidance (in isolation tank, for example). or just take a suitable drug in suitable dose. my favorite is carbon monoxide, which our bodies make 24/7 in low doses and use to modulate the nerve action firing potential of all our sensory nerves. High CO exposure will dull all your senses quickly (leaving you literally senseless in a coma if not dead), while chronic low level exposure such as from sustained poisoning of tissues will make all your senses hypervigilant, so you notice everything all the time and can\u2019t habituate to any stimuli. I call this MUSES syndrome for multi-sensory sensitivity. the good news is that \u2014short of death\u2014both outcomes are reversible when treated as CO poisoning. Not everyone wants to get rid of MUSES however. many people with autism symptoms consider sensory hypersensitivity to be a key part of who they are and they don\u2019t want to treat or cure it. Same with some who developed this as adults and call it \u201cHSP\u201d (for highly sensitive people ) ",

            "answer_text": "If you don't control your senses, the media will do it for you! Each time I try to be more self aware about the things I choose to hear and to see. Our senses are like tools. We connect with things according to our beliefs and sadly sometimes according to disrupted feelings or disorganised thoughts. It has to do with the value of time as well, the way one use time to invest itself in something sane. ",
