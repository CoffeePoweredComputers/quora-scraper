            "answer_text": "Experience is not necessarily gained by age. People might undergo experience but that does not mean that they actually learn anything from it. Look at how many people make the same mistakes over and over - for example women falling in love with and get hurt with the same type of men, or with men. Or men undergoing the same thing. I do not understand how experience can be gained with knowledge? Knowledge might be gained through experience. Often knowing that something is the case, obtaining data and information is distinguished from learning how to do something, like swimming, riding a bike, driving a vehicle, do better at a sport and other skills. I think as someone does or practices these and other skills or knowing how to do something, through experience they will improve on those activities. This is the reason why someone has dance classes, driving lessons, swimming lessons, piano and singing and acting classes, go to schools etc. ",
