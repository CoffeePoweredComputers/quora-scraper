            "answer_text": "Q: Doesn't the mere fact that the universe, matter, time, reality, or anything that irrefutably exists mean that some\"thing\" HAD to have created it? A: No. There are quite a lot of models that work quite fine without something creating them. The problem is that we can\u2019t prove which one of them, if any, is right. The idea that some \u201cthing\u201d \u201chad to create it\u201d is anthropomorphising the unknown, to make it into a person. It\u2019s actually a sign that we still have a brain focused on telling stories, rather than understanding physics and mathematics. Terry Pratchett once argued that we should not call ourselves Homo sapiens, the wise man; but rather Pan narrans, the storytelling ape. Q: Even the singularity must've come from something else, right? A: To answer that, we must first learn a few things about singularities. Singularities are problem points in mathematics. It\u2019s often undefined or tends towards infinity, or both. 1/0 is a singularity.In physics, singularities often means that there is something fishy with your theory.So where does the singularity come from? In the late 1920s, Georges Lema\u00eetre (physicist, astronomer, mathematician, and Jesuit priest) played around with Einstein\u2019s General Relativity. Like Alexander Friedmann before him, he figured out that General Relativity predicted that the universe could not be static, which was the paradigm of the time. Instead, Lema\u00eetre showed that given the field equations of General Relativity the universe must have had the volume zero at some point in the past. That would also lead to infinite density. It\u2019s a typical singularity in mathematics, and thus a problem point. So when Lema\u00eetre presented his idea to the scientific world, including Einstein, it was not well received for three reasons: it was against the paradigm of the time, there was a singularity in it, and it sounded suspiciously much like creation. Not that long after, Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies were rushing apart. That had the effect that the scientific community started to accept this new paradigm, and that Einstein apologised to Lema\u00eetre. With the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, the case was basically closed. Except for the singularity, which still remains a problem point. It\u2019s not the only one in physics: black holes are another, and there used to be one called the \u201cUV catastrophe\u201d. The problem with the UV catastrophe is that classical blackbody theory didn\u2019t work, and would lead to all matter instantaneously radiating all their energy to near absolute zero and mostly in the ultraviolet range. The solution to that problem was in the then fledgling idea of quantum mechanics: that energy would radiate in form of discrete packets called quanta. We call these particular quanta of electromagnetic energy \u201cphotons\u201d today. That solved the UV catastrophe, removed the problem point/singularity, and everyone could breathe easily. The same probably is the case of the Big Bang: the singularity at the beginning remains a problem point, but currently there is not a solution to it. Until we have a solution, we cannot figure out anything about the singularity or even if there actually was a real \u201ceverything divided by zero\u201d point in the history of the universe. Since Lema\u00eetre toyed with Einstein\u2019s General Relativity, we have had great advances in quantum mechanics. It allows us for instance to make computers that work, like the one you are reading this text on. Just like the UV catastrophe was solved by quantising electromagnetism, perhaps the solution to the singularity lies in quantising gravity of General Relativity. The problem is that we don\u2019t have a theory on quantum gravity. Until we do, we can\u2019t know what happened at the earliest moments of the universe. We can\u2019t even tell if there actually was a singularity. We have a few ideas of what happened before, including that our big bang is the other side of a black hole in a previous universe; that our universe came from a collapse of a previous universe; that there is an eternal inflaton field in which our universe is a slowly-expanding stable (from our point of view) bubble; and my personal favourite, that you can regard gravity as negative energy potential and if you sum up all matter and energy and gravity, you get the sum zero. In the last idea, the zero-energy universe, the universe could not only come from nothing, but would actually still be nothing, only unevenly distributed. All of these models, and more, works fine with physics as we know it, and does not require some \u201cthing\u201d that \u201ccreated\u201d it. In each of these models, it just happened. The problem is that we just can\u2019t test those models, because we lack a way to go around the problem point that comes from General Relativity. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, yes and no. We do not live in a strictly \u201ccause & effect\u201d universe. Much of the time, from our extremely limited perspective, it seems that way, and so we tend to assume that it is that way, a predetermined, deterministic, mechanistic kind of a universe where everything had a cause, everything is predictable, and you can backwards engineer everything that happens, in principle, to see what caused it to happen. But we live in a relativistic, quantum, chaotic, complex universe, and it is especially quantum. That means that things are not predetermined and are probabilistic rather than predictable. Chaos Theory also has a role to play in unpredictability, since it has been found to extend to the quantum level. The quantum butterfly effect, if you will. So the universe does not have to be caused in a Newtonian, classic sense. The singularity didn\u2019t have to come from anything, especially since it seems to have \u201cexisted\u201d outside of space, time and the laws of physics, which isn\u2019t even existence the way that we define and experience it. But since we do live in a universe with certain characteristics, we can look at those to see if they suggest a \u201csomething\u201d that might be behind it all. And there are several things that do offer that suggestion: Big Bang/Inflation itself, everything coming from nothing in a tiny fraction of a second (I put inflation in there even though it is increasingly being challenged), fine-tuning (all of the laws of physics lining up just so in a phenomenal way, observer-dependency (gotta have an observer in a quantum universe), and an interactional/relational universe where everything we think is something is actually nothing but physical interactions acting persistently like there is something. So, truth is, everything didn\u2019t come from nothing. Nothing came from nothing, but the nothing that is here acts like something persistently enough to fool us. Those would be the clues that There is Something Going On Out There That Might Be a Lot Like God, only not the silly little gods that atheists like to disparage and humans like to worship, by and large. A really respectable God who is outside of time, space and the laws of physics, who observed it all into being and ordered it in such a way, for some bizarre reason, to produce intelligent sentient observers.

            "answer_text": "As worded, the answer is \u201cno\", and \u201cin a way, sort of\". I say \u201cno\" to the first question because of the use of the word \u201chad\", and it's implication of a volitional act of Creation or creation (the capital \u2018C\u2019 does make a difference). The only two things that HAVE to exist in the observable world of phenomena are an observer and phenomena. This obtains even if all phenomena are contained within the observer (which automatically brings up the matter of a phenomena requiring at least two states in order to be observable, implying the the phenomena and the onserver both are infinitely divisible, that all observers exist as an observer within another observer split off by the nature of observation from the world of phenomena solely by virtue of observing. This would indicate the the observer's distinction of themselves as being seperate from the world of phenomena would actually be an illusion of separateness generated by, and necessitating, an act of observation and thus division within the larger observer within which the distinction between an observer and the world of phenomena can be observed to exist. That is pretty straightforward, right? Now things start to get tricky, you might want to take a deep breathe before we go on (actually that is almost always suggestable). Now, the observer obseving the observer and world of phenomena that is contained within themselves ( because where else COULD an observation be but eithin the observer, because the observation is not the phenomena, and unless it is retained within the observer, it has not been observed), must inevitably given enough time observing the totality of the world of phenomena and observer within themself, which represent the totality of the world of phenomena that they have observed, PLUS all variations of that totality of which they are able to concieve, arrive at an inevitable conclusion. If they consider the totality of phenomena and observers and variant conceptions within themselves, which had to have had their derivations from the observers observations ( because where else could they have derived from?) Inevitaby they will come to a conception which is incomplete based on all of their observations. Trying to encompass that conception within themselves in it's totality poses a conumdrum that is rather challenging. (The suggestion of breathing pertains throghout all of this, by the way, continuation of the intake of breath which was called by the ancient Greeks \u2018spiritus' is important in being able to continue concieving and observing) As the observer concieves of the totality of all that they have observed or conceived and attempts to conceive of a point from which they might themselves be observed they are establishing a vector from the totality of what they contain in totality. To whatever extent their conceptualization of the world of phenomena in which they exist is incomplete, that vector inevitably curves and directs itself back into their conceptualization of the worl\u010f in which they exist, because to be able to properly format the question which is that vector the totality of the conceptuaization of the world of phenomena inclusive of themselves as observer must be complete if not to the detail at least in terms of being capable of accurately infering things which have not been directly observed. Having done so, accomplishing a working internal totality of the world inclusive of the observer ( which for the sake of completeness must count the observer as being the sum of all observers and observations) has the conumdrum that while for an instant they may be able to come close to holding a conceptualization that is adequate to provide a beginning point for the vector that is a question directed towards that which has not been observed, given another instant the requirement of having a complete conception based upon all observations including observation and conceptuaizations by neccessity expands and must include the conceptualization of the immediately preceding world, plus the inclusion of the present world of phenomena inclusive of the point of the observer from which point a conceptualization is being formed. The observer being counted as the sum of all observers encompassing the observable world of phenomena must then either increase in resolution their conceptuaization of expand in order to encompass the larger world that they must encompass. I hope that you can derive a useful answer to your question from that, I am reaching my limit, it almost seems like I have been writing forever. I did my best to at leadt provide the raw material from which you can derive a rough direction that you can work from, but I fear that if I keep on going with this, it will start to go around in increasingly smaller circles without ever really getting to a point that you could work out from, and if from there I had gone over everything already, what would be the point? It would be completly zero, and where would you go from there? Look at all that has been written, and it has yet to get anywhere, we are at the same place, maybe with a bit more novelty in terms of how to look at your question, but at this point I can't even remember the diection I was headed when I started. I wish that I could have been more help, but please, keep on asking questions. It never hurts to expand your horizons, dnd even if you don't make it all of the way you might learn things that you can bring back to make the world bigger for all of us. Just don't forget to stop and breathe and look around to enjoy where you are. All you have is time, and as long as you have some sort of direction, what more do you need? ",

In response, some religious people assert, with a tinge of righteousness, that something must have started it all: a force greater than all others, a source from which everything issues. A prime mover. In the mind of such a person, that something is, of course, God. But what if the universe was always there, in a state or condition we have yet to identify\u2014a multiverse, for instance, that continually births universes? Or what if the universe just popped into existence from nothing? Or what if everything we know and love were just a computer simulation rendered for entertainment by a superintelligent alien species? These philosophically fun ideas usually satisfy nobody. Nonetheless, they remind us that ignorance is the natural state of mind for a research scientist. People who believe they are ignorant of nothing have neither looked for, nor stumbled upon, the boundary between what is known and unknown in the universe. What we do know, and what we can assert without further hesitation, is that the universe had a beginning. The universe continues to evolve. And yes, every one of our body\u2019s atoms is traceable to the big bang and to the thermonuclear furnaces within high-mass stars that exploded more than five billion years ago. We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out\u2014and we have only just begun. ",

            "answer_text": "It is all quite simple really :- To answer the question why there is SOMETHING rather than NOTHING leads to the answer that there is actually NOTHING Except that Mathematics still exists 1 + 1 will still = 2 The universe is simply a set of rules under which a calculation is performed. It does not exist but the concept of the universe ( under that set of rules) does exist. We are just one of the results of this calculation after it has been calculated to a point equating to about 14 Billion years. (N.B. Time does not really exist but is one of the rules of the calculation). There is no difference from our point of view to living in a REAL PHYSICAL UNIVERSE and to living in the mathematical concept of a universe, We can not tell the difference. Consciousness is local to one point and time in the model. Most points will have very little or none but for a few points which coincide with a critical part of a brain or possibly of a computer they have access to much more data through memory cells linked to that point Obviously a universe can be defined by many rules and a starting condition. Therefore there are an infinite number of universes but only a small percentage will evolve to the point that we experience. This might seem depressing that there is no meaning of life, but then again it should make you feel special that you are part of an amazing formula that is greater than even our universe. Maybe in a greater universe there are people who study the results of our universes calculation as we may live in the simplest possible universe that supports conscious life. There is a possibility of a \u201cGod\u201d as something called a Boltzmann Brain, in which a brain/computer spontaneously appears by chance and then could run a simulation of the universe that we experience. I dont think this is very likely in our universe but it is a possiblity. ",

            "answer_text": "In order for our physical universe to exist, there must be at least five pre-requisite components which are time, space, matter, energy and all physical laws. None of these could arise from literally nothing. Such an idea defies logic and physics. These five components require a supernatural causation, which is God. Our universe is highly ordered. It clearly did not arise from some big bang event. If such a big bang event occurred, what banged it ? What was it that got banged ? Its an illogical premise to believe that a big bang suddenly happened. Where did the energy come from ? Where did the thing that got banged come from ? Furthermore, prior to this imagined big bang, all of the above mentioned components must have existed first. The problem with secular theory is that it assumes that these five components pre-existed, but it never ascertains the origin of these five components. Individuals believe what they prefer to believe, not necessarily what is true. The belief in alien life is a good example of this. There is no proof of alien life on other planets. None. But individuals still continue to believe in aliens. They want to believe in aliens. They don\u2019t need proof. But this seems contradictory and hypocritical, because when confronted with the idea of God\u2019s existence, these same individuals deny God\u2019s existence because of lack of proof. Jesus saves.

See Big Bang - Wikipedia; Option 2 has some logical problems, in that an infinitely regressing sequence of causes ought to exist for some reason, a meta-cause if you will. But the meta-cause itself cannot be the result of an infinite regression; and Option 3 indicates some sort of thing which exists outside of our universe of matter, energy, time an space, and is itself uncaused.

            "answer_text": "This remains one of the most enduring arguments for the existence of God, because people seem to have a really hard time understanding it. We know there was a Big Bang. We know a surprising amount about the state of the universe just after that point. But we don\u2019t know anything about what caused it, or what came before. There is no data. The idea that something started the universe is compelling. The danger here is that you call this something the First Cause or the Prime Mover and then it ends up being called God (which sounds reasonable\u2026) but then it gets conflated with the Christian God and all the mythology that comes with it. I\u2019d rather call the start of the universe something like Fred. Nobody would worship a Fred. But here\u2019s the problem. If there was something that started the universe off, where did that something come from? You\u2019ve essentially got three options. The something was always there (eternal).The something was created by something else.There was no something - the universe came from nothing.In the first case, you\u2019ve got another problem. Eternal things don\u2019t change. They can\u2019t. If something changes, it isn\u2019t there any more - a new thing is there instead. And for our universe to be created means something changed - our eternal force went from being force alone to force + universe. (Or, to put it in simpler terms, why would Fred spend an eternity sitting around doing nothing and then one day decide to make a universe? What triggered that decision? And why did he wait?) In the second case, you\u2019ve got a recursion problem. If Fred was created by another force (let\u2019s call it Wilma), where did Wilma come from? Oh, Betty made Wilma. So who made Betty? And so on\u2026 now you have an infinite regress. In the third case, you\u2019ve got the same problem as the first but without the eternal force. Rather than God randomly deciding to make a universe for no reason, the universe just happens for no reason. (This is actually a better explanation than God making a sudden decision - it\u2019s fundamentally the same, but simpler, as God isn\u2019t involved - but it still has the same central issue.) Some physicists have a simple explanation for all this, though it isn\u2019t very satisfying. They suggest that there is no \u201cbefore\u201d. Time started with the Big Bang. Nothing caused it, because there was no time before it TO cause it. Then there\u2019s the idea of a cyclical universe - the Big Bang was the result of a Big Crunch, when the previous universe died and collapsed back into a singularity. One day ours will do the same, and a new universe will be born. This is my favourite, though there\u2019s still absolutely no evidence to support it over any other idea. In summary - we don\u2019t know, and don\u2019t believe anyone who claims they do. ",

The one and only logical postulate is that the pure energy source of the cosmos has always been there. When this source vibrates, the cosmos emerges. In fact the vibration of pure energy source creates the subject and the object simultaneously. Without a subject to perceive, there is no cosmos existent in its own right.

Because all our experiences show that all things have a beginning within our realm of existence. But, we are talking about before the beginning of our realm.

Even the singularity must've come from something else, right? If the universe obeyed Classical physics, you might be able to build a case for that. But we know the universe is not classical.

You have just increased the apparent complexity of the system without solving anything. My guess is that time, which we do not understand at all, is more complex than we can see from our limited view point, and wraps around in some way that does not need a start point. But that is just my guess. ",
