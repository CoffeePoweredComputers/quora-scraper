            "answer_text": "A high IQ is an indirect indication that you most likely have a higher intelligence than the average person. You can\u2019t measure intelligence directly. It\u2019s much too complex for that, as intelligence can mean a number of different things. The general consensus is that intelligence refers to a set of mental skills which are applicable to a range of tasks and where an individual with \u201chigher\u201d intelligence is more able to complete such tasks or to complete them faster and more efficiently than a \u201clower\u201d intelligence individual. So some clever people sat down and came up with a set of tests which increase in difficulty, which need to be completed within a given time frame. Most people won\u2019t be able to complete all the tests on a page / screen within that given timeframe, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s how far you get that counts and ultimately translates into an IQ \u201cscore\u201d. And that\u2019s basically what an IQ test is. It is generally assumed that a higher score on an IQ test correlates with higher overall intelligence. But you IQ score is not a direct measure of your intelligence. The important thing that many people (judging by the questions asked here on Quora) fail to understand is that your IQ score is simply a measure of how well you performed on the IQ test. It is not a direct measure of your intelligence. It also has absolutely no meaning with regards to how employable you are, whether you should be admitted to a prestigious university or whether you somehow \u201cdeserve\u201d any sort of special treatment. Essentially, your IQ score is meaningless, and people who brag about their score are sorry figures. I mean, if all they have to brag about is an abstract score, instead of real-life achievements, than I think they should stop bragging and get a life. I don\u2019t know my IQ score and honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less. Question as originally answered: Does a high IQ mean intelligence? ",

            "answer_text": "Intelligence is a broad word. Personality is another word, unrelated to intelligence. An intelligent person with a bad personality can appear to be stupid to others. Now, I've met all types of people. People with low IQs, people with average IQs, and people with high IQs. This is what I have observed over time: People with low IQs tend to be very rude, dismissive, unempathetic and incapable of putting themselves in other people's shoesThey lack concept and depthAs for average people, I have observed that: They have a hard time thinking outside the box and they constantly need to be told what to doThey think that creativity is something related to art, not the ability to think abstractlyAs for people with high IQs I have observed that: They sometimes struggle with fitting in because they haven't found their niche yetSome of them struggle with depressionSome of them are psychopathsSome of them are narcissistsSome of them lack empathy because they are tired of being the smartest person in the roomSome of them do drugs to alleviate boredomSome of them are lazy or have unhealthy habits because they are used to the instant gratification of being smart and being able to learn things 10x faster than the average personAll of this might lead to smart people developing \u201cpoor\u201d personalities, making them appear to be stupid in certain ways. Does a high IQ mean someone is more intelligent? Logically, spatially, verbally, and visually: yes. Wise; makes good decisions? Not necessarily. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on your definition of intelligence. Each person has their own idea of what intelligence is. More often than not intelligence is an illusion, masked by soooo many variables and biases. Our beliefs affect who or what we consider to be intelligent, our understanding, political views,.... because of all of these biases it is nearly impossible to find a definition of intelligence. What it is important to remember is that while iq does not mean a person is more knowledgeable, better at school, going to earn more and it doesn't mean the person is going to act smarter, it does have some correlation with understanding.IQ is about (mostly) pattern recognition, which means people with higher IQs may have an easier time understanding certain topics because they can see the logical pattern behind it.A person with a high iq is not smarter than a normal person simply because of their iq, and assuming so is false. Regardless iq is not worthless either. Hard work beats out IQ. Which does not mean that iq is a useless measurement.  Many times people will state that iq is a bad measure of intelligence. This is true, but only because it is poorly named (intelligence quotient). This suggests that it measures the intelligence of a person, which it doesn't but rather it measures the capacity and rate of understanding. (This is very simplified!!!) ",

            "answer_text": "(A2A) Yes, it only pegs raw intelligence, not what you are likely to do with it.  An IQ score is just one metric. By itself, it does not say what you are likely to learn or where you will excel, or predict how likely it is you will enjoy some success, whether you define success as earning money or achieiving a high position or having an impact of a kind that solves problems out in the world. Those details are up to you and what you do or don't choose to pursue. If you studied as many high IQs as you could find, I also suspect you would see clusters of higher highs and lower lows across the whole group, if that makes sense. Perhaps more stellar test scores, more out of box thinking, more advanced degrees, more high quality authoring or skillful problem solving etc -- but also more complicated personal issues ranging from social relations and loneliness to problems with physical and mental health. Thus, the net effect in the aggregrate might be a picture just as varied as the rest of the population, but for different reasons. From what I have seen up close, high IQ is (generally) not a ticket to a life of easy high accomplishment, but just as often leads to a life of added complication and effort. ",

Are you conversant with the problems that the overall intellectual community deals with and thinks about, and can you write books that they will read and take seriously? Do you think \u201cCONCEPTUALLY\" in addition to having a broad knowledge base that includes a lot of histotical and scientific knowledge? Are you conversant in the sciences and the problems confronting the sciences? A high IQ is not necessarily required for any of this, but you can't get away with just writing about history. Your writing needs to be of an ABSTRACT and CONCEPTUAL nature, and you need to be conversant with all the issues that other intellectuals are dealing with. Can you seriously think about these and write CONCEPTUAL books that other brilliant intellectuals will be reading, criticizing, and gaining knowledge from? Someone who just sits in their apartment and thinks of things while feeling they're curious about the universe does not, thereby, demonstrate that they have what it takes to be an intellectual. Someone who knows enough about history to write books based on a lot of facts is NOT, thereby, an intellectual. Can you write books based on your own CONCEPTUAL independent thought that other intellectuals, such as Noam Chomsky or Richard Dawkins (as well as their religious equivalents) will take seriously? Can you debate with them for several hours about the problems confronting the world? Have you read all of the major philosophers? What do you know about exo-biology and astronomy? What do you know about science, as well as everything that is taking place in the sciences? Can you THINK about all this and write books that other intellectuals will read and take seriously? It is not enough to be knowledgeable. You must have profound CONCEPTUAL and ABSTRACT thinking abilities on top of a massive knowledge base. You will need to have a profound knowledge of the Ancient Greeks and their philosophy and science, in addition to profound knowledge about the modern world. You will have passed through Marxism and many of the philosophies in your thinking over time, you will have been both a THEIST and an ATHEIST at some point, and that's only the tip of the ice berg. But it is the ABSTRACT AND CONCEPTUAL nature of your thinking which distinguishes you as an intellectual, rather than just being an academic or knowledgeable person. Look at some philosophical texts, or simply books by Noam Chomsky, Thomas Sowell, Carl Sagan, Jacob Bronowsky or more recent intellectuals. Are you capable of writing those books? Would philosophers read your books and take them seriously? Could you debate with a Jordan Peterson or a Thomas Sowell for several hours and potentially win the debate? Could you go back in time and debate Hegel and Plato for several hours and stand a chance of winning the debate? and so on \u2026 ",

While I am against the idea of IQ entirely, I will say that YES it does have it\u2019s uses in determining certain aspects of intellect, but you cannot derive full intelligence from such a small pool of variables. I am what you would call an intellectual, but my IQ is only slightly above average. I read books on a lot of things and while my memory is poor, I can effectively take my knowledge and expand upon it in deeper thought once I figured out a cool memory trick. You see, unless you\u2019re mentally handicapped, IQ is almost meaningless with no work put into it which is the case with a lot of people whom I know, but you don\u2019t need a High IQ to be extremely smart or arguably even moderately intelligent. So no, if you invest your time wisely and dedicate yourself to your studies and/or interests, you\u2019ll most likely come off as very smart and \u201cintellectual\u201d, because you are! ",

Okay, the book gives understanding that emotional intelligence (EQ) is more important than IQ. It explains that we respond events fast using EQ, then the IQ give response after it. The book not only gives the explanation but also gives the real examples of events that happened. One of examples is father that falsely shoot his child because of thinking that there was robber in his home. If we can't use our EQ wisely, we ended up with regretting what we've done. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. For when it comes to emotions (understanding them at a social level), spirituality, to having an amount of knowledge, no. If you are talking about how fast you learn of things and figure them out, yes (aside from kinesthetic pursuits, which more is bodily memory).. I do not have to study as hard, I do not have to read very much, and I ahead of time know the answer before most would\u2026 I figure out things through piecing them together.. As an example, I will give you this: If someone is saying you are having poor boundaries by overwhelming them and claims you are abusing them, and then they say you are overwhelming someone else, but never outright say you abused them, you can logically conclude that they would also think you are abusing the said other person. I can fill in blanks, but at more abstract levels than this.. Soduku is a good example; if a 7 is in the grid or above you in the row or further down in the row, 7 does not there belong in that grid or in that strip of line. that os how I think at a subconscious level. Another example is that I did not have to learn or read about how I attain information; I observed my own self\u2014that I observe, think of possibility, recognize patterns and connect. I see intricacies and how things interrelate. I think outside the box\u2014 what if gnats are machines disguised as gnats, disguised so I do not think they are machines and this is a conspiracy?.. That is how I think, aside from connecting things through my observation as well as brain storming sometimes. Most people would need to spend years learning about psychology to possess of the degree I of it know, whereas I am not even yet graduated of high school and have not read much of it; just, pieced things together through analysis of my own self and others, and reading basic, basic information. I just require a lesser effort. I can piece together that a narcissist uses pride as a mask to fulfill a low self esteem; it is not something I need read, I knowing it is a maladaptive tactic, can figure that out. That is why I have such a breadth of knowledge in psych; I always fill in the blank. You\u2019ll as an example see inmost questions even I ask on Quora, I have an explanatory second question, as if I almost already know the answer and am just looking for verification of whether or not my conclusions are correct. As an example:What causes water to spread? Is it the force of hitting the surface it falls upon, or perhaps more specifically, gravity? and Why does the brain not process nightmares the same as real life trauma, since nightmares also can feel so real? Is it because the brain is aware it is in a sleep state, or perhaps different brain parts activate?.. This is what I mean as in I fill in the blanks; I question and then look for possible explanation. That is my inherent nature. I do not need to read something to learn about it; I observe my thought (unless it is about specific facts, like for instance, the composition of a Quartz crystal. Then I will need read to attain that info).. Use logic, thinking about possibilities and observation to deduct a conclusion. I do not want to give you principles I have observed existent, and made my own system out of it, but I as an example, will figure if there is a storm nearby, and there is a fire, lightning must have struck and created fire. If someone cannot unscrew a cap, I will first try that, and if it does not work, pull upward instead (find a different way to do it). If I cannot undo a locker with a scroll set up, I will presume I put off the locker by one number and scroll each the digits up and down one than the originally intended combination. I do not need to read a system to understand how something works; I can figure it out my own self through pondering my own thought and through observation (it is hard to explain this without giving information for a book I am writing). It is hard for me to explain, but in a simple answer: I need lesser work to attain knowledge and information. Most the information I get, I discover through the self of my own; my inner logical reasoning and pondering thought. (Me enclosing furthermore examples would disclose theories and systems I have created that I have not yet copyrighted, and I have entitled briefly of them enough in answers and questions I have asked which I should not have done). Most people are not as good as identifying patterns as per say, someone with a high IQ as myself is, which thus leads them to not as readily understand things. Knowledge is different and can accumulate through repetition. You can be an equivalent in terms of success with the knowledge; that is the end result. It is a matter of possessing the knowledge, how fast you get it does not matter unless perhaps you are in timed conditions or need right on the spot understand of such (makes it beneficiary in things like psychology, law, science, writing, etc). So.. Does IQ determine success? Not necessarily. There are plentiful examples of high IQ individuals who were less than successful. There are mostly average people IQ in our society.. Most are doing fine, living a stable, bountiful life. Though perhaps, living blindly as to the dysfunctions blatant to me, in our world, and I cannot help but want rectify and for some, eradicate them. I have a high IQ, and I wouldn't say I am successful, though childhood abuse and coupled disorders from it are the reasoning as to why. Otherwise, I very much would by now, be, as even teachers had recognized and I won a state award, which this answer is not for telling, but it is in my currently pinned (also of 09\u201301\u201320, may not in future be) answer. If you want to define success by Quora, I certainly would say I am on here, successful in a degree (QPP member, more than 100 followers attained each month, made a few decently supportive friendships, documented my abuse with proof which can help in legality should I ever need of it, many answers put in the Quora Digest, etc), but other than that, no.

Of course, being very intelligent does not make you knowledgeable (a very intelligent baby will still need to learn how to talk, walk, etc), nor does it protect you from making mistakes, even really stupid ones (in fact, making mistakes is how humans learn; if you don\u2019t make mistakes the topic is too easy for you), Being very intelligent isn\u2019t always a boon either: our society is geared for the average brain (since most people ARE average), and very smart people can have trouble fitting in, just like for example very tall people (try finding a car if you\u2019re 7 foot tall: a big car just means a bigger console and often even *less* room to squeeze your legs!). School is a good example where many gifted children run into trouble because the material is not suited to them. If this is you, read up on giftedness (IQ130+) from as many different sources as you can find, and see what applies to you. There\u2019s good sides and bad sides, but as usual, knowing what the problem is is half the solution. ",

Now, if those tests were effective, could we not go observe such? Even then, we get into interpretation. And IQ, many times, goes ego (super-ego). Not all.  Unfortunately, the counter view of EQ has the wrong acronym. E for ego?  But, let's say that we say that IQers rock after a certain point (and hold our noses as we do so). Why is it that some little bit of humanity would be so endowed (there are many ways to be endowed, by the way) thus? Ah, age-old question.  My additional would be this: how can we keep those whose abilities allow them to have a very wide sphere of influence in check (oh Lord, deliver us)?   ",

A high score (at or above 115) on legitimate IQ tests generally means high intelligence for aspects related to academic achievement and success in employment contexts. HOWEVER, a high IQ does not guarantee that one will actually perform well in school or on the job. What is also required are many personality traits related to industriousness (working hard, consistently), perseverance (not giving up in the face of failure), sincerity, humility, sensitivity to the feelings of others and other character traits. There are many aspects of what is considered intelligent behavior which is not measured by traditional and legitimate IQ tests. IQ tests have a very specific purpose in the 20th and 21st century. I\u2019ve written succinctly about those purposes several times already. Feel free to peruse my answers on the purpose of IQ testing. ",

Philip Marks's answer to What does IQ stand for? How is it measured, and what does it really mean? Whatever IQ testing may miss, it is the best way available to measure intelligence at the moment; and the effort is 100 years old now. It is in fact a fairly well refined effort and across a broad range of tests will produce pretty much the same results. ",

It can be subdivided into different forms of reasoning (verbal, visual etc) and people with the same IQ may have different amounts. People have since invented concepts such as Emotional Intelligence which might mean something but are not reasoning ability. Please note the original purpose of IQ tests was not to rate some people as inherently better than others, but to identify children who were less able to reason, so that they could receive extra teaching and get up to a satisfactory level in reading and mathematics in particular.

In no field is it sufficient for success, and even in academia, hard work and ambition matter a lot more to success. However, it is useful to know for children with problems in school, because high IQ children often (paradoxically) do badly in school from boredom. Knowing that a children has a high IQ, educators can try giving them harder material when they're doing badly. Ultimately, IQ measures a specific ability, rather than being a general quantified of what would commonly be called \u201cintelligence\u201d. ",
