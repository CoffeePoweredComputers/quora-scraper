            "answer_text": "If you had to kill someone what would you do? First recognise that there is no situation where you \u201chad to kill someone\u201d. There is always a choice on your part even if that choice to not kill the person causes a greater number of people to die. Take the Trolley problem - Wikipedia. This is a popular moral dilemma case where people are presented with a problem of make choose but someone always being harmed. The basics are a person has control of a switch that can be used to divert a train/trolley onto a different track. On the main track there are 5 people that, if the person doesn\u2019t throw the switch, will die. But if the person does throw the switch 1 person on the other track will die. Now most people think they\u2019d would throw the switch. But in testing people often don\u2019t. Not throwing the switch, for what ever reason, is a form of choice even if it is just a panic and freezing. You can extend this to other hypotheticals. Like \u201cif a psychopath gave you a button to kill 1 person but if you don\u2019t use it then 10 will be killed would you push the button?\u201d Here you could take a position and say you wouldn\u2019t participate and let the 1 live at the cost of the 10. That is still a choice. Now we recognise that in such a situation you shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for pushing or not pushing the button as your freewill is always in question since someone is forcing you into the moral dilemma. There is always a choice. I often hear the phrase \u201cThey had to kill him\u201d and shake my head. To many people accept that killing a person is the only solution. The reality is in most situations there are tons of other non lethal options available. A prime example is like when police where faced with an unarmed naked black man and they decided that shooting him was best option when it clearly wasn\u2019t. So I reject the idea that there are situations where \u201cYou had to kill someone\u201d. There might be situations where you end up killing someone but you don\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d do it. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHad to\u201d implies that there is no way out of it. You don\u2019t tell me if this is because I am a soldier in combat, fighting for my country, a police officer defending an innocent person, or a husband protecting my wife. As a person who has often been able to negotiate or talk my way out of many conflicts and even talk other people down when things get escalated, it is hard for me to even fathom the idea of a situation where I would find that I \u201chad to kill someone\u201d.
