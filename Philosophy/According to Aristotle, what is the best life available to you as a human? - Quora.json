            "answer_text": "Happiness as the Ultimate Purpose of Human Existence One of Aristotle's most influential works is the Nicomachean Ethics , where he presents a theory of happiness that is still relevant today, over 2,300 years later. The key question Aristotle seeks to answer in these lectures is \"What is the ultimate purpose of human existence?\" What is that end or goal for which we should direct all of our activities? Everywhere we see people seeking pleasure, wealth, and a good reputation. But while each of these has some value, none of them can occupy the place of the chief good for which humanity should aim. To be an ultimate end, an act must be self-sufficient and final, \"that which is always desirable in itself and never for the sake of something else\" (Nicomachean Ethics, 1097a30-34), and it must be attainable by man. Aristotle claims that nearly everyone would agree that happiness is the end which meets all these requirements. It is easy enough to see that we desire money, pleasure, and honor only because we believe that these goods will make us happy. It seems that all other goods are a means towards obtaining happiness, while happiness is always an end in itself. Source: (pursuit-of-happiness.org) The Hierarchical View of Nature In order to explain human happiness, Aristotle draws on a view of nature he derived from his biological investigations. If we look at nature, we notice that there are four different kinds of things that exist in the world, each one defined by a different purpose: rocks, metals and other lifeless things. The only goal which these things seek is to come to a rest. They are \"beyond stupid\" since they are inanimate objects with no soul Vegetative: plants and other wildlife. Here we see a new kind of thing emerge,something which is alive. Because plants seek nourishment and growth, they have souls and can be even said to be satisfied when they attain these goals Animal: all the creatures we study as belonging to the animal kingdom. Here we see a higher level of life emerge: animals seek pleasure and reproduction, and we can talk about a happy or sad dog, for example, to the extent that they are healthy and lead a pleasant life Human: what is it that makes human beings different from the rest of the animal kingdom? Aristotle answers: Reason. Only humans are capable of acting according to principles, and in so doing taking responsibility for their choices. We can blame Johnny for stealing the candy since he knows it is wrong, but we wouldn't blame an animal since it doesn't know any better. It seems that our unique function is to reason: by reasoning things out we attain our ends, solve our problems, and hence live a life that is qualitatively different in kind from plants or animals. The good for a human is different from the good for an animal because we have different capacities or potentialities. We have a rational capacity and the exercising of this capacity is thus the perfecting of our natures as human beings. For this reason, pleasure alone cannot constitute human happiness, for pleasure is what animals seek and human beings have higher capacities than animals. The goal is not to annihilate our physical urges, however, but rather to channel them in ways that are appropriate to our natures as rational animals. Source: (pursuit-of-happiness.org) This is the way in which, according to Aristotle, despite the contributions of parents, society, and nature, we are the co-authors of the active states of our own souls (1114b, 23-4).

            "answer_text": "There are three ways of life for Aristotle: The Life of Pleasure (Bronze)The Life of Politics (Silver)The Theoretical or Philosophical Life (Gold)The Life of Pleasure is what most men seek and it manifests itself in the desire to find and fulfill the pleasures of the body. Aristotle saw this orientation as the result of a poor upbringing and the lack of education. For Aristotle, the character of man is determined by his choices. Proper choices are not simply driven by appetite or passion or wish or opinion, but aimed at nobility, over and over again. As one of many examples, an improper choice could be seeking pleasure in getting drunk on the weekends or acting foolishly with friends. The Life of Politics is honor-seeking and attempts to display virtue through politics. Aristotle considered this way to be much better than the life of pleasure, but still not the best. For Aristotle, politics is the proper balance, or mean, between the individual and the collective. Therefore, justice is the practice of virtue both within ourselves and in relation to others. The Theoretical or Philosophical Life is one where man gains pleasure from intellectual and contemplative activity. Magnanimity (a greatness of soul) means that one is self-sufficient and oriented towards justice for the community. The magnanimous person is happy because happiness is virtue and virtue is action. This is the best way of life, for Aristotle. ",
