            "answer_text": "Practically all Presidents are smarter than people think. George W. Bush, for example, was constantly maligned for his peculiar turns of phrase (which in hindsight seems like a quaint thing to criticise) and perceived as some kind of chimpanzee in a suit. But the boring reality is that people generally don\u2019t get to the point where they are a political leader unless they worked through the ranks of power, impressing people enough on the way to give them their support. If Bush was a complete moron to the people around him, he\u2019d never be up for the job. In person, Bush seemed to be more humble, self-aware, and witty than the media normally emphasises. The same could be said for Trump. I do think he is less intelligent than a lot of previous presidents, but I\u2019m not basing that assessment on any of the popular perceptions of his lack of intellect, such as his apparent distaste for reading or his short attention span. You can be lazy or distracted and still be highly intelligent. He is also woefully ignorant on a lot of issues, but then so are a lot of presidents; the trick is that most other presidents have the discipline to present themselves in such a way as to hide their ignorance; If you put Obama on the spot, he would probably not be able to tell you the capital of Estonia, and yet if he had to talk about a crisis going on in that country, he\u2019d know to talk on the issue in a way vague, limited and confident enough to sound like he is some kind of authority on the subject. Effective presidential speeches are like cold readings and Barnum statements, and Trump doesn\u2019t have a knack for this, his off-the-cuff approach leading him to make foolish looking guesses and assumptions. So he\u2019s undisciplined, near illiterate, lazy and uncoordinated. But how is Trump smart? Firstly, he has an instinct. When he was told the Mueller investigation was kicking off, he took it incredibly seriously, because he was smart enough to know the implications and risks of the investigation, and the harm it would do to his image. Even a man as arrogant and self-assured as Trump had the awareness to spot a major threat to his credibility. A stupid man would shrug the investigation off in the moment, and think it won\u2019t touch him. The Trump in private responded very differently to the Trump in public, publicly not taking the investigation seriously. Trump also has a knack for realising what people like. He might not know how to talk with precision, but he does know what to say to impress an audience. You can\u2019t do that unless you have some kind of perceptiveness around other people. Finally, Trump has been smart enough to figure out an optimal strategy for politics that has let him shake off exhaustive criticism to get elected in the first place; he constantly promises impossible things, knowing that a) even if he doesn\u2019t achieve them, the fact that he appears to be trying is good enough to voters, and b) by the time people are pointing out his failures in office, he\u2019s already onto the next big promise, maintaining that forward momentum. It\u2019s a daring approach that wouldn\u2019t work by accident; Trump realises if he falters or slows down, it\u2019s going to go terrible. There is something very calculated about all his bravado and big promises. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been a Resort Hotel General Manager for years, but after maternity leave, went back to college so I could start up my career again. I chose the #1 school in the world\u2026 University of Nevada-Las Vegas, for their Hospitality Administration program. While getting my Bachelor\u2019s degree, we were required to do lengthy reports on case studies in the hospitality industry. Disney among them. I was required to do one on Donald Trump. (This was back in 2006.) I was very impressed by what I found, which is an opinion formed far before the media got a hold of him. Trump believed in having every employee a homeowner\u2026 not a renter. He brought in his own experts to provide learning opportunities for his employees so they could learn about mortgages, debt, real estate strategies, and other investments so they could make savvy real estate deals and own their own home.Trump knew every employee in his hotels by name. Even the janitor, and knew the janitor\u2019s wife\u2019s name, his kids names, and even his dog\u2019s name.Trump promoted a corporate culture of taking extremely good care of his employees, because he knew if he did, they would take extremely good care of his customers. His job, as he sees it, is to create an environment where they can thrive, where they are treated with respect, and where they have a voice and a contribution.These are all facts I uncovered doing my report. In addition, I researched his views on the TV show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Trump actually hates firing people. He has tremendous difficulty doing it, because he considers it a bad decision he made. He believes in having the best people, in telling them they are the best, in telling others they are the best, and in helping others want to be the best. He hates having to fire anyone because he has to admit that he made a mistake. I have discovered something interesting when it comes to elections. Often the person wins, not because they were the best or the most favored candidate\u2026 but because they had the most attention. Even if it was bad attention. Hilary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for president since the day her husband announced his candidacy. She has been seen by the entire U.S. as \u201cthe woman most likely to be the first female President.\u201d This view has been held so long, that it would HAVE to have taken something and someone really huge to take her down. She had far more momentum pushing her to the White House than anyone else ever had. When she announced her run for president, I remember thinking, if anyone was going to beat her, they\u2019d have to make an enormous spectacle of themselves to get enough attention away from Hilary to nail the presidency. When Donald Trump announced he was running for president, I knew he would win. He understands marketing. Even though he didn\u2019t like his most famous catch phrase from The Apprentice, he used it, and he used it well\u2026 because it got ratings, and ratings means advertising dollars. He\u2019s a very money-savvy man. He used the media to his advantage. When he started getting lots of attention for what appeared to be outrageous behavior during the presidential campaign, I told my husband\u2026 you just watch. That man is crazy\u2026 crazy like a fox. Sure enough, he took the media by storm, creating such a huge spectacle of himself on national television, he was able to get the majority of the attention focused on him\u2026 and he won the presidency. Is he all the bad things the media says about him? I don\u2019t think so\u2026 mostly because I had an opportunity to find out who he was and what he stood for, far before the media got to him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed since then\u2026 I think he\u2019s still crazy\u2026 like a fox. ",
