That being said there is no such thing as \u201cThe German\u201d or any consistent level of cursing amongst them. Some do, most don\u2019t, under normal circumstances. After living in Australia for over 6 years now I believe that cursing is more popular here. I hear the F- and C-word a lot more than I ever heard any German equivalents. But that\u2019s just an example from my personal observation. Not sure if there are statistics on the average use of words like shit (Scheisse, merde,\u2026) in different cultures. What might be true is that the German language itself sounds harsher to someone from an English speaking background. You shouldn\u2019t come to the conclusion though that this means anything in terms of how vulgar or rude people are. ",
