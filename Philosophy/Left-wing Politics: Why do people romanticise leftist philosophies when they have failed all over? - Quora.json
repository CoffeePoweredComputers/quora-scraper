            "answer_text": "Both left wing and right wing politics are politics of revolution. They have inherent tenets of revolution, either by peaceful methods or by violent means. This in built mechanism of violence has a charisma which attracts youth in his /her formative years and he/she starts to dream of changing this whole world. In both these ideologies there is a enemy either in the form of oppressor( left) or aggressor( right).  Left envisions a world free of capitalism where all are equal ,everybody has equal opportunities and no body is discriminated either on colour, case or creed.This may sound very good to ears but is equality  possible in this world of so many races, religions , caste and creed with wealth divided  lopsidedly between three classes-- upper( 10%people of population), middle ( 20%)and lower(70%}.But in the exuberance of youth, it seems that we will overcome these hurdles and we will be able to create a world free of strife, poverty and discrimination. If for this they have to go on streets to protest or to strike  or even getting beaten up or killed  or to jails, they are not bothered because they believe cause is bigger than the life. This idealism attracts youth in the 20's but in the 30's this idealism vanishes when it faces the harsh realities of life.I am not elaborating right wing politics because question pertains to left wing. But these ideologies fails when they  confront governance. Both these  ideologies thrive on events and cannot remain in a passive mode and governance is a passive activity. That is why left wing politics which attracted 10 nations in the twentieth century has been discarded by those countries also. In India foremost bearers of left ideologies ( Communist parties) has to tone down their thinking to the centrist level to remain in power.  People who still get attracted to it are  idealistic youths and people who are frustrated by the system. It also attracts those who study beyond their student life, by this I mean who study meaning less courses just to remain in universities. It also attract those who have read a lot on atrocities or those who  undergo by that torture. But these people are now very few in numbers and their influencial areas are also rapidly decreasing in the world. ",
