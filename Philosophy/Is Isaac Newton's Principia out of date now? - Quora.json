            "answer_text": "I would love to know how many people in the world today have actually read Newton\u2019s Principia. I\u2019m not demanding that they read it in the original Latin, just in a decent translation into English or their own native language. But I am demanding that they read it all the way through. I\u2019d be surprised if the answer was above a few hundred. And this isn\u2019t for lack of access: there\u2019s an free online version in English that anyone can browse to their heart\u2019s content: Newton's Principia: the mathematical principles of natural philosophy : Newton, Isaac, Sir, 1642-1727 : Free Download & Streaming. Certainly I haven\u2019t read it all, despite the fact that I spent several years studying the history and philosophy of physics at a postgraduate level, and have written a paper on the interpretation of philosophical arguments that Newton employs. I\u2019ve read bits of it, but not the whole thing \u2014 I tried, and I failed. It\u2019s too obscure, too dense, too idiosyncratic. Newton\u2019s Principia is hideously out of date, and it bears no relation to how physics is done by anyone today, or for the last couple of hundred years. It\u2019s not even clear that it bears much relation to how Newton did physics. For a start, the book involves no calculus. When Newton wrote Principia, he was still somewhat secretive about his \u201cmethod of fluxions\u201d, so he translated his arguments into the \u201cgeometrical style\u201d. Given that many of the problems he addresses are much more easily framed in terms of calculus, this makes his geometrical arguments almost wilfully obscure. In many cases, you can see through the mess of lines and curves he creates to the simpler calculus approach he was actually following. In other cases, his methods are just baffling. It\u2019s probably easier to display a page than to argue this in the abstract.  Source: Newton's Principia Second, Newton\u2019s topics make no sense at all today \u2014 they were chosen to suit the particular issues that he wished to address in 1687. The First Book is all about constructing a theory of motion under centripetal forces.The Second Book is all about refuting Descartes\u2019 theory of motion (which hardly anyone knows about today).The Third Book is a pretty unsorted collection of derivations using tools introduced in the first part (e.g., the motions of comets), plus some philosophical musings.None of this bears much resemblance to how Newtonian mechanics is introduced, taught and used today. The laws of motion that Newton first clearly stated and wielded in Principia are of course still relevant. They are used in a surprisingly large amount of contemporary physics, and in the vast majority of engineering and technical work done today. But they are not used in the way Newton used them. Even at an introductory level, the laws are stated and applied within a larger framework that Newton never appealed to (a framework which, ironically, owes much to Descartes and Leibniz). For more advanced work they are reformulated according to a series of innovations that were constructed in the 18th and 19th centuries: principally through the work of Lagrange and Hamilton. But the actual work itself? Newton\u2019s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica was out of date almost as soon as Newton wrote it. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Well Leibniz and Newton were so far ahead of their time that their works are still valid today. As a foundational text, there's a sense in which it can never be out of date (even though we don't directly really use the original work per se). However, in a sense, the principia is out of date. There have been many revisions, corrections, and amendments to the Principia by MANY great mathematicians and physicists that the principia is useful for most \"simple\" problems. It doesn't diminish it as a work of genius. For more complex problems we need relativity; and at the planck scale we need the mathematics of quantum mechanics.  Is Euclid still relevant? Of course. Is analytical geometry still relevant? Of course. Is Pythagoras out of date?  In the future. We still use the work of Lagrange, Jacobi and Hamilton even though they've been dead for over 100 years. And in the future we will still use the work Einstein and Von Neumann even though they will have been dead for over 100 years. All knowledge, mathematical and otherwise, is an edifice that builds upon itself.  ",
