            "answer_text": "After pecking the drives both great and small, I have come no closer to finding out which is the most important to me, and I also assume there is no solemn reason that overshines others. Perhaps all this will not provide neither a satisfactory nor a direct & blunt answer to the question, --that is the way. The question has send me back to open De Montaignes` Essays and that one famous To philosophize is to learn how to die. Now, let us not get all murky here. I still have miles to go. Although, fairly, better be ready than taken by surprise. An interesting thought indeed, that philosophy is an apprentice of Death, as what is more important but the end ultimus. What a delightful sentence I have found, let me paraphrase it-`A man is quite unworthy of an acquaintance with philosophy if he weighs her fruits against the price she exerts; he knows neither her graces nor her ways\u00b4.--Relevance? Is it relevant to me to encounter such lines and brood over them, yes, and it is not a product of merely one need that drives me from today to tomorrow. Product is made of multiple factors, each bearing his share. \u2014Now, to continue the paraphrasing `Those who proceed to lecture that the questing after philosophy is rugged & wearisome ( it can be at times, I am sure of it ) whereas it is delightful to possess her can only mean she always lacks delight. For what man has ever possessed her?...\u00b4 It is about aspiring & meeting, not about possession. Therefore the drive for possession shall end in a gutter, without the stars this time. Can I tell that I have obligations to myself, to read and learn extensively, with a realization that all is or shall be vanity? Eccle. 8:17 \"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.\" Perhaps this is all too impersonal & detached. The Needs that drive, among which I can choose. But what are those needs, is there a list? Sure, I can reflect and speculate why, and perchance rationalize it later. Oh, while at speculation & rationalization, a cheeky Rand mockery: \"You have no choice about the necessity to integrate your observations, your experiences, your knowledge into abstract ideas, i.e., into principles. Your only choice is whether these principles are true or false, whether they represent your conscious, rational convictions\u2014or a grab-bag of notions snatched at random, whose sources, validity, and consequences you do not know, notions which, more often than not, you would drop like a hot potato if you knew.\" ( Philosophy, who needs it ) Torture mechanic to everything unmechanical\u2026 Back to the quote, it does raise some warranted questions. First off, two sentences, and `I have no choice, I have only one choice\u00b4,\u2026 see where this is going? `I integrate my experiences, observations, ideas & so forth into principles, of which I, I!, decide to be true or false. I compare them to my rational convictions, which is what, already me-approved principles, and\u2026 I am lost afterwards. What is another one of my drives, to make sense and spot bullshit. That too is an important one. That notion we are finally `educated\u00b4 and free of religions and dogmas, i.e. what some people think of as the bullshit of the past, is utterly wrong. Back one the road, so, filtering the gibberish. Next, Scientia est potentia. We all know too well power has many faces, and Philosophy, is a way of handling it, to set the direction. There is not plenty of things than knowledge & power derelict of philo-, which is ships\u00b4 wheel. That too is another of the drives, to steer my boat. One thing to remember, Eccle 9.11: \u201cI returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\u201d What drive but that to do the right thing to myself & to others, and how, by what means, why,\u2026 to do it. That is the most important of drives. The bot knows the day to throw questions at you\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The simple fact that I could not live an unexamined life. Every human, assuming normal powers of reasoning, has a simple choice concerning how to live their life. You can be Nike (the company, not the god), and \u201cJust Do It(TM)\u201d, or you can try to figure it out as you live it. Either way is cool, but I find the latter one a whole lot more rewarding. It gives me the best opportunity to leave something behind that may enhance humanity, not just the life I've lived. Not all of us are going to be Edison or Einstien or Firestone or Ford. (I can't believe I just thought of those examples in alphabetical order, but with the exception of Albert, they were all Midwestern boys like me, so.) Even if they had not had a single thought about the life they lived, those guys each put a mark, for good or ill, on the world around them. Maybe I've made some smaller marks, maybe not. No matter. What I have done is changed the way my son thinks about himself and his place in the world, by passing on what I've learned. I've done so in other places, in other forums, and maybe changed a few out looks there. They will know their responsibility to do the same. My mind touching theirs. One at a time. I won't go into what I've found true for me. Any of you who follow what I write have probably seen its outlines, in among the smart assed commentary and humorous asides. I believe, more than anything, in human beings thinking, critically and carefully about themselves and their relation to the world and the other humans around them. I believe that is the only thing that has ever improved the human condition or ever will. If you wish to put the title \u201csecular humanist\u201d upon me, even if you spit upon it, I will pick it up and wear it as my crowning glory. That also is what makes me that other dreaded term, a \u201cliberal\u201d. When one wears multiple crowns, I believe it becomes a coronette. Unlike those who spit upon those things, I believe that they come with responsibility. At the most basic level, the responsibility to improve myself. Daily, even hourly. Then the responsibility to improve the lives of those in my immediate circle. Then those in my community and my nation. Then all those beings with whom I share the planet. And finally the universe at large. Think of it as a pyramid with REALLY steep sides, and a point a LONG way from the base. I doubt I will reach much beyond the third or maybe fourth level up from the bottom, no matter how I try, but I take my shot however I can. All of it because I could not choose the unexamined life. Can you? ",

The Personality of Philosophy Majors - Daily Nous I don\u2019t see myself really as deeper or things of that\u2019s what you meant! I think everyone has a solid philosophical intuition, but it takes a bit of training to develop it. We all wonder about things like how to live a good life, what love is, etc. Philosophy is very much an egalitarian discipline in terms of people being interested. I think anyone from age 3+ is most likely interested in the work philosophy focuses on. I do not think all ideas are made equally in philosophy or that people have good philosophical intuitions. But the interest is there. ",

However, a few years back, I started doubting everything I had been taught; why would God allow suffering? Why can\u2019t the LGBT+ community just be allowed to live in peace? Why did God create us at all, if He knew what would happen? Was it for sick pleasure, or because He couldn\u2019t actually tell what would happen, or what? Then, philosophers would say \u201cthere must be the Immovable Mover\u201d for the universe, or whatever\u2026 but why that God, precisely? Asking questions made me realise just how many of the values I had been taught I had accepted without thinking for myself. I would never begrudge a person to believe in faith, or God, or an Immovable Mover, or whatever they see fit to help them through their lives! But for me, I now prefer to rationalise and question the world around me, to see what makes sense to me personally, rather than to accept without question what people around me say is right and wrong.

With this state being one of the reasons, I\u2019ve become a philosopher, as a way to discover the world in a different way than the natural, normal way of being spontaneous, blocked by the neurological existence in the spectrum.

Through varying levels of enquiry and ongoing examination, the relationship between our experience of things and language, what aims to identify experiences, are examined. Words are selected to explain and describe the extent to which language accurately represents our experiences. Wittgenstein writes, that all ideas are undermind by the language we use (to identify the ideas). As a result, we often criticise, and are criticized ourselves, based on language choices. The additional step then is often taken to criticise those - for their word choices. Our intentions, regardless of how ethical, do not appear to matter as much as what we say. ",

He must know and understand himself fully in order to philosophise accurately on his fellow man. This means understanding and accepting all facets of the personality good and bad, dark and light and fostering a self love that is uplifting and supportive without becoming narcissistic and self aggrandising. In short, the best philosophers are those who are constantly working on their own personal developing. Peace and love ",
