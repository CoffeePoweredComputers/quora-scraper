            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Yes, if you interpret free will to mean, the ability to do what we want. For example, you can choose between pizza or salad. If you want pizza, you can choose pizza, but, if you want salad, you can choose salad. Well people, that's obvious. In all of the time philosophers have been debating this matter, not one person has claimed that we do not have this ability. This is not the free will we're talking about. It's freedom of will. We have freedom of will, whether we believe we have free will or not. Personally I don't believe that we have free will, but I do believe that we have freedom of will. The ability to do what we want. So, what am I talking about? What is free will? Well, free will comes into play when I want pizza and I also want to eat healthy/lose weight. Free will is the ability to choose between two things I want. So, not choosing salad, when I want salad, but rather, choosing salad, when I want pizza. Do we possess such an ability? First, ask yourself, how can you want two opposite things? Are there 2 people inside you? In a manner of speaking, yes there are. We have 2 brains. One is logical and one is impulsive. One sees the big picture and seeks long term benifits, while the other seeks instant gratification. That first impulse to punch someone in the face if they irritate you, that's your impulsive brain. There's a reason your first impulse is to punch the person. Your impulsive brain reacts faster than your logical brain, which has to analyze the situation. You see, the purpose of the impulsive brain, is to take control in life or death situations, when speed is crucial. Your life may depend on it. When you feel threatened, your logical brain is put on the back burner. It has no say. Your impulsive brain takes control. Unfortunately, this leads to road rage. So, you now understand how we can have 2 opposing desires. Do we have the ability to choose? I'm going to let you absorb this a bit before I continue with my argument. Feel free to ask questions in comments if I'm not clear on anything. ",

            "answer_text": "Can free will exist if we do not have the choice to accept or decline free will itself? That would depend on what you imagine free free will to be. If you imagine it to be \u2018doing what you want to do\u2019 that\u2019s a pretty meaningless definition isn\u2019t it because everything you want to do you want to do & it\u2019s actually impossible to willingly do something that you don\u2019t ultimately want to do (i.e. more than not want to do) regardless of what it is - even crazy actions like self harming etc. But if free will is the ability to be free of error i.e. wisdom then it can only be wise to be able to act wisely & why would we want it any other way. Would you want to be unwise? U can\u2019t believe anyone would if wisdom is something that\u2019s supposed to be worth wanting & it is isn\u2019t it? ",

Your question comically elucidates one of the inherent inconsistencies. \u201cCan we use our free will to decline to use free will?\u201d Also, I don\u2019t think that anyone (except maybe a mystic) would want to argue that a newborn baby has freely chosen to be born at that particular place and time, to those particular parents, etc. So then, when, where and how does this mysterious power of free will come upon us? I would argue that if the existence of something cannot be confirmed by evidence, nor logically deduced, then we default to the conclusion that the thing does not exist. ",
