            "answer_text": "What a poetic question. I'll try my best to answer. For the first question I'd say that no happy people are not necessarly more likely to be delusional. Nothing in Life is black and white. \"Happy\" people are not happy 100% of the time and their happiness will be affected by media, events or sometime just the weather. I think in fact that SOME depressed people (emphasis on \"SOME\") are in fact more delusional than \"happy\" people. Its not because things are going bad somewhere that there is no hope and we should cry and give up on humanity because some people are bad. Yes Life is cruel. Bad things happen a lot, medias make it look like its the end of the world. But its not because there is no good things happening. Its just because medias are more likely to get your attention from bad News than good news. So when you see everything is dark you are as delusional as the person who think everything is white. I dont think depression is a \"reality filter\" for your life. you dont necessarily need to be ignorant of all the bad things going on to be happy. Reality suck, I Know. Society sucks real bad. Schools are too pushy and unadapted to the modern need. Capitalism might be ruining our planet and our lives in general. You dont need to be in depression to see it. But you dont need to be depressed because of it either. There is nothing you can do about it, but its not a reason to give up to depression. You can still live an happy life in a world like ours. Even if you do not agree with things, when you cannot change something, sometimes you must learn to live with it\u2026 Depression is just painful. You dont have to be in pain for the rest of your life just because you realized society sucks. It may be true, but society is not worth all the pain. Nothing will change because you are depressed. Its \"delusional\" to think otherwise. Hope this was the answer you were looking for. Please take care of yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m really sorry, but your perception is so wrong in so many ways, that I can hardly find how to address it. OK, I'll keep it simple: Happy people are healthy people whom choose to be happy in spite of what happens around them, good or bad. They are not delusional, they are happy regardless of what the world throws at them. They know what is good and what is bad, they just choose to not let it affect them. (PD: That by the way is the way to live life. Life is a decision, so if you want something, anything from life, you take the decision to be happy, to love, to hate, to move on, to be negative, to smile, to be and do whatever you want...it's your choice!)Depressed people are ill. They are so lost in the abyss of desperation, self-loathing and darkness, they simply are incapable of choosing, taking decisions and much less be happy, in fact many times they perceive death as the only option out of the hole. I'm telling you this not because somebody told me that's the way it is, but because I had a depression and know what it is! There is no way this way of thinking portrays life more accurately!Ignorance is not bliss, it's just ignorance! Learning, growing, evolving, reaching for more is what you do with live. It is too much of a marvelous opportunity to simply vegetate and wither in the branches of the tree of life. We have to strive to progress, advance, fill our life, persevere, keep up and transcend. Humans are never more happy than when they are on the move. It is only when they stop and do nothing, that they become morose, sad and depressed.So, go out there, start letting go, fill your life, enjoy life in spite of life, and enjoy the benefits of a full, fulfilled and happy life!

            "answer_text": "There are difficult truths in life if you look closely enough. I think if a person looks too long at them then it can unravel them entirely. I wouldn\u2019t say what I think they are because it\u2019s a bit like Pandora\u2019s box. I\u2019m not going to open it up to prove a point but I\u2019m firmly of the belief that each person\u2019s sanity, beliefs and will to live can be broken down under the correct circumstances. They aren\u2019t fixed attributes however tightly they are held or taken for granted. There are also comfortable lies. There is also the idea of using your illusions, asserting your reality, convincing others of it, and making it happen. We call those people visionaries if the world comes around to their perspective or delusional if they don\u2019t. The process gets judged by the result. I don\u2019t think people generally need to learn to be more ignorant. I\u2019d say the reverse is true, that being less ignorant opens you up to the world and gives you more to care about, which is a tonic against the singular focus on one set of thoughts which can present itself in someone depressed. Ignorance is not a good thing generally in the world. If you have a problem with depression then you need to try (it\u2019s not always possible) to be disciplined with where you put your energy and avoid previous pitfalls you\u2019ve found. I\u2019d call it that rather than ignorance. I think happy people can do that either by learning that skill or naturally. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. There are many reasons why someone might be unhappy but sticking within this (limited?) context I think the opposite might be true! We\u2019ve all read questions like \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of living if there\u2019s no meaning to life\u201d? There are so many variations to this question and they are all depressing. Realistically, many religions say there is a meaning but non of those meaning have been proven (so let\u2019s say it\u2019s delusional to believe in them).But even if you believe in one of them, that\u2019s not why you are happy. If it\u2019s true that this life is for the other life, then the only people that are living the true life are those that work for god. If I believed in the Bible or Kuran, then why on earth wouldn\u2019t I do the thing that is guaranteed to bring me joy - get as close to god as I can (by becoming a priest, or nun). If we are realistic (not gullable, hence easily deluded) we\u2019d say \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence that there\u2019s a meaning to life\u201d despite this, people seem to be happy. Not all of them because they believe in something that hasn\u2019t been proven but rationally speaking people seem to derive happiness out of self-love and optimism (to name a few). And, rationally speaking them having a positive image of themselves and me thinking I\u2019m a fat loser, doesn\u2019t make them delusional and me realistic - as realistically, I\u2019m only told that being fat means being a loser, I don\u2019t have and reason to think that that\u2019s the case. Then there are people that worry (hence get unhappy) that they\u2019ll have a plain crash, that terrorists are around the corner, that morality is worst than ever before. None of these are true. Yet these delusions make us unhappy. Then theres gossip, comparisons and insecurities. We gossip or consume gossip (magazines) with the illusion that we\u2019re on the know or that we are warning others of Barry the womanizer - but all we\u2019re doing is building hatred for Barry, which makes us unhappy. Then we compare, believing that we\u2019re being realistic. Then we start questioning whether people love us \u201cbecause \u2018realistically\u2019 people cheat all the time - especially on people like me\u201d So I think being realistic and rational makes you more happy. Being learned and educated make you happier still! I\u2019m not going to go on and on in this point but personally I think of learning as a game. Discovering things that you didn\u2019t know is amazing Ignorance. Nothing good comes from it. We were scared of wind blowing in the trees, scared of witches and scared of a train in cinema. Whatever the equivalent is today, ignorance can\u2019t possibly give you happiness ",

            "answer_text": "Depression lies. This is the best slogan I\u2019ve ever heard about it. While so-called optimists apparently are less realistic than others, and while there can be an overlap between depression and pessimism in certain ways, real depression, the disease of depression, is not a good guide to accuracy. May I suggest also that there is a big difference between feeling happy and being happy. You are focusing only on the first it seems. The latter may be more important. And its relation to truth may be stronger. And you know, I\u2019m not sure you really need to learn to be ignorant. I think that\u2019s taken care of if you just don\u2019t try to learn and keep up with reality as it changes. You can feel less unhappy if you don\u2019t keep up with bad news. At the moment, and for the first time since last November 2016, I\u2019ve stopped keeping up with Trump\u2019s personal statements and actions and reactions to them.When his face appears in a photo on my internet, an app shows me a picture of cats instead. I don\u2019t particularly like cats, But Trump\u2019s facial expressions express attitudes unbecoming of a human in my judgment. This has made my life less painful. But what provides more happiness is being a sustaining part of social movements and organizations trying to make the world better, whether related to Trump or not. If these folks have to be optimists to keep their hopes up, so be it. ",

The world we live in does seem to be a less utopian realm than the happy campers would have us believe. However, we should not be tempted to reach for the inverse of this statement - i.e. If you\u2019re not depressed, you\u2019re not seeing things in their true light. There are ways of accepting things the way they truly are without going full-on clinically depressed. Unhappy, maybe. Or anxious or mad; but these are not in themselves symptoms of depression. They\u2019re just feelings. One often has the option of battling the negative and taking pride in the battle. In other words, picturing the world with a positive outlook does not require that you be a happy idiot. ",

There is another option that you aren't even considering because you're so focused on delusion and definitions and othering those who aren't like you. The option is: I don't know. What you need to be happy is to understand that no matter how much you know, you really don't know anything. Any conclusion you draw could be delusion. If that idea makes you miserable, you are going to get depressed. If that idea brings you relief, you are going to be happy in spite of anything that happens. There is no possible way to portray life accurately. Ignorance is lacking sufficient knowledge to even make the attempt. Wisdom is knowing enough to know better. Both ignorance and wisdom are bliss, but only one of them is effective at sustaining happiness. ",
