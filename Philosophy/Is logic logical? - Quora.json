            "answer_text": "It is a tautological question, inconsistent with the Three Laws of Logic. \"Why a thing is itself\" is a meaningless inquiry, for the fact or existence of the thing must already be evident ... but the fact that a thing is itself is the single reason and the single cause to be given to all such questions as \"Why is man man?\" or \"Why is the musician musical?\". \u2014\u2014-from (Aristotle, Metaphysics 7.16.1041a15-18). However, I will elaborate. The question invites people to conclude that a Self Referential is equivalent to the exercise of Aristotelian Method.. In the operation of Arristotelian Method, it is known that all Identities are equivalent to themselves. (A = A, B = B, \u2026Z = Z etcetera). What the question does, is invite people to momentarily suspend the other two Laws and assume that a Self Referential constitutes the entirety of Aristotelian Method. It invites people to momentarily conclude that the Law of Noncontradiction and the Law of the Excluded Middle are suspended, void, or non-providential. This was never the case. In the exercise of Aristotelian Method, what is fundamental for the exercise of \u201clogic\u201d is the recognition of 2 Extremes and a Mean. However, what is absent in the asking of a question (using a Conditional) is the Declarative, which is necessary for the operation of Aristotelian Method. in the operation of the 3 Laws. (It is not true that all Interrogatives (Conditionals) are probative. Also, what our mind is doing when it offers the Self Referential Interrogative, is rather like playing a game. This game could be called \u201cThe Game of 1 Law Logic\u201d or lperhaps, \u201cThe Game of 2 Law Logic\u201d. Such a game invites people to abandon the recognition of 3 Laws, and replace our premises with a recognition of 1 law or 2 laws or something like that. The invitation is to think that the exercise of Aristotelian Method (i.e. \u201clogic\u201d) is the operation only of a Law of Identity, which is to say, a Self Referential like A = A. The crux of the issue is to remember that in the operation of Aristotelian Method there needs to be a recognition of 2 extremes and a mean. When this is abandoned, the mind begins playing a Self Referential Game like the Logic of 2 Laws, or introducing a 1 Law Logic. It can also be thought of as the proposition that the operation of Aristotelian Method is a singularity. That is an error of course, because 3-Law Logic is always a function of the Triangulation of Vectors. (Triangles are the most stable of all shapes.) Sometimes, our mind chooses to explore logic, and we momentarily dispense with some laws and operate with 1 or 2 Laws of Logic, and our mind puzzles us and allows us to wonder about the exercise of a different \u201clogic\u201d. However, a different logic would not be consistent with the Aristotelian Logic of 3 laws and the Triangulation o Vectors. However, Aristotelian Logic, the logic of 3 laws, is like this, with 2 premises and 1 conclusion, which shows the Triangulation of Vectors and not merely a Self Referential. There must be 2 Extremes (2 opposites) and a Mean. Of course, the variation in Mean Identities can change. Not all Triangulations produce Equilaterals. There can be Triangulation of Vectors like this:  There can be variations in the two sides which represent the premises. The conclusion is represented by the third side.

            "answer_text": "Well done! A wonderful Quine. What validation shall we rely on for our reasoning as we attempt to answer it? The outcome of the vote is actually No - based on a result of 2:1 - that is to say of G\u00f6del\u2019s famous theorems two invalidate the capacity of logic to prove its own completeness whilst one shows its internal consistency to be demonstrated in its own terms. Another good way to phrase this question is to make it an ontological one: how do we know what logic is? Syllogisms form the traditional examples of logical forms, but again they cannot define what makes them so. Various types of logics exist, but they all share the feature of demonstrating valid inference. However, the explanation for why their forms constitute valid inference remains inaccessible to formal systems and this is the stuff of G\u00f6del and Tarski. I am personally very fond of Vern Poythress\u2019 work. Whilst probably unpalatable to many minds, I find his triperspectivalism exemplifies a more potent logical aesthetic (there, I said it!) than some other explanations of the phenomenon of logic. Is Beauty Truth and Truth Beauty? Keats\u2019 vessel is as transient as Theseus\u2019. Where shall we find our Philosopher\u2019s stone to which we might attach our anchor in the storm? ",
