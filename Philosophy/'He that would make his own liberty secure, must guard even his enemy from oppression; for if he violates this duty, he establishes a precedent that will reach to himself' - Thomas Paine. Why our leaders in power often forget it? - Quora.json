            "answer_text": "Interesting proposition. The system of checks and balances in a constitution is the best guarantee of preserving individual liberties for all citizens accepting that constitution. Yet the lure of power , particularly political power is enormous. Politicians vie for wielding power- even when their motives are to increase the welfare of the citizens of their country. It is a common human reaction to reduce checks on one's actions/ autonomy; more so when the person sees himself as trying to do so much but being held back by others/ cumbersome practices etc. that opponents are first villified and then restrained. The common man too wishes for simplicity and quick resolution of his problems. So in difficult times it is possible that appeals to restrict rights of opposition to the government are welcomed as being action oriented steps aimed at removing the problems being faced. A fundamental reworking of the way the governed consent / ratify the actions of the governors may be required. Today's society is too large and complex to be understood by any one person- even if he is put in the position to provide leadership and direction to the government machinery. ",
