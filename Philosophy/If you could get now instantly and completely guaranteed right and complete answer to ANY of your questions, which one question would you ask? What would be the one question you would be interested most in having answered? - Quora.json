            "answer_text": " My question would be a rather simple one: What is the most effective way for me to acquire as much knowledge as possible? I thought about a lot of questions to ask and none of them seemed all too exciting. I do not want to find out what happens after death, or which religion was right, as it takes away from the surprise. I might either get entirely crushed by the answer or feel entitled to tell everyone else they are wrong, and life would become a lot less exciting when the biggest surprise of my lifetime goes away. I do not want to learn the reason for me being here and alive because I have spent years finding it myself, and if this is wrong, then that is completely okay. I will still want to find the truth myself because the journey I have been on in trying to find an answer was the most incredible experience I could have ever imagined. I do not want to find out who my perfect partner is because that makes the struggle worthless and it makes me not have a choice in the matter anymore. I want to chose my love myself, even that means they are not perfect. That just means it will be a more exciting journey with them, filled with ups and downs. Just think how boring a roller-coaster ride would be that always goes straight, and ends without going up, down, left or right even once. But when I know how I can learn the most effective way I will be able to change the world much faster. I will be able to read every book I can imagine, learn about so many lives and stories that it will feel like I have lived multiple lives myself, and I will have such a grand knowledge base that I can go to all my goals in a lifetime. I want to know how I can acquire the most knowledge so I can share it all with the world, teach others and show them the result of this knowledge. That way I could change the world in he most drastic way. ",

            "answer_text": "Under this hypothetical question, since i am being guaranteed of a 100% honest answer in reply. So i would ask them \"What is your worst kept secret that no one else knows?\"  After this i'll make sure that i won't misuse this information and wouldn't judge them on this either. Following things may happen as a consequence of sharing this information with me by them -  If secret was something over which they feel guilty: this will help them overcome this feeling and move on and come to peace with themselvesIf they didn't share secret with anyone else because they don't trust people easily: this will help them overcome their inhibitions and start trusting people and making deeper relationshipsIf they didn't share secret because they are self critical and self judgmental: this will help them to loosen up themselves and start doing what makes them happyIf they were hiding the secret because they were concerned what others will think of them: this will help them to start being themselves and not looking at themselves from society's eyes   This is what they will get. What will i get, well a friend for lifetime. ",
