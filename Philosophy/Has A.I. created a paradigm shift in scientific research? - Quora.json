            "answer_text": "Only incidentally. The problem lies in the way most AI mechanisms work. By-and-large, a great majority of today\u2019s AI solutions work by making Associative connections between facts, images, information identifiers, strings, or what-have-you. These associations can be achieved by any number of methods \u2014 a neural network, statistical inference, heuristics, associative gate arrays, and so on \u2014 but the keyword here is Associative. If you run the same initial input data into the same system after it has just been initialized albeit in a different order, you have a finite probability that you\u2019ll get a different answer. Granted, the answer may be very similar to one you got earlier \u2014 but then again, it might be wildly divergent. Science works by two primary rules, namely deduction and reproducibility. Yes, there\u2019s a well defined process that goes along with this (observation, theory, method, experiment, results, conclusion, and so forth), but at the end of the day incremental progress is won or lost on whether the revisions to the methods, conclusions, or theory in successive experiments are logical (I.e; deductive), and whether or not the same results can be reproduced by other scientists \u2014 even allowing for the possibility that data might be obtained in some other order, providing that it doesn\u2019t contravene the rules set down by the theory or method. On rare occasions the deductive process can be informed by a lucky inference drawn by associating related facts, but that is more the exception rather than the rule. You see, science promises the tenuous possibility of answering the question why something happens the way it does, and associative methods in and of themselves do not. True, while researching the historical facts on prior work in the scientific literature a scientist may rely on Google or some other AI-augmented tool to dig up the relevant information, but that doesn\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) affect the final report on his work. The same references could be obtained by a careful trolling of a library card-catalog, or even a slow perambulation of the relevant stacks, pulling books off the shelves, studying their table-of-contents and indexes (indices?), and only taking the ones that address the needed subjects. This may change. Already AI is demonstrating some facility at doing mathematical proofs, which are at least as logical as the reasoning underlying proposed changes to scientific theory, but so far at least these are mostly the plodding, dull, obvious Euclidean sorts of proofs that used to drive us mad as young students. AI is better at Conjecture \u2014 B is far more probable if A happens \u2014 but it is utterly useless at providing us the reasons why. Until that undergoes a major transformation, I\u2019m afraid the more correct answer to the original question is \u201cNo.\u201d Stay tuned. ",

            "answer_text": "AI is a rather loosely defined term, but, certainly it has affected research. One of the easiest to understand ways is to look for causation or associations in data. The basic technique is as follows: Collect far more data than you believe you need to make a causation claim.Randomly separate the date into three or more random groups taking care to assure randomness in every conceivable way.Use only one of the groups of data and apply numerical methods on it and apply Fourier transformations (or similar) pattern extracting algorithm. From there, depending upon the quantity and strength of the associations, even a Bayesian formula (or similar) multi-dimensional model of multiple causes and effects might be developed. In health research, this can involve relative influences of multiple environmental factors, and multiple effects could be longevity, quality of life, or other specific conditions.After the model is developed, take a second set of data and apply the model. If the model fits, you have completed a research process.Once the basic model is established, if you have additional sets of random data, you can further calibrate the model.Contextual AI could look at news and journal stories to find key phrases that are becoming more popular, find influences that are becoming more concerning, and seek out existing data sources that may contain what would be the most desired cases of cause and effect and conduct that experiment itself.
