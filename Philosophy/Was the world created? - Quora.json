            "answer_text": "WE know Earth was formed the same way all the planets and moons were formed basically. We don't truly understand the big bang. WE dont know what was there before the big bang.....   WE throw the word create around trying hard to understand...WE are aware of time and beginning and end......because WE are finite......or more properly out life cycle is incredibly short compared to the universe or even our planet. We ASSUME there is a begging and even to everything....which may not in fact be true. Everything in the unverse is some kind of matter.  Our 5 senses and experience see things until we don't and assume they ended. if we had line more sense we might be able to see that nothing changes or ends it simply morphs into a different collection of particles.Create means SOMEONE created it.  So I am not sure the world was CREATED. ",

            "answer_text": "All questions that imply the necessity for absolute answers are unanswerable for temporally limited (self realized beings) like ourselves.  \"Creation\" is one of those words.  It implies a fixed beginning -- something that a linear quantitative thought process (like the one to which we are restricted) is incapable of characterizing, due to its inherent dependence upon process (repetitive reflection).  Hence, the closest we can get to understanding \"the beginning,\" exists in the form \"a beginning\" or that which is conceived (by us) to be representative of 'the beginning.'    Beyond that... What we are able to understand is that we individually (due to our mortality) have a beginning and an end, even though we cannot understand the circumstances surrounding either.  Nonetheless, we inadvertently establish an order relative to what we cannot understand by repeatedly attempting to understand it.  The result is called time -- or, the orderly progression of successive inquiry.   Due to our dependence upon the idea of 'a beginning' as the source for our difference, our idea of time, and thus the validation of our belief that we do in fact exist (however inconsequentially) within the eternity of difference, it follows (for us) that all things we are able to differentiate between likewise must have a beginning.  And since order necessarily follows from our own beginning, reason is inclined (to the point of being constrained) to believe that order is attributable to 'the beginning.' That order necessitates an order-er.  It is this linkage between order and that which gives order to it (even though both exceed our capability to linearly define how or why they function) that gives cause to the idea of 'creation.' ",
