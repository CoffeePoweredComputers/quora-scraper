But we cannot know our future for sure, because it is, or at least might be, affected by factors beyond our control. Still, we must make decisions, and we do so in the present based on our judgment of our capabilities, talents, and potential, along with our understanding of where are now, where we want to go, and what we might want to do when we get there. All subject to change with little or no warning. I know I didn\u2019t exactly answer the question, but I couldn\u2019t, as it is based on a false premise. ",

So knowing our own future (in detail) is incompatible with choosing now: either our future is determined by ourselves or by something else. Of course we generally don\u2019t know our future; that\u2019s why we choose and decide. But it doesn\u2019t follow that our future is dependent on our choice. The only point is that we can\u2019t both know our future and choose it. ",
