            "answer_text": "What is truth? First that must be established. Everyone holds to that which they think is truth but is it really? Even if they see it with their own eyes is it really truth? When two people see the same incident but have two different answers as to what happened yet both are certain of what they saw then who or what determines which is truth? I have had many witnesses that there is a God that loves us and is concerned for our happiness. Atheists have not had such a witness. Which is truth? Scientists relied on assumptions and calculations to come up with the age of the earth. God gave a different answer. Which is truth? There are those that argue that truth is relative and a matter of perspective. Others say that truth is the way things are, were, and will be regardless of personal perspective. Which is the correct answer? If the first is the correct answer then that means the second is among the correct answers. If the second is correct then the first is incorrect. Thus the only correct answer can be the second. So with that established then who or what determines the way things really are? If you ask the psychiatrist he will claim that he has the answer. But if you ask his schizophrenic patient he will say that he (the schizophrenic) has the answer. If there are 100 schizophrenics and only one psychiatrist then do the masses decide what truth is? If not then who is to say that the psychiatrist is the one to determine it? I submit that the one that is the standard of truth is God. He knows more than all of us combined and He lives in a realm where the past, present, and future are before Him. He knows the way things really are as well as knowing what we are thinking, why we think that way, and what our perspective is. He knows it all. He also knows what truth is and how it compares to our perspective. So with that in mind I say that He is the one to determine what truth is since He knows it. So now back to the question: How do I justify the truth of my belief? I don\u2019t, God does since He is the source of truth. My lot is to align my perspective and ideas with His truth. If I\u2019m incorrect then no amount of rationalizing and debating will change the truth. No amount of pride will justify holding to an idea that is not aligned with truth. I don\u2019t have all of the truth and neither do you nor anyone else thus we all have reason to be humble so that we can learn and grow. What if God is wrong? He isn\u2019t otherwise He would not be God. However I can err if I receive something from Satan and assume that it is from God. That is not God\u2019s problem but rather mine because I was careless. There is a way to know that it is from God and that is through a witness of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will never lead a person wrong but a false spirit will do so every chance possible. Perhaps the question is aiming at the possibility that what God reveals does not align with what others, especially scientists, deem as \u201ctruth\u201d. Has the thought occurred that scientists could be wrong? Let\u2019s take a hot topic: the age of the earth. God said it was created in 6 days. Those are not earth days because the day and night used for the timing was not the sun. We are told that one of God\u2019s days is a thousand of our years (2 Peter 3:8). Let\u2019s say that is truth. That would put the age of the earth at about 12,000 years. That\u2019s a significant difference from the 4.3 billion years believed by scientists. Which is truth? Remember that the \u201ctruth\u201d from 100 schizophrenics doesn\u2019t mean the one psychiatrist is crazy so sheer numbers does not establish what is truth even if it is every scientist in the world. So let\u2019s look at just one opinion used by scientists in deriving the calculated date of the earth. That opinion is with regard to the radioactive decay rate. It is assumed to be constant and calculable. For the past 3,000 years the calculations matched records and so it was assumed that it could be extrapolated beyond the known records. That is an assumption, not a fact. In order for it to be a fact it must be known how the radioactivity actually comes into existence at the atomic level, exactly what it is, why it happens, and what can alter the decay rate. Those things are also assumed. There is evidence that something can alter the decay rate but it is not known what it is or what the source of it is. If that is not known then how is it known that the unknown condition did not exist at a previous time in history and did affect the decay rate of the rocks being tested? It is assumed that such conditions did not exist. Notice how much assumption has gone on already just in that one aspect? Have scientists ever determined as a matter of a fact what causes earthquake lights? No? Obviously it is some source of energy that originates around the time of an earthquake. Can that energy alter the decay rate of uranium? We don\u2019t know for sure because we don\u2019t know for sure what that energy is. Here\u2019s a tougher one: Ever hear about earthquake fog? It is a very rare occurrence that can happen during massive earthquakes. The New Madrid earthquake of 1811\u20131812 created one. When the fog from the earthquake comes it will make lights look very dim. The phenomena is too rare for scientists to have been able to study them. We know that it is not a normal fog by the descriptions given by those that have experienced it but rather it is something that effects light. It appears to be an unknown type of energy that is rarely experienced. Can that energy alter the decay rate of radioactive substances? We don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t even know what type of energy it is that is being experienced let alone how it behaves with atoms. Why are those last two questions important? Because there was a significant earthquake deep in the earth that caused the earth to be flooded about 4,500 years ago. \u201cIn the six hundredth year of Noah\u2019s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\u201d (Genesis 7:11) When \u201cthe fountains of the great deep\u201d were broken up indicates a massive underground earthquake. When that happened was an energy released similar to what is experienced with earthquake fogs and earthquake lights? We don\u2019t know but given the magnitude of the quake it is possible. Did that effect the radioactivity of all of the radioactive elements on earth? We don\u2019t know. Scientists assume that it didn\u2019t but they don\u2019t know enough about everything that can affect the radioactivity of atoms to state as a matter of a fact that it did not. That verse brings up another assumption that scientists make. The \u2018great deep\u2019 was broken up. That means the internal structure of the earth was changed from what it was before. We are living at a time after that had happened. Before it was broken up was the earth naturally creating a type of energy that caused living conditions which are unknown today? It appears that may be a possibility. The life expectancy since that time had decreased dramatically - why? We don\u2019t know other than God said it would be less from then on. Notice that after that event the life expectancy dropped. The very first generation after the flood only lived about half as long as those before the flood. If the earth was producing some sort of energy and that production was broken up at the time the \u2018great deep\u2019 was broken up then might that energy have effected the radioactivity and decay rate of elements prior to that time? We don\u2019t know. Scientists assume it didn\u2019t but scientists also cannot fathom a person living for almost a thousand years, either. After the flood the continents on the earth broke up some more (Genesis 10:25). After that the life expectancy was cut in half again. Why would the life expectancy be cut in half after massive earth changes? It would appear that it might be because the earth was either smaller thus turning faster and orbiting faster or maybe because the earth was producing some sort of energy that prolongs life. We don\u2019t know and neither do scientists but the possibility exists. And since the possibility exists then the possibility also exists that the radioactivity levels and decay rates of atoms may have also been different. Scientists assume that it isn\u2019t so but they do not know. Notice how much is unknown just in that one aspect of radioactivity and decay rates. That is at the heart of the calculations that scientists used to determine the age of the earth. Scientists simply do not know what the conditions were 6,000 years ago and whether those conditions played a significant role in the radioactive levels and decay rates which are used to calculate the age of the earth. Scientists totally disregard the claims that man lived longer back then and they totally disregard the observation that each time there was major subterranean activity that life expectancy was reduced. So with the assumptions made and ignoring claims of fact then how can it be construed that the calculated age of the earth is a fact or truth when there are assumptions relied upon and a disregarding of evidence? Now comes again the topic of faith. Faith is to not know all the truth nor all the facts but rather have hope and trust in a belief. Atheists have faith in scientists. How is that faith? Because they hope and trust that the assumptions and opinions used by scientists in matters such as the dating of the earth is truth. On the other hand I have faith in God. My source knows the truth and will share as He deems fit. When He shares it is known that science will one day come to the same conclusion as long as all facts are relied upon by them. ",

It is a personal conviction in the existence of a Higher Being, or the certain coming of something. How can you justify those to people who are violently opposed to your beliefs? I used to have an engineering classmate who believed in the absolute. For him blue is blue and no color can exist outside of his idea of what is blue. Even if you show him various shades of blue, he still insisted that they are not blue according to his perception. What can you do in situations like that? Either he is a nut or you are. Period. ",
