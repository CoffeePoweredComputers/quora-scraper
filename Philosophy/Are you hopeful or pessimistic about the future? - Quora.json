            "answer_text": "Short answer: It\u2019s a mix of both, but leaning rather heavily toward optimism. Long answer: I\u2019ll try not to go too \u201creligious nut\u201d here, but yes, I am religious, and, yes, I do subscribe the belief that the final \u201cend game\u201d is utopia. But it\u2019ll be hell to get there. To elaborate, right now, a lot of things look pretty bad across the globe, but I\u2019ve also observed that while at least my society (American) seems to be on a downhill slope, that slope isn\u2019t all inclusive; it seems more polarization, where the bad get worse, and the good get better. I find I agree with the song \u201cI believe most people are good.\u201d Thing is, we\u2019ve got some\u2026 not so great\u2026 people in positions of considerable power (I can hear the questions now: \u201cYou mean, you\u2019re a Christian who didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump? Heretic!\u201d), and not just in the US. There\u2019s plenty of saber rattling, a growing trade war, military maneuvers all over the place, the whole Syria thing, etc. etc. etc. When bad people take power, they tend to fight tooth and nail to hold onto it, and even if the majority of their constituents are good, moral people, well\u2026 it usually makes things bad for everyone anyway. So, yes, I\u2019m convinced that things will get worse (and considerably so) in the near future (hence the \u201cmix of both\u201d), but I do actually trust both ancient and modern prophets who tell us that after it all falls apart, events will transpire to not only patch things up, but to create the kind of society most people have been longing for for millennia. And that is why I lean very heavily toward optimism. All the best. ",

Sometimes it\u2019s for the better and sometimes it\u2019s for the worse. But over the course of humanity we have always progressed and always striven to improve. Till the end of life on earth or maybe our galaxy (if we ever inhabit other planets) I believe humanity will press on. Want more than nice words? While we hear about all the bad crap on our 24/7 news cycle just look at humanity\u2019s history. Living conditions, human rights, and knowledge of the world around us have drastically improved globally. ",

The treasonous acts of Trump allowing Putin credibility goes unchecked. The EPA no longer protects America. HUD is now geared to eliminate tens of thousand's of eligible recipients. The Department of Education is a joke. Energy is being lead by a man who studied animal husbandry and the Department of the Interior is selling off Federal Land to benefit Big Oil and Mining. The deficit will reach record numbers. Our Infrastructure is crumbling and yet nothing has been done. And to top it all off we have experienced noticeable inflation in our purchases from groceries and gas to S.U.V.s and Housing. This is not my America. It is now an America for the 1% ",
