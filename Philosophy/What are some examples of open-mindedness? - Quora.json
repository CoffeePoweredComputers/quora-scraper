If you\u2019re a soldier have a meaningful, non-hostile, conversation with an sjw. If you\u2019re an atheist, have a meaningful, non-hostile, conversation with a religious person. If you\u2019re a religious person, have a meaningful, non-hostile, conversation with an atheist. Pick something, anything, that irritates you and go learn about it. Not \u201clearning\u201d as in looking for cracks in the facade [although that is fine too]. But learning as in attempting to resonate with and understand the merits of whatever it is. THAT is open-mindedness. If you make it that far, then I suggest throwing all that understanding in the trash and listening to your heart instead. Only the confused need an open mind. ",

            "answer_text": "As already stated; tolerance of others. An open minded person can accept that others do not have the same theological, cultural or relationship beliefs that they have, and they try to accept this about others. For example; I consider myself to be open minded because even though I am a believer in Jesus Christ and His teachings, I understand that others do not and therefore do not feel a need to live their lives according to Jesus Christ's teachings. I may believe that homosexuality is against the will of the creator of the Universe because it involves the act of sodomy, but others who are not Christian or Jews may have no reason to feel the same way. I'm ok with that as long as I am not forced to accept homosexuality as a norm in my own life. ",
