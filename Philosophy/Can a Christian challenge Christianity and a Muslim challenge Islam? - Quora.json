            "answer_text": "If by \u201cChristianity\u201d and \u201cIslam\u201d you mean the traditions of the Church/Mosque that are contradictory to the teachings within their respective Holy texts, then yes. I am a Christian. There are many traditions held by different denominations, even within my own denomination, that I consider unfaithful to the teachings of Christ and God\u2019s word. Only through regular studies of each tradition can I know if they actually are contrary to scripture. There\u2019s one I\u2019m currently studying in order to discuss it with my senior pastor, and yes he is aware of my objection. A Christian shouldn\u2019t actively seek out the false doctrines, but should be studying the word of God to know what it teaches, and closely paying attention to the teachings of their pastors/teachers. If they perceive that the pastor/teacher is straying from scriptural truth, they should privately approach the teacher to address the teaching. This needs to be done tactfully and with a mind open to the possibility that they might be wrong. There is a process in the Bible that can be used for this. However, if a person calls themselves a Christian, but challenges the central doctrines of Christianity (the death and resurrection of Christ, the identity of Christ\u2026 meaning the second person of the trinity that is the one and only God\u2026 etc)\u2026 and I\u2019m referring only to the biblical teachings on those, not someone\u2019s (mis)understanding of the biblical teachings\u2026 then that person ceases to be a Christian. If you are worshipping anything or anyone other than the one true God, then you are engaging in idolatry. ",

            "answer_text": "Christianity is a frail and decaying faith in terms of the amount of believers it has. The West is becoming increasingly atheistic or twisting their Christian texts to fit evolving socially left wing political agendas. Islam is a far more powerful and fast growing religion. Although officially Christianity is the largest religion in the world on paper, Islam probably has a far greater amount of true believers. Also the penatly for leaving Islam is far more serious than for leaving Christianity in any area of the world. Whether that be punishment by the government or by the family. ",

            "answer_text": "Religion cannot and will not withstand or tolerate informed and independent scrutiny. Least of all in the bright light of the liberating gospel message. Religion is darkness masquerading as light. There is nothing religion secretly hates and fears more than the un-redacted liberating gospel message. Doing a complete comparison of religion and the gospel message is a peak experience. Spiritual 'Everest'. \u201cThe ultimate quest\u201d. \u201cThe ultimate context\u201d. \u201cReligion vs the gospel\u201d (Google image search). A short 4-page primer: HomeMany believe a right and clean standing with our creator is EARNED. This creates us-versus-them thinking. It divides the \"human family\". Into competing and sometimes hostile camps or groups. However Isaiah* reminds us all that there is a better way. He says that our creator's ways and thoughts are higher than ours. Isaiah calls us to yield instead to our creator's message. This message is known by quite a few names. Jews \"know\" it as bissar. Muslims \"know\" it as injeel or injil. Christians \"know\" it as the gospel, evangel, good news and more. This message reveals the abundant and generous heart of our creator. According to this message a right and clean standing with our creator is IMPUTED as a FREE GIFT. It cannot be earned, deserved or paid for. That truly is GOOD NEWS. This\u00a0GOOD NEWS is above any and all thought, imaginations, dogma, doctrine, tradition, liturgy, rituals, laws, rules, creeds, formulas, programs and the like. It vanquishes all our pettiness, jealousies, conceits, prejudices, divisions, ignorance and squabbles (noisy quarrel about something trivial). And instead it connects us personally, autonomously and directly with the mind, heart and spirit of God - now. We are given a new higher identity, perspective, vision and destiny - now. We are set free to become our best version - now. *Isaiah is one of the (roughly) 15\u00a0prophets held in common by Jews, Muslims and Christians - more than half earth's population. Angels announcing victory in the war against dysfunction, by means of the supernaturally powerful, unstoppable and ultimate weapon of mass peace: the liberating \"good news\" about the roadmap to a better world for all.
