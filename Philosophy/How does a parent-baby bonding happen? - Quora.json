            "answer_text": "With science and technology we know so much more about babies today than ever before. Such as they have their own DNA, at conception, different than the mother's or father's. Pre-born babies can hear sounds around them. It has been recognized that babies learn and are comforted by the mom's and dad's voices. So, bonding begins in the womb. Read to your baby and share your feelings. I think poetry, singing songs, and the Bible are all good material to introduce to your baby before it is born. If you read the newspaper or books for your entertainment it would be good to read aloud. Wow, bond before birth! After your baby is born, holding your child and talking gently to them is very desirable. Loud or sudden noises tend to frighten. Bathing your child is much the same. Warm gentle cloth, count their fingers and toes. Tell them your heart's desire. Wrap them in a warm blanket. My daughter was a burrito baby. She wanted a snug blanket. Spending time with your child is how bonding occurs. Gifts and 'things' fade. Having you with them is what is important. ",

            "answer_text": "Spend as much time as you are able with feeding, changing diapers, holding your child, and especially playing and entertaining your child. Just as in relationships that are new most times lead to a bond, a bond between a parent and child will come naturally if The parent is involved in every aspect. Bonding usually becomes natural between a mother and a child because of the mother tending to the child more so than the father. The closer you are that child through its upbringing and infant years of course, the closer the child will become to you. I am making an assumption here that by your name, you are a male. Hold your child often and tend to their basic needs as much as you can. Take turns with your significant other with those actions. You will find bonding absolutely will take place. Best of luck to you! ",
