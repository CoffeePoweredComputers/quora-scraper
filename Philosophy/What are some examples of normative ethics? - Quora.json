            "answer_text": "Normative ethics is the study of comparing different ethical systems based on how they claim to meet a goalpost, once that goalpost is set. Basically, instead of with objective ethics which states that there is a predetermined set of goalposts inherent in nature or a spiritual creator of nature, after people have subjectively determined which goalpost they think ethics should pursue, normative ethics explores how different ethical systems reach that goalpost. As such, there isn\u2019t really an example of normative ethics that is an entire ethical system itself. Instead, normative ethics refers to the entire branch of ethics that explores differences in how an ethical system reaches a goalpost. This gets confusing, because virtue ethics is referred to as one branch of normative ethics because it is a way to examine the ethical claims in a specific ethical system, but it is itself also an ethical system. Currently, normative ethics is claimed to ontologically contain 3 different arguably combinable or irreducible to each other, approaches: virtue ethics (moral character), deontology (rules), and consequentalism (consequences).

            "answer_text": "Discourse Ethics of J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Karl-Otto Apel: by arguing or just communicating with others we are rationally committed to obey the a priori norms of discourse, such as respect for the freedom of thought of others and for equal rights in a discourse. Kantian and neo-Kantian constructivism (Korsgaard for example): if we value our human existence we must also value humanity and act accordingly, otherwise we would be irrational. Metaethical Constitutivism (Velleman, Rosati, also Korsgaard): following certain rules or adhering to certain values is necessary to be capable of acting in the world; if we failed,to,adhere to those rules or values we cease to be agents. Moral Realism (G.E. Moore): there just exist moral truths that can be discovered or intuited. Metanormative Realism (David Enoch): there just exist some irreducible truths (which are indispesible to us) in virtue of which some things are right and some things are wrong.
