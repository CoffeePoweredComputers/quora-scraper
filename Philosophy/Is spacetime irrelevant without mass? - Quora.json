            "answer_text": "Identity Crisis. Let\u2019s say that that answer is relative. With all that moving and curving going on are we the ones to say what\u2019s relevant? Zero mass in a universe without energy as well? If the question is asking that then we can safely say then time nor space has any meaning. The philosophical implications demonstrating what a total void is relative to human consciousness is meaningless as well. Is Spacetime irrelevant without gravity? We might say that is the same question. But what about taking that weak force and looking at it through the lens of General Relativity? We may find another type of gravity. A gravity which is linked to quantum mechanics and black holes. Quantum Gravity, strong force. At that point time may cease to exist. Everything we know may become unified and without space. So is spacetime irrelevant to our mass and energy universe? I\u2019d say it just may be instrumental in finding what the theory of everything is and that\u2019s pretty relevant. ",

            "answer_text": "As far as I\u2019m concerned, spacetime is irrelevant even in the presence of mass because space is a void in which events take place and matter exists in; and time is a concept that gives the illusion of movement, no matter how persistent. If we humour relativity, in order for mass to curve spacetime, it must convey that influence to the surrounding spacetime in some way. Relativity doesn\u2019t explain that; nor does it state that the curvature gets shallower as the square of the distance from the centre of mass. This actually describes the equipotentials of the gravitational field that emanates from the mass; and the perpendicular forces to those equipotentials, are the forces of gravity. OK, so non-relativists are finding it hard to show how gravity is propagated in space; but the 4D spacetime doesn\u2019t either. Besides, some relativists are now saying that spacetime is a mathematical construct and not a physical thing. So, spacetime is irrelevant with or without mass. ",
