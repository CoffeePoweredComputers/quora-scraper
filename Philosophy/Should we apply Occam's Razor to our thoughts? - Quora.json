            "answer_text": "Yes! Occam's Razor is a fundamental element of critical thinking and skepticism. Can you imagine what the world would be like if more people applied critical thinking skills to their own thoughts? No more paranormal or supernatural superstitious mumbo jumbo to cloud the obviously intricate and amazing world around us. Perhaps there would be more people focused on progress instead of nonsense. Yes, Occam's Razor and many other critical thinking skills are extremely important to the well being and success of the individual who applies them to their own thoughts. I've personally found this to be true. Have a nice day. ",
