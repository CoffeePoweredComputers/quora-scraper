            "answer_text": "Of course people aren't created equally. Each person has different knowledge, mental and physical power. If someone from fourth grade elementary is given a test that should be for master degree, how can they pass? Or -if everyone is created equally- and a thief broke in a house, would you as a husband let your wife engange the thief by herself -as you both have the same right to defend and be defended-? The only equality we have is the chance to choose, wether we obey/disobey God. Qur'an says, \"O you mankind, surely We created you of a male and a female, and We have made you races and tribes that you may get mutually acquainted. Surely the most honorable among you in the Providence of Allah are the most pious; surely Allah is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Cognizant.\" Qur'an and Hadeeth has spoken about many ways to be pious. If you rich you can donate, if you poor you can be patient. If you're healthy you can increase your good deeds, if you're disabled God will reward you for every pain you feel. If you are in a warring country, your effort to fight persecutions will be considered pious. If you are between the war/conflicts of two side which both do good, it will be considered pious if you settle their differences. A musician/artist/actor can be considered pious if they use their ability to do/encourage good. Progeny do good for their parents, parents for their progeny. Husband to wife, wife to husband, to the family of both, praying for our deceased parents may God forgive their mistakes. A wise man to those who know not, teachers for their students, students for their teachers. Even doing work can make you to be considered pious if you do that for your family, or by evading what's prohibited like bribes or corruption wether anyone sees you or not. Better yet, God just give you 1 punishment for 1 sins, but He gives you 10 times to 720 times the reward for your good deeds. Just remember that this life (according to 5 major religions which is Christianity, Jews, Islam, Vedist, and Buddhism) is just a test. The amount of your wealth, your children, your husband/wife, your happiness and sorrow in this world is a test. Whoever be pious, no matter what their background, will go to Heaven -everlasting-, and the one which is covered with sins shall go to Hell, and if the punishment is enough, then God would forgive them or not and sent them to Heaven. Considering that, we all equally have chances to go to Heaven or stop by to Hell. And our reward/punishment depends from what we have done in this world. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it true that people are created equally? Usually, when we speak of people being \"created equally\", we mean to say that we're all equal in one sense -- moral value. Few would be so silly as to deny that we are all quite different, and that some people are better than others at various tasks or even across the board of skills. Nor are we equal in the eyes of evolution; some traits are favoured and some are not.  The point is rather a statement of principle, that regardless of native ability, we all have the same basic moral value as persons. I agree with it, though I think it must be accepted as morally axiomatic rather than an observation of universal truths; the universe doesn't make value judgements.   ",
