I think there are quite a number of people, who remain in/ retain higher levels of consciousness,by training, by habit or even by sheer instinct.For such people it may not even seem something so very different or difficult. Point Two: Personally speaking I am in full agreement with Bailey Marie Mononoke, that  it  should be quite boring. It will be like eating the same food all days all the year around simply because it is the healthiest or the tastiest food, Or like reading only the same book, listening only to the same music,or visiting only one place etc.simply because they are the best or the highest in their respective genres.
