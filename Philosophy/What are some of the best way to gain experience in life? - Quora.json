            "answer_text": "Well your question is a bit vague but it suggests to me that you are asking about how we, in general, gain experience. So I am going to make an attempt to answer that. FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE IS A BIG MYTH. Either it can be the first time or it can be the Experience. It can\u2019t be the both. Let me explain. When we actually do any task, whether it be Tieng a shoelaceGoing to a new placeReading a book on a never read subjectDealing with a new software for making official documentwe actually learn it and be experienced in it in 3 stages viz: InitiationImitationExperienceInitiation: In this stage, we do the task for the very first time. we are completely conscious and watching one process at a time. eg: reading a new book for very first time or going to a new place for the very first time. Imitation: In this stage, you try to do the same set of processes that led to the previous completion of the task. As your mind already knows that these processes have led to the completion once, so they will complete the task at hand again. eg: In the second reading of the book, you will now know which chapters took more time than others so you will assign more time to such chapters. Or how did you reached that tourist destination after changing 3 modes of transportation (just for example), so this time you will make sure to look out for them once you reach their boarding/ deboarding point. Experience: Now in this stage, your mind will start making those little changes, subtle modifications in the processes required to complete the task more efficiently and effectively. eg: Your eyes will now automatically start sticking to the places where interesting information is written in the book. or you will find shortcuts or other hacks to reach the same tourist destination.or you 'll determine which hands lace will go above and which will go below while tieing the shoe knot. Once you reach this stage and you in yourself believe that you have started making those subtle changes, you can start calling yourself experienced. Examples are really limited to a few but I hope you have got what I meant to say. know more about getting experience here: ThePractocalPsychology.com ",

            "answer_text": "Life is all about experiences, isn't it? Whether they are in regards to your love life or life in general, experiences make us who we are and they sort of set us to become the people we should end up being. To me, there is no such thing as \"too many experiences\" or being \"too experienced\". Every person, regardless of how educated, skilled and experienced he/she is, cannot be experienced in every sphere of their life. That is why we are given this life to experience and learn as much as possible, and to do that, there are a number of ways.  #1 Quit the Job You Hate Even though this may sound ignorant of me, I think no one should ever work a job they are not happy with. This experience is one of the many that changed my life completely. Even if you do not have a backup plan, quit the job that makes you miserable. Nothing is more valuable than your happiness and mental state, so if you think your job dims your light, it is time to go. Walking away from your job, with or without a backup plan is one of the scariest yet best experiences that you can ever gain in life. At that moment, the moment you close the door of the office you hate so much, for the last time, you will be reborn into a person who can do everything. I promise you will then find your inner strength and become unstoppable. Mark my word.   #2 Volunteer Volunteer work broadens life experience like nothing else. Find something you enjoy doing and start volunteering. Whether it is an animal or homeless people shelter, a nearby school, a project that you are interested in, volunteer to gain experience in that area. You never know what you can learn from others and their lives, so put yourself out there. You will not regret it!   #3 Travel Needless to say, travel can and will always be a crucial point in such lists. Take time off work to travel, not because you are allowed to but because you should want to! Seeing the world opens your mind and helps you choose what you want from it. Traveling will help you build maturity and proactiveness, and will definitely help you let go of fear. You will become more able to adapt to different situations and people, which will immensely contribute to your life. \"Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer\" Absolutely!   #4 Get a Pet, Even Better - Adopt a Pet Getting a pet, especially early in your adult life is a challenging task and probably one of the best moves all of us can do. Adopting a pet, on the other hand, even though brings the same amount of responsibility, initiates a different kind of feeling that may change your life drastically. Knowing that you gave a homeless pet a loving home is beyond incredible, so if you have the chance to do that, make sure you adopt a pet.   #5 Start a Business Ending with a pure classic, starting your own business is one of the greatest experiences you can gain in life. Do not be afraid to start your own business regardless of how old you are, where you live or how much experience you have. Give it a go whenever you feel like it and see what happens. I guarantee you, even if your business fails, which is not the end of the world anyways, you will come back stronger and smarter than before. Along the way, you will learn a few things about business, marketing, and people in general, that will make a huge difference in your life going forward. Starting a business is always a good idea, believe me, not because it may make you a millionaire (even though it can) but because it gives you an opportunity to learn and experience things you would not be able to experience otherwise.
