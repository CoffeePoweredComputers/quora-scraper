            "answer_text": "It depends what your concept of the self is. There\u2019s a philosophical school of thought that the \u201cself\u201d is ever changing, not real, always different from moment to moment, and that there is no self. However, in the thousands of deep hypnosis cases I\u2019ve examined, the 50 or so I\u2019ve filmed, I\u2019ve found that is accurate - but that the \u201cself\u201d that we think we know here, is not the same as the \u201cself\u201d that has incarnated many times both here on the planet and in some cases elsewhere. What people claim is that we bring about a third of our conscious energy to any given lifetime, about \u201ctwo thirds\u201d is always back home. That when we exit this stage, we return to that other two thirds, and can access all of that information, which includes all of our previous lifetimes. So in that instance alone, the concept of \u201cself\u201d doesn\u2019t apply - because we seem to be talking about the \u201cConscious human self\u201d and not about that conscious energy that we brought here that animates and informs who we are or become, or why we\u2019re here and what lessons we\u2019ve come to learn. However, that being said, even when the one third merges with the rest of us, that self is always learning, always changing, growing, etc. We go through many stages of learning - not in a hierarchical way but in a spiritual journey way. There is no hierarchy in this research - old souls and young souls are equal. But in terms of a person\u2019s journey, they have many lives to lead, many lives to master. Many lessons to learn and many to teach. So the self which \u201cseems eternal\u201d with relation to our time frame, is not really \u201ceternal\u201d - there was a beginning point, and there will be a form of an \u201cend point\u201d - but suffice to say as we are here discussing this point, we\u2019re in the midst of one of our many journeys.

            "answer_text": "Not in the slightest. It can\u2019t possibly be, unless solipsism is actual. This is simply because the \u2018self\u2019 is what is considered to be \u2018that which is considerate\u2019 - that is to say \u2018the self is what determines the appearance of the self and every aspect of its awareness\u2019. So, if that perception is truly representative of reality then \u2018reality\u2019 is merely \u2018what the self says\u2019. If this is the case then all evidence is merely the impression the self gives itself of what it is doing and we might as well have a brain in a vat imagining it\u2019s a brain in a vat. But then we have truth, right? Well, insofar as truth is necessarily tautological. However, here is the rub: if what we see as the \u2018self\u2019 is actually exactly what it is then we have a scenario where the description given by that self for itself would be absolutely definitive. In such a case what the self is would be literally self-evident in every sense. Where you are exactly what you believe yourself to be then you know yourself completely because that knowledge is the activity by which the self is structured. This sounds pretty good, though. I mean, I do know myself and cannot doubt it because that self would be doing the doubting. Yet with all due respect to Descartes there is absolutely no evidence for such an Echochamber unless that axiomatic awareness is, in fact, the sole basis of all belief that follows. Where \u2018I AM\u2019 is the necessary foundation of all philosophy there cannot be anything necessarily more than that. In short, if you are the judge of all things then all things are merely your judgement - because there is no reason but your own for them to be anything else. Nevertheless this logical conclusion is, in fact, quite paradoxical for a reason that is obvious from the nature of this question: such an absolute self could not be questioned. Where something is what it says itself to be it cannot concurrently ask what that is with any real uncertainty otherwise its own nature is nullified! \u2018I AM\u2019 cannot wonder \u2018AM I?\u2019, otherwise it is not in any coherent sense. Thus, a self-aware \u2018self\u2019 that exists by the determination of its own definition cannot be real, because if it were then the instability of identity would directly influence the world rendered in that reality. It may feel that way, but the most obvious insight available is that the world does not really respond to how we feel. If you convince yourself that everything really is the expression of your own existence then either way you do it to yourself, and that\u2019s what really hurts\u2026  ",
