            "answer_text": "There were two areas of philosophy I was particularly passionate about.  1. Political philosophy. The world is an incredibly unjust place, and philosophy can tell us by what principles we ought to try and order our societies.   2. Parts of the philosophy of religion. I am not religious, but I hate the popular claims made by eg. The New Atheists that theism is just obviously irrational or that theists are violating some obvious epistemic obligation. I thought, and still so think that theism in general and Christianity in particular is compatible with sophisticated philosophy. This also ties in a bit with my political philosophy interests. The great John Rawls recognised that competing conceptions of the good (whether secular or religious) are here to stay, and that a sensible liberalism needs to take account of this. This is in stark contrast to other brands of philosophical liberalism. ",
