            "answer_text": "Mental-modeling explains the sensation of awareness. To survive in the simulation as human entities we use not just attention but also modeling of the information we receive through attention. If we're healthy (functioning well) we're constantly revising and expanding our mental models to accommodate the \"reality\" of the simulation. If we're unhealthy we're constantly trying to fit this reality into our mental models - usually, without success, and this causes our sense of suffering. However, don\u2019t imagine there is a singular me pulling levers in an operations room. We think we're acting the way we do for logical or emotional reasons or whatever motivation our brain concocts. It's the dog chasing the tail. We perceive ourselves to have agency in our lives while our lives are acting out before us, a chain of causation that is external and internal. If everything we do is actually a learned response, including all the cognitions and actions associated with it, our awareness is merely a byproduct. However, I do not deny that consciousness exists, but it does not exist in the human brain. I entertain the possibility that we are role-playing in some cosmic sense. We're performers in a great production, and we chose our roles. I'm not a theist, but I accept the possibility that consciousness can precede and proceed physical existence. Then that puts the simulation in a wonderful new light. What if we are the higher beings who put on the simulation: a kind of vast role-playing entertainment to occupy us during our infinite sojourn in nirvana? ",

            "answer_text": "A game analogy works best to understand this.  Every computer game is a simulation. But the games have infinite possibilities because we have player(s) who can \"act\".  So each game invocation has the potential to have a different end result, however within the rules of the game.  So consciousness is the player on the framework of the Universe.  We have infinite possibilities within the universe/simulation.  In fact we need simulation only because we are trying to determine possible outcomes based on variables that we are not entirely sure about.  If everything was a constant, we will end up with a formula and the same end result. So consciousness is the variable that is used to run the Universe.  Without consciousness the simulation of the Universe will be futile or constant.  Without Universe, there will be no place for the consciousness to play out the possibilities and explore options.  Together we have something marvelous.  One of these days we will either have figured out all possibilities, or if that's not actually possible (due to the infinite nature), we would have figured out sufficient possibilities that the game (Universe) is no longer interesting to us (person / consciousness). Then we end the game and in meta-physical terms we will end the cycle of life and death. ",

            "answer_text": "How extraordinary it is, the extent to which this absurd, even paranoid version of a reality narrative has gripped the imaginations of so many intelligent people. I knew for a long time that Hollywood exerts a powerful influence on our reality narratives and our world views, attitudes and beliefs, but this bizarre and unsupportable fantasy is so obviously fake, so clearly just a silly expression of a sci-fi comic book way of thinking about reality, that I can\u2019t digest the impact it seems to be having. My hope is that like a fever, society will recover and reject as absurd, bizarre, and childish this recent storyline for what it is. Utter tripe and nonsense. People, get a grip! What is consciousness; is there any way to extricate this potentially serious question from the unserious context you have embedded it in, in your question? If so, then let me try: all animals with brains have an attention. The attention is a current of bio-electrical energy produced in the brain stem, conducted on nerve fibers connected to the other brain structures. In humans, we have a highly evolved cerebral cortex in which language, abstract reasoning, imagination, and perception occur. The attention is attracted to the activity in those brain structures and imparts a small charge of energy to the specific zones it is attracted to in a given moment, \u201craising\u201d that zone and its mental contents into \u201cconsciousness\u201d. When the attention is attracted to another specific zone, the mental activity it was attracted to goes back into the subconscious condition and the new activity is \u201craised\u201d into consciousness. There is no permanent \u201cconsciousness\u201d or subconsciousness. All mental activity is potentially able to be made \u201cconscious\u201d by the action of paying attention to it. That is the purpose and function of attention. The variety of mental states, often called consciousness, comes from the rise and fall of the voltage potential of the energy of attention plus the specific zone of mental activity it is attracted to in a given moment.

He uses a simulated pen to write on simulated paper. After three simulated months he finishes the story and shows you the simulated manuscript. It contains a story which moves you to tears. Is the story a real story or a simulated one? How can you tell? Likewise if you give a simulated chess player a chess problem and ask for the solution, the solution you get will be a real solution.  When you think about it there are things within the simulation which are just as real as things outside it because they are conceptual, even in the real world. Consciousness is quite possibly one of them. ",
