            "answer_text": "I was aged 39 before I started to work on myself. Before I began my journey with personal development in 2011, I was very damaged, had very low self worth and little to no confidence due to my dysfunctional family set up and my past failed relationships with men. I had no clear goals, no boundaries set, no vision for a better life and future, I was stuck in a deep rut. Yet, I made the conscious choice to go for what I wanted without the regards of what others think and say. I still do. I still disregard what others think or say about me because it\u2019s none of my business. I am being productive on working on myself. I am thoroughly enjoying life\u2019s adventure and that is what life is meant to be, an adventure. To answer your question, it is never too late to do anything that you really want to do. It is never too late to undo the damage of your past. It is your responsibility to create a better future for yourself. It is you and only you who is capable of doing that. No one shall be able to do it for you. Your life, your choices. It is entirely up to your choices that you make or do not make. Life is short, before you lie on your death bed, do what you want to do without anymore hesitation. There is no gaurantee that we shall grow old. Take every day as an opportunity to grow and expand. Learn new skills. Get out there and stop living as a \u201cvictim\u201d to life. Meet new people. Get into a new circle of influence. Surround yourself with people who are making progress and getting somewhere with their lives. Drop the people around you who are getting nowhere with their lives. Limit the time you spend with any family members who suck the happiness out of you. . Get help from a professional to help you heal and recover from your pains of you past. Write down your goals, put an end date on each of them and work consistently on achieving them. Write down your bucket list if you have yet to do so. There is so much you could do to live a higher quality of life. Go for it! Develop yourself so that you become the best version of yourself. Keep moving forward and make continual progress. Progress equals to happiness says Tony Robbins. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi my darling, no, not at all, you are super young and you can redo your whole programming ok? Your self worth comes from the WORDS you say in your mind, animals don\u2019t have access to language and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t suffer low self esteem, or stress. If tragedy strikes they are in shock for a few minutes, or hours and then move on. People don\u2019t know that their thoughts before bedtime are the most important thoughts of the day. Why? Because you are already in a natural state of hypnosis, and that\u2019s the time we all choose to beat ourselves up. I can see you, laying down, trying to sleep while thinking about your day. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid, I can\u2019t believe I did this, I should have told this instead of that, what was I thinking? I\u2019m really dumb, really, if I was smarter I would have done something different, I guess my brother was right, I\u2019ll always be dumb, if I was smart that girl from high school would have gone out with me, but no, she had to go out with that stupid jerk, I\u2019m a loser, I guess I\u2019ll always be a loser\u201d These are the things that many of my clients think at night, its as bad as if you were coming to see me for a hypnosis and while in hypnosis I say to you: \u201cYou are stupid, you are not good enough, don\u2019t try anything because you will never accomplish it. \u201c If I did that I\u2019d be damaging your self-perception and undermining your confidence. But no, people don\u2019t ask me to do that for them first because I charge and second because they do that to themselves. If you choose to read something happy and upbeat at night, or do a self hypnosis, there are many out there, I have some hypnosis on youtube as well. Whatever works for you but what I want you to realize is that you cannot think anything you want without consequences. You deserve a good life my dear. ",
