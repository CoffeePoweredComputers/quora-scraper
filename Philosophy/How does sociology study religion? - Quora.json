Sociology of religion is an individual paper which is introduced in many institutions which provide the discipline. It looks into how the existence of religion came about, it's role in human society, role in the larger world and everything in between. It not only looks into formal and developed religions but also studies the kinds and forms of religion that was present in the underdeveloped world throughout history. It links the effect of religion on economy through Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, looks into the relation between religion and gifting through Marcel Mauss' work \u201cThe Gift\u201d, studies superstitious beliefs through Durkheim's works.
