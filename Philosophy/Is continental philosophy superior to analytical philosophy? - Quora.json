            "answer_text": "Continental philosophy is different than analytic philosophy; it is not superior or inferior. Things can be different without being better or worse. For things to be ranked as better and worse, they must be commensurable; otherwise, any comparative valuation reflects the different values that have been applied in making a comparison. Although there are certain areas of philosophy where continental and analytic philosophy converge, they remain, at root, incommensurable \u2014 and in the most radical sense. The \u201cmeasure\u201d of analytic philosophy is the finite clarity of discursive reasoning. The \u201cmeasure\u201d of continental philosophy is what we might call (with many reservations!) the infinite idea. The infinite idea cannot be adequately represented through discursive reasoning; it cannot be \u201canalyzed\u201d into discrete elements. In most pre-20th century philosophers, these moments are not clearly set apart. (An important exception: Hegel, who makes this distinction the basis of his critique of Kant). Hence nearly all pre-20th-century philosophers can be treated either from a finite or an infinite perspective. This changes at the turn of the 20th century, partly as a result of innovations in mathematics which allowed for a logical analysis of the concept of infinity and the continuum (the real number system). Intuitive non-discursive concepts no longer seemed necessary in order to make sense of mathematics. This gave rise to a \u201cpure\u201d analytic philosophy. But it also gave rise to a \u201cpure\u201d continental philosophy, which started out by rejecting the status accorded to mathematics and scientific objectivity. Thus Heidegger, in Being and Time, argues that presence-at-hand (objective givenness) is grounded in readiness-to-hand (equipmentality), which in turn must be understand from out of the structure of Dasein as Being-in-the-world. Dasein is characterized by a kind of radical self-referentiality (it is the entity whose own Being is at issue for it) and by its radical finitude (being-toward-death). What is so curious about Heidegger is that he preserves the infinite idea \u2014in the sense of Being in its difference from beings \u2014 only by relating it to an irreducible finitude. The question of the meaning of Being only exists at the meeting point of finitude and infinitude. (Heidegger resists this terminology, and with good reason\u2026 It is too rooted in the discourse of the past. I\u2019m disregarding this scruple to make a point!) Yet more curious, though, is that what makes both \u201cpure analytic\u201d and \u201cpure continental\u201d philosophy possible is that both discovered a kind of bridge between the finite and the infinite. (In this sense: Hegel is already a \u201cpure\u201d continental philosopher.) And yet these \u201cbridges\u201d are radically incommensurable\u2026 There is a bridge of the Hegelian absolute-spirit-as-subject, of Dasein, of formal logic, and even of Derridean (or Deleuzian) difference. Perhaps one could even say that the opposition between \u201ccontinental\u201d and \u201canalytic\u201d philosophy only makes sense when applied as a way of carving up philosophers who are neither one nor the other. (Evidence: the most dogmatic, pig-headed, adherents of \u201canalytic philosophy\u201d are analytic Nietzscheans like Brian Leiter). The distinction itself has a regressive character. It is, fundamentally, a way of misunderstanding what is actually taking place\u2026 There remains, however, different solutions to the relation between finitude and infinitude, as to the relation between scientific objectivity and \u201chuman existence.\u201d These solutions are not yet compatible\u2026 They don\u2019t yet speak the same language\u2026 The problem with so many academic philosophers, on both sides of the continental divide, is that they don\u2019t even recognize this problem as the fundamental problem\u2026 They are complacent \u2014 Intellectual complacency is the one absolute enemy of philosophy. My own guiding thought is that these different \u201csolutions\u201d correspond to different modes of truth. ",

            "answer_text": "The entire notion to split philosophy into a binary of analytic and continental is exactly why nobody in America actually studies \u201ccontinental\u201d philosophy because it\u2019s only used as a way to disparage anyone who studies anything which acknowledges a certain set of arguments posited by Derrida way back in the 60s. In fact, people who study philosophy (for I could never allow them to get anywhere near the apple of their eden; to call them \u201cphilosophers\u201d) don't even know they exist. Someone, some heinous asshole\u2014invariably; or, already\u2014has posted some bullshit about how \u201ccontinental philosophy speaks to the human experience\u201d when I can garuntee you not a single modern theorist cares about whatever the fuck that means\u2014obviously some point beyond approach, the positively produced capital t \u201cTruth\u201d which enables the figuring of all following metaphysical observations. Yes, call me a relavist if it suits you to ignore anything which doesn't come in flavors of black and white, light and dark, truth and falsity and beauty and justice and all those other fun words which mean nothing without each other. As long as you wonder if a proposition is true\u2014when it is not self-evident; when it does not already function in a structure of truth; when those structures are being used to justify a presupposed natural heirarchechal binary on other structures\u2014than you'll always be circling the drain of philosophy.
