            "answer_text": "QUESTION: What are the mind and the self to you? ANSWER: Mind is a term for a mostly-continuous narrative that the brain creates for itself, for two basic reasons: - to maintain a coherent overview and chronology while amalgamating and integrating perceptions, intentions and actions - to communicate with other brains. Self is the activity and point-of-view of a living brain. So what does that word-salad mean? The brain is constantly working, constantly receiving inputs from the body and its senses, and integrating those; constantly making decisions and choosing which perceptions need more (or less) attention; causing actions assessing probabilities, and planning for what it will do next. All of this needs to be gathered and tracked somehow, and the brain does that by generating a narrative, a story. That story is pretty-much continuous, tying together all those perceptions, assessments, decisions from the past, the present, and the [anticipated] future. The ongoing story is \u201cthe mind\u201d or \u201cconsciousness\u201d. It\u2019s the surface overlay, the display if you will, of all that work going on under the surface. I\u2019d say there is a lot of overlap, with fuzzy edges because the terms are inherited from a time where we knew so much less about how brains function. We have yet to come up with new terms or an agreed-upon definition of the current terms, so there\u2019s more room for misunderstanding right now, than there will be after we\u2019ve been living with the outcomes of studies of neurology, physiology, psychology for long enough that most people, most of the time, have the same general apprehension of what each term means\u2026 and if there are any valid distinctions to maintain.

            "answer_text": "Very interesting question, however I am going to answer this one very differently You have a mind, which is made up of your left-brain analytical masculine mind and your right-brain intuitive feminine mind. When these are balanced, you have a whole brain mind. You also have an ego and personality, which can be healthy and balanced, or co-dependent and dysfunctional depending upon how balanced you are. There is also the authentic self, which is aligned with you soul and higher self - and the unauthentic self, which is aligned with your wounded ego and dysfunctional personality. To add to this, you are either energetically present in your physical body - or you are not present. You are either grounded to the earth and connected to your higher self, or you are ungrounded and disconnected from your higher self. I hope this helps - You can contact me if you have any specific questions Blessings to you - Michael ",
