            "answer_text": "The ancient Stoics certainly did believe in \u201cGod\u201d - you see references to and discussions about the divine throughout their writings - but they conceived of God, and the gods, in a way very different from how most contemporary religious people do. So if what a person has in mind in asking this question is a conception of God as you might find it in most contemporary Christian communities, for example, the answer would have to be something like: \u201cYes, the Stoics do believe in God, but they understand God to be something very different than you do.\u201d So, what did the ancient Stoics believe about God - and about the gods (plural)? As some of the other answers note, the Stoics did not believe that God was transcendent to the cosmos. Rather, they thought that the entirety of the universe was divine and rational, and that all things were ordered providentially by this divine reason or Logos. You can call that divine Logos running through the entire cosmos \u201cGod\u201d (theos, deus) if you like, or you can call it \u201cZeus\u201d - Stoic authors use both of those to name the divine. They depicted Zeus as very different from his traditional conception in Greek religion, tragedy, and epic - God or Zeus isn\u2019t the sort of thing that would be sleeping with mortal women, ticking off his wife, etc. Various Stoics expressed other views about the gods (plural), but there isn\u2019t something like a coherent, systematic doctrine about them that everyone had to accept. You\u2019ll find Epictetus, for example, speaking about a community of gods and human being, or the Stoics depicted in Cicero\u2019s On the Nature of the Gods talking about the gods as being tasked with various portions of the world (sort of similar to some conceptions of angels in monotheistic theologies, or of the orisas in Ife religions) As far as modern Stoics go, they\u2019re rather all over the map. Some are atheists or agnostics, some are believers in various religions (you can find Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, etc. people who also embrace Stoicism), and you can even find some who espouse some or all of ancient Stoic views about the divine. If your goal is to start digging into the Stoic views on the divine, one of the best places to start is Cicero\u2019s dialogue mentioned above, On the Nature of the Gods. I actually led one of my Intro to Philosophy classes through that work several years back. If you\u2019d like to watch the three lectures of that work, here they are: On the Nature of the Gods - book 1On the Nature of the Gods - book 2On the Nature of the Gods - book 3",

            "answer_text": "There is a division over that among the Stoics of today, though it has no significant impact on Stoic ethics. The Traditional Stoics do believe in a god of sorts, though it is almost certainly not the one you refer to. They believe in the pantheist god\u2014a conscious and providential Universe, also described as the Universal Reason, Divine Nature, Logos. They feel the concept of providence is important to Stoicism. The modern Stoics do not consider the existence or lack thereof of Divine Nature to be significant to the rest of Stoicism. Some are theist, some pantheist, some atheist. To the best of my knowledge this group is far more numerous. ",
