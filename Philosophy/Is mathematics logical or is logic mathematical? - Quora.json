            "answer_text": "The idea that math amounts to logic possibly originates with Euclid, who made the idea of proof fundamental to his mathematics. And while that approach has been accepted ever since \u2014 nothing is accepted in math until you can prove it \u2014 I would argue that math involves something \u201cmore,\u201d something we might call mathematical intuition. For a long time, people like Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead maintained that mathematics was really just a branch of logic. To do that, however, they had to strongly suggest that if you simply defined all your terms clearly enough, then every truth of math (even things such as Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem) would ultimately follow just by definition. So if you defined \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c+\u201d, and \u201c=\u201d with sufficient clarity, then \u201c1 + 1 = 2\u201d would follow simply from the meaning of the symbols, just as the proposition \u201cAll bachelors are unmarried\u201d follows from the definitions of the words. And Russell and Whitehead may have indeed demonstrated \u201c1 + 1 = 2\u201d. What they wanted to suggest was that ALL true mathematical propositions had that same character, even very difficult and esoteric ones. However, Kurt Godel\u2019s landmark work on his Incompleteness Theorems, which demonstrated the existence of undecidable propositions in math, doomed Russell and Whitehead\u2019s project to failure. Therefore, math is not a branch of logic, no matter how much math may depend on the tools of logic. I would say, logic provides the tools for math, just as math provides tools for science. But none of them are precisely the same. ",

            "answer_text": "This question needs to be qualified. Russell believed that logic and mathematics were the same subject. Something to be discussed. Quine, for instance, though that logic was just first order logic and with a finite number of predicates. Nice for some. But it becomes quite restrictive. I think that nowadays it is convenient to assume that \u201clogic\u201d is the basic stuff of some theory which explicate the theorie\u2019s way of making inferences, either deductive, inductive, or whatever. In this sense, logic, when analysed, involves mathematics, for the way we have to study such a framework is by mathematical means. But, does this analyses presupposes logic? Yes, some sense. It presupposes an intuitive, quite constructive reasoning, but step by spet we arrive at strong formal system were we can reconstruct our informal steps. As Kenenth Kunen has said, logic is something that must be constructed twice. Look at his book on the foundations of mathematics. So, your question depends on what do you understand by \u201clogic\u201d. As wider discipline, involving recursion theory, theory of models, mon-standard analysis, and do on, logic become a mathematical discipline, for the ancient idea that logic is the \u201cstudy of reasoning\u201d, or the study of valid forms of inference no more fit the present day status of logic. Mathematical methods are essential, but logic is a peculiar discipline. ",
