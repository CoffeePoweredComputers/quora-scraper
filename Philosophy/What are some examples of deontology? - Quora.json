            "answer_text": "A deontological ethics is any ethics which takes as its fundamental basis one or more duties or obligations. Examples are: Kantian ethics, where individual human dignity is the paramount principleThe Golden Rule, in which you determine obligations to others by asking what obligations you would like others to have to youMore detailed religious codes, such as those of IslamThe Wicca principle: an it harm none, do as thou wilt (a negative obligation in this case, i.e. something you should avoid doing, rather than something you should positively do; some would call it the Silver Rule).Ethical systems which are not deontological may still have rules, but the rules are derived rather than fundamental. The main alternative system is consequentialism, where actions are not good or bad in themselves, but are judged on the basis of their consequences. Virtue ethics can form an alternative method of ethical analysis, avoiding such closed systems. ",
