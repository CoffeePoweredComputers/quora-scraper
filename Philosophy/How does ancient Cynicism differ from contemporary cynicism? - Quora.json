            "answer_text": "Ancient Cynicism was very different from today\u2019s cynicism. Diogenes of Sinope, the most accepted and honored Cynic believed in the fundamental position of Cynicism. Humans act in their own interests as they perceive their interests. Diogenes however differed from contemporary Cynics in that he advocated moral and spiritual development. There was also the living in caves and doing private biological acts in public. Contemporary Cynicism would actually mock Diogenes as naive and deficient in knowledge and intellect for not just advocating moral and spiritual development but for even believing such fantasies as morality and spirituality exist. Contemporary Cynicism is more nihilistic and some say more realistic. This man is the apotheosis of contemporary Cynicism. Ambrose Bierce Quotes. Contemporary Cynicism honors Bierce more than Diogenes. He was not a Nihilist but there would be little of his works that a Nihilist would find incorrect. ",

            "answer_text": "Very much. The Greek school of philosophy we call Cynicism had very strict moral standards, and a definite (but severe) ethical message. What we call cynicism today more closely resembles the ancient Skeptic school than the Cynics. Cynics, for example, Diogenes of Sinope, rejected material wealth and possessions \u2014 but in order to focus on moral and spiritual development. ",
