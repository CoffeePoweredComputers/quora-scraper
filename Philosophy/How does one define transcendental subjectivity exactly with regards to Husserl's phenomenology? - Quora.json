            "answer_text": "Transcendental subjectivity refers to consciousness as it is in itself. Kant wrote in his Critique of Pure Reason, which initiated his Copernican Revolution in philosophy, \u201cI call all knowledge transcendental if it is occupied, not with objects, but with the way that we can possibly know objects even before we experience them.\u201d So, consciousness is considered as a stand-alone item that may or may not be connected to an external world, other minds, etc. It is the realm of study for the way things appear to a subject.

            "answer_text": "Anything in Husserl\u2019s phenomenology is subjective truth, including transcendental subjectivity, which will only get an individual into the 99th percentile of certainty. Anything less than the whole truth is an also-ran in your journey up the mountain of truth which is your life. The responsibility for that last \u2018increment\u2019 belongs to you and you alone, without the guidance of another entity or individual. Husserl\u2019s stuff was and is an empiricist\u2019s dream, but it is not the whole truth. Seek truth. Seek, your truth, (without the guidance of another). In consequence, all truth becomes accessible to you. ",
