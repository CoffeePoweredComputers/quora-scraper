            "answer_text": "The original link attached to this question no longer works. Nevertheless, a similar statement was tweeted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. There is certainly something to be said that some kinds of speech should definitely have consequences. The issue surrounding the statement; however, is that people fail to apply it evenhandedly. In fact, sometimes the consequences aren\u2019t even about what was said \u2014 they arise because of the person saying it and the political party he or she appears to represent. Cortez tweeted her statement about Congressman Steve King (R-IA) who she accuses of racism. But she also entirely ignores Biden\u2019s seemingly racist statements and the Democratic Party, and many others who identify as liberal also ignore any controversial statements made by members of their own party, but hop on the epithet spouting bandwagon whenever a conservative is accused of doing so. Robert Riedel's answer to What do you think about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claim that: \"Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences?\u201d During a contentious interview with radio personality Charlamagne tha God on \"The Breakfast Club,\" a popular syndicated New York radio broadcast, Biden responded to Charlemagne question about returning to the show for more questions, \u201cIf you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\u201d The statement was widely panned as \u201cracist\u201d and Biden has since tried to walk back the comments. However the treatment of Biden by his own party is in stark contrast to the way similar statements by conservatives are handled in the media. Had Trump or any Republican made a statement like that, it would have been 24-hour a day news on every media outlet, the subject of endless expert interviews reiterating over and over that the statement was racist and proof that the Whitehouse was occupied by a white supremacist. Nor is this Biden\u2019s only gaffe. But unlike conservatives who are taken to task for every comment, the media and the Democratic Party largely ignores the foibles of their own party, or others who identify as liberal. If consequences are going to arise when exercising the freedom of expression, then everyone should be treated equally.

            "answer_text": "It has to do with the common misconception that freedom of speech somehow means that one is free from criticism and judgment, when it means freedom from state censorship and legal punishments. So, if someone says something idiotic, they are and should be completely free to do so, but if he gets called an idiot, than that is protected speech too. Similarly, if nowadays someone, for example, says something racist and then many people get upset and start boycotting campaigns and demanding that that person should be fired, it does not impinge on freedom of speech in any way. People are free to criticize public statements (which is everything in social media if one is not careful) and they are free to choose not to support a private company. That is freedom of expression and these are just consequences of the original utterance. Quite many complaints about free speech nowadays center on this issue. Twitter has no requirement to allow accounts that disagree with their terms of service. Facebook has no requirement either. They are private entities and can control their content. Universities can do this too. Of course people have rights that say they shoudn\u2019t be judged due to their race, ideology or religion, but this doesn\u2019t cover anyplace anywhere. In a nutshell, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences is the same everybody learns very early in life: if you behave like an asshole, you will be treated like one. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve got mixed feelings on this one. Part of American free speech is that we have developed a culture of free speech. Politically we used to respect that others could disagree with us, while we could still be friends or acknowledge that they were decent people. We seem to have gotten away from that, where many think that any disagreement from our point of view needs to be challenged and punished. I\u2019m a basketball fan. I realize that many of the players are on the liberal side of the political spectrum. I choose to let them have their points of view while not throwing a boycott tantrum if they say something I disagree with. That said, I sympathize with those who are upset with the kneelers in the NFL who are making a scene out of what should be a unifying moment during the anthem at the start of games. If you go too far out of your way to thumb your nose at your customers, eventually they are going to have enough and stop supporting you. If you are a marginal talent (Colin Kaepernick) who causes your employer to lose revenue, it might not be worth the trouble paying your salary if I will lose fans. I was very troubled by what happened after Prop 8 in California when donor lists were used to get people fired from a variety of employers who happened to have donated to a cause they believed in. While this was not government imposed restriction, it was very much counter to the idea that we should be able to say what we want in our private time. ",

            "answer_text": "Freedom of speech encompasses anything anyone says that does not lead to immediate or specific acts of violence and that are not knowingly lies intended to harm the reputation of a specific person. Those are the *only* two exceptions. You can be as profane as you like. In earlier times profanity was, on occasion, considered as an incitement to riot, but even that reading is long since gone. You can be as hateful as you like. Say terrible things. Offensive things. None of that is prohibited under freedom of speech. The proper response to bad speech is more speech, telling why it was bad. Even the old canard about not shouting fire in a crowded theater isn\u2019t valid. In fact, the Justice who first said it took it back shortly thereafter when he saw how it was being misinterpreted. There can be legal consequences to shouting fire in a crowded theater, but not due to the speech itself. It is covered under wanton endangerment, just like driving while intoxicated or any other *act* that knowingly causes unwitting others to be put in significant danger without their consent. It would also apply to, say, someone hauling a piano up to a third floor room outside the building without first clearing out the sidewalk below or a chemist that put a dangerous chemical in an orange juice bottle and sticks it in the fridge without keeping a 100% watch on it before he takes it back out.

It is important to know the difference between uncivilized bad miscreant behavior and honorable freedom of speech intended for conveying ideas or opinions with intellectual context and in a civilized manner. Under the First Amendment, you have the right to use hateful words like curse words and also a right to talk about hateful ideas such as Nazi torture techniques or sexual perversions but that does not include hate speech that is racist bigotry. Under international human rights, every person from the day of their birth possess the right to freedom of speech that applies at all times and in all places, in public and private, in government and business, online and the workplace. In a democratic society, your free speech rights are also protected from consequences, threats, and coercion in order to guarantee that the speaker is expressing his true honest opinions without adjustment for threats.

Innacurately describe something nerds know about and getting corrected? That\u2019s just cause-and-effect. The distinction, however, is whether IT stops you or YOU stop you. If you touch fire and it burns you, technically the only thing stopping you from touching it again is your own fear. If an authority puts a wall between you and the fire because that\u2019s how stupid you are, THAT is censorship. If you make a movie and the Hayz office won\u2019t let you sell it, that\u2019s censorship. If you make a movie and people decide for themselves not to see it, that\u2019s consequences. ",

Insulting speech is protected while inducing violence with speech is not. He is not helped by this question, whose intent I find masked by the language used.
