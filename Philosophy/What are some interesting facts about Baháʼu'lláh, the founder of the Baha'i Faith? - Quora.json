            "answer_text": "There is nothing new in the religion brought by Bahaullah. Each and every principle that Bahais boast about was already a part of Christianity. So a false religion cannot have an upper hand on a true divine religion.Bahaullah had four wives. (Bahaullah married Jamaliyya after writing Kitab e Aqdas so no bahais can say that bahaullah married his fourth wife when he was a muslim) - The Life of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah, Compared to JesusBab had appointed Mirza Yahya Subhe Azal as his successor. However Bahaullah usurped the rights of his own half brother and took over the leadership by claiming the title of \u2018Him Whom God Shall Manifest\u2019 for himself.Bahaullah did not fulfill the conditions of \u2018Him Whom God Shall Manifest\u2019 as per the writings of Bab.Bahaullah did not follow any of the principle that he taught. The same has been clearly explained in my blog. Researchers may visit - 12 Principles of the Baha'i FaithBahaullah claimed himself God while Bahais call him a prophet founder of the faith. (Stanford Dsouza's answer to Does Bahaism have a god? If, so how would you identify their god from anyother god?)I leave the readers with just one thought that this life is very small do not waste it by following someone who was not even a percent of what Jesus was. If you are not a Bahai better not waste your time behind this so called faith. And if you are a Bahai then independently investigate the truth and ask questions to your LSA NSA UHJ whatever you call it and your raising questions will get you contradictory answers and you will understand the truth about this organization. Is Baha\u2019i Superior to Christianity? ",

This title was actually awarded to someone else by the Bab, I think it was awarded to Tahirih.Baha\u2019u\u2019llah was a victim of domestic violence. His step-mother used to beat his father for money.Baha\u2019u\u2019llah used to read books of Muslim scholars and Muslim philosophers, this is mentioned by his own sister Izziyyih Khanum in her book Tanbih ul Naemeen.Baha\u2019u\u2019llah had 3 wives and 1 concubine. He had 14 children.Baha\u2019u\u2019llah owned slaves.Baha\u2019u\u2019llah and his followers were banished from one country to another because of their crimes, not because of their faith.After the death of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah two of his wives disbelieved in him. Most of his children broke the covenant after his death.Baha\u2019u\u2019llah is accused of sodomy by his own brother, Mirza Yahya.Baha\u2019u\u2019llah ordered to throw most of his own writings in river Tigris.",
