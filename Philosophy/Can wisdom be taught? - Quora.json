            "answer_text": "Let's first understand, what's wisdom? The ability to make sensible decisions and judgements because of your knowledge or experience. Definition source- Google dictionary. Wisdom is the gap between theory and practical. It's about extracting useful information from knowledge and experiences and applying it in decision-making. For example- Applying brakes to stop a car is theory, and knowing this theory is knowledge. Applying brakes fast to stop a car instantly is also knowledge. Once, I applied the brakes of my vehicle with high pressure. However, it stopped only after a few seconds. This is an experience, which altered my knowledge a little. Some days back I was driving a car on the highway, suddenly the car ahead stopped as it missed a turn. I immediately applied the brakes to avoid an accident, but not with high pressure. Thus my vehicle stopped only after dragging for a few metres, inches away from the car. My father, who was sitting beside me asked me the reason of applying brakes slowly. I explained him how a truck was speeding behind us and if I would have pressed the brakes hard, the truck driver wouldn't be able to stop the heavy vehicle on time despite applying the brakes, and we could have been a part of a major accident. By applying brakes a little slow, I made a balance between the vehicle ahead and the truck at the back and saved our car from an accident from any of the side. The way I used my knowledge, observation and experience to take the best decision in the critical situation is wisdom. Question- Can wisdom be taught? Yes, wisdom can be taught by experienced people, like I shared this example with you. Next time you drive a vehicle, you would be careful about this aspect. However, the best way to acquire wisdom is by analysing other people's actions and experiences, and by learning from our failures and experiences. Wisdom can't be acquired only by reading books. Be observant and a good listener to be wise. ",

            "answer_text": " Yes and No. Mostly learned through experience but somewhat can be imparted by people with wisdom. My wisdom guides me with the powerful 80\u201320 concept that is 80% wisdom is gained through experience and 20% through knowledge imparted from others. Wisdom is very easy to understand but very difficult to apply in real life. What is Wisdom? Wisdom is the ability to know what is true or right, common sense or the collection of one's knowledge. Wisdom is more than just the accumulation of knowledge. It is the thoughtful and enlightened application of it. Example - So a simple example would be in these times of pandemic, as we are informed by government and authorities to stay at home so that we can collectively fight coronavirus. This is knowledge. And the best application of this knowledge is to stay home and keep yourself and others safe too. This is wisdom. Knowing what to do and what not in every situation. Check your wisdom level first : 10 pointer check Are you aware of yourself every moment? Your reaction to things and situations around is what is lacked by many.Are you curious lifelong? Are you excited to learn about the depth of various dimensions of this universe.Do you interact with others the way you interact with yourself? Are you showing signs of resourcefulness, love, humility and empathy to others? Also, do you distance yourself from people who bring you down?Do you know that your mind and body are the most important verticals of your life? Taking care of them is your duty.Do you practice detachment? Do you know that what we perceive is all in mind? Life will be followed by death? Happiness followed by misery? Do you remain balanced in all situations of life after understanding this?Do you practice spirituality to reach to your soul and know who you are?Do you know and practice happiness over money or material needs?Do you practice delayed gratification to unlock better opportunities for the future?Do you go to bed smarter than when you woke up?Do you focus on what is in your control or worry about everything and try to fix it?How to develop wisdom? Wisdom of the past - There is a deep wisdom in the past., letting one discover, connect and gain inspiration from a reservoir of information.Difficulties breeds wisdom - The more difficulties a person has gone through in life, the chances of his / her gaining wisdom early are more. Difficulties will test your values, create and solidify your morals. Treat everything as something you learn from, and you will educate yourself on the art of living a balanced, undisturbed life.Wisdom through self help books - The purpose of self help helps is to acquire wisdom. Self-help books are filled with wisdom.New-found Wisdom - Talking to yourself in the third person brings clarity and insight about the current situation or problem. Being detached removes the emotional bias that one has, but is unaware of. Meditation helps.Untapped Wisdom - There is a huge amount of untapped wisdom and potential in older people. So always seeks wisdom from older people in form of parents, mentors, volunteers etc.Points 1\u20134 make 80% and point 5 makes 20% (what I wrote above) Act on your wisdom The advice absorbed above is now to be acted upon to actually gain wisdom. Wisdom tends to be less effective with time so act upon the suggestions to gain better wisdom and live a fulfilling life. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and no. Allow me to explain, but first, let's look at what wisdom means.  \u200b Wisdom is inherently good judgement. You may have knowledge, and you may acquire experience, but if you fail to make good judgement, it's pointless to have the other two. While knowledge can be taught, and you may also learn vicariously through the experiences of others, but the most important aspect, i.e. the ability to make good judgement can not be taught. For example, a person who has years of experience, and has acquired vast knowledge may in a fit of anger, or when overcome by lust, fail to make sound judgement.  We all have weaknesses like envy, lust, anger, greed, and pride that can lay waste to all our knowledge and experience. The one who is able to keep these vices in check is the wise master.  However, how you may keep these vices in check can not be taught. It's what you teach yourself. ",

In 8th grade, I was taught about the wisdom of using condoms from people who had experienced first hand just how bad things could be if condoms weren't used. That stuck with me, fortunately. In fact wisdom should be taught more in schools. There are so many important life lessons to learn. Wisdom is arguably more important - as it confers happiness later if life, much more so than the ability to memorize data for tests. ",
