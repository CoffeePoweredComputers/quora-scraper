            "answer_text": "Physical beauty is defined by health and longevity. But it is only as good as the soul that the body contains. If i was only interested in physical beauty i would have a good time dating a sculpture. It is the mind and heart of a person that makes or breaks their appearance. A relatively healthy person with a heart of gold will make your heart sing all day long. But a person in peak physical condition who is mean spirited and selfish will, after a minute, look totally unattractive and gross. A person who has a morbid health condition, even if they are as sweet as sugar, will often not be very attractive because most people don\u2019t want to fall too far in love with a person who will die on them. Its not that we can\u2019t, its just that most of us are too scared to try. Because then we\u2019ll be widows and widowers. But if you do have a morbid condition don\u2019t give up hope because remember \u201clove conquers all\u201d. And believe me it will. Just look around. Everyone gets a morbid condition eventually because we all die at some point of something. On a second note ladies. All this talk about independence is good. But as a man i want some one that i can take care of. I want to be needed and appreciated. So don\u2019t be ashamed of your flaws and concerns because many times they are what make a relationship work out. A totally independent person has no need for anyone else so why would they be a great partner, unless your a leech. In fact i dont think anyone on earth is totally independent because we need each other to have children and without children we can\u2019t survive. It isn\u2019t always bad to be clingy because if a guy wants to get married we know a clingy girl is a good bet. It isn\u2019t bad to be needy sometimes because we love to take care of our women. I assume women often feel the same way. It is bad to be unrealistic, so don\u2019t expect a millionaire lifestyle or a girl who wont have cellulite in her 90\u2019s. But if a millionaire or a supermodel shows up don\u2019t think its too good to be true be cause Bill Gates and Heidi Klum need lovin too. Emotional reliance on someone and a need that your S.O. can take care of is the spice of living together so never be ashamed of your heart or your tummy. Just because they are perfect looking or rich beyond measure doesn\u2019t negate the fact that they need some one to talk to and cuddle on. Namaste XOXOXO Me ",

            "answer_text": "It's both. We all agree on the beauty of a sunset, a rainbow, a flower, and a friendship. If beauty was completely subjective we would never agree on what is or isn't beautiful. But we do agree. Often. Of course we have preferences on what is more beautiful than the other. But it's probably all beautiful. Our opinions are more like choosing a favorite color. No one color is more beautiful than another. In fact they are completely dependent on eachother for their definitions. But we are free imagine that one is more beautiful than them all. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Kevin Carter! I think it solely depends on the opinion of the person. In my personal opinion, \u201cBeauty is in the Eye of the Beholder.\u201d Beauty is fundamentally the simplest and greatest sensation you suddenly feel in your heart and eyes that just floods your whole mind and you only think to yourself \u201cYess, that is the moment that should never end!\u201d But usually, it\u2019s so fast gone as it came. But I guess that\u2019s exactly the definition of beauty. It\u2019s enjoying every second of it before it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s what we, on a personal perspective, perceive and see as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d It\u2019s in sharing this, with others, that is true beauty in the form of gratitude and compassion. To finalize this answer and make my thoughts about what is beauty clear: Beauty is what You find holds truth and a sensation of wonderfullness in your eyes. Thanks, Hope you liked it; even if it was very short :) ",

So when someone says something is beautiful that\u2019s because to them, it meets the criteria of what they think beauty is, but then again everyone has a range of criteria to what they define as beautiful.
