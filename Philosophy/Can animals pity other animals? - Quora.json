            "answer_text": "Pity is a hard thing to define or to identify, but they can certainly feel cross-species empathy and concern - bearing in mind that humans are also animals. Many cats and dogs, for example, show concern if their human friends are upset. One of the stories told about the famous, and famously eccentric, 19thC Hungarian mare Kincsem, probably the greatest racehorse who ever lived, is that one cold night she took her own blanket off and draped it over her stableboy, and thereafter always insisted that he should have her blanket. I have read that both wolves and foxes will care for the orphaned cubs of other individuals, although in that case it's within the same species. In the 1930s there was a champion standard-bred (that is, about Dalmatian-sized) poodle named Nunsoe Duc de la Terrace (Duke to his friends) who one day went out for a run and came home carrying a stray kitten in his mouth, with whom he shared his dinner. Duke and the kitten became lifelong friends and would run around the neighbourhood together, and if Duke wanted to go fast he would just pick his cat up and carry her to their destination. There was a story from circa the 1970s, which so far as I know was true, about a mother and daughter going out riding along the side of a canal when the daughter's horse stumbled and she fell off, hit her head on the side and ended up face down and unconscious in the water. In front of the mother and a lock keeper her horse - a middle-aged Irish Draught gelding whom she hadn't even known for very long - jumped into the water (which was evidently shallow enough for him to get his hooves on a solid floor), stuck his whole face under water and used the back of his neck to heave the girl out onto the bank. And of course there are many well-attested stories of dogs saving drowning humans, often without being ordered to, and I also remember a case of a Border collie who without being instructed to do so ran into a burning barn and got his sheep out and to safety, burning his own paws in the process. I also remember in the late 1970s or 1980s reading about an experiment in which lab rats were given the option of getting a treat but if they did so another rat, whom they could see, would get a mild electric shock - and they chose to forego the treat, So whether non-human animals feel pity, exactly, many of them are able to feel concern when they see that a member of their own or another species is in distress, and will often attempt to do something about it.

            "answer_text": "I honestly believe some animals do but our human interpretation of pity could be wrong when it comes to that. I saw a documentary on Discovery Channel, or one similar, where an elephant calf was stuck in quick-sand. The entire herd seemed to be in an utter state of pity and they all rallied round the quagmire in an attempt to save the young. There was weeping and wailing and stomping of feet and this continued until the calf was saved. I don't know if Discovery uses camera tricks to garner viewership but I saw what appeared to be real tears flowing from some of them. Now take some domesticated animals. I've seen pigs slaughtered and their pen mates could care less. They even seem to rejoice the fact that with one less mouth to feed their ration could be increased. Chickens will attack and kill a pen mate showing the slightest wound. ",
