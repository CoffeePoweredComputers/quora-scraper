            "answer_text": "I imagine you mean \u2018waiting\u2019 in terms of the concept of Gelassenheit, right? You might find this piece by Barbara Pezze useful, though it\u2019s not particularly concise\u2026 Speaking generally, Heidegger is concerned with the nature of thinking. He starts off critiquing what he calls \u201ccalculative thinking\u201d: goal-oriented, mechanistic, concrete, active thinking; the thinking of a scientist, or an academic, or a businessman (or really, of most of us in most of our daily lives). This form of thinking, for Heidegger, is ultimately sterile; it collapses to and enslaves us under technos (my term for the forms and systems of technology/bureaucracy; the reduction of human life to a set of calculations and measurements). Someone sets their eye on a particular goal (be it a job, or a house, or a car, or a lover), does the steps necessary to achieve it; sets their eye on another goal, does the steps; sets their eye on another goal\u2026 an entire life might be lived that way with the mechanical precision of a robot. If one wants to call that a life\u2026 He goes on to suggest that what we are really after is Gelassenheit (the essence of thinking, or meditative thinking). Where calculative thinking is action-based, meditative thinking is thought without action. To quote the article I linked above: If calculative thinking does not think beyond the usefulness of what it engages with, meditative thinking would notice and become aware of the fact that these devices are not just extremely useful to us. It would also notice that they, by being so extremely useful, at the same time are \u201cshackling\u201d us: \u201csuddenly and unaware we find ourselves so firmly shackled to these technical devices that we fall into bondage to them\u201d (ibid., p. 53-54). If man, not being aware of this, is in a situation of being chained to these machineries, then by becoming conscious of this he finds himself in a different relation to them. He becomes free of them. With this awareness man can utilize these instruments just as instruments, being at the same time free to \u201clet go of them at any time\u201d (ibid., p. 54). And this is so because once we acknowledge that their usefulness implies the possibility for us to be chained to them, we deal with them differently; we \u201cdeny them the right to dominate us, and so to wrap, confuse, and lay waste our nature\u201d (ibid., p.54). It is a matter of a different comportment towards them; it is a different disposition to which Heidegger gives the name \u201creleasement toward things\u201d [die Gelassenheit zu den Dingen] (ibid., p.54) In other words, we can use a tool like an iPhone to do all sorts of things (that\u2019s normal calculative thinking), but unless we can step back and see our relationship to the tool \u2014 step back and see, for instance, how much of our lives we spend on Quora or Facebook; see what urges and drives bring us to spend our time that way \u2014 we are simply slaves to the tool. Now, Gelassenheit is undefined (and probably indefinable); we don\u2019t know what the essence of thinking (non-active, meditative thinking) is. But waiting is the doorway to it. Waiting is the most obvious and salient form of non-active engagement; it is (so to speak) the action that leads us to non-action. We don\u2019t want to wait for something; that is an active (calculative) mindset that is looking for a particular thing to come down the pike. We simply want to wait, which is neither an end in itself nor a means to any particular end. Heidegger is converging on Eastern mysticism here, and there is a whole lot I could say from that perspective. But I think this covers it in a nutshell. ",
