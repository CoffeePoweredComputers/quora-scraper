            "answer_text": "Of course. I have two main criticisms of BLM. The first regards its decentralized organization. This is a feature is shared with other Millennial movements such as Occupy Wall Street. This has translated into a predictable lack of discipline. Thanks to this, it\u2019s easy for certain elements to use the protests as a way to riot, vandalize, and steal. If you talk to most conservatives, these negative images are all they see about BLM. The lack of organized discipline is that when local chapters have idiosyncratic leaders who say asinine things that are political malpractice, this is easily picked up by hostile conservative media and played to White audiences all over the country. See? This Black Lives Matters leaders says such and such about White people. Here she is on video. There are people on the left who are always going to be sympathetic. There are people on the right who are always going to be hostile. But there are a lot of hearts and minds in the middle that can be convinced. BLM has spectacularly failed in this. This brings me to my second point.BLM has allowed itself to be cornered into becoming a far-Left activist group. This was worse than a crime; it was a mistake. You can\u2019t get your priorities passed if you\u2019re perceived this way. Even potentially sympathetic Republicans will be forced to distance themselves from you. What you need to have is an organization that has friends in both parties, an organization that makes friends among police departments, imperfect as they are. You need an organization that awards prizes to police departments, that gives police chiefs an opportunity for positive publicity. At the moment, BLM is an implacable enemy, with very little positive to say about any police department. The movements should be trumpeting positive change every time a police department somewhere tries. You can\u2019t allowed to be seen as the angry Black people who are always mad about something and will never be satisfied. You can\u2019t afford to have all police departments unified against you. You need a split among their ranks. Embracing some police departments and some Republican lawmakers like Rand Paul will make them feel like the good guys and will give them further incentive to embrace some of the reforms you suggest. But why in the world would they listen to a group they consider to be on the lunatic fringe of the far-Left?As I hinted above, these were the same issues I had with the Occupy movement, which erupted in a paroxysm of emotion and was gone from the scene without accomplishing a damn thing. Young liberals too often feel that it\u2019s enough for them to protest and express their emotions. Well, I\u2019ve got news for you: no one gives a damn. Protests uncoupled from a legislative agenda go nowhere. And to have a specific legislative agenda with a chance of passage, you\u2019re going to have to get your hands dirty and to make deals with the powers that be. Otherwise you\u2019re going to get to feel all pure and aloof, but you won\u2019t change a damn thing on the ground. ",

The killings at the hands of US police no one is talking about Yes black ID'd experience it a notch up but it's not presented that way. That would require somewhat more attention not all of it. Dark skin matters would be more accurate. People considered black won't experience that same social friction because can have tan or peach skin. A dark skinned South Asian or Polynesian can have a \u201cblack\u201d experience. Unproductive. Okay, those who haven't acknowledged a bias aren't at this point so now what? It started strong and has fizzled but being kept on life support. Turning it into blackvotingmatters would actually be productive. I've seen he hash tag used when a black ID'd person has been killed by the police with no clear information. It can be justified sometimes so it comes off like tribalism and defending a criminal. Snap assumptions either way is wrong. Splintered. Anyone and everyone uses it. Its decentralized but comes off as a singular voice when it's factions. ",
