            "answer_text": "I have an MSc and PhD in Psychobiology. I routinely translate it as Neuroscience, because that's what it is. Psychobiology \u2014 the study of the biological basis of psychology, a.k.a., the brain. Now on to Biopsychology, I don't recall hearing that name often. But my hunch would be that it relates to psychology applied to the comparative study of species. That's out of the realm of psychology (largely human focused) and into the realm of biology (usually studying non-human species or comparing humans to these). Biopsychology \u2014 the taxonomic study of animal behaviour. There's a more common name for that: Ethology. ",
