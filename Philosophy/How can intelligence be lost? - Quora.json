            "answer_text": "Simple question with a complicated answer. First, we have to recognize that intelligence is a somewhat slippery concept. We have no good definition of intelligence any more than we have a good definition of happiness. What we can do is identify certain skills or potentials. Verbal IQ tests measure your facility with words and concepts such as the relationships among them and the ability to reach different levels of abstraction. One may have a very high verbal IQ and a dismal mathematical IQ. Likewise, one may be able to grasp very abstruse mathematical concepts without a lick of mathematical education, yet be unable to deal with verbal abstractions beyond a superficial level. Some may score extremely well in every measure on a standardized test like the Weschler or Stanford-Binet tests and be utterly incompetent in dealing beyond a superficial level in the ordinary tasks of life that the average person handles quite well. This is even before we begin to discuss the whole question of the mind-body dichotomy. This is the question of whether the mind and the brain are synonymous or whether the mind is separate and the brain is merely the link between the mind and the body in the same way that the circuitry of a radio is the link between the speaker at the transmitting end and the listener/audience at the other end. Either model explains why physical damage to the radio or brain results in gobbledygook at the listener\u2019s end or even nothing at all. Damage to the brain\u2019s/radio\u2019s circuitry can result in odd behavior, apparent personality change, or apparent loss in intelligence, but in one case, in which the mind and brain are the same, intelligence is lost, but in the other intelligence is not lost but may no longer be capable of being fully expressed or expressed at all. We are all familiar with the reports of people in comas who are aware of everything that happens around them if they awaken, but were completely unable to react to those events while comatose. Even without resolving that fundamental question, we can see how intelligence can be preserved in a human brain while the ability to express it may be partially or completely lost. Some stroke victims may suffer what is called expressive aphasia. In this condition a person make be able to think quite clearly, but when he or she tries to speak, the words just don\u2019t come out right. How do we know this? Often someone with expressive aphasia can communicate quite clearly using a computer or paper and pencil. As you can see, this could be the case regardless of the answer to the mind-body dichotomy question. If the brain is all there is, this result means apthe part of the brain used to express the result of thinking in words has been damaged whereas the thinking part has not and IQ has not been impaired. In the second view, thinking is never impaired even if every other part of the cortex has been damaged. So, to answer your question we can assume that the brain is all there is, though I don\u2019t think that is so. In that case, intelligence can clearly be lost by a thing that physically alters the brain. Obviously a stroke or other brain trauma may diminish intelligence. Any disease process may also affect intelligence to the extent it involves the brain (a high fever, for example, brain dehydration from high blood sugar levels in diabetes, for example). Such losses may be temporary or permanent. Aging may do the same, at least to the extent that it is accompanied by such things as atherosclerotic changes that narrow or harden arteries. Chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may do the same by affecting the amount of oxygen available. So too, in my estimation, can a lack of exercise in thinking. Studies show that people who use their brains more, such as people who are aging but do crossword puzzles, logic puzzles, etc., or who just get out and about, interact with others, and live in the outside world rather that staying alone indoors retain their faculties much longer. I once had a patient in my former career, a young women who tragically backed off a cliff while getting her picture taken by friends by taking one too many steps back, who survived but with serious head injuries. This was tragic enough, but worse was the fact that she could remember what it was like to have a quick and agile mind and thereby know what she had lost. It saddened me more than many another case that might seem more awful, if you know what I mean. ",

            "answer_text": "To a certain degree it\u2019s a use it or lose it type of thing. I guess in the theory it can be like a muscle, and likewise atrophy could occur. Though the brain is not a muscle, learning is lost to a degree after time. If you don\u2019t maintain, or build intellectual capacity then you\u2019re losing it. Otherwise head injuries, dementia, stroke, and so on are incidental type factors that could produce a loss of intelligence. ",

            "answer_text": "The obvious answer is injury or illness. But other than that, you can certainly lose facility is various cognitive skills due to age or dis-use. You can get better at the sorts of skills an IQ test measures, but I doubt by much, since a good IQ test should, theoretically, be immune to that sort of thing. Theoretically. Mensa, for example, allows for a certain score on the SAT for admission. But we all know that kids today do all sorts of SAT \u201cprep\u201d studies to boost their scores. Does this really increase \u201cintelligence\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d? The bottom line is that, while IQ may not be boosted, you get \u201csmarter\u201d if you actually use your brain, regardless of that \u201cIQ\u201d number. ",
