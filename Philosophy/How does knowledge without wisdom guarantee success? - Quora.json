            "answer_text": "Hi, great question. thank you for request to answer. I am a Jew so obviously don't do bible. I am also a Mishnah Jew-(oral concept taught only) - Jew; but saying that doesn't mean I don't understand the malarkey of those who do. Mishnah Jews are like the Example of Moses . . . no books, no religious teacher, no scrolls, no temples or church building to attend/but rather Objective Understanding of the desire of Ruach HaKodesh Himself (you know; the \u201cBurning Bush\u201d style) instead. Period \u2018knowledge only works from the \u2018brain\u2019. It truly boils down to the \u2018rue\u2019 of \u2018wisdom\u2019.\u201cWisdom\u201d can\u2019t, doesn\u2019t, won\u2019t work from a/the \u2018brain\u2019. Brains are just like computer hard drives and only really give really \u2018dry\u2019 answer. The brain knows the answers are \u2018dry\u2019 so it calls up the \u2018Emotions\u2019 dept. and have them fly in a bunch of emotions to choose from, to help you to understand the \u2018dry\u2019 answer. It becomes your \u2018choice\u2019 to pick the best emotion to fit your personality. The issue becomes that those emotions are like \u2018fireworks\u2019, great to look at; but soon the \u2018smoke\u2019 from those emotions fog up the \u2018smarter\u2019 choice. Now, Wisdom (she is my sweetheart) actually lives in a pure (cleaned up from all that religious, and social dross) . . . (poop) . . . Chair (throne) in the very center of your heart (smak dab in the middle of it) She never sends out a fireworks show to help out; doesn\u2019t need to. Her answers are always spanking clean of fog. Wisdom is always waiting for you to visit her, but the hitch is, . . . you just can\u2019t fake her out if you try to con her that your heart is \u2018clean\u2019 . . . if it really isn\u2019t. She can sniff that \u2018she/yit\u2019 from far off. Even if it\u2019s only just a bit stinky . . . then, you have to cancel the visit because the door to her will remain \u2018locked\u2019.\u2018 Knowledge without wisdom will only work until the \u2018gunpowder in the fireworks\u2019 burns. Then you will only have to wait untill the \u2018smoke\u2019 clears. If you read the fine print . . . you will see the guarantee expires the moment the \u2018smoke\u2019 disappears. The way it guarantees success is only on the ads, posters, commercials, door knockers, doorbell ringers, and it\u2019s parking lot panhandlers, sending you to see the \u2018stage show\u2019 of it\u2019s team of \u2018master magicians\u2019. On the drive home from the show, (then and only then) it will dawn on you that you\u2019ve just been screwed. just that simple Have a great day from that damn Jew boy ",

            "answer_text": "It does not. Wisdom is experience plus time. Knowledge is not wisdom. There seems to be a movement of self-learners. It\u2019s good to self-learn, but\u2026 THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR EXPERIENCE!!! One of the issues with being self-taught is that you only get one perspective. One of the biggest strengths entrepreneurs possess, when they possess it, is an open-mind. One take on something does not an open mind make. The issue with one-sides knowledge is that without experience, one doesn\u2019t know the value of experience. And for some ridiculous reason, the young don\u2019t seem to understand that older people have been what they are going through, and have the experience. You do not want to go through a major part of your life without experience, to find the importance of it. You will have missed out on a whole lot of opportunity for experience. One of the top reasons people fail in business???? Lack of experience! Learn now or learn later. When we learn later, we often wish we would have learned sooner. ",

            "answer_text": "The way that I \u2018see\u2019 it, knowledge is of little use without wisdom. The problem for most of us is that we have listened to the falsehoods of society, believed that nonsense, and have little wisdom. We are taught lies so that others can keep us barely surviving in the many weak states of Fear and most humans still believe much (if not most0 of what they are taught. This is true even when we have a niggle, down deep, telling us that something is not quite Right with what we are being taught. Since a vast majority of what we have been taught is simply not True, as the universe would determine True, we are open for total control by others. Unfortunately those others are pretty nasty people. From decades of study, based on both my training and experience in Science, plus my life experiences and self-taught understandings from Philosophy, I now understand that we are eternal, spiritual beings having a series of trips in human bodies made of stardust. We have a Destiny of becoming Great examples of living Love, but are largely dissuaded away from that by society. Some will choose to grow in Love and many will choose to just barely survive in Fear. Choose your path! ",

            "answer_text": "Knowledge alone can not guarantee success if wisdom at first is not involved.What I mean is the only knowledge we know now is of shortened wisdom .People can tell other of their knowledge yet lack the ability to explain because wisdom is not involved. Wisdom and knowledge should be addressed together and never separated from one another because it is through Wisdom we find knowledge or through Knowledge we find Wisdom. This is different from person to person but based on the documents I read I could conclude by saying Wisdom is what we are looking for , meaning we look for wisdom with the navigation of knowledge . Success therefore need balance between the two if we maintain knowledge at 50% we still need to maintain Wisdom with 50% but it's tricky because Wisdom needs 100% and knowledge 100% ",

            "answer_text": "Knowledge acts as a foundation for wisdom. Learning is the process of understanding the how. Wisdom is understanding the when. Without a proper initial foundation then what you build upon it will become very flawed. An example of this is making a decision based upon bad information which results in a choice that is harmful. With proper knowledge higher quality choices can be made and experiences can be more easily learned from which makes gaining wisdom in those experiences much easier. ",
