            "answer_text": "The ultimate truth, according to most of the spiritualists be it Aurobindo or Swami Vivekanand or Kabir or Guru Nanak, is about experiencing oneness with every being in this world, removing the very sense of ego or \u2018I\u2019 and seeing the entire world as fluid and one. Vedanta philosophy, elaborately explored by Swami Vivekanand in his body of works, outlines the following four methods or four types of Yoga (Yoga stands for union of mind, body and soul) for seeking truth: Bhakti Yoga: where you surrender to devotion to either a formless God/teacher or one with form. Meera bai and Ramakrishna Paramhamsa or Rumi were Bhakti Yogis.Jnana Yoga (Gyana Yoga): where you reach that oneness via acquisition of knowledge. Dayanand Saraswati or Swami Vivekanand are paragons in this field.Raja Yoga: This outlines the practice of tough physical practice of Hatha Yoga, where the oneness is reached by winning control over senses using one\u2019s body as a tool. Several anonymous Himalayan yogis strive for this.Karma Yoga: The most attainable yet most difficult way to seek ultimate truth for the masses is to practice this: work with sincerity yet detachment, unaffected by the results of the action. This requires great self-control and equanimity.",
