            "answer_text": "There are a number of forums that tend to be attended to by philosophers, the most prevalent of which is Philosophy Forums (which is just as active today as when I found it in high school some seven years ago). Forums are great as online communities as you can engage in debate somewhat more easily than Quora allows. Forums tend to have fewer laymen and support somewhat more rigor than other social platforms. Next to Philosophy Forums would have to be Twitter. While 140 characters seems rather tight, there is considerable discourse online (often extended by blog post exchanges). And, despite the tight discourse (as philosophical as it may be), there is also a great number of philosophers on Twitter, a great portion of whom are academics and students of philosophy. One person in particular, Rani Lill Anjum maintains lists of  Philosophers on Twitter, which count more than 1,300 as of this answer. It is an amazing way to network, and my studies (let alone my general philosophical disposition) have benefited greatly from the vast and accessible network of philosophers on Twitter. Beyond these two larger communities, there are less 'maintained' communities such as those on Reddit, and those here on Quora, and your own personal communities (friends and groups on Facebook!). Academia.edu could also be a great resource (though I admittedly only currently use it to stalk pre-publication papers and thesis work). And, of course, the best communities are those offline, where you can meet up and stroke beards in person, be it through faculty and academia, journal clubs, across the cafe tables, or under a tree.
