            "answer_text": "Well, it is worse than that. Nobody even seems to care what the word \u201cfree\u201d stands for in this context. What do we wish our will to be free of? All influences? But that\u2019s not free, that\u2019s oblivious. Clearly, minimally, we wish to be influenced by information about our surroundings. Support from below. Pressure from the atmosphere. Photons from a light source. And so on. So how do we pick what do we wish to be free of when making choices? Every path of possibility is a constraint at the same time. The very act of taking a pick cuts us off from everything else. Freedom is constraints we like. Period. Sometimes we wish to have the \u201cfreedom\u201d of making choices, other times we wish to have the \u201cfreedom\u201d of not having to make choices. Whenever we like something we call it free. Sometimes we call it freedom when we are not being constrained in our actions. Sometimes we huddle up on a two wheeled engine that moves at a constant speed while being contstraind by a narrow band of pavement. For hours. Same posture, same direction, same speed. And we call that freedom too. Besides, our beliefs with respect to our freedom of choice do not seem to have any influence on our behavior. A hard core determinist\u2019s actions are absolutely indistinguishable from the actions of a hard core libertarian. They even argue the same way, as if they thought their audience had choices. However, the determinist supposedly thinks s/he has no choice but to behave as if they thought they had the freedom to argue against it. Now, ain\u2019t that just wonderful? IMHO, determinism and free will are among the worse ideas humans came up with so far, slightly topped by compatibilism - an attempt to cook up something good from two hopelessly spoiled ingredient.

            "answer_text": "The recognition that we DON\u2019T matters significantly. Why? Think of how differently we treat valued but malfunctioning things we recognize don\u2019t have free will. We examine them, diagnose the problem(s), fix the problem(s), and locate responsibility for the problem not with the thing manifesting the problem but with that which or those who ultimately created the problem. If our computer system is buggy, we realize the system itself is only the apparent, manifesting cause. We understand and act realizing the ultimate, responsible cause isn\u2019t the system itself but that which has caused the system to be what is is at the moment of malfunction: the operating environment, the system operator, the programmer, the system designer, the system manufacturer, the parts supplier, etc. That\u2019s who we hold hold ultimately responsible. Our response toward the valued system is remedial, not punitive. We don\u2019t move the system to a dark closet for a set time and then \u201crelease it\u201d to see if it\u2019s somehow managed to self-learn how to \u201cstop malfunctioning.\u201d We recognize the system is what it is. It\u2019s doing EXACTLY what it\u2019s set up to do under those precise, dysfunctional conditions. So we diagnose it to see if it\u2019s a hardware or software problem, we get into the details of the problem, we divise a solution, we implement the solution, and we test to confirm the fix. If society would ever come to realize that \u201cfree will\u201d is a fallacious, psychological illusion and embrace the reality that we, like everything else, are fully caused, then we would recognize its profound dysfunctionality. We would recognize our mutual sameness, our ultimate oneness with each other: that others \u2014 the virtuous AND the vile, the accomplished AND the wastrels, the brilliant and creative AND the dull and unimaginative \u2014 are ALL thinking and doing EXACTLY as we would at every moment under their identical circumstances of nature and nurture. And they us, under ours. Our self-disgust and embarrassment and our empathetic horror at all of the well intended but wrong-headed, victim-blaming abuse we\u2019ve perpetrated on ourselves for millennia would lead to widespread reforms both profound and deeply humanizing. We would completely reform how we raise and educate our children, how we handle poverty, how we treat our fellow men and women, how we evaluate merit, how we compensate, and how we administer our system of justice.

            "answer_text": "I see it this way: If humans lack free will, they will act however they are compelled to act.If humans have free will, and they act as if they have free will, they have an opportunity to make conscious (and hopefully intelligent) decisions based on some moral code that is designed to promote the betterment of mankind (as in John Locke\u2019s Social Contract).If humans have free will, and they do not act as if they have free will, their actions will be irresponsible (ironically because they actually will have total responsibility for their actions), and there is no telling what sort of society (if any) will result (the Hobbesian view).Based on the available alternatives, it seems to me that it does not matter if humans lack free will, but it may matter if human do have free will. Of course, there is no guarantee that humans will exercise their free will in a way that benefits mankind, and there similarly is no guarantee that humans failing to exercise their free will harm mankind. For example, humans attempting to exercise their free will in a manner that they perceive to be beneficial to mankind may well be mistaken in their analysis (for innumerable possible reasons), and actually do more harm than good. And, humans who could care less about exercising their free will could end upon driving the evolution of a superior variation of the species that is naturally suited to thrive in that environment if they did not cause the extinction of the species (Darwin).

            "answer_text": "We don't, so it doesn't. On the other hand, the fact that most humans believe we do is the cause of the greatest suffering on Earth. First, let us review why we do not have free will. We are a compilation of (among other things) our past experiences. We do not see objectively, but only subjectively from the view of our peers and internal ideas formed from our unique memory. We choose based on observation of other flawed observers, ad naseum through history.We are not omniscient, so we cannot truly decide what is best for us, but only similacra of what we think might be best for us, but never is because there is always a better way.We are not omnipotent, therefore we cannot actually manifest the things we want or envision to test if we really want them. Instead we work our whole lives just to survive, and die.Our bodies are mortal, so we rapidly die before gaining any meaningful self-awareness, wisdom or idea of what we ought to be doing with our lives, and mostly end up following orders as a child at home, at school, work, courtrooms, chapels and before we can learn to unlearn all that and think for ourselves, we die.Even if we magically gained free will, our conscious and sub-conscious minds are constantly assaulted with orders as described above, and ads constantly thrown at us for our entire lives, making us far more likely to eat fast food rather than grow a garden, buy new furniture rather than learn to build and repair our own, watch others do things rather than do it ourselves, and generally waste our limited time and energy (aka money) making other people richer instead of enriching our own lives. [Your will is free for companies to buy haha.]Now that we know why humans cannot have free will, you can know how the following areas of suffering have risen. War is based upon orders, and following them even to the point of death. Surely no one would use their free will just to die trying to take another's life, but so it happens every day.Prison exists because people still think punishment causes people to logically reconsider their options, rather than be raped and abused in a confined space trapped with peers who also comit crimes. Even if you were sane, you may not be any more and will certainly not be able to get a good job or pay if debts quickly one you get out, so return is extremely likely. But the entire premise relies on people choosing to steal or use a chemical rather than be forced into it by economic conditions and hightened stress. The United States may have 5% of the world population, but it has 25% of the world's prisoners. Odd, being the land of the free. At least companies get to pay prisoners 12 cents per hour for mandatory hard labor.We let kids choose what to be, which sounds great until they get to college and end up going hundreds of thousands into debt obtaining a degree that nobody would ever pay them for, so almost anything except engineering or accounting basically. Thus we have millions of unemployed, unmarried millenials with tens of thousands in debt, soon to be more with decades of interest that may be passed onto their children if they can ever afford to have any. (But what about paying students to research their field? That's what free grad students are for, silly.)We let parents raise children, which sounds normal until you have kids of your own. Then you quickly realise that nothing could ever prepare you for this and holy crap please don't let all my negative qualities appear in them or worse HELP!!We think we can eat whatever we want. We can't. Most people take decades to figure this out and by then it is too late. Everyone's genetic situation is unique so some people can eat donuts forever and live to 100 while others can't, that's life and has nothing to do with free will, but many still think it does.We think we can do whatever we want to the environment because we\u2019ll be dead before having to deal with it. While entirely untrue due to air and water pollution, we also are already causing a mass extinction event to the tune of 1 extinction every hour, which is 365 times the rate of precious extinction eras. If we had free will then surely we would not destroy ourselves, right?We destroy ourselves, in many ways. Nuclear bombs, genocide, and even self-depricating mentalities all destroy us collectively and personally. But perhaps this is proof that we can choose, after all. Maybe there's a lesson to learn here.If I had to make an educated guess I would say that consciousness is a journey, and people are struggling because we assume will is free, and not earned and improved eternally. What do you think? ",

One could say that the question of free will is merely the modern version of the inquiry, \u201chow many angels can dance on the head of the pin.\u201d The idea that humans do or do not have free will will not greatly impact the way the world works. However, it will change the way humans conceptualize the world. If there is conclusive evidence of free will, people who make poor decisions that lead to there demise will be shamed publicly, but if there is conclusive evidence that there is no free will, there is a greater likelihood of compassion demonstrated to those who have made poor decisions. The truth about free will will likely impact the criminal justice system and views on welfare and poverty in many countries. However, the fact that the universe is deterministic would likely help science research immensely, as it would be possible to see the unified model of the universe. This will immensely help technological advancement. ",

We still live in a world where sequential actions have consequences and where we have an internal feeling of at least limited free will. Free will is a very broad concept and all definitions of it may or may not be falsifiable. Either way, we must live with the outcomes of our actions and to try and disconnect those from ourselves by appealing to some lack of agency\u2026 Well, we see what happens when people act as if they were not accountable for their actions and we see how people react to behaviour like that. There seems to be general agreement that we must live as we had choice and people will generally not accept release from responsibility through appeals to a dearth of concrete evidence for the existence of free will. These observations hold true regardless of whether free will is present or not, since they occur in our reality. ",

With the realisation of \u201cno self\u201d (or whatever you want to call it) there is the recognition that there is nobody to have free will. This is insight. No self, no free will. The question ceases to be valid. On a practical level, as we recognise that we cannot witness where thoughts come from and that we therefore cannot know what causes them we can use this as a basis for letting go of anger towards ourself and others. The basis for guilt, hatred, bitterness, self loathing etc is gone. This is a very simple yet profound practice of wisdom and compassion. I hope this helps to overcome negative emotions towards self and others (well the appearance of self & others!) ",
