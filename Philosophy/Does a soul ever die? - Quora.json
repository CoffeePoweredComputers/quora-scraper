            "answer_text": "There is no reliable proof that souls do exist, but if they did exist, it might be possible that they die. How long would a soul last? Ten thousand years? A hundred thousand years? By necessity, in our folklore souls are eternal. Before we die, we are afraid to die, and then after we die, we'd be afraid of the death of our souls - assuming a free-floating soul can feel fear. Assuming souls exist and they end up in some kind of paradise where the soul gets its delight, it might in fact be a mercy that a soul would die after all.  Imagine the best thing you could do. Maybe it's eating chocolate ice cream and never getting full on a beach with all your friends. Maybe it is listening to Beethoven while flying over the seas of a billion alien worlds. Maybe it is dancing in a circle around your favorite deity. Try that for a million years. A billion. A billion billion billion. That's a really long time. Let's say you can try something new every billion years, and you do that a billion times. That is only scratching the surface of eternity. Eventually, this wonderful entertainment must run a little dry. As much as I might love Beethoven, disembodied flying, and chocolate ice cream, after a while, I'd get bored. What seems like a heaven would really turn out to be a hell if I could not escape it. I think oblivion might be a kind escape. If there are souls, I'd certainly wish for the ability for my soul to die. I think eternity is far too long for me to be me. I get tired of hearing myself talk sometimes, and I'm only 43. Imagine how I'd feel at 1,000,000,000,043? It's terrible. If there are souls, and if they don't die, I believe that they should die. Undying souls would be awful. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but a 'sleeping' soul is just as good as dead to the world.  The Panchatantra and all fables that came before (e.g. cave paintings) and after it and which were influenced by it, used parables with the animal kingdom. You will find that the symbol of some thing is, by the same token, the soul of it.   The soul is like an elephant in the room and yet we cannot isolate it, though we've tried drowning and burning and, well, killing it (save a better term).  The wind may recede but does it die?  Death is all around, yet you can find clues of Life's stubbornness.  Speaking of elephants:  It takes about two years for a baby elephant to be conceived (gestation period).It then only sleeps for 2 or 3 hours a night. Its being is grounded and awake; it has high cognition and intelligence.It has heightened senses and a great memory.  It is often associated with burden due to its size. (See references to the expression White Elephant).  The body is a burden. And yet, as a symbol the elephant is undying (just to illustrate a few...): The Buddha is said to have been reincarnated from an elephant and rode away on a White Elephant. Prophet Muhammad was born in the Year of the Elephant.Lord Indra (weather god) rides on Airavata (Erewan in Thai) a flying white elephant.  In the Mahabharat, Airavata is listed as a great serpent.  (Too long too get into the significance of serpents here\u2014and yes they too are an endangered species).  He is also symbolised by thunderstorms and rainbows. In Sumatra, elephants too have been associated with lightning.  Ganesha, son of Shiva, is depicted (not unlike Egyptian gods) with an animal head.   \"Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.\"  \"Elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the Gothic churches [even if they'd never set eyes on one].\" For the ecosystem, elephants are considered a keystone species.  \"Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals.  [...] Elephants are [among other things] important seed-dispersers.\" - Wikipedia  Out of Africa:   Many African cultures revere the African Elephant as a symbol of strength and power.[40][41] It is also praised for its size, longevity, stamina, mental faculties, cooperative spirit, and loyalty.[42] South Africa, uses elephant tusks in their coat of arms to represent wisdom, strength, moderation and [get this] eternity.[43]  The Mbuti believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants [...] Other African tribes (who) believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants.   More here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_elephants Today Dumbo and Mumfie still get \"AirPlay\".  So, 'does the soul die', you ask.  You tell me! ",

He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.Purport: Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or k\u016b\u1e6da-stha. The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth from the womb of the mother\u2019s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval \u2013 that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul\u2019s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.18) we also \ufb01nd a similar passage, which reads: na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcinn\u0101ya\u1e41 kuta\u015bcin na babh\u016bva ka\u015bcitajo nitya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvato \u2019ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47ona hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but here in this verse there is one special word, vipa\u015bcit, which means learned or with knowledge. The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not \ufb01nd the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not \ufb01nd the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies \u2013 whether man or animal \u2013 we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge \u2013 past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not like the forgetful soul. If so, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 would be useless. There are two kinds of souls \u2013 namely the minute particle soul (a\u1e47u-\u0101tm\u0101) and the Supersoul (vibhu-\u0101tm\u0101). This is also con\ufb01rmed in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.20) in this way: a\u1e47or a\u1e47\u012by\u0101n mahato mah\u012by\u0101n\u0101tm\u0101sya jantor nihito guh\u0101y\u0101mtam akratu\u1e25 pa\u015byati v\u012bta-\u015bokodh\u0101tu\u1e25 pras\u0101d\u0101n mahim\u0101nam \u0101tmana\u1e25 \u201cBoth the Supersoul [Param\u0101tm\u0101] and the atomic soul [\u2009j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101] are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or by His bona \ufb01de representative (the spiritual master).

            "answer_text": " God is Consciousness- the mind, Goddess is the body, Soul is concentration- Dhyan. The Body is made of elements that are changing, inimical to each other with time and place, they are unsteady and destructive. Therefore, one dies due to old age, disease, natural calamity and violence. Therefore, death is dress of life. The Soul under the control of mind casts off worn-out bodies and enters others that are new The Soul is free from the elements, it produces no dirt like our body do. It is neither feminine nor masculine, being free from the destructive elements, the soul is eternal and immortal. None can cause the destruction of Soul, the Imperishable. Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not. This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, ancient and immovable. (Bhagvad Gita Ch 2) The Knower of Truth calls Soul as a \u2018Hansa\u2019 because of its nature Chal Hansa Satlok Hamare, Chhodo Yeh Sansara Ho. Yahi Sansar Kaal Hai Raja, Karm Ka Jal Pasasr Ho.Sant Kabir asks every Soul to return to their real home Immortal 4th world-Satlok, Give up this worldly ocean of misery, Almighty God is the ruler of these three worlds of mortals, and he entangles you in Karma. God puts the Soul in everything in this bio-diverse world; trees, animals, human, demon and divine beings for his own pleasure. Being in the body we are not allowed to be ourselves- Soul. God as mind imprisoned our Soul in the body and impose the illusion of duality, fear of birth and death. Mann He Niranjan Sabey Nachaey, Naam Hoey Toh Maath Nawaey.Sahib Ji says that Almighty Kal Niranjan (Mind) is driving the whole universe and makes everyone dance to his tunes (commands). But, the king (mind) actually bows down in front of that being who has the true \u2018Satya Naam\u2019 of Satguru. As long one takes this body as self, and the world as real, he faces birth and death. But once he surrenders to a Satguru- Knower of Truth, ( Bhagvad Gita 4.34) Soul is free from God\u2019s domain- mortal world. ",

            "answer_text": "As Nisargatta Maharaj commented, \"The real does not die. The unreal never lived.\" Since \"soul\" is an idea which, as all ideas, refers only to itself and not to anything real, and since \"death\" is also an idea, which similarly refers only to itself and not to anything real, there is no real answer to this question. According to how you want to define these words, the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\". Since all definitions are arbitrary, so any answer is also arbitrary. In short, don't worry about it. My motto is, \"Live now. Die later.\" It seems that nature takes care of death automatically, so I do not need to worry about that. Living, really living fully, now seems more complex. So that is my focus. Living this moment fully. If you can do anything to help yourself or someone else, now, just do it. If not, don't. Leave the rest to philosophers, who do that for a profession. Maybe the only people who really understand so-called spiritual work are Nike. Keep well,Jonathan ",

            "answer_text": "Self means awareness. Self-awareness means awareness of thoughtless awareness, which is experienced in meditation where you dissolve all thoughts and be aware of your pure awareness. Awareness is specific work form of inert energy (that is generated by digestion of food) in a specific functioning nervous system. It is generated when you awake from deep sleep. It disappears when you enter deep sleep. Hence, in deep sleep, you do not have self-awareness. A thought is made of awareness like a jewel is made of gold. A bundle of thoughts can be also called as awareness as we call a lump of jewels as gold. Hence, there is no difference between pure awareness in meditation and bundle of thoughts in the awaken state. This pure awareness in its essential causal material called as inert energy, is called as soul (atman) and the bundle of thoughts is called as individual soul (jiva). The soul is said to be all-pervading and eternal. If you take pure awareness in the sense of bundle of thoughts (individual soul) as soul, this statement is not possible. Such pure awareness is limited to the body and is also not all-pervading. It is also born and disappears every day. Hence, you must treat pure awareness (gold) as bundle of thoughts (lump of gold jewels) and use the word jiva for both. The word \u2018soul\u2019 should be used for the basic inert energy that is transformed into awareness and also entered the awareness as basis. This basic inert energy is all pervading as cosmic energy. It cannot be limited by body since body (matter) is also a form of inert energy. Hence, the all-pervading nature, eternality, etc., are suitable to inert energy or soul. Both soul and individual soul (pure awareness or bundle of thoughts) are imaginable items of the imaginable creation. Hence, a soul or individual soul is not the unimaginable God, who is beyond even imagination, not to speak of experience. Whether you link the \u2018I\u2019 (yourself) to the soul or individual soul or body, all these three items are parts of creation only and not the Creator, who is beyond creation and even your imagination. Of course, such unimaginable God is mediated by a human form like Rama, Krishna, etc., and comes down to the Earth. The external medium of the unimaginable God, which is body, soul and individual soul together, is experienced and even seen with your eyes. There is no other way than this to experience the unimaginable God indirectly through the medium. This unimaginable God exhibits unimaginable events called as miracles through human incarnations and by these miracles, you can experience the existence of unimaginable God. Except existence, nothing else of the unimaginable God can be experienced or even imagined. The experience of the absolute God (unimaginable) is only the experience of existence of unimaginable God through inference with the help of the unimaginable miracles (asteetyeva\u2026 Veda). Practical Proof Experience Contradict False Monism Self means awareness, which is generated and dissolves every day and this is proved by science very effectively. Science is authority in the analysis of creation, though it cannot touch the unimaginable Creator. Self or awareness is awareness only and if you go deeper into the self to find out its background, the inert energy only appears, which alone is transformed into awareness in nervous system. It is just work-form, which is transport of information to brain by neurons. Hence, by digging self, you cannot touch the unimaginable God. If you go deeper and deeper depths of imaginable items of creation, you will get only imaginable items of creation, which are more and more subtle. A subtle item is invisible but imaginable. Unimaginable God is beyond subtle items, being not only invisible but also unimaginable. Hence, even if you concentrate for thousand years on yourself, you will end only in the imaginable domain (creation) and never can touch the unimaginable domain even by imagination! You can perceive and receive the unimaginable God only when He is mediated by the imaginable part of the creation. Arjuna is a bundle of soul, individual soul and body along with inert energy and belongs totally to the imaginable domain. Krishna is also imaginable domain just like Arjuna, but, Krishna is charged by the unimaginable God to become human incarnation. The difference between Arjuna and Krishna is only the unimaginable God. What is the difference between consciousness and awareness? You are aware of your duty. You are conscious of your duty. Both mean the same. The consciousness or the awareness is bound by the law of nature. If food is not taken by somebody for a long time, there is no generation of inert energy, which alone transforms into awareness or consciousness and the person dies without the re-appearance of awareness or consciousness. Such consciousness is in every human being. Even if you concentrate on consciousness for thousand years, what can you attain? What you attained already before thousand years is attained after thousand years! You have the same awareness after thousand years. Even if you concentrate for thousand years on consciousness, you cannot lift even a big stone, not to speak of a big hill as lifted by Krishna. All this is against experience and logic, which cannot be accepted since experience is the final authority. Awareness exists. A non-aware (inert) stone also exists. If awareness can\u2019t be separated from existence, every item of this creation must have awareness. A stone is not having awareness. Does it mean that the stone is non-existent since awareness alone is existence? Narayana (Vishnu) is the energetic form in which unimaginable God exists. Krishna is the human form in which Narayana (along with unimaginable God) exists. Nara is the human form, which is without Narayana (unimaginable God with energetic form). Narayana is the gold wire (energetic form) in which the electricity (unimaginable God) exists. Krishna is the copper wire (human form) in which the electrified gold wire (Narayana) exists. This means that both Narayana and Krishna are electrified. \u2018Nara\u2019 or Arjuna is the copper wire (human form) without electrified gold wire (Narayana) or without electricity directly (unimaginable God). The practical proof for a layman is that Narayana lifted Mandara hill (during churning of sea) and Krishna lifted Govardhana hill. Arjuna or yourself or Myself (with reference to human being component since My devotees feel that I am the human incarnation of Lord Datta. For others, who don\u2019t believe this, I am just human being only.) cannot lift even a big stone even after concentrating on consciousness throughout our life period! Practical proof and experience contradict this false monism (misinterpreted Advaita of Shankara). When Shankara told that He is God, disciples also told the same. Shankara swallowed molten lead and disciples unable to do it, fell on the feet of Shankara. Then Shankara told that He alone is God (Shivah kevaloham). If you say that realization of self makes one to become God, I have not become God even though I realized that I am the consciousness. Concentration of consciousness for thousand years reveals that it is just consciousness. If the consciousness is something other than consciousness, I may realize that consciousness is something else after concentration for thousand years. I am seeing a stone. After concentrating on the stone for thousand years, I realize only that the stone is a stone! All this is psychic illness or mental disorder, which is against the logic and experience. Shankara told that He is God because God is in Him. Realizing the original and inner nature of the self as the unimaginable God is possible only in the case of human incarnation like Krishna, Shankara, etc. The electric wire realizes that it is electricity, which is existing in it as experienced from the electric shocks given by the electric wire. A non-electrified wire doing penance even for million years cannot be the electrified wire since electricity did not enter it and such wire gives no shock even after million years, even if the wire concentrates on itself. After million years of concentration also, a non-electrified wire can only realize that it is mere wire without giving any shock! Self is God provided that self is Krishna. This means only that the unimaginable God appears as a specific self (self means soul along with body since atman has both meanings in Sanskrit). This does not mean that every self is God. If you say that this wire is electrified, it does not mean that every wire is electrified. Self means a specific soul or human being. ",

            "answer_text": " Both body and soul are anatomically our muscular system. Therefore, both perish at death. Then why do we believe that at death only the body perishes and soul is eternal and has no death at all? Scriptures are written allegorically and we take their literal meanings and ignore their intended meanings. Body is based on isotonic contraction. This shortens the muscle and brings about movement. Movement gets abolished at rest. Soul is based on isometric contraction. Isometric contraction is the one that produces muscle tone. It is eternal and continues both at rest and during activity. In scriptures \u2018man\u2019 symbolizes an idea. Body symbolizes movement and soul symbolizes its power supply. Body (Movement) perishes (stops) at death (rest). However, the power supply pattern associated with the movement will continue even at rest and may be utilized for the modified action (Reincarnation). Thus, reincarnation is about ideas and occurs during the life of an individual. It has nothing to do with the persons death. Thus, it is people who ignore the intended meanings of scriptures and take just their literal meanings who suppose that the soul is eternal. The soul actually perished along with the body at the death of the person. ",

So to me, there are a lot of people going around saying they are immortal, or some part of them is immortal. What I see is that when one of these people die they stop telling the soul story, and only some live people continue to tell the immortal soul story.  I've never seen a soul or identified one in me. No ghosts either. The question is kind of like asking if a ghost ever dies except that the ghost story requires someone to die first before you get a ghost. I don't buy those stories either. So I guess the stories never die, but the people who tell the stories do. ",

Notice that this is a small number of ideas about what the soul is or what we mean when we use the word. In common use, the word \"soul\" is usually meant to indicate something that continues to exist after a person's bodily death and usually is taken to be immortal, or, rather, eternal. If we take the soul to be eternal then no change can occur to it and never has. No death, then. We could say that the soul can die if it is somehow an emergent property of the body, but at that point it might be that we're talking about something else entirely. ",

Most of us live on the physical plane and our ideas remain grounded in the tangible objects. But we are hardly aware of our limited perception. When some one says, 'soul' is a idea' we instantly dismiss it as \"just\" an idea, implying, not real. We cannot see a cascading world of matter where the gross is a manifestation/ creation of the subtle. Consequently, the subtle foretells the gross' lifespan, and outlives it. Thus what looks like an idea (a non-entity) in our world, is really a very potent phenomenon in the subtle. Stationed in the physical it is not possible to get a 'reliable' proof, as one will lack the required tools.     So, soul outlives our spiritual self, that outlives emotional self that outlives  physical self that we know. And its logical corollary is that soul, the life (wrongly perceived as a differentiated \"many\") is an undifferentiated,  infinite phenomenon so subtle that it is present in and out of everything and human conditioned mind takes that \"in\" presence as an \"individual\" soul.
