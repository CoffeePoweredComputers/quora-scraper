I'd love to know how they managed to do that, since chromium was otherwise unknown to the world 2,200 years ago.  http://www.chinatourguide.com/xian/terracotta_warriors_details.html  By comparing and contrasting the anecdotes and phrases in the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), biblical scholars believe there was a fifth gospel, known as Q, the Quelle, the logia, or the sayings gospel. But we've never found a copy.  http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/q.html  Most Middle Eastern and European martial arts have been lost. Some of the more recent ones can be partially recreated from fighting manuals and comments made by observers, but the oldest ones, including the ancient Greek martial arts of pankration and panmachon, have been completely lost. Modern pankration was invented in the 1970's and keeps little more than the name. But most of all, across the 100,000 years or so that anatomically modern human beings have been around, we've only have writing for 5,500 of those. For the first few thousand years, writing was highly restricted. It was only within the last thousand years ago that mass production of paper and printing arose. And it's only been within the last hundred years that literacy became widespread worldwide. That means we've lost the languages, names, thoughts, tastes, loves, victories and defeats, hopes and dreams, and personality of billions of human beings, slaves, natives, illiterates, peasants, foragers, barbarians, and residents of ancient cities and empire who weren't lucky enough to have their biographies or philosophy preserved for posterity.

            "answer_text": "Since the 700's A.D., the great library at Baghdad was a treasure-trove of knowledge and culture that rivaled (perhaps even surpassed) that of Alexandria. This makes sense, as the region was situated on a nexus of great historical civilizations: China to the East, the Western World, and the Indian Sub-Continent to the South-East. As such, it was the logical repository of learning aggregated from all of these civilizations, and it stood until the 13th Century. It housed countless precious documents on various sciences, such as medicine, physics, astronomy, and also guarded many literary treasures from a range of cultures, perhaps unrivaled in its day. And, as my own (albeit, too-limited) reading has indicated, it's not like the Abbisad Caliphate was greedy and clandestine about sharing this knowledge with others. Alas, 1258 saw the siege and sack of Baghdad at the hands of the Mongol horde under Hulagu Khan. While there can be strong arguments made for some great things the Mongols did for their subjects (for example, they were largely religiously tolerant), they were cruelly efficient in the capture of cities during their conquests. To cut the long story of the siege short, the Mongols laid waste to the city and, not knowing the value of what they had in the libraries, essentially destroyed precious manuscripts and books. In fact, more than one chronicler remarked that the Tigris ran black with ink for days after. (Not to mention running red with the blood from the slaughter of what is thought to be up to 100,000 civilian inhabitants.) This event is widely accepted as the end of the so-called Islamic Golden Age. Sadly, we will never know what was lost as a result of this event. ",
