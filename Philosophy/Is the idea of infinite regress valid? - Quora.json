            "answer_text": "The problem with infinite regress is that when people ask for justification for accepting something as true, they are asking for an answer which terminates in some compelling fashion. But answers which result in an infinite regress by definition never terminate, and as such aren't found to be rationally compelling.  With respect to the design argument, it's not clear that everything needs a \"creator\" to exist. Even people who believe in God don't accept that universally, since God is claimed to be eternal, uncreated. It could be that the universe is infinitely old, so it never \"began\" and so the question is moot. Or it could be that because there was no time before the universe, the universe couldn't \"begin\". After all, if time is an intrinsic property of the universe, there was no time \"before\" the universe, because \"before\" requires time to exist in order to make sense! ",
