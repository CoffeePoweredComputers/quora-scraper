            "answer_text": "It seems like I\u2019ve answered this many times. A theist is a person. To be anti-person makes no sense if one is a person. To be so is crazy and I would be very worried about such a person. However, faith is belief without evidence. It is an epistemology which makes assertions about the real world. For examples; God made the universe, homosexuality is a sin punishable by death, morality is solely the province of religion, faith deserves a respect not shown to other ideas even in a society based on enlightenment value, apostates should be killed, etc. Faith is an invalid epistemology. Faith is an idea. It is possible, even desirable, to be against bad ideas. Conclusion; being anti-theist as an atheist is possible but wrongheaded. Being anti-faith as an atheist, and actually for anyone, is a very good thing. Question - Can an atheist be an anti-theist at the same time? ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. I am one. An atheist does not believe the fairy tales most of us were told from an early age. They reject those claims as utter nonsense and of no worth whatsoever. Now an Anti-theist is one who recognizes the evil done in the name of the (presently) dominant religions and wants that to stop. Of course the problem is that this evil lies at the very core of those religions - there is no fix, only utter destruction will end that evil. The main problem is that the followers of these religions actually like the evil at the core of their beliefs, and will resist most heartily it\u2019s destruction. Therefore the only real path of the anti-theist is to promote real beliefs and oppose fake beliefs - to convert as many religious people as possible to atheists and instill in them a love and respect for real knowledge, honestly acquired.

I would say that antitheism is a subset of atheism, but it is technically possible to be a theist and an antitheist, though I would not want to meet the poor tortured person who occupies such a self-hating position. For all intents and purposes, you can consider antitheism to be a type of atheism. ",

An atheist is simply someone who lacks a belief in god. An \u2018anti-theist\u2019 would be a Gnostic Atheist. That is, someone who specifically claims there are no gods, rather than just lacking a belief in any gods.  I suppose an anti-theist could be someone who simply believes there are no gods, which is \u2018strong atheism\u2019. But that\u2019s still a form of atheism. To be an anti-theist, one must be atheist. ",
