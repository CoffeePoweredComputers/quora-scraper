            "answer_text": "My favorite criticism, which takes a good deal of unpacking, is that social contract theory by and large assumes (or locates in the state of nature or pre-political condition) what it wants to prove. I.e., once the theorist has set up the state of nature, the social contract of the theorist follows almost inexorably (along with many implications bound up in the theorist\u2019s social contract). Someone like Marx might add that (most) social contract theory is a good political theory for the rising bourgeoisie: it generates a social contract government and society built on individual rights, a state whose role is to keep order, protect rights including property rights, and assure individuals extensive free range of choices in especially economic activity. That law-based, rights-based society makes community difficult and communal action very difficult. (Rousseau would be an exception to this paragraph, but Rawls would not be, nor would Nozick.) (Hobbes and Locke, each in his own way, would say to Jay Stephan Steinmetz that he just was not looking. It is true that he has never signed a social contract, but he has consented to be ruled by the government under which he lives [unless, in Locke\u2019s theory, he goes into exile]. Locke\u2019s theory works by \u2018tacit consent\u2019: if you live in a country and follow its laws and participate in its system of rights and property, you have, Locke thinks, tacitly consented to be a citizen of that country. Hobbes\u2019s theory works by having what many would call a trivial view of consent, one that is very similar to Locke\u2019s: as long as you obey the laws of the government (sovereign), you are showing that you consent to be governed by that government.) (I have not read Rousseau recently, but I suspect that Rousseau does not accept \u2018tacit consent\u2019 to his social contract society, because he requires active human beings if his ideas are to work. Hobbes and Locke are just as happy to have apolitical subjects.) ",

            "answer_text": "I have never seen nor have I ever signed a \u201csocial contract\u201d of any kind. A contract isn\u2019t a contract unless the parties to it have seen it and agreed to it. Therefore, Rousseau\u2019s \u201csocial contract theory\u201d is just a lot of wind. There either isn\u2019t a social contract at all, or if there is one, nobody\u2019s seen it, agreed to it, or signed it. ",
