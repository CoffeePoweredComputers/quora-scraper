            "answer_text": "A decision becomes impossible when two or more options present to you are equally good or equally bad for you. For example, you love aloo paratha, cheese burst pizza and american chopsuey. All three are presented to you but you can select only one. But you want both. OR In case you're married, you'd want to keep your parents happy as well as your wife happy. Both might want alone time with you, whom to give how much time and when, becomes an impossible decisions. For example, if your mother and your wife have birthdays on the same day! Whose birthday do you celebrate first? The one who has been with you every step of the way till now, or the one who will be with you every step of the way from now on? OR Getting a job in another city and staying away from your family or staying with your family and moonlighting to maintain a certain standard of living? This one is relatively easy: choose family. Conclusion: When all options are equally good or bad, the decision to choose a single one becomes impossible. :) ",
