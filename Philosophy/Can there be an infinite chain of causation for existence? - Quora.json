            "answer_text": "Question originally answered : Can there be an infinite chain of causation for existence? Usually people come to the conclusion that there must have been an uncaused cause. However, an uncaused cause seems as viable as an infinite chain of causation in my eyes, since both scenarios are antithetical to logic.What makes an uncaused cause anymore logical than an infinite chain of causation?  As pointed out by John Catiller in his answer, you are correct. Logically there is no reason to prefer one possibility over the other. You perhaps also might consider a circular chain of causation, either finite or infinite, which is also generally rejected. The reasons for rejecting these possibilities are always justified by appealing to other claimed properties of other phenomena. For example, infinite chains might be rejected based on the claimed property of time that an infinite past is impossible. This would be argued for by claiming the impossibility of ever reaching the present from the past, because that would take infinitely long if the past was infinite. Therefore, they argue, the past must be finite because the present clearly exists. However, logically, nothing precludes all times, present, past and possibly the future too, from having real existence. In fact, such a view is entirely consistent with observed reality, the box view of time. Excluding such a class of models is nothing but an axiomatic assumption. An unjustified claim on the nature of time, which possibly might actually turn out to be some emergent phenomenon rather than a fundamental part of reality.  The same kind of reasoning is applied to circular chains of causation. It is reasoned that allowing for circular chains essentially means that events cause themselves either directly or indirectly. This it is argued is evidently impossible. Events cannot cause themselves. But again, this amounts to assumptions on the nature of causality. It amounts to an a-priori exclusion of an entire class of models of causal structures axiomatically. On no other grounds than that such structures are not intuitive. Because the claim that they are impossible logically, is simply false. There are consistent mathematical models of such structures, therefore they logically possible. Who says reality must be intuitive?  Whenever any argument appeals to the properties of other phenomena to justify some line of reasoning in the current argument, one would do well to actually question these implicit assumptions. Very often one will find that the claims are not self-evident at all, but merely appeal to the listener\u2019s intuition or common sense as it often called. But common sense is not knowledge and common sense is often wrong. Common sense is nothing more than a socially accepted set of base assumptions and reasoning methods within a certain community, at a certain point in time. It is most definitely is not a certified and guaranteed path to truth. Common sense told us that our world was flat, that the sun revolved around us, that objects have a unique position and momentum at every point in time, etc. etc. Common sense was wrong. Common sense is an appeal to intuition, notoriously unreliable as a source of knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "Your logic is spot on. There is no reason why our universe couldn't be just one of an infinite series of universes. Though out most current theories seem to eliminate the Big Crunch, the universe collapsing into itself to explode again. But there may be another type of cycle going on. Imagine if the universe spread out to the point of heat death were matter has decayed to energy and the finite energy of the universe so finely difused throughout that you effectively have a really large space full of nothing, which to me leaves room for the next Big Bang doesn't it? Just throwing that out there. Or our universe could be a self contained \u201c black hole\u201d within another universe. There is no apparent reason why our universe can't be one of an infinite number of universes to spring into being through eternity. The only thing holding us back is that we cannot, by definition, know what, if anything, came before, is outside, or will come after our universe. A universe is self contained. Anything \u201coutside\u201d if there is an outside, is beyond our reach. We do know our known universe is finite and had a definite beginning. Which only leads to even bigger questions. You guess is just as reasonable and probable as any other right now. ",
