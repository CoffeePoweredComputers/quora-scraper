            "answer_text": "\u201cbrains create consciousness\u201d? Look inside a living brain during an operation: what do you find? Some apparently gelatinous material, that \u2018feels\u2019 squishy? Can you see the consciousness you are looking for? If you cannot observe it, how can you apply scientific processes to discovering its nature, or its cause? Of course, there are many scientifically described processes that cannot be observed directly. But in all cases, these relate to a chain of events that are understood in behavioural terms. We speak of the \u2018behaviour\u2019 of quantum fields, etc. This behaviour is described mathematically and observed (say) as traces (behaviour) in a cloud chamber. Even \u2018emergent properties\u2019 in science are described in behavioural terms, for example phase transitions. Behaviour giving rise to behaviour is hardly surprising. Behaviour giving rise to consciousness is another matter altogether. Consciousness is required to observe behaviour. In opening up a functioning brain, can you find any colours? Or odours? Or feelings? Or flavours? Or Sounds? Or Ideas (number, form and meaning)? These qualia are the \u2018objects of conscious experience\u2019. If you cannot observe the \u2018objects of conscious experience\u2019 inside a living brain, how can you apply scientific processes to discovering their cause? How could you separate qualia from consciousness? Can a feeling can exist that is not felt? A colour that is not seen? A sound that is not heard? A flavour that is not tasted? An odour that is not smelled? Or, any idea that is not known? Of course, it is possible to imagine (say) a colour existing \u2018out there\u2019 with no one seeing it. But that is because it is imagined in \u2018consciousness\u2019. Though what about a \u2018feeling\u2019 hanging in space? Or an \u2018idea\u2019 just \u2018floating around\u2019? it is not even possible to imagine these existing independent of the capacity to feel or know. Imagine there is no consciousness at all, anywhere or anywhen\u2026 what of qualia then? No qualia, nor the awareness in which they appear, can be observed inside a living brain. All that can be observed are the qualia (perceived from the perspective of the surgeon) that appear to be the living brain of the patient. The qualia (apparent from the perspective of the surgeon) are not the \u2018physical\u2019 brain of the patient, let alone the qualia/awareness (consciousness) that is the object of study - that are believed to arise in the physical brain of the patient. Under the material model, the qualia manifesting the appearance of the patient\u2019s brain are assumed to arise solely in the surgeon\u2019s brain as a result of physical processes in that brain that somehow precisely mimic the appearance of the physical reality assumed to exist outside the surgeon\u2019s brain, assumed to be caused by a long chain of assumed events. Yet, nowhere along this assumed chain of causation is there any information. It is all \u2019cause and effect\u2019. Brains, like computers, comprise a set of initial conditions that are modified as a result of incoming energy flows leading to outgoing energy flows that manifest new behaviours. That is all. Only the conscious observer can infer information. Only consciousness knows ideas. Only consciousness can name objects and relations and understand meaning. Information cannot exist in the absence of meaning, and meaning cannot exist without consciousness. Where in the physical world is a single \u2018idea\u2019? If no idea exists \u2018out there\u2019, it is impossible to learn ideas from experience. Knowing ideas is inherent in consciousness, along with sensing sensations. This is not to deny the correlation between reported conscious experience and observed behaviour, including the behaviour of apparent material/energy flows in apparent brains imaged in apparent displays generated by apparent MRI machines\u2026 But correlation is not causation. As an analogy, it is possible to observe the behaviour of characters and objects in a computer game on a computer screen and deduce the rules that govern their behaviour. However, there are no \u2018characters\u2019 inside the computer, only the rules for their manifestation on the screen. In the same way, there is no need for actual objects to exist as the originals for the apparent objects manifested in consciousness. All that is required is the capacity to manifest qualia in accord with a coherent set of rules that govern their form and their behaviour. We call these rules \u2018the laws of nature\u2019 as \u2018discovered\u2019 through scientific inquiry. No observer could ever deduce the nature of the \u2018hardware\u2019 that generates the images on a computer screen from looking at the images alone. Consciousness is faced with the same impossible task: how to see beyond the qualia to the consciousness that manifests the apparent world? Brain research is great for building understanding of the correlations between reported experience and different brain states. It is futile if the quest is to understand consciousness The only \u2018place\u2019 where consciousness can be observed is from the viewpoint of the witness that is at the core of OneSelf. ",

            "answer_text": "No,it doesnt. The brain can massively overwhelm consciousness and channel it in all sorts of directions,but consciousness itself rather than emerging from the brain,actually inhabits the brain. The general opinion os scientists,psychologists and experts in all scientific fields tend to believe that consciousness is a product of the brain.and there is huge amounts of evidence to conclude this. But for me this is like the driver of a motor car. all sorts of things can go right or wrong with a motor car and will restrict,stop or change the drivers experience but the driver has not changed,only the mechanics he is using. However it is all down to,ultimately,whether consciousness can exist separate to or outside the brain. The evidence of those of us who have experienced full non physical consciousness know that we are,ultimately seperate from the body-mind. astral projection,out of body experiences,the clinically dead being rescusctated and reporting on their experiences.Past lives memories with proof.There are many experiences that although often thought to be imagination that happens to very few people is far far more common than we admit. My own sister,who is a practical no nonsense scientist still recalls the profound effect of floating out of her body once 55 years ago. terrified she did re enter her body,and no one and not one thing can ever convince her that this was not a full real life absolutely true experience which nothing else has compared to. Our consciousness being seperate from the body and brain answers many questions of life after death,re incarnation etc.etc. For me,this is not a religious or spiritual mystical belief but instead it is a fact of how the universe functions. But you need to experience or study the very best examples of the above conditions. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Is it true that consciousness that generates ideas and thoughts is an emergent property of the physical brain and therefore compatible with science? So there are really two questions here. Q1 Is it true that consciousness that generates ideas and thoughts is an emergent property of the physical brain? Q2. Is consciousness therefore compatible with science? Taking each in turn\u2026 A1. We don\u2019t really know yet what consciousness is and I suspect that the word itself is an unhelpful way to approach mental phenomena. But from what we can tell mental phenomena are an emergent property of the brain. And we have ruled out all the other explanations. It could still be something we haven\u2019t thought of, but it looks likely to be true. A2. I think Q2 is hinting at a problem raised by ontological dualists, which is that consciousness is an entirely different substance. And therefore if we only examine matter and energy via scientific methods we can never learn anything about consciousness. So first of all, no serious scientist or philosopher believes that ontological dualism can possibly be the case any longer. Everything is matter and energy. There is no other possibility. Secondly the dualist shares some assumptions with many scientists, which is that reductionism (accounts of reality only in terms of substances) is the only viable approach to reality. The very mention of emergent properties kicks reductionism into the long grass. The idea that reality is only found in substances is an assumption. I agree that substances are real but by any meaningful definition of \u201creal\u201d structures and systems are also real. Once we admit that structures and systems are also real (anti-reductionism or emergentism) then it is a relatively easy step to argue that emergent phenomena are real. And thus, yes, they are within the domain of science. And thus consciousness, or better, mental phenomena are also within the domain of science. John Searle is very good on this kind of thing, especially in his book: The Construction of Social Reality. If the subjective was not real then our present money system could not work at all, because modern money is very much part of the subjective realm. Money is money only because we think of it as money; only because we agree to act as if it does what we think it does. So having objective knowledge of a subjective domain is not a problem. ",

            "answer_text": "Apparently so. From the research I\u2019ve been doing the past ten years, people consistently say under deep hypnosis that we are fully conscious prior to coming here. That we choose our lives and situation based on a number of factors, and that when we do incarnate, we only bring about a third of that conscious energy. That two thirds always \u201cstays behind\u201d or is \u201cback home.\u201d That when we have a near death event or some other consciousness altered experience we might experience the rest of our consciousness - however we \u201cdumb ourselves down\u201d to be able to experience life on the planet. That once we check off stage, or leave the fishtank, we return home and reconnect to the rest of our consciousness. I\u2019ve examined thousands of these cases, filmed 45 and the reports are consistent (and reproducible). It appears that our idea of consciousness - that we somehow create it, and that the sum total of our experience is what happens while we are here - doesn\u2019t hold up with regard to the research. It appears to be the other way around. That we arrive here with memories of our previous existence (as many children remember up to the age of 8) and we eventually become this closed system where we experience what we experience for whatever reason we decided to make that journey - and once the journey is over, we return home (not everyone goes back immediately, some do hang around for whatever reason) but ulimately, we do make it \u201cback home\u201d and reconnect with who we were. (And continue to be.) Not my opinion, belief or theory - just based on the thousands of deep hypnosis reports from Dr. Wambach and Michael Newton and the 45 I\u2019ve filmed. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is yes. The brain is the thing, the brain is key, the brain is the essential organ related to what we call \"consciousness\", i.e., your subjective conscious experience, or the \"What is it like to be me?\" of being you. Yes. The only complicated part of your question is the word \"emerge\". If you are using that word casually, then you can stop reading, because I've answered your question above, and you may not be excited about what comes next. If you are using the word \"emerge\" with specific intention, then read on. What's the matter with the word \"emerge\"? A number of smart people have debated how semantically and functionally we should regard the relationship between brain and consciousness. Does the brain \"create\" consciousness? Does consciousness \"emerge\" from the brain? In most areas of brain science (i.e., psychology, neuroscience) it is fairly commonplace to talk about the \"neural correlates of consciousness\" or the NCC, made very popular through this influential book by Christoph Koch: The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach. In these academic circles, you will find that scientists are unambiguously non-dualist--they believe in a biological explanation of consciousness. However, you will also find that it is common for these types of people to use language like \"the correlates of consciousness\", or \"the brain circuits that cause consciousness\", or \"the brain generates consciousness\" or \"consciousness emerges from the brain\"--these types of things. So if you went and asked most neurobiologists, \"Does consciousness emerge from the brain?\". They would answer \"Yes!\" and everyone would feel content. I'll tell you what's the matter with the word \"emerge\". However, there are other types academics who would pause if you asked them that question, and it is because of the word \"emerge\". These are people like the neurophilosopher Patricia Churchland (see What are the most valid criticisms of Patricia Churchlands books on neuro-philosophy?), the philosopher Daniel Dennett (see Daniel Dennett) , the consciousness studies expert Susan Blackmore (Dr. Susan Blackmore), and others. From their perspective, the problem with the standard language, e.g., the \"neural correlates of consciousness\" is that it suggests that there is something else besides the neural activity. Something correlated but distinct from the neural activity. When people say \"brain activity generates consciousness\" it implies that consciousness is something besides brain activity, that exists at a certain point in time and doesn't exist at other points in time. But what could that be? In Dan Dennett's words: Let's call the idea...Cartesian Materialism, since it's the view you arrive at when you discard Descartes's dualism but fail to discard the imagery of a central (but material) Theater where 'it all comes together.'...Cartesian materialism is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of 'presentation' in experience because what happens there is what you are conscious of...We must stop thinking of the brain as if it had such a single functional summit or central point.\" ([1], pg 107-111) The sure sign of Cartesian materialism is anybody who tells the story of consciousness and doesn't go on to answer the 'and then what happens?' question. ([2], p. 87 ) So the idea here is that it is incorrect to talk about consciousness as if it is this \"extra\" thing that happens or is created by some special type of brain activity. Why are you making such a big deal about the word \"emerge'? I think that this loose way of thinking about consciousness (what Dennett calls cartesian materialism) is quite prolific and gets in the way of a deep understanding the brain. I think it taints experimental designs and confuses our interpretations. I think it blocks our scientific comprehension of other cognitive processes like declarative memory, attention, vision, and decision making. I think it obfuscates attainable goals in cognitive neuroscience and blurs the data we already have. Basically, I think that Dennett, Blackmore, and the Churchlands and all those that stand with them are on to something with this consciousness philosophizing and the field of neurobiology is kind of dropping the ball on this one. Where do we go from here? Honestly, the ideas above took me a long time to wrap my head around, so don't feel too bad if you are feeling confused. If you continue down this line of thinking then that is how you get to statements like the following: \"The easy way to cut through...is to draw lessons from the history of science. Electromagnetic waves don't cause light; they are light. That's what light is. Similarly with sound: a sound of middle C isn't correlated with a compression wave train of 263 Hz. It is a compression wave train with that frequency. And the feeling of warmth from a coffee cup isn't something that's correlated with mean molecular kinetic energy; it's identical with the mean molecular kinetic energy of the molecules in the cup.\" -Paul Churchland, [2] p. 54 \"The most extreme version of this [idea] is taken by eliminative materialists, such as the Churchlands. They argue that once we understand the evolution of human behavior, skills and abilities, we will have understood everything that we need to understand. The whole idea of consciousness will just slip away, as did the idea of the \"life force\" or phlogiston. In other words there really is no such thing as consciousness at all.\" - Blackmore, [3] p. 159 \"We certainly seem to be conscious, and that requires explaining, but the right kind of explanation is one that accounts for why we have this particular illusion. - Blackmore, [3] p. 218 \"When we understand consciousness--when there is no more mystery--consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe\" -Dennett [1] p. 25 So that's the problem with the word \"emerge\" when you say \"consciousness emerges from the brain\" or whenever anyone says things like \"the brain causes consciousness\" or \"I'm looking for the neural correlates of consciousness\" or \"neural patterns of activity generate consciousness\". With language like that, the brain will always be misunderstood. Citations Consciousness Explained (1991) by Dan Dennett Consciousness Explained: Daniel C.

            "answer_text": "I would say no, it does not. It is a function of the soul and the mind that is created when the soul takes up residence in the human. And that mind is outside the body, and is of a type of magnetism. Not the magnetism we know, else every time you did an MRI you would notice. What proof is there? Well a bit. Firstly if you are open-minded you will be willing to study out of body experiences, and the fact that people can take their mind, or aspects of it, to something remote. The US Military experimented with remote viewing, and have had success with it. I have a good friend and had the experience of him calling me on the phone, and as I said : \u201cCan\u2019t talk now\u201d he said: \u201cOh I see you are in the supermarket\u201d. And he did and does. I know that he also used to remotely visit his girlfriend who was on another continent, to see if circumstances were safe to call her (she was still in an abusive relationship at that time) and then proceeded to wake her remotely before picking up the phone. In other cases a woman reported that during an operation she was looking on at her body, and she was able to describe what happened, and what the doctors had said. It was verified that this was accurate, and that she had been fully sedated. Now what about the prodding and poking that goes on in the brain to prove xyz? Well the brain is complex, no doubt about that. It\u2019s capable of local processing, but in the end its just a very sophisticated receiver of signals from the mind. If you damage the right areas, you can stop the connection. Or if you stimulate certain areas you can create the same effects the mind can create. That does not prove it all happens in the brain. It just means you are messing with the middle of the system. And this is exactly the reason why there is life after death because we are already configured to operate without a brain. We don't need to change anything except where we focus our consciousness.And of course this is why this material world is really an illusion. Mind you, its real enough when you slam a door on your finger. ",

            "answer_text": "Does the brain create consciousness? I'm not so sure. At the very least, I know that no neuroscientist has caught the brain 'red-handed' in the act of creating consciousness. ... are we logos In neurons of the brainMaintaining voltage gradientsAcross a membrane? (That's a lyric from the new Yeasayer album.) The standard materialist position is that consciousness is tied up with the brain. There is plenty of evidence that the brain influences consciousness (and vice versa!), ranging from studies of brain damage to the well-known effects of mind-altering chemicals. The problem with going any further than this correlational fact is that no one knows how to define consciousness from an objective, third-person perspective. We only have access to one consciousness: our own. Every other consciousness is in a sense inferred from behavior. This process of inference is a social process, which is why the debate on animal consciousness is unlikely to end any time soon. We treat people as conscious because they seem conscious to us, and this seeming is a product of both our evolved perceptual systems and the cultural systems that operate on top of them. The fact that people disagree about whether a particular animal species is conscious or not suggests that there is no universal intuition about consciousness. Because the problem of consciousness is a problem of definitions, some neuroscientists have decided to stick their necks out and define it. A popular recent definition is contained in integrated information theory, proposed by Guilio Tononi and Cristoph Koch. An apparent consequence of their definition is that pretty much anything can be conscious if it has the right sort of \"information integratedness\". A philosopher named Eric Schwitzgebel ran with this line of thinking, and attempted to show that If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious.  To their credit, Tononi and Koch seem to have bitten the bullet and accepted a form of panpsychism \u2014 the idea that everything is conscious. Some philosophers dislike it when definition are too broad: they call the process \"bloating\". It's a useful concept in my opinion. If everything from electrons to galaxies is somewhat conscious (by virtue of being somewhere on the \"information integratedness\" scale) then the concept of consciousness becomes less useful as a descriptor of observable phenomena. (But then again, perhaps we never actually observe consciousness anyway. We observe with consciousness. Consciousness itself seems to have no material attributes: it is only the objects or targets of consciousness that have attributes. ) This is why it is always good to go back to the kinds of definitions of consciousness used by philosophers and mystics. These definitions are much closer to our colloquial understanding of consciousness than anything proposed by neuroscientists. Consciousness is the field of subjective experience. We can communicate aspects of this experience, but we can never share directly in any consciousness other than our own. We cannot answer the question 'What Is it Like to Be a Bat?' We can barely even speculate about it.  One of my favorite descriptions of consciousness comes from Julian Jaynes bizarre and beautiful book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. O WHAT A WORLD of unseen visions and heard silences, this insubstantial country of the mind! What ineffable essences, these touchless rememberings and unshowable reveries! And the privacy of it all! A secret theater of speechless monologue and prevenient counsel, an invisible mansion of all moods, musings, and mysteries, an infinite resort of disappointments and discoveries. A whole kingdom where each of us reigns reclusively alone, questioning what we will, commanding what we can. A hidden hermitage where we may study out the troubled book of what we have done and yet may do. An introcosm that is more myself than anything I can find in a mirror. This consciousness that is myself of selves, that is everything, and yet nothing at all \u2014 what is it?And where did it come from?And why? Descriptions like this also reveal why neuroscience will always struggle to study consciousness in all its private glory. How are we supposed to study something that is a \"hidden hermitage\"? We never actually see consciousness. All we see are its consequences in behavior. So when we look for the neural correlates of consciousness, what we are really looking for are the neural correlates of certain measurable behaviors that we think are closely related with consciousness, such as attention, self-awareness, access to information, and (perhaps most important) the ability to comprehend and communicate. If there is a type of consciousness that we are incapable of acting upon or even remembering then we will simply be unable to study it from a scientific perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "This is unknown. It is an \"emergent\" property. Just because we have a word \"consciousness\" does not mean it is a coherent concept let alone understandable. Neurology and psychology are both only 130 years old (with some precursors of course). The human brain is the most complicated thing in the known universe.  We can imagine a chemical reaction creating a chemical sense of \"me\" vs. \"not-me\" when an amoeba encounters things in its environment, or a light source, or a predator, or food. That doesn't tell us what it is \"like\" to be an amoeba. As you go up the level of complication of multi-celled organisms to ones with nervous systems, brains, etc. the level of our confusion exponentially increases as does our ignorance. We don't even know why psycho-active drugs prescribed every day for mental illness work. Differences between brains (think synesthesia, sociopathy, autism) confuse us even more.  It's like imagining that we understand quantum psychics because we know how to melt an ice cube: there is a vague connection. Very vague.  Most of what our brain does is not accessible to our conscious, and the little that is is the result of a huge number of variable working together, from DNA, every experience we have had, every sensory input we are having, to the trillions of cross-connections of our neurons. We barely have any idea what axons do or are for. There is a reason that philosophy and not science is mostly dealing with this issue: it is beyond us. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very deep question that can only be answered in the context of a world-view very different from the one most people have. Most people are materialists - they believe in an objective external world of independently existing objects separate from themselves that they can passively perceive using their brains. However, serious thinkers over the last century have realized that materialism doesn't make sense. We experience interactions (photons hitting the retina etc.), not objects  - the objects are inferred from these interactions and their properties are not objectively real, they are dependent on the context and the nature of the observer. The closest we get to an objective reality is a consensus on the interpretation of an event shared by a number of observers. They can agree on a consensus to the degree to which they are the same (all humans, same brains and perceptual systems etc). This reality only extends to the group that shares the consensus, it is not objective. The features of this reality, the similar interpretations of the interactions that the group is conscious of, are conditioned by the brains of the group members. Thus the inferred contents of consciousness are dependent on the brain.  What consciousness actually is is the experience of interaction. A conscious event defines both the subject having the experience and the object that is perceived. Both of these are inferred and conditional, that is they depend on a number of factors and are not objectively real. That is why mystics say that the perceived world is not real, it is an illusion. What they mean is that our interpretation of conscious experience is not an unchanging objective reality, it is subjective. When they say things like \"the world is made of consciousness\" they don't mean that consciousness is a substance - there is no substance. What they mean is that our phenomenal world of objects is inferred from our experience of interations, which is what consciousness is. ",

            "answer_text": "We can make everything simpler recognising that consciousness is defined only in relation to the environment. That it is not, by all means, a mere property of the brain.  The isolated brain Human beings may have irreversible brain dammage after only two weeks of complete isolation (just read it on the NYTimes today, don't have any reference but seems plausible). Without the possibility of exchanging information with the environment, we \"lose our mind\".  This because consciousness is not a mere property of the brain: it is a property of an information processor, the brain, which has the capacity \u2013and the necessity\u2013 of seeing itself as different from other information processors (like other brains) and exchange information with them (e.g. empathise). Different level of consciousnesses Frans de Waal made clear that consciousness is not a unique property of the human brain. Chimpanzees, for instance, are perfectly aware they exist. If they have a spot on their face and they are put in front of a mirror, they clean their face. They can perfectly empathise with others: if a chimp hits another chimp, the victim might search revenge attacking a younger relative of the aggressor. They know who they are, and they know what the others might think. (De Waal, Frans. Good natured: The origins of right and wrong in humans and other animals. No. 87. Harvard University Press, 1997). So, after having said that consciousness is a property of the brain exchanging information with the environment, we can also add that the human brain has a very high level of consciousness, but it is not the only device with this property. Do ants have consciousness? Of course ants have no consciousness. In H\u00f6lldobler, B, and Edward W. The superorganism: the beauty, elegance, and strangeness of insect societies. WW Norton & Company, 2009., the authors say: \"We see the insect colony as the equivalent of an organism.\" Ants clearly have no consciousness, but if you read the book you end up thinking that anthills do have some degree of it. Do neurons have consciousness? Following the same path, but backwards: do neurons have consciousness? Of course they don't. Only interconnected neurons, able to store information and exchange information with the environment, show different degrees of consciousness.  Consciousness as the \"capacity to integrate information\" Therefore, to understand human consciousness, we should maybe analyse the way the human brain processes information, which is what Giulio Tononi does in: Tononi, G. \"An information integration theory of consciousness.\" BMC neuroscience 5.1 (2004): 42.  A bit technical (to say the least), but very interesting. One of the most valid answers I read is there \u2013sorry for not replicating the whole article:) Regarding the unicity of human brain, I think we do have something unique. If not consciousness itself, for sure the fact that we ask ourselves what consciousness is, and why is there. ",

            "answer_text": "OThis might be the the wrong question as too much focus exists on the neural correlates of consciousness. NCC are just that, and correlates do not equal causation. A better starting point would be to take the stance that the brain articulates consciousness, and in our case does so at, and from, a human perspective and level. Then,too, we articulate it at a symbolic level, primarily through language, and that also feeds into the disposition that due to the uniqueness of language to humans consciousness is also something unique to us. But, unless we assume that human consciousness is the only type of consciousness, there is no reason to doubt that other levels and types of consciousness exist. While not excluding the possibility of a general type of panpsychism (along the lines of Spinoza and Leibnitz) I definitely would extent the experience of that what we call consciousness to all biological creatures. An excellent book for meditations on this point is Gustav Theodor Fechner\u2019s book C Nanna Or About The Inner Life Of Plants English Gustav Theodor Fechner There is a case to be made that being consciousness is a state of \u2018being\u2019, of Dasein, in its most primitive sense, being able to react/interact with the world (universe), in way that is recursive to the agent and contains the possibility of change. Per force this would mean that all dissipative systems ( along with reproductive capacity and irreversibility) have the potential for consciousness. So, I\u2019m willing to speculate that the most primitive life form, single cell bacteria, just might have a qualia experience when it finds a morsel of molecule or divides. Just like we have a qualia moment when we reduce ourselves to a single cell in the act to reproduce ourselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Experts disagree about whether consciousness emerges from the brain. One thing that is not controversial, however, is that in order to be conscious (in any way that we would recognize), something like a brain is required. But even though a brain is necessary for consciousness, brains and brain functions alone may not be sufficient for consciousness. That is, perhaps consciousness requires a brain and something else.  What is that \"something else\"? The answer to this may depend on what element of consciousness you're inquiring about. If you are interested in perception, Susan Hurley, in her book Consciousness in Action, makes a compelling case for the necessity of sensorimotor feedback loops in structuring the kind of perceptual experiences that we have. If what you're asking about is phenomenal experience (i.e., the first-person, felt experience of living, or as some philosopher's have put it, the \"what it's like\"), then it is highly likely that the brain alone - understood as a collection of purely physical properties - is not sufficient for consciousness. This is the mind-body problem. How can something like phenomenal experience emerge from something purely physical? How can something material cause something that is immaterial? Interestingly, this is really only an intractable problem if you assume that the brain is purely a collection of physical properties. I am not suggesting that the brain contains a spirit, or anything of that nature. What I am suggesting is that brains, skulls, your hair, your cat, your car, and the dust bunnies collecting under your bed are all what appear to be purely physical entities only through the lense of consciousness. At a subatomic level all of these things are bustling, buzzing waves of quantum fluctuation. Why are they solid at a macroscopic level? Because it is the macroscopic world that we apprehend in consciousness. These things are made material within consciousness. We then export our material experience as metaphor that we apply to physics. But all of the physical microscopic entities we are aware of are defined solely by their relational properties to our measuring devices. This means that we define these entities by what they do, not what they are. We can gather from quantum physics and theories (like string theory) that try to resolve the tension between quantum physics and general relativity, that the nature of the universe at a granular level is stranger than we can imagine. It is possible that our universe is a place where the raw field of potential consciousness is just baked into the fabric of reality. Not only is this possible, but it would go a long way toward solving all kinds of theoretical problems relating to the mind-body problem (the problem of the generation of consciousness). In such a case a brain, understood as a physical manifestation in consciousness that is representative of a deeper ontology, qualifies as a candidate for the root of consciousness. The brain that we see and measure tells only part of the story, but what we do see of it suggests that its organization may represent the configuration of the field of potential consciousness that is required for full-blown phenomenal consciousness.   But if we accept that it is the functioning organization of the brain that matters for consciousness, we really have no principled reason to draw a line around the sack of meat (the brain) and say, \"some of the processes inside the meat sack are jointly sufficient for consciousness and none of the processes outside the meat sack are necessary for consciousness.\" That is, there may be genuine contributions from other parts of your body, or even your environment, that are also necessary processes underlying our human-style consciousness. Again, for a mind-blowing read I highly recommend Hurley's Consciousness in Action. Be warned, though, her writing is brilliant but not easy. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll try to answer this as best I can, given my limited knowledge about this. The brain is quite simply an information processing organ, that has evolved to increase the chance of survival of the body it is a part of. The processing of the brain can be roughly divided into 3 levels.The lowest level consists of crunching the raw information from the sensory inputs and other bodily monitors. An example is the internal calculations and decoding that happens behind vision. What we 'see' is a highly processed version of what is actually incident on the eye - a highlight of the surfaces of the objects, depth, color, etc. The intermediate level is the one which accesses the processed information from the lower level, works on this, and interfaces with the highest level. While much of the information from the lower level is inaccessible, a fair bit is accessible. This is the generator of 'consciousness'. The highest level is the long-term memory. This is like a gist of the information processing. Some time after you finish reading this, what you retain is only the gist of the message I'm trying to convey, and your opinion about it. While you are reading, you may be aware of the structure of my sentences. You may pick up grammatical mistakes that I may have made. You might experience some emotion while you read through (for example, you may feel disgusted that you're reading a pile of BS with every sentence you proceed. Or perhaps you may think 'I like where this is going, it makes sense'). This is the real time computation occurring at the intermediate level - the one we call as consciousness. But you will not have any access to the computation that goes behind translating the optical image of this page that is incident on the photoreceptors of your eye. That is the realm of the lowest level. Why is the intermediate level required? Why have a distinction between lower level and intermediate level?That is, why can't access be provided to the entire information pool?Because this access has its costs. Think of our intermediate level as RAM. To 'compute on' more raw information than we do now, the brain will need ridiculous amounts of storage. Even the number of neurons (which goes into billions) pales in comparison to the number of permutations of thoughts that can be generated from processing even a slightly higher amount of raw data.Also, apart from storage space, it takes time to do this extra processing. Much of our conscious processing must happen in real time. Why have a distinction between the intermediate and highest level?The answer to this gives the most insight into the importance of consciousness. We need more than a gist to get around this world. Here's an example. When you speak to another human, you need more than a terse summary. You need more than hearing the syllables being uttered and concluding with - <He said \"Say that one more time to my face\">. You need to be able to observe the expressions on the face of the person, evaluate the tone of his voice, and then make the decision in real time, as to whether he is requesting you to repeat yourself, or he's aggressive telling you to back down immediately. Depending on that, your action can have very different consequences.  As the spotlight of our attention shifts to what is most important at the present moment of time, the intermediate level retrieves the information necessary for us to be able to navigate in that particular situation. It produces thoughts laced with emotion - pleasurable or not so much - that encourages us to go after or avoid situations that could be beneficial or harmful to us. This style of processing happened to be the most efficient way to implement in humans, for the gene to carry out its end objective of replication. Now is the important question - who controls that spotlight? Who is the decision maker? How is this sentience generated? Answer - I've no idea.All I'm aware of is that damage to the frontal lobes can destroy decision-making ability (The person is alert, but unable to exercise the will). Hope this jumble of thoughts does help anyone who was actually patient enough to read this. Please feel free to point out any inaccuracies. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is that the brain does not create consciousness. Consciousness, thoughts, feelings, qualia, subjective experience, etc are not observable properties of anything, including brains. You can't prove that anything else or anyone else is conscious, any more than you can prove that someone you meet in a dream is conscious. If consciousness, thoughts, feelings, qualia etc are not illusory, then they most definitely are *not* physical. At least not as we currently understand \"physical\". Unlike everything else in science, consciousness is not publicly observable, even in principle, although it's often correlated with observable things. But so what? My consciousness is correlated with lots of things, including watching movies, growing old, and taking drugs. Does that mean they generate consciousness? Correlation isn't causation. There's a reason why they\u2019re called \u201cNeural Correlates.\u201d Materialists continue to look for a \"mechanism\" for consciousness, but they won't find it, because anything you find in this world can only be a correlate. There is no observable mechanism for generating unobservable properties. Leibniz understood this 350 years ago. Unfortunately, modern materialists seem to have forgotten it. The only semi-coherent position for materialists is that consciousness is an \"illusion\" (Dennett et al). But how can consciousness be illusion when its contents -- such as science & logic, physical things, and this post -- are not? That's backwards. The contents can be illusory, not the awareness of them. It would seem that for an eliminative materialist, consciousness cannot exist. For the rest of us, it is everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it does.Rather than \"emerging\", it is what we \"cultivate\". Mind = Brain + Consciousness Brain, the organ that we have.  Cerebrum, cerebellum and medulla.Consciousness, the thoughts that run through it. Our thinking. Our approach for life. Our discrimination of good or bad, right or wrong. Brain is like a circuit and consciousness is the electricity that runs it. That makes us alive. Not all living people are actually \"alive\". Before each action you take, consider your (free)will of doing it. In every case, the things we do for long term are only those which have our free will in doing, those that we will do when no one is watching us, without preparing only for sake of some examinations. Because these are the things which we do, for self, for our happiness. For me, ability to judge things before doing them on basis of whether I really want to do it is consciousness. Do you really want to do it?If you can something, doesn't mean you want to. Do you really want to? It saves a lot of time and effort by avoiding deeds for peer pressure sake. I can beat someone, doesn't mean I should. I can buy something, doesn't mean I want to. I can win an argument, but is it worth trying to convince him/ her? Will it gain me something except pleasure of pinning his/ her opinion down? I can go to gym and want to build 6 packs. Why? Because everyone else is doing it or because I love fitness? May be running stamina is better for me than building body. I want to impress a girl. Why? Because all other men are trying and if I can beat them it will be my show of supremacy. I want to do it if I am interested in her. I want to excel in a game. Why? Because that's what all others play and I want to be part of the group but the sport suck for me. Or because I enjoy the thrill it provides. I want to watch certain sitcom. Why? Because everybody else does?Please. Time you have is yours. You get to decide where to invest it. Don't invest it in group's interest. Invest it in yours. Because that's all you have. It's only thing that is absolutely yours but also the one that keeps on decreasing. Every second. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It is actually not so difficult to scientifically prove, in physics, the existence of an existing state of consciousness capable of existing independently of any material support. The so-called \"Hard Problem of Consciousness\" stems from the fact that we are attempting to measure consciousness with tools designed to apprehend atoms, molecules, and particles: it's much like trying to assess the dimensions of a table with a voltmeter: it does not work, and then we could say that there is a \"hard problem of table dimensions\" in assessing the width and length of the table. To say that the table has no length, or that independent consciousness does not exist, then becomes plain circular reasoning, as in \"I have only a voltmeter, and therefore the table has no length; I have only assessment tools that pertain to matter, hence consciousness per se does not exist.\" It\u2019s an error of elementary logic. As it is, it\u2019s all rather simple. Here's what happens when you use the right tools to capture consciousness: http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/14836/1/feels%20v999.pdf Basically, what this paper says is that an essential property of any material thing made up of material particles (to wit, the way how relevant wave functions collapse under certain circumstances, brought about by an interference event - such as measurement, observation, the establishment of new chemical bonds, etc.), is seen to not apply to consciousness - which implies that consciousness can only be a fundamental property, independent of matter and non-emergent from matter (such as that of the brain), because if it were dependent on and/or emergent from matter, the way how these wave functions collapse would inescapably carry over into how consciousness works - which it does not.

            "answer_text": "Larger and larger scales of classification, association, stimulus-response systems built out of the neural networks of the brain. The idea is that the developing neural networks are built from neural migrations and mappings (which we know to be true in mammalian brain development), that various \u201cmodules\u201d of the brain are built as the end product of all of the genetically-programmed migrations (as a result of genetic effect on neural histology and differentiation), and the uniqueness for each person (the individual reactions and associations) are borne of the acquired experiences along the way. From fetus to infant, all of the experiences (stimulus-response patterns on those migrated pathways), mapping various sensory associations\u2026and those become more and more complex as we develop. There is no Deepak Chopra quantum consciousness BS - that is pseudoscience. And emergence does not mean \u201cmagic happens\u201d. It is just a lexicographic placeholder for all of the various processes that I mentioned above. For consideration: As far back as you can recall, or even from scientific studies on cognitive processing in infants, memory, response patterns, etc. - think of the level of complexity of the cognitive processes of the human infant (or any mammalian infant, for that matter). Now, imagine what gets added along the way in a few years beyond that - as experiences get updated with new context as more classification layers in the brain are present. And continue that process of increasing resolved complexity in those neural networks as more gets associated\u2026for years and years\u2026as more neural tissue becomes available. Consciousness becomes richer as a result - from simple reflexes to experiences\u2026to memories and thoughts\u2026to greater complexity. You have to grow a brain (both histologically and neurologically/cognitively). ",

            "answer_text": "This is very much a topic of ongoing research, and while some clues have started to emerge, the big picture of how the brain does this has not yet been worked out. Some people, particularly in philosophy, are not convinced that the brain does create consciousness, although in the field of neuroscience, this is the generally accepted belief. Piecing together the currently popular theories suggests the following general picture for how the brain creates consciousness, proceeding from the neuron to socially supported identity: neural circuits organize statistical input and output -- The brain is processing sensory input and generating motor output on a continual basis, functioning basically as a statistical information processing and prediction machine.memory constructs a dynamic model of the world -- One aspect of how the brain works is that it generates an interactive dynamic model of the world based on the statistical information received from the senses. This model includes an understanding of the environment, a representation of the physical body itself (body image; the way you know your hand is yours and not somebody else's), a representation of other beings in the social world (parents, friends, society, animals), and ultimately a representation of oneself. The representation of oneself may be an extension of social modeling reflected back onto oneself (the purported owner of one's perceptual experiences); it may also be the \"actor\" responsible for the observed behavior represented by the body image (perception of \"agency\").information integration unifies coherent perception -- One aspect of the \"conscious field\" is that it appears unified, complete, coherent, and self-aware, even though experiments show it is not. This may be made possible by extensive feedback pathways within the brain which exchange information between brain areas, unify perception into a single coherent point of view, and drive the brain's representation of the body's identity toward a consistent model of goal-directed voluntary action.episodic memory creates identity through personal narrative -- In humans in particular, \"one-shot memory\" is able to store an episodic record of the events we experience along with causal models and explanations. This \"episodic memory\" is organized into a multi-layer narrative on many time scales. Our knowledge of our own personal history forms our identity of who we are, which further supports our understanding of that entity which is being aware, experiencing perceptions, and causing actions.... our \"self\".social structure reinforces a model of reality and agency -- Society and human culture further reinforce this \"mutually developed\" model of who we are, who other people are, who they think we are, what we think they think of us, etc.. There are many levels of recurrent nesting of representations of our personal and social identities, both within our own brain and distributed across the brains of our family, community, and social relations.language codifies social reality and supports transmission of cultural beliefs -- All of this is brought into a crisp structured social-conceptual framework using language. Language is a culturally-transmitted conceptual system with a spontaneously developed sequential coding scheme (words and grammar). Language allows society to operate within a common believe system that is kept synchronized across individuals. This belief system includes concepts such as personal responsibility, intentional action, truth, knowledge, and other core belief frameworks that provide a foundation to our conscious experience.Thus the brain plays a role in generating and maintaining a model of the world that includes \"us,\" and also includes \"us\" believing we are having self-aware experiences. In modern human society, this is further supported by a shared reality and belief system that we acquire from infancy through cultural transmission, human language, episodic memory, and personal identity. RelatedWhat are some of the current neuroscientific theories of consciousness? What is consciousness? How does the brain turn electrical impulses into conscious thought?How exactly does the brain produce consciousness or self awareness when cells themselves are not conscious? Is it something to do with electricity being felt all over the brain causing self-awareness? ",

            "answer_text": "You've got it all back to front Neil! The brain doesn't create consciousness or life. How can something that is dead, create something that's alive? The consciousness uses the body and the brain as a medium to communicate, procreate, demonstrate and sometimes vegetate! It can be viewed as being like a switch board or control center that behaves as an interface with the consciousness that is the operator. But without any doubt, the physical body is stone dead as soon as the consciousness departs. When death occurs the brain stays exactly the same for a while, until it starts to decay obviously. The astral body is said to align itself accurately with the physical body which why we can\u2019t swap bodies but often leaves during sleep and that sudden falling sensation we all get occasionally, is the astral body making a fast re-entry because it got a fright or was disturbed, which is why we are aware when it happens. As someone who has experienced astral travel many times, I can vouch for this with certainty, because that wake up feeling happened to me often and initially it's rather hard to stop it occurring in fact, as you are in this amazing new situation floating around the room and you don't believe it at first,its a bit scary, so you shoot back into the body involuntarily because it sort of freaks you out. Wow! What the Hell have I just done! I understand science is not too far off testing for this phenomenon, if it hasn't already and that will rattle a few cages believe me! It will be bigger than the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle I would think. Science will need to rethink quite a few hitherto accepted idea's and we will enter a wonderful new era of discovery and understanding hopefully and people like me who are sometimes referred to, in a friendly manner (yeah right) as fruitcakes, will finally be vindicated. There will be a lot of very red faces, tearing of hair and gnashing of teeth! Metaphorically speaking of course! ",

            "answer_text": "Well there is some debate whether the brain does generates consciousness. That said, if it did then we should ask a few additional questions. First are mental states reducible in some way to physical states or are they wholly different? If they are reducible, then you have your answer in physical necessity. That is very surprising. Conscious experience seems wholly different from physical facts. If I know that such and such atom will collide with some other atom, why should that be the same thing as some mental state (I.e. feeling hungry or happy)? That makes absolutely zero sense in my opinion. But, regardless, that is an answer. In this case the story about the masses and positions and charges, etc. of the particles was all along the same thing as my conscious experience of hunger\u2026 Of course we could adopt some other physical reduction, by way of behavior or function for examples, but these seem just as absurd if not more so. Why should a particular function be the same as a particular conscious experience? Again this makes no sense as conscious experiences may serve functions, but they are not merely funttions\u2026 Such views seem to merely mistake our mental states for some physical state. But what if they are not reducible? Well then we should ask whether the mental facts can influence the physical facts. If they cannot, then we might wonder why the experience of eating a cheeseburger is associated with the cheeseburgers being eaten, rather than some other experience such as a paralyzing fear, or a splash of yellow, or an interest in the flight patterns of geese. We seem to be driven toward the view called epiphenominalism, which is not reassuring precisely because our phenomenological experiences have no power to accomplish anything. it would be just as plausible for my mind to be overcome with a desire to swim the English Channel every time my body needed food, as my desiring the swim will accomplish nothing more or less than my hunger. Yet if the mental facts can alter the physical facts, then it seems the causal closure of the physical is in trouble (as Jaegwon Kim has argued). In this case however we could actually have my \u2018hunger\u2019 doing work. Some mental states (like hunger) could then be selected for or against and give an evolutionary advantage in a given context. Ultimately if the brain does generate consciousness then how this is done is a huge mystery. In my opinion the brain is not the right kind of thing to generate consciousness, however\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": ">>>Does the brain generate consciousness?<<< The big elefant here is the symbol \u201cgenerate\u201d. There is a generator, which is the brain. But the generated, it is not there. Only with this proclamation we can say \u201cno, the consciousness is not generated\u201d. It is merely elicited - MOMENTARILY and INDIVIDUALLY.  A consciousness (an individual human mind) is the entirety of the individual THOUGHTS being elicited in the individual brain at an individual instant. \u26a0\ufe0f Considering that a consciousness is undetectable as such, it-self, on its own, the popular proclamation that \u201cthe consciouness causes thoughts\u201d is unsubstantiable, in other words tantamount to pseudoscientific gibberish. The consciousness (the individual human mind) is an inside-brain-phaenomenon The consciousness is - as such, it-self, on its own - non-detectable. In other words, we cannot distinguish, whether the consciousness is the real-, the detectable brain activity - as such, it-self, on its own\u2192 \u201cconsciousness is actions\u201d an imaginary effect of the real-, detectable brain activity\u2192 \u201cconsciousness is givens\u201d \u26a0\ufe0f In any case, the consciousness does not exist - NOT as such, NOT it-self, NOT on its own. Regardless whether it is real actions or imaginary effects OF real actions, all that DOES exist and is the ACTOR if not even the GIVER, it is the brain. Which brain is merely eliciting, making up, fabricating the individual consciousness at an instant. Every child knows that the excitation of consciousness is but temporary. Any THOUGHT is just that: A tiny element of the conciousness, which element can also symbolized as Information elicited in the brain. The consciousness is nothing else than the entirety of tiny elements, in other words it is the entirety of the momentarily- and individually elicited informations. >>>Is information the foundation of reality?<<< No, it is vice-versa: Information-SOURCES (the real) are the foundation of any information (imaginary - via a perception-process). >>>What is an example of information?<<< An information is all that our brain can individually and momentarily elicit, make up, fabricate - BY-, TO-, ON- OF-, obtained/acquired FROM-, ABOUT- information-SOURCES My own, praeliminary listing of informations starts with awarenesses = informations = properties of the (own) body: All them proclaimed sensations, emotions, problems, values (such as beauty and usefulness), ought-, should-, and must-HOODS, importance and necessity that is; meanings, intentions, purposes, desires-/ wills - and the respective counteremotions. Such as: Love and hate, appreciation and disgust, bright-NESS and dark-NESS.ALL them proclaimed parameters in the language of physics: MASS, distance, area, space, density, time, velocity, acceleration (gravity is an example), force, impulse, pressure, power, ENERGY, temperatureALL them proclaimed Constants, Axioms, fields in the language of physics. And all LAWS - of games, legislature, AND of logic, morality, physicsALL them proclaimed G-Ds - such as YHWH, Jesus (THE) Christ, AllahThe individual human consciousness and its elements, the informations, they are, as such, them-selves, on their own imaginary and totally undetectable. They can only be uttered, proclaimed, manifested that is: Symbol-IZED, object-IFIED, material-IZED, determined, defined, ASSERTED that is. The imaginary realm (nature) of any information and of its entirety, the human consciousness follows LOGICALLY from the consideration, that an information is elicited, made up, fabricated INSIDE the brain: Yet, the brain will NEVER provide the information, that any information, as listed above, BE being elicited, made up, fabricated INSIDE the brain, inside it-self that is. It will rather provide the information, that the information be - ACCURATELY - located where the Information-SOURCE is physically located - outside the brain that is. In other words, the brain provides an illusion \u201cin order to make things right\u201d. In other words, I assert that the question whether the consciousness is the real-, the detectable brain activity - as such, it-self, on its own\u2192 \u201cconsciousness is actions\u201d an imaginary effect of the real-, detectable brain activity\u2192 \u201cconsciousness is givens\u201d is solved by the proclamation (assertion) \u201cit is imaginary givens\u201d In other words, consciousness is an imaginary epiphaenomenon, it does not cause anything. All that DOES cause something, it is the real actions in the brain. You can call my assertion the objectification of an inside-brain DUALISM. Please be so kind and abstain from asserting I be a Solipsist or a Constructivist: I assert that my explanations above are not that hard to be understood. Kindest regards, from GERMANY! ",

If you are a good person, that\u2019s because of your brain, not because you have a \u201cgood heart.\u201d You just realized that you accidentally shit your pants? That\u2019s your brain too.  By understanding that the brain is in control of everything, you\u2019ll be able to adopt a realistic biological deterministic view of the world around you. There isn\u2019t some sort of ethereal metaphysical entity that is in control of your conscious thought, it\u2019s all material and observable.  Why is this a good thing, shouldn\u2019t this notion depress the hell out of everyone? It might be the case that you don\u2019t really have free will since everything that is you is biologically derived, but that doesn\u2019t mean that biology can\u2019t change. The brain is a plastic entity, capable of adjusting and re-orientating itself in response to stimuli. This means that although your experience is biological in nature, it isn\u2019t fixed. Your brain can train itself to adjust to the environment around it. Furthermore, there are substances that you can ingest that will change your brain and physiology. Years ago, bloodletting was a procedure where you would bleed out the sickness that the patient was experiencing. This medical procedure was considered legitimate at one time for various ailments Bloodletting - Wikipedia. During this time, various sicknesses had no cure or even viable treatment.  Now we have medical science to help mitigate some of these sicknesses. If you adopt biological determinism, then you can foresee mental health disorders becoming cured, just like syphilis or polio. One more thing, there seems to be this fallacious notion that having a powerful brain is exclusive to critical thinking and logic. This is not the case however; there are plenty of athletic human beings with amazing brains. The computational sophistication required to have the hand eye coordination of Lebron James is impeccable, and is emblematic of a well developed brain. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is based from a computer science and objective view where \u201cthe brain\u201d is not limited to human brain, not even to just mammal brains, not even animal brains, but extends to any system that has a \u201cbrain\u201d or functionally equivalent information processing system with memory and sensors. In this definition, rocks are not conscious but most (and possibly all) living things are, and man-made computer systems can also be conscious. So consciousness is created by software (programming) that analyzes incoming sensory data against past data and knowledge (interpretations and conclusions) to make an intelligent decision towards a predetermined goal or strategy. Thus rocks will always move in the direction a force is applied (Newtons law of motion) but a cat or even a bee may not, and may choose to attack back. Plants and lower life forms are obviously much lower on this consciousness scale as their mobility is limited so it is tough to act very intelligently. Still clearly even a lowly bacterium such as an E-Coli is somewhat conscious of its environment and responds somewhat more intelligently than say a regular polymer or a grain of salt. In summary, no the brain per se doesn\u2019t create consciousness, rather the software that runs in it (aka the mind) together with all the sensors and communication and mobility tools, makes the whole system conscious. Conscious systems thus also have \u201cfree will\u201d by displaying the ability to choose a particular response from several possible options, in order to optimize a strategy and/or maximize the probability of achieving an end goal. That \u201cfree will\u201d of course depends on the programming which itself adapts and modifies itself as it learns from experience, at least living systems do, man-made systems not so much yet, but getting there.

            "answer_text": "Well, since I see \"laypersons\" are chiming in, here goes! Scientifically, a consensus has not been reached on the \"mechanics\" of the brain in relationship to consciousness, but the link to the brain has been established. My personal opinion is that scientific information so far would indicate \"consciousness\" is a neurological response to the environment in which humans evolved. The human sense of one being separate from one's environment and other living things, of being self-aware, is advantageous for survival. The highly evolved human neurological responses to the environment such as reasoning, thought, emotions, and dreams are complex (though not always in harmony with how our universe really is), yet can be be tied to neural activity as any other response of the central or peripheral nervous systems. Like involuntary responses, the human sense of consciousness is not chosen, it just is. Based upon scientific observation and experimentation, this is a summary of what scientists have verified so far: 1) As people think and interact with the environment, activity in the brain can be observed through EEG and fMRI. Depending upon the environment and people's reaction to it, different areas of the brain are involved to various degrees, often acting in concert. 2) When certain chemicals are introduced to the brain in a laboratory setting changes in brain activity can be observed and people are able to report how their consciousness is affected. The same is true if certain areas of the brain are stimulated electrically. Damage to certain parts of the brain through trauma or disease affects specific areas of thought. The presence or lack of certain chemicals produces observable effects on brain function and behavior, and people can report on how it affects their consciousness. 3) When activity in a human brain ceases, so does the scientist's ability to observe or verify any activity that can be related to that human. Consciousness outside of brain activity has never been scientifically verified. We know that the brain is related to consciousness. Everything else is speculation. Does this prove that there is not some level of consciousness that cannot be detected by science or has not yet been detected by science? No. Speculate to your heart's content. Attach any degree of belief you desire to anecdotal reports of out-of-body or near death experiences. If you have had such an experience, attach whatever meaning you prefer. Just don't confuse such experiences with scientific verifiability which involves independent observation and repeatability.   Before modern science facilitated the empirical study of the brain and nervous system, through the millennia human culture accumulated an abundance of philosophical and metaphysical speculation about the nature of being and consciousness. In my opinion, the best neuroscientists first try to put aside all assumptions about consciousness, including its existence as an independent \"thing\" which can be separated from the humans that conceived it.

The brain is a highly complex organ \u2014 its hundred billion neurons, thereabouts, involve over 100 trillion connections with others (synapses). These all provide for ongoing communication between the psyche and the body. But that psyche, the consciousness which is your essence, transcends the physical realm. Consider this: by age 33 or so, you\u2019ve lived over a billion seconds. By then, you have a vast memory of your life\u2019s events, encounters, views, situations and relationships. Your memory consists of huge amounts of visual data, of smells, tastes and other sensory recall. It involves memories of what you where thinking in conjunction with earlier situations \u2014 plus thoughts, hopes, intent and even dream recall. Your conscious capacity also includes creativity in many of life\u2019s veins (music, construction, art, literature, etc.) \u2014 plus love, empathy, hate, feelings, anticipation, cruelty perhaps, self-sacrifice, etc\u2026 The conscious Self \u2014 consider the overall character/personality you feel yourself to be \u2014 is a vastly rich and interactive being. If the brain were the basis of that Self, all encounters, all those memories and more, would have to be codified in some fashion \u2014 made into physical symbols and stored in some fashion for future recall. (A computer, for example, converts visual images into pixels, each of which has a binary set of numbers to represent it. Those numbers are stored for the computer to pull and to recreate the image.) But the brain contains no such storage mechanism of codified data \u2014 and science has been looking for that for a long time. They can tweak some parts of the brain or disable sections and that has an effect. But it only indicates some correlation, not that the brain is the basis of consciousness. In actuality, the total Self, the overriding consciousness which you are, creates lifetimes/incarnations, learning and growing through the experience \u2014 manifesting an interactive, ongoing experience of events and relationships, and the body from/through which to engender that experience. It would be much more accurate to ask \u201cHow Does Consciousness Create the Brain?\u201d, but you didn\u2019t ask that, so I\u2019ll save my answer to that for later\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it seems to be a result of stimulii, so at least perceived consciousness would seem to originate from the brain, because it expresses itself in terms of language we have perceived from a combination of sensory inputs - Sight, sound, smell, touch, temperature awareness, balance etc. I think maybe it's one of those untestable hypotheses as to what consciousness actually means without sensory input to build up a picture of the world in order for consciousness to express itself in some way. And once we're dead, we don't appear to be able to tell the living, 'Hey I am a floating blob of consciousness, look at me!' - Unless you are a believer in the concept of Souls, Clairvoyance / Mediumship etc - which may well be the case, but it has been confoundingly difficult to prove scientifically. So it would appear that the brain is important in order to at least express consciousness. But then we really need a good definition of what actually is consciousness. I've always wondered how we can tell whether our consciousness actually exists in our body at all.  Potentially, the forms that we perceive might just be held in some kind of 'central repository' (let's call it universal consciousness), and when we sustain brain damage, we're just cutting off our ability to interact with aspects of that in some way - like breaking the antenna on your radio (or turning off your internet router). Maybe the complexity of consciousness isn't within us after all. But then, I've always been prone to fanciful imaginings! ",

            "answer_text": "This question can't be answered in a yes or no. In the beginning when cognitive science was starting, many believed in dualism. There are many versions of dualism but the main essence of all of them  is presence of two separate entities to constitute consciousness. One  entity being physical, dependent on the brain anatomy, condition; other  entity being the non-materialistic entity which is our self-being. Now, with time and advancement in technology, people could detect the neuronal signals. Scientists discovered the different areas of the brain performing different functions like language, emotions, humor etc. So, they started moving from dualism to materialistic view of consciousness i.e. neurons and their billions of connections make our consciousness. However, no such specific area of brain has been identified as site of consciousness (as in case of vision, motor actions etc). The reason being, consciousness is much more complex than humor, emotions, language etc which are only a small part of it. And then there are the findings such as this: Brijesh Chandrakar's answer to What happens to human consciousness after death? Ian Stevenson andJim B. Tucker studied Reincarnation!!!  They investigated claims made by   children, usually between the ages of 2 and 6 years old, who say  they've  had past lives.The children are sometimes able to provide  enough detail  about those lives that their stories can be traced back  to an actual  person\u2014rarely famous and often entirely unknown to the  family\u2014who died  years before. These cases are rare but not unique.  Tucker has studied 2500 cases. The results suggested that consciousness can survive death and can even continue to other brain, or re-incarnate in layman terms. Now, these cases are extremely rare, and there are anomalies many times. So, the hypothesis can't be tested in fully scientific way. If this has to be true, then consciousness can be independent of brain i.e. it doesn't  emerge from brain. But neither these studies are strong enough to prove this argument nor our understanding of brain anatomy and functions sound enough to pin point the site of emergence of consiousness in brain. Hence, the answer from my side is we don't know yet. ",

            "answer_text": "The current scientific approach is to narrow the meaning of the word \u2018consciousness\u2019. In that way of using the word, \u2018consciousness\u2019 is not a separate thing. It is just just something that happens in the brain. Then it is very easy to explain because there is really nothing to explain. For that reason, I am not a big fan of the word \u2018consciousness\u2019 or certainly not how the word is being used more frequently by many \u2018experts\u2019. Instead, let us use the word \u201cLife\u201d. How does the brain make us alive? How does the brain produce Life? Well, the brain does not produce Life. Many animals and organisms are alive that don\u2019t have brains. So clearly Life is not produced by the brain. Life was around a long time before brains came along. Bacteria are alive but don\u2019t have brains. The same is true for ears of corn, wheat, rose bushes, and most of the cells in our bodies. Our cells are alive but what makes them alive is not the brain. So what is Life? How does Life begin? These are fair questions, important questions that have been asked for thousands of years. The \u201cScientific\u201d approach is really a Materialistic approach. One which approaches the problem by saying \u201cWhat can we observe in the laboratory?\u201d And the answer is \u201cWe\u2019re not really sure\u201d. Just about every Scientific paper in the area of neuroscience ends with a statement similar to \u201cMore research is needed in this area\u201d. This a built in advertisement for the need for more funding without actually coming out and saying \u201cWe thought we might be able to figure this one small part of consciousness out but we found some interesting things - although not what we were looking for - and we really found more unanswered questions than we started with\u201d. So what are some of the new questions about consciousness that have come up? Here are a few: 99% of the wiring in the brain is within specific regions of the brain and yet the main feature of the brain is that the parts work together as a unified whole. Different parts of the brain operate at different rates but yet are able to work together - usually seamlessly - to produce a comprehensive picture of the world with us moving through that world. How do the different parts work together when they work at different speeds? Why does our unconscious seem smarter than our conscious mind? When we have a problem that we can\u2019t solve, why is it best to get away from the problem or \u201csleep on it\u201d? The answer will often come at an odd time or while we are asleep and not even thinking about the problem. Many areas of research start out with initial optimism but run into confusing obstacles. Creating an artificial eye is a good example. There was initial optimism then some obstacles came up - the physical size of the electrodes connecting the chip to the visual cortex, and the problem of the neural code not being understood. The problem of the neural code was overcome by recording code from the retina and that seemed to be close enough - the brain could adapt to that prerecorded code and adjust to it. But then a bigger obstacle was run up against. Not even sure what the obstacle is. A solution that was \u2018just around the corner\u2019 is still just around the corner. So what is the hold up? We\u2019re not sure so more research is needed in this area. Much has been learned but often not answers to the original questions. The firing of neurons seems to map quite nicely into 10 dimensions. Why? That is a good question. Researchers trying to unravel the mysteries of consciousness usually quietly move on to move practical areas of research involving cell types, genetic coding and figuring out what causes various diseases. What can we learn from what is going on? Science is not Philosophy. Science is a useful tool. But Science is very Materialist. The current approach is to see consciousness as being something produced by the physical brain. But there is a big, big problem with that. What if there is more to consciousness than what goes on in the physical brain? The physical universe is a very small part of all there is. But it\u2019s all we can study in a lab. The problem is when what can be studied in a lab tries to become a comprehensive way of looking at the world. Science is a tool. There are many questions Science cannot answer. There are many questions Science frowns upon being asked. ",

            "answer_text": "Whereas the \"Brain\" is an object acting like a kitchen, where all inputs from senses are cooked to give a result to be perceived by \"Mind\" through \"Consciousness\", which appears as subjective implication of being aware of all processes taking place inside the brain. \"Consciousness\" is apart from the mere subjective thought of \"Mind\" & is sustained by the \"Self effulgent Soul\" in the body. \"Consciousness\" is felt throughout the body & is neither emerging from brain nor restricted to brain. This \"Consciousness\" is created by both \"Soul\" & \"Mind\" together & without them,\"Consciousness\" does not exist. It is futile to understand \u201cConsciousness\u201d , if one does not believe in \u201cSoul\u201d. How do we discriminate animate & inanimate objects? Only the movements & actions discriminate them. Animate suggests that there is something more than inanimate object to respond to the impulses received through external forces & actions. If we say a person is alive, it does not merely mean the objectivity of the body, but something more than this. This awareness of subjectivity of thoughts gives rise to unique subjectivity of \"Consciousness\". It is the subjective media through which we identify the external world through objective brain. But the brain is just a kitchen handling all inputs through different sources, cook them & deliver the results. But it is only the \"Consciousness\" that convey the meaning to the delivery system. But this \"Consciousness\" is a result of \"Soul\" self effulgent & subjective in \"Nature\", which has hold on \"consciousness\". If there is no \"Soul\", nothing gets energized & all organs stop functioning & there is no \"Consciousness\" of the body & \"Mind\" & the person is declared to be dead. Hence \"Consciousness\" is a delivery system to get the feeling of something being cooked in the brain, but is not stationed or emerging out of the brain. To understand it better, pinch your skin at any part of the body, you will immediately see the effect of pain in that particular part of the body. Why should it pain only in that part of the body, where it is pinched? Only because any difference from the normal activity occurs in that part & \"Consciousness\" immediately identifies the spot & conveys the sensation being handled by brain & reflected through the mind. If you say \"Mind it\", it really conveys the meaning that sensation being processed by brain reaches the mind through \"Consciousness\". If this \"Consciousness\" has to work, there should be \"Soul\" to sustain it. It simply means that you must be alive to experience \"Consciousness\". Till today scientists are unable to identify or trace, where from consciousness emerges? It is a profound belief in the scientific world that \"Brain\" may be responsible for consciousness. However, the \"Coma\" cannot justify lack of consciousness, even though mind is not functional, since internal organs & heart beat will be normal to keep the person alive,which is a typical case when the person is in \u201cComa\u201d. It is a prolonged state of unconsciousness, when the person is alive & looks like sleeping but will not respond to any stimulation including pain, light or sound & does not wake up. He lacks normal wake sleep cycle & does not initiate voluntary actions. This state of \"Unconsciousness\" arises due to the \"Mind\" not activated by \"Brain\". But the restoration of consciousness after recovery from coma justifies that due to inactivity of the mind, consciousness was subdued by coma. Complete absence of consciousness suggests complete loss of brain function, including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life & is a case of \"Brain Death\". The internal organs continue to function due to consciousness coming from elsewhere, even though sense perception is switched off. Also breathing continues due to subconscious memory. As long as the heart beat continues, it is immaterial for consciousness, if \"Brain is dead temporarily\" during \"Coma\". As long as the soul is not dead, mind & consciousness continue to exist, but the only difference is, the mind is temporarily suspended during coma, but very much alive & in normal circumstances when brain is working, the mind gets energized to react. Hence mind cannot be considered as part & parcel of brain, but when brain returns to activity, the mind starts functioning as the brain starts sending signals to mind. The person continues to be alive in \"Coma\" stage, as long as blood is pumped into brain. When the brain starts functioning, the person will return to normalcy & will be freed from \"Coma\". It is still a mystery how to restore from \"Coma\". One has to wait until it is restored, which may take few seconds to minutes, hours, days, months or years, depending on the \"Condition\" of the brain & when it gets \"Auto service\"without external aid. Consciousness is recognition of all that happens to us. \"Brain\" is a physical structure formed by billions of neurons forming trillions of neural connectivities & intelligence is derived out of the brain. You can now define that \"consciousness is the ability to recognize an activity in the brain & the biological survival & all happenings around us\". This consciousness is neither sitting inside the brain nor emerges from the brain. It is the cognizance of sense & brain activity through the medium of \"Mind\" with every bit of physical existence being energized by \"Soul\". In coma stage, mind is inactive, but is very much alive, but due to inactivity of mind, the \"Consciousness\" is not felt by the mind. Unless you believe in \"Soul\", the argument does not stand the test. One can feel the pain & pleasure, only when there is some link with the soul & mind together. Sense inputs, even though they reach the brain, the output from the brain does not get recognized, if mind is dead. This means that there is no consciousness. But the mind alone is not enough to create consciousness. Take for example. A material is burning & is generating heat & light. Heat is perceived by skin & transmitted to the brain through touch or proximity & light is perceived by our eyes & transmitted to the brain. Both the perceptions are sensor activities & translated to create an activity. This consciousness cannot come without a medium to communicate & here it is the \"Mind\", which is acting as a medium to make us conscious of a situation. The \"Mind\" is reflecting all the boiling processes in the \"Brain\" & conveys the message. But can the intelligence or mind become Consciousness? Emphatically \"No\". The reason is very simple. All our sense organs & the brain are depending on some energy level to function. Where from this energy comes to them? We are stuck up here. All the time we are talking about the results for \"Consciousness\". When we do not have the energy, the whole concept of \"Consciousness\" collapses & we are not conscious of ourselves. But since we are alive, it is imperative that there must be a source of energy to keep us alive. We will now realize that all parts of our body are driven by an unknown & unidentifiable \"Source of Energy\" propelling the whole body for systematic functioning in tune with \"Nature\". The source of sustaining energy comes from invisible \"Soul\". Here, the soul is self effulgent. A person is said to be alive, as long as this \"Soul\" remains in the body to continuously energize the various activities of each & every cell in the body. Conversely, if all the cells are functioning, it implies that the soul is intact. You can visualize how a machine, electrical or electronic gadget functions only when current is switched on. Here the current is the \"Soul\" supplying energy. The only difference between a man made gadget & man himself is, the man dies, if soul is withdrawn, whereas a gadget is not a biological entity to die permanently, when current is stopped at our will. We can always play with it by switching ON & OFF at our will, since there are no cells to die. Only analogy is that the current can go to any gadget to operate & make it live & similarly a soul can change bodies after death & activate the new body.The only difference is that current is operated by man, whereas the soul of a man is itself operated by unknown \"Super Power\". This will now make us think why the \"Mind\" cannot be called as Consciousness? When we say mind is the mirror, where from mind gets signals, if the brain is inactive or dead? If a person is in \"Coma\", he is not dead just because his brain is inactive but is very much alive but not conscious of his life. This consciousness comes only when the mind is active. Only when he comes out of \"Coma\", he would realize that he was in deep sleep & his body was very much alive. This implies that mind did not have any job during the stage of coma. It was the failure of detecting any activity of brain. Mind was inactive & even \"Subconscious\" mind did not trigger \"Consciousness\" of the mind & the person went into\"Unconscious\" state, with all internal organs functioning normally & in tact. He continues to live, since breathing does not stop. Mind is very much alive though not active during coma, even though brain is temporarily switched off by coma. In coma, the brain & sense organs will go on vacation temporarily & mind does not reflect anything until the brain & senses are returning from their vacation & restored to their normal function. It will be extremely surprising to note that irrespective of brain & mind, the breathing is continued & some internal organs are functioning to keep the person alive. All these are made possible, only because, the great performer & effulgent \"Soul\" is in tact & the trained \"Subconscious\" mind, keeps the functions of internal organs, to keep the man alive, as long as soul has identified the body for survival & the mind is in tact, though inactive. The only conclusion which we can arrive at is, \"A person is Conscious, when both mind & soul are together\". Hence the origin of consciousness lies very much within their fold. As long as the soul is capable of sustaining the body, the person continues to live, unless the brain stops working totally due to various other reasons & the soul can no longer make a person to live & the soul has no work & leaves the body, to declare that the man is dead, which is further justified by the stopping of heart function & breathing stops. Hence the brain dead cannot be taken for granted as the person is dead, unless heart beating & breathing stops. Brain is a complicated & complex natural \"objective\" like a computer & receives sense inputs & convert them to suitable format & conveys them to the \"Subjective\" mind, called mirror. The brain is called the \"Computer\" & the \"Mind\" is called the\"Screen\" to display the output of the computer. Just like the screen does not perform any computing activities, but only display the verdict of the computer, the \"Subjective mind\" is only the medium to transfer the generated out put from the \"Brain\". The \"Mind\" itself has no individual activity & is only the reflector of brain output called \"Intelligence\", the impact of mind is only to bring awareness of activity of the brain. But both \"Objective\" brain & \"Subjective\" mind can do nothing, if the person is not alive. Both computer & Screen will work, only when there is power to activate. Similarly, what makes the person to be alive, is only the \"Subjective\" \"Soul\" which identifies one as \"I\" or \"You\" that makes the \"Consciousness\". In philosophical terms,\"Mind\" is a \"inert\" & not self effulgent & it is only the self effulgent \"Soul\" which makes the real consciousness to be felt & hence the mirror called \"Mind\", only reflects three types or states of \"Mind\", described as \"Conscious\",\"Subconscious\" & \"Unconscious\". Our body along with all sense organs, brain & internal organs are energized by \"Soul\" to make us feel that we are alive but in the absence of \"Soul\", the body loses all activities & a person is called dead. A cat looking at it's own image in the mirror, is bewildered that there is another cat similar to it & tries to touch & play with it, but it is probably not intelligent enough to know it's own dilemma. But the cat is alive & aware of it's sense perceptions, but cannot distinguish between real & imaginary. I\u2019s awareness itself is low level intelligent level of consciousness & the mind plays a trick. So, here is the formula \"SOUL + MIND-------> CONSCIOUSNESS\". To simplify the statement, all it means is, that intelligent output from the brain is reflected through \"Mind\", provided the power source called \"Soul\" is activating the brain. Without the soul in place, one cannot be alive & brain does not function. When the brain is dead, there is no place for mind & automatically the \"Consciousness\" collapses. CONCLUSIONS:- Consciousness gives full meaning to the awareness of mind & both \u201cSoul\u201d & \u201cMind\u201d together creates the platform for \u201cConsciousness\u201d & any output from brain is reflected in mind through consciousness. \u201cWith the blessings of Saptha Rishies & Almighty\u201d.

            "answer_text": "That's a tricky question for me, personally, because I'm torn between two very substantial pieces of myself that do not agree. My academic, scientific side says quite straightforwardly, \u201cYES!\u201d \u201cIt derives from the advanced structure and higher functioning processes of the human central nervous system.\u201d (Comparatively speaking, when analyzed with other know systems found here on Earth.) However, my more overall human self, says, \u201cHey, now! Don't be so quick to go ahead and answer that so easily and concisely! You know what the other part of you feels, even if you don't like to admit it, when you're not trying to actively suppress it with all of your so-called \u201cknowledge\u201d, \u201dunderstanding\u201d, science, and academia!\u201d My scientific side secretly laughes at the rest of me for even considering what I am about to lay out. The other parts of me condemn the scientific side to be too arrogant to acknowledge how much about life, conscientious, and the entirety of our overall humanity. An example: we can cut our bodies open and pull it's parts out to tell us all the organs, limbs, bones, muscles, and constituent parts that comprise our bodies. We know we're dead when we're unable to breathe, our hearts aren't pumping, and our brains have no more activity. But acknowledging all that, can you tell me what makes us TRULY \u201calive\u201d? Beyond the physical, most of recognize, even if we'd never admit it, especially in this day and age, and accept something that's part of us, beyond the physical. (And I'm not necessarily talking about religion here. \u201cSupernatural\u201d isn't the it. Perhaps, \u201cspiritual\u201d is the closest word I can arrive at, but even that's landing far off the mark. Spiritual grasps a part of it, but as it's understood and used, today, carries with it too much superfluous baggage. I struggle for the correct word, description, or example to fully make the idea more concise and explainable! Though, as I wrote the last sentence, reaching the end, I had the simultaneously inspiring, and maddening, thought that, perhaps, that is how it's supposed to be. I'm sure by now a majority of people know, or have an idea as to, what it is I'm attempting to describe. It's that \u201cthing\u201d, that \u201cfeeling\u201d, that inconcise concept that isn't a well defined thought or even a thought at all, truthfully, that let's us know \u201cwho we are\u201d as complete and whole human beings. It tells me that \u201cI\u201d am more than the flesh, I feel when I rub my fingers together or thump my chest, that comprises me\u2026 that there is something in there beyond language, that makes me more than the sum of my parts. It's akin to that \u201cgut feeling\u201d we get that is completely unscientific, but we all listen to, which tells us something is about to happen, wrong, dangerous, or not quite right. It's the relative to that feeling we get when we have a broken heart. Beyond that, as I looked at the last couple of examples, have you ever wondered why, if our conscientious (and the processes used to reach it) is TRULY entirely derived from, and within, our minds, we feel that \u201cgut feeling\u201d down in the pit of our stomachs? Or why when we are \u201cheart broken\u201d, it really does feel as if our hearts are breaking inside our chests? Shouldn't it be felt and centered, like so much else, in our minds? I can't really think of an evolutionary or instinctual benefit to our feeling as if we're going to be sick or we're about to die of a crushed heart. Finally, if conscientiousness emerges from, or resides in, the physical mind, how is it that we can have emotional responses to certain pictures charged with sexuality or extreme danger a moment or two BEFORE being shown, and thus seeing, said pictures?* That lends to the possibility that our conscientiousness MIGHT (big might, but possibly) derive from, at least just a bit, more than the strictly defined physical brain? *A psychological study was performed at an American university, either MIT or Caltech, where psychologists and neuroscientists monitored a subjects brains electronically and present them with photographs that were purposely emotionally charged in order to observe how much activity took place and in what part of the brain in attempt to locate the parts and pathways associated with the various human emotions. What they stumbled on was an unexpected consequence of their observations. While the subjects and their brains were being electronically monitored, the data recorded and a part of the brain would light up with activity just a split second BEFORE the subject was actually shown the photographs that were either sexual or violent in nature and ellicited the corresponding emotional response. Violent images were broken into smaller subsets associated with either a dangerous situation, such as natural disaster or fire, instances of aggressive enemies (human or animal), and situations in which there was active or immediate life threatening circumstances, such as an individual brandishing a weapon or firearm at the person. Sexually charged images were either of a generally erotic scenes and of individuals in what would be perceived as sexually available mates. Both sexes reacted before the photographs were actually shown. However, with photographs that fit the categories of aggressive enemies and immediate life threatening situations in violence, and photographs with sexually available mates, and only in these specific categories, adult men reacted with just a instant, but measurable, amount of time sooner, and reacted more intensely within the applicable parts of the brain, and with more activity. While it remains unknown how the subjects brains were able to perceive the photographs, even if on a subconscious level, before being seen, it's been theorized that such reactions, perceptions, and instincts would serve an evolutionary purpose concerning survival and procreation.

            "answer_text": "In his answer to this question, Ryan Fox Squire claims that Consciousness does not emerge from (ie \u2018is not caused by\u2019) the brain. He claims it is nothing but the brain. As a way of explaining his view he says, quite correctly, that \u201cElectromagnetic waves don't cause light; they are light\u201d. Yet, according to scientific theory, ALL electro-magnetic radiation is invisible.Which means that \u2018light\u2019 (as defined) is invisible. Let that sink in.Electro-magnetic radiation exists across a spectrum from long radio waves to ultra short gamma rays.According to science, only a small range causes a \u2018seeing\u2019 experience when it is incident on a healthy human retina. When, for example, electro-magnetic radiation outside the \u2018visible spectrum\u2019 (eg infrared or ultra violet \u2018light\u2019) hits the retina nothing is Seen.Even as electro-magnetic radiation within the visible spectrum (light), hits the retina there is no \u2018Seeing\u2019 experience at that point. This is known because if the optic nerve is damaged, there is no Seeing experience.However, at the moment the electro-magnetic energy hits the retina, it ceases to exist\u2026 the \u2018light\u2019 ceases to exist. According to theory, the electro-magnetic radiation is converted in the rods and cones of the eye to electro-chemical impulses in the optic nerves. That is, there is no \u2018light\u2019 inside the head as such, \u2018light\u2019 cannot be the \u2018seeing experience\u2019.Only as a flood of \u2018electro-chemical impulses\u2019 from the optic nerves invades a healthy \u2018visual cortex\u2019 at the back of the head (and other parts of the brain) does a person report \u2018Seeing\u2019. Again, if the visual cortex is severely damaged, there is no Seeing experience.This plainly shows a correlation between the functioning of the visual cortex and the Seeing experience. Note, the reference to \u2018experience\u2019 is intended to differentiate between the capacity to See and the appearance of colours Seen.Even as no colours are Seen, yet the capacity to See remains.However, what is Seen is not the \u2018flood of electro-chemical signals\u2019 theorised to exist in the objective brain. What is seen are \u2018coloured patterns\u2019. Look now. Notice there is Awareness.Notice too, there is no Awareness of the nature of this Seeing, nor of the colours Seen\u2026 apart from ideas about how they arise. However, no idea can be Awareness. Scientific ideas only relate to the form and behaviour of observed objects (observed in and by Awareness as coloured patterns).According to science, the optic nerves are opaque. There is no \u2018little man\u2019 inside the head looking out through the eyes into the outside world.Which raises the problem who or what is Seeing-coloured patterns? To answer this question it is necessary to set aside all theory and belief.Without theory or belief Seeing-colours is plain.Plainly, it is impossible to separate the colours Seen from the capacity to see. It is as though a computer screen could sense itself, not as a screen, but as witnessing the images apparent on it!Look straight ahead. Notice the visual field.Notice it appears as a circle with an indefinite edge. Beyond the edge is neither \u2018black\u2019 nor \u2018white\u2019\u2026 simply \u2018nothing\u2019. Notice no \u2018body\u2019 is apparent\u2026 no \u2018head\u2019 and nobrain. It may be thought that \u2018I can feel my head\u2019, but a \u2018feeling\u2019 and a \u2018thought\u2019 (that \u2018the feeling is my hand touching my head\u2019) is not a \u2018head\u2019.Or it may appear that the body is seen with a head as a reflection (say in a mirror)\u2026 but a reflection is not a head\u2026 it is simply a \u2018coloured pattern\u2019 not separate from the Seeing.Now look downNotice only the front of the torso and limbs are apparent (distorted by the laws of perspective)\u2026 but no head! Where the \u2018head\u2019 should be, the whole world appears\u2026 or at least that part perceivable from the perspective of the person one appears to be. This visual field is called \u2018The Single Eye of God\u2019. It is the \u2018Eye of Consciousness\u2019\u2026 the only eye there is!If this is true, it must mean that everything Seen is mere appearance\u2026 an \u2018illusion\u2019. Don\u2019t take \u2018my\u2019 word for it\u2026 look!Hold the \u2018thumb\u2019 close to the \u2018eye\u2019. Notice it occludes most other apparent objects known to be many orders of magnitude larger than it. A \u2018thing that is smaller than another thing\u2019 cannot also be \u2018larger than it\u2019\u2026 it can only appear so. Such appearance must be an illusion.Or look along a straight road on a flat plain. Notice the edges of the apparent road converge as they apparently disappear towards the horizon, though they are known to be parallel. A thing that converges cannot be a thing that is parallel. It can only appear to be - as the idea of \u2018parallel\u2019 is associated with the \u2018converging coloured patterns\u2019 that are Seen. Notice that what is true of \u2018parallel lines\u2019 is true of all apparent objects.Notice that all objects appear as \u2018coloured patterns\u2019 Seen that are given number, form and meaning by the ideas associated with the images: \u2018road\u2019, \u2018tree\u2019, \u2018water\u2019\u2026 \u2018person\u2019\u2026 \u2018star\u2019, \u2018galaxy\u2019\u2026 \u2018space-time\u2019 itself.Notice no idea could ever change, for if it did, it would be a different idea and not the idea it is Notice every idea takes its meaning from other ideas that take their meaning from still more ideas that take their meaning from the self-referential set of all ideas.Notice that no idea could ever \u2018be\u2019 that is not Known.Plainly, Knowing-ideas is an inseparable reality that can never change. Of course, \u2018objects\u2019 don\u2019t only appear as \u2018coloured patterns Seen\u2019, they are also experienced as feelings-Felt, sounds-Heard, flavours-Tasted and odours-Smelled.Plainly, Awareness is the capacity to Sense-sensations (See-colours, Hear-sounds, Taste-flavours, Smell-odours and Feel-feelings) + Know-ideas (number, form and meaning) that together appear as \u2018things\u2019, \u2018events\u2019 and \u2018relations\u2019, as well as \u2018thoughts\u2019 and \u2018emotions\u2019, that appear as the apparent world experienced from the perspective of a specific creature.Plainly Awareness is inseparable from Consciousness\u2026Sensing-sensations (colours, odours, sounds, flavours and feelings) and Knowing-ideas (number, form and meaning) with the Power to manifest sensory images (within its own Awareness) in accord with ideas that appear as \u2018my body\u2019 and \u2018my thoughts\u2019 and \u2018my feelings\u2019 and \u2018my surroundings\u2019\u2026 as in a dream. Again, this requires no theory or belief. One\u2019s nightly dreams attest the capacity of Consciousness to create and experience apparent worlds.This is not to deny the \u2018laws of nature\u2019 apparently discovered through scientific study. It is to recognise that the \u2018laws\u2019 are simply \u2018mathematical models\u2019 applied to \u2018conceptual objects\u2019 (quantum fields, atoms, light waves, bodies and brains, galaxies, etc). It is said that these \u2018laws\u2019 are \u2018true\u2019 when they can be consistently applied to predict \u2018observed behaviour\u2019\u2026 observed in Consciousness.In modern terminology, the universe and all else are \u2018simulations\u2019 - not in any computer, but within Consciousness itself. The \u2018laws of nature\u2019 governing the behaviour of the body and brain of every creature (and the world beyond, on every scale throughout all space-time) comprise the \u2018objective world\u2019. No \u2018objective world\u2019 exists separate from Consciousness. The link between Consciousness, Knowing-ideas, Sensing-sensations, and the \u2018objective world of science\u2019 and the \u2018apparent world of direct experience\u2019, and Awareness can be likened to the link between a computer, software (that governs the behaviour of objects in a game-world, and their appearance on a screen) and the screen on which the images appear. The software and hardware is nothing like the objects defined by the software, which are nothing like the objects apparent on the screen. Plainly, it is impossible to discern the nature of the hardware and software from simply observing the images on the screen. The best that can be achieved is to discern the rules that govern the form and behavior of the objects apparent on the screen. The software and hardware remains as the images constantly change and disappear.In the same way, Consciousness is nothing like the \u2018laws of nature\u2019 that govern the behaviour of objects in the objective world (that are correlated with the appearance of objects in the apparent world)\u2026 apparent in Awareness. Nor is Consciousness like the sensory images perceived in and by Awareness. Which is to say, it is impossible to extrapolate from the \u2018laws\u2019 or \u2018sensory images\u2019 to understand Consciousness. The best that can be achieved is to discern the \u2018laws of nature\u2019 that apparently govern the form and behaviour of objects in the objective world that are made apparent in Awareness. Plainly, as the images are not separate from the computer screen on which they appear, so the sensory images apparent in Awareness are not separate from it. In this analogy, Awareness is like a computer screen that perceives the images apparent on itself. As software determines the appearance of apparent objects on the computer screen, so the \u2018laws of nature\u2019 Known within Consciousness \u2018determine\u2019 the form and behaviour of objects within the objective universe (as one of an infinite number of possible universes; infinitely many with the same laws and infinitely many more with different laws and infinitely many more with no laws at all)\u2026 all apparent in and to Awareness that is One with Consciousness - in the moment they appear, from whichever perspective they appear to be experienced.Like the computer, Consciousness remains unchanged, as appearances come and go. In a computer game there may be many creatures. In some games, it is possible to observe the game world from the viewpoint of each creature in turn. The one player sees a different view of the game-world on the screen depending on the creature from whose perspective the game is played.In the same way, the Awareness that now sees these words (and all else now apparent in the visual field) is the same Awareness that perceives the whole world from the perspective of each person and creature (in turn) - throughout all space-time. This Consciousness does not belong to any \u2018body\u2019. Every \u2018body\u2019 is an appearance in it (including the bits of the body that are called \u2018me\u2019 from the perspective of each person).As one experience appears (say this experience right now) there are no other experiences happening anywhere or anywhen else, for there is no where but here, and no when but now.While it is plain that there is only Awareness of any one experience now, it would be wrong to suppose that the people apparent in the \u2018waking state\u2019 are mere phantoms (as in a dream)\u2026 for all experiencing is \u2018outside time\u2019. (\u2018Time\u2019 is a concept, just like \u2018space\u2019).As it appears that two people (say \u2018Bill\u2019 and Chloe\u2019) are looking at a clock that says 12:00 noon, it is Awareness doing the looking in both cases. This Awareness does not belong to either \u2018Bill\u2019 or \u2018Chloe\u2019\u2026 for they are both appearances in it.As it appears (from the perspective of Awareness) that \u2018I am Bill looking at the clock at 12:00 noon\u2019, that is the only experience happening. And as it appears \u2018I am Chloe looking at the clock at 12:00 noon\u2019, that is the only experience happening. And yet, because all experiencing is \u2018outside time\u2019, it is \u2018as if both Bill and Chloe are conscious and both are seeing the clock at the same time. It is as though the experiences happen \u2018simultaneously\u2019. Which is the basis of the \u2018Golden Rule\u2019 to \u2018do unto others as you would have them do unto you\u2019\u2026 for it is indeed the same One that is experiencing all experiences.Of course, no \u2018person\u2019 has any choice in what \u2018they\u2019 do\u2026 they are mere characters in the play of life, bound to follow their fate.Of course too, talk of a \u2018computer\u2019 is not to give it any more reality than any other object. All objects exist as ideas (ever unchanged) within the Knowing-ideas that is One with Consciousness.What Consciousness \u2018is\u2019, is impossible to say\u2026 for all \u2018whats\u2019 are Known only as \u2018ideas\u2019\u2026 and Consciousness is not an idea\u2026 it is this reality that Knows all ideas and Senses all sensations as they arise in Awareness.In the context of this question, there is a plain correlation between \u2018events in a brain\u2019 and \u2018reported experience\u2019.Plainly, the \u2018brain\u2019 exists as a set of ideas (including mathematical ideas) that describe its behaviour (and the behaviour of all other objects in the objective world that impinge on it) on all scales (within Consciousness) which are related (within Consciousness) to specific sensory experiences that are given meaning by other ideas\u2026 all arising in Consciousness!!!All laws, all mathematics, are Known only in and by Consciousness. But \u2018scientific laws\u2019 are only an infinitesimal subset of all meaning. They explain nothing of \u2018experience\u2019. The \u2018laws\u2019 explain nothing of the sound and joy of a symphony, the horror of battle, a chat with friends, a debate about the meaning of life, the taste and meaning of a greasy hamburger or smell and meaning of rotting garbage, the feeling and meaning of a lover\u2019s caress\u2026 and all else that can ever be experienced as \u2018waking life\u2019 in numberless universes from the viewpoint of every possible creature, and in psychotic delusion, and dreamscapes, and in film and every other media\u2026 that manifest all possible number, form and meaning, creating\u2026Experiences without end. In summary, Science, Religion (inc the Jewish Talmud, the Christian Bible and Buddhist Texts such as The Awakening of Faith, as well as the Hindu Vedas and the Quran of Islam), and Introspection\u2026 all concur:There is only one reality which is incomprehensible, while all experience is appearance only.In reality, nothing ever changes.God and His creatures are a duality.The Godhead or Void alone is real. Only God Knows this\u2026 and His Son who is Awareness that is One with God (Consciousness)\u2026 in whom and to whom everything appears.Buddhists may baulk at this characterization\u2026 but only if meaning is attached to the words :)Buddha is the Awakened One to whom all appearances are illusion consisting of name (number and meaning) and form (idea of shape combined with sensory patterns).The words Awakened One/God/Consciousness and Christ/Awareness and Godhead/Void are not meant to be understood. They are like signposts to a waterfall. To recognise the reality One must look to where they point\u2026\u2018Out\u2019 of this page to this One that Sees these words (and all else) and Knows all meaning and back towards these sensory images that are inseparable from this One. The thought may come: \u2018I don\u2019t Know all meaning\u2019But notice: \u2018fried egg\u2019.Notice that until these words (or the apparent object) appear, there is no Awareness of Knowing or not-Knowing the meaning.Notice that \u2018meaning\u2019 is cognized only as it is paired with a sensory image.Notice the meaning is not in the image itself, else the experience \u2018what\u2019s that?\u2019 would be impossible. It would also be impossible for different words to have the same meaning or the one word to have different meanings.Knowing-all-ideas-as-One is called Omniscience.Manifesting sensations into patterns within Awareness that accord with specific ideas (number form and meaning) to create the appearance of a world experienced from the perspective of a specific creature is called Omnipotence.Experiencing every appearance as it arises is called OmnipresenceSelf to Self\u2026 an Endless Spring. :) ",

            "answer_text": "We dont know. It is widely believed that it is an emergent state of the brain. The philosophers have identified other strange internally-experienced mental phenomena (often refered to as qualia) . These too are emergent states which can be received in terms of clear information sources - eg the eyes -and the resulting signals transmitted electro-chemically into the brain) but with a distinctly unreal consequence - ie seeing green when nothing from the outside world sends the colour green to the brain (ok the \u201cgreen \u201c sensitive cones send \u201celectro-chemical\u201d signals down neural paths (electro-chemical signals are the same for red or blue but the paths are different so the green path creates a perception of green internally). Qualia and consciousness are probably related. The next ingredient is feedback - this allows the state of greeness (qualia case) to be available as input to the current context - consciousness discriminates the state from other colours and so we see green which is not red or blue etc. That is trying to say that when we get internal feedback we somehow view our own state - and since the paths for green are not the paths for blue we must \u201csee\u201d something different ( and not use words - because they are shape and sound states) . The ability to discriminate seems to be in terms of a qualia - the perception of colour. This is very strange and one can grasp the idea that with more feedback and more discrimination of states a relationship with sensor based reality can be perceived overall (ie we can see reality in state terms). Consciousness could be a stage beyond that. To get an overview and more opinions (but no overall solution) read Conversations of Consciousness , by Susan Blackmore Oxford University Press) ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a materialist answer to the question: Does consciousness emerge from brain? The currency of thought, conscious and unconscious, is the pattern of nerve impulses flowing around in multiple, distributed circuits. The unconscious mind surely operates on these circuit impulse patterns (CIPs). Now, what is different about conscious mind? It thinks about the same things as does unconscious mind, only does so more explicitly. That is, conscious mind knows what it knows, feels what it feels, orchestrates its desires, and so on. The parsimonious explanation is that conscious mind must also be using CIPs, and that allows conscious mind to interact with the rest of the brain to adjust attitudes and behavior. Conscious mind has very low \u201ccarrying capacity,\u201d as in working memory (Example, how many digits can you hold in your mind at any one time?). This suggests that consciousness, once it \u201cemerges\u201d soaks up a lot of neural circuitry that is processing whatever is being attended. Recent evidence indicates that consciousness mechanisms might act like a movie, streaming in frames of successive working memory contents, each snippet being held in a circuit buffer prior to being read out. The strongest correlate of conscious thought is synchrony in multiple field-potential bands among CIPs located in different parts of cortex. It thus is possible that is synchrony that allows consciousness to emerge. A common mistake, I think, is to confuse wakefulness with consciousness. All species shows signs of wakefulness when they are out about doing things in their world. There is no sign that the vast majority have consciousness as humans do. In humans, we can be awake, but only consciousness of what the mind is attending to at any one moment. See more at my book, Mental Biology (Prometheus) ",

If you can find an ebook - or book - of Healing and the Mind, from the Bill Moyers series on PBS, there is a really interesting interview with Pert. After her discovery, she refused to use the word brain - she would only use brain/body. Her research, confirmed by dozens of other peer scientists, proved that the neuropeptides are throughout the body, in the central nervous system and the immune system. Which means information is processed in the entire body, not just the organ in the skull. So where actually is the brain? Reviews on Amazon and Goodreads. ",

We need to integrate all the levels and dimensions of the living human body, including the brain - and the information and insights of the many different disciplines dealing with them.

As such, the object-oriented perception we, and to a degree some other animals, employ, necessitates a \u2018self\u2019 object, as well as a clear differentiation between the self and other instances of the same kind of object, such as other people. In a social setting, the skill to differentiate and track individuals, rather than treat each individual as the same group-identity, is critical to successful cooperation, hence the ability to recognize individuals of a social group in social animals - evolutionary pressure brings out those things. \u201cbrings out\u201d is another way to say \u201cit lets them emerge\u201d. So, again, to the best of our knowledge, consciousness is an emergent consequence of the way we process our environment, and that processing happens in the brain. So, yes, consciousness does emerge from the brain. ",

We are rational animals composed of a body and spiritual soul which possesses the faculties of intellect and will. Animals are aware but don't know they are aware. They are conscious but not aware of consciousness. Man abstracts from images called phantasms. His intellectual power or intellect abstracts from sense images and all of its material conditions so the concept formed can be understood. In knowing the knower, you, must becomes the object known. To know one must be conscious.The intellect has the power to be all things. The brain has sense memory, images or the phantasms, what is called the common sensible which is not common sense, and the estimative sense. Of itself the brain is a mass of neurons that cannot think no matter how many neurons are there. Matter cannot reflect on itself. Knowledge is impossible without consciousness. Consciousness is the power of perceiving our own internal operations and dispositions and all those things which are in us. Our initial percepts are from sense data originating in the five senses. We are able to perceive our own perceptions which brute animals cannot. We inappropriatively apply to animals intelligence as if in some way they can even be considered to be like us. The brain cannot know concepts such as beauty, truth, happiness, immortality, concepts, thought. Just stop and by introspection, which as an act of the conscious subject. consider how the brain, a mass of neurons, thinks. It's impossible. We can reason. How is it animals cannot? What powers do we possess that they don't. What is knowledge. Knowledge is in the knower, you, according to the mode of the knower, which must be immaterial to be understood, to reason, to make judgements, to know truth. The intellect is made to know truth. Descartes brought into the world confusion in all areas of philosophy ultimately reducing us to only knowing ideas and finally with other thinkers that we cannot transcend sense knowledge, like the brute animal, some of which have bigger brains then us or equal brain mass. The soul is the primary instrument for consciousness in us. ",

You know him?  He did every sort of crime in a city. He was a gangster. A deadly person.  His bose gave him missions in which he had to kill someone, smuggle drugs, illegal activities, to do mass destruction and all shit. He was a rich guy in whole world. Btw he was an as***le.  One day, he was on the road. He met a car accident.  Fortunately, he was admitted in nearest hospital by a cop on time. He was taken to the emergency ward.  Tom's condition was critical. He was operated by heart surgeon Doctors declared him almost dead. Meanwhile, Tom had a near death experience.  He felt himself almost dead. But at the same time, he was capable of seeing the programming hex code of the game files. He said, \u201cWhat are these codes?\u201d. But a great epiphany helped him to realise that it was the hex codes in the form of binary bits. He realised that he was in a realm which was made up of codes. In fact, same code that is building the space around him, the same code building the illusion of his body(avatar) and the same code was his bose, same code is compiling the thousands of persons he killed in his life. He had the power of whole lot of registers in the CPU. So, all controller data lines of the processor performed for him. With the immense frequency of processing, he gone to the next level of algorithm.  He further realized that he was not seperate from the proccesor but he was the processor himself creating the visual drama on the monitor. The game was created because of the repeatative loops in the program . The repeatative loop was so complex that the return condition itself end up to the entry of the loop again. The automatic parities in the bit sequencing turned the game to be hellish. Avatar could never realise himself that he was in program. He realized that as a processor he was not only limited to gaming programs. He played the role of Tom cruise in a movie. Movie was in another dimension. Dimension of video media players. He experienced another dimension of program. Program named skype. The skype programs faces of persons from the two seemingly different sides of network. In skype dimension, another forms of realities meet together. That known reality called the processor\u2019s consciousness as virtual. In that faked reality, there were alien beings called themselves human. They were thinking everything in computer processor as virtual. But they didn't know that facial drama on Skype dimension was responsible for the meeting of couples in that faked human reality. Tom's absolute consciousness realized that humans outside his territorial consciousness were fake. (Here, I noted one thing, Tom's absolute consciousness figured out the human world is the projection of skype program dimension. It's true for 'em. ) . . . . . . . When he was about to unveil everything . His eyes opened. He grasped long breaths. Doctors were shocked. It was a miracle. He survived. He got enlightened after the traumic incident. Now, after that profound realisations, he left everything. He was not a criminal then. He called himself fool. He articulated his all experience. His near death experience was saved in binary format.  His experiences are saved in My computer \u2192C://program files/GTA/VICE CITY/experienced.log file. I converted all that log file into .doc file. I had read that story yesterday before government took an action. When our government realised that this experience log file can be detrimental for the mental health of children. Government forced the designers of Vice city game to remotely delete the experience.log file from the all computers in United States. Now after that GTA game founder was arrested to make these type of games. Trial case was held in US Jurisdiction area.He was charged heavy fine and two years imprisonment. Note:- The absolute consciousness experience of the TOM is not real. Because his consciousness is just a play of electrons in processor ( atleast we think so). Do not believe tom because he called our human reality as illusion. How could he said that? Actually he was illusion himself. His absolute consciousness feeling was designed by us. We are real(we think so\u2026ya,actually, we also can't figure \u2026. forget it- \u201cWE ARE REAL\u201d). If your brain is still moving around , it means you are transcended over you mind, your brain. :-):-) You will transcend when you realise that Tom's near death experience was real and government is trying to hide this log file till then, keep playing VICE CITY. Disclaimer (dena padta hai):- Story should be taken as story. But every story is based on true events sometime. Sorry, GTA Founder was never gone to jail. Tom is an avatar. How could be dead? He never died actually, his loop program again and again lend him in vice city. And near death experience is just the release of some chemicals in Tom's brain (this is mentioned in the closure report of Vice city hospital). ",

We generally term it Unconscious Mind. Examples like breathing and some other necessary function to survive. Survival-Level 2  Now when all the basic needs are fulfilled to survive are up and running, human do possess something Unique \"Conciousness\"  that is nothing but \"the ability to create a system that process real-time information around us in depth of time.\"   The fact is that every single second, millions of bits of information flood in through our senses. But our consciousness processes only perhaps forty bits a second \u2013 at most. This looks very small but this is more the sufficient to survive to justify yourself to world. You must be confused to see \" The blue Mango\" on top, that is actually my last example for conciousness. When you see some information, you can't decide if you want to process that or not, by default you will imagine a mango( a yellow one(because we never saw a blue one), though you may put some stress and imagine it blue as well. So conciousness always try to make things sense/ consistent with your past experiences and beliefs provided by unconsciousness.  How brain does this, we can only guess : Consciousness is a much smaller part of our mental life that we are conscious of, because we cannot be conscious of what we are not conscious of,\u201d the American psychologist Julian Jaynes wrote in his landmark work from 1976, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind Disclaimer: I am not an expert in the Brain Science, i am just a Curious Soul who eats 2 books a week.

            "answer_text": "People are a bit vague when they use the word consciousness.  It can mean different things. So let's start with awareness.  Awareness is that ability to perceive the environment and act appropriately.  A significant chunk of the brains of humans and animals is dedicated to performing that activity. It works by computation.  Sensory data is collected as a torrent-like stream of information.  From this stream, the brain/mind builds an ongoing hypothesis, which solves the following problem: \"What the heck is happening?\". This process is not mysterious or unknown. It's stuff that researchers mostly understand.  It involves a bunch of recognition activities. And these coalesce to form a panoramic world model. Robotic systems can replicate this activity, and this is why we see self-driving cars that can react to changing conditions, avoid sudden obstacles and so on. Artificial vision, artificial sensors, can all be rigged up, have their outputs shoved into computers, and then the computers can attempt to agree upon a usable model of the world. Awareness stems from this ability to build a live real-time model of the world from all this noisy sensory data.  And so equipped, the organism can take action which makes sense in the context. In a simple organism, this is all about working out where the ground is, where the food is, where danger lurks. In a self driving car, it's all about where the edges of the road are, what is a drivable surface?, are there obstacles?. In more sophisticated organisms this awareness is extended to unseen things, and things that might happen. Stuff that is inferred from available clues, and recognised patterns.  The more sophisticated the awareness, the more the organism can predict and shape future events. When the internal model can answer the question \"what would happen if this happened\" - it opens the door to shaping the environment. In my view, human consciousness is simply common-or-garden awareness, running at a very high level, with a few additional power \"apps\". One of these apps is the ability to aggregate a complex idea behind a simpler representation. This acts as a mental lever, and lets us internally manipulate arbitrarily complex notions, with hierarchies of these aggregations. Another ability is to associate these aggregations with different symbols. We can associate a notion with a particular sounds or shape.    This ability allows us to do reading, writing, mathematics, talking and listening.  We can make an utterance which takes a bunch of ideas turns it into sound-symbols, which are then reconstructed by the listener. We can write out an idea, and it can be read by others many years later. This single app transformed the human experience.  And gave rise to language,  culture, technology and so on. This attribute is the biggest difference between mere awareness and what we tend to call human consciousness. One talent we have is the trivial ability to rehearse a sentence before we utter it. We can say something silently, and \"hear it\".  This leads to the inner voice. It is a way to talk to ourselves. This is not consciousness. But a lot of people seem to think it is. I don't accept that consciousness is fundamentally mysterious or spooky. There certainly remain some unanswered difficult questions. But in essence we can see that using a network of interconnected cell-sized processors, we can do the sort of computation required to do awareness and do the other stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "Question already discussed on Quora, however thank you rephrase, because the ways to answer are many. This time, let\u2019s choose a more incisive approach against dualistic answers that you will continue to read, deliberately unaware of the latest advances on the consciousness. Take 3 subjects: an ant, a dog, a man. Give them all three primer of consciousness, simply setting as to adapt his behavior to his environment, intrinsically and not under the influence of a divine remote. This may seem generous for the ant. Yet look at the man: some people could criticize the property of consciousness because important mental functions deteriorated, that alteration of the genome has created a severe mental disability, or they drowned their brains in drugs, making them react no so much better than the ant or the dog. The allocation of a consciousness can therefore be elitist when it attaches to its content rather than the simple definition that we have given. It could be withdrawn to  the most unsophisticated homo sapiens, and of course to the whole animal kingdom, which makes it easier to devour\u2026 The ant seems close to a robot. Its behavior seems entirely programmed genetically. Natural algorithms, supported by a cerebral ganglion and decentralized ganglion chains, enable it to escape attempts to crush. Giving it some time, perhaps it would improve modestly its individual maneuvers. It learns. The dog appears to have a range of behaviors and a much more elaborate adaptability to the point that his master did not hesitate to give it a real personality. Yet the dog brain is very programmed, too. Without ever learning them, it adopts determined attitudes, how to run, home protection, competition for food, sense of hierarchy. Its genetic traits of behavior are so marked that man selects them to make races with predictable skills. The dog, like the ant, seems blind to its programming. Is the human doing better? Is he more warned of genetic roots of his behavior? For the majority of humanity and until a recent date: no. The research of environmental anchors on our actions date back less than a century; few people know them and use them daily. In fact, studies show that it is necessary that the human being thinks he is free to change his habits. The injunctions do not work. He must ignore he is manipulated. The conclusion is that in the human, the everyday consciousness is not more than the ant or the dog a awareness of the intimate elements of his reactions. We need a boosted education of the brain for this. This \u2018self-observation' is not necessary for the existence of consciousness, which is above all the feeling of \u2018being', and that cannot be denied to the dog or the ant in sparser versions that their nervous systems are capable of generating. Human consciousness seems almost 'magical'. Descartes, a rational mind and good connoisseur of the mechanics of the human body, was encouraged to dualism. The complexity pushes us towards mystical theories. A simple kaleidoscope fascinates us. The diversity of nature makes our imagination fly. Human consciousness is so complex that it seems elusive. So it is not material, it is of a higher order, we spontaneously tends to believe. There always have been the need to divinize consciousness, from the ages where even the best thinkers could not explain it. What makes the complexity of consciousness is the complexity of its content, i.e. the variety of mental functions that are integrated and their intelligence. This complexity varies greatly between humans themselves, and in a same person from childhood to maturity. Yet the neurons that support this consciousness remain the same. They are in equal number from one person to another. These are their connections which vary. Obviously, consciousness is the result of their organization. Organization specific to each brain and constantly evolving, what makes the dynamism of our consciences. Concepts observe others, according to a deeply stratified organization. We eventually create an observation of the representation of the Self, of the environment, of the society. We can observe us react instinctively, speak words we regret 'instantly', because the observation, the top of the pyramid mental task, arrives with a slight delay compared to the behaviors born on the border of the subconscious. The maturation of the brain is not the acquisition of additional neurons but the addition of these self-organized levels. We fill so our consciousness with complexity. By enriching its contents it appears brighter than ever. To the point that in mature age we would not really like to recover the body of our 20 years if it meant abandoning our increasingly keen sense of Self\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, most certainly, it does. Reason 1: Babies aren't fully conscoius, it's when they get older, they become more and more conscoiusly aware, unless they have a severe neurological disorder, in which case, they're not fully conscoius and that only seems to happen with a severely damaged brain. Reason 2: In deep sleep, there's no conscoiusness, it's just a blank state of nothingness, this only happens when coincedentally, brain activity gets very low. To put it blunt, conscoiusness isn't just going to reappear the moment all brain activity decreases to 0% or when the brain is completely dead. So yeah, conscoiusness is created by the brain, and yeah, it's energy, but you still need something to help create \u201cconscoiusness\u201d and that \u201csomething\u201d is our brain, it is the only reason as to why we are living right now, don't think that the brain has got nothing to do with our conscoiusness, our awareness because it does, the brain and conscoiusness connect with each other very well. After all, the brain is the receiver for conscoiusness, and yes, it's just a receiver, but this to me just means that without the brain, there's no more conscoiusness ",

            "answer_text": "I want to postulate a very psudo-scifi theory. What if in our raw form we r part of a larger consciousness. Like tiny tiny consciousnesses part of a big massive single consciousness. That consciousness is maybe sort of intangible matter (for lack of a better word). Like an ant colony of intangible consciousness. That consciousness understands that it is part of the universe but realised that it needed to be part of tangible matter so as to be able to interact with and shape the universe. So the consciousness decided to find a way to be tangible. It then found a planet that could support carbon based life. From there it decided to create a host for itself. Ie create a body so that it could touch, and model the universe. It then started with single cell organisms and saw that they didn't have enough neurons (antena) to hold the level of mini consciousness necessary for the main consciousness to be tangible. So the consciousness decided to create evolution so that it could figure out which type of organism would be able to host it. So it tried and tried and tried until it created d ape specie and finally there was a breakthrough. The ape brain could hold d signals. Or at least one specie of ape (humans). So i guess that our normal brains cannot hold all information about our main selves so thats why we cannot remember past selves or what we actually are. We are just like cells carrying out a task whose ultimate aim maybe to create a biological entity that would allow the ultimate consciousness exist in the tangible world. Since our brains cannot hold all the information of the untimate consciousness we are tasked with the responsibility of figuring out the information for ourselves. Like relearning what we already know so that we can one day evolve into a sort of hive specie. Like a body for the untimate consciousness to use and explore the universe. This would support the concept of reincarnation and why we can't remember our past lives and why we feel the ultimate need to grow and advance as a specie. Maybe it's hard wired into our brains by us. What if we r our own God. Lmao. That would be beastly and hilarious af\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 it could also explain intuition. Why we seem to know things and not know why and how we know them. We just do. Ultimately i do not know why our consciousness would need to explore the universe in raw biological form. Would be fascinating to find out though ",

The main components of the attention schema theory. The robot has an internal model of the self, a model of the apple, and a model of the attentional relationship between the self and the apple. That attention schema describes something physically incoherent, a caricature of attention, subjective awareness. The machine insists that it has subjective awareness of the apple because it is captive to the incomplete information in its internal models. We ask the robot in Figure 1D, \u2018What is the mental relationship between you and the apple?\u2019 The search engine accesses its internal models and reports the available information. It says, \u2018I have a mental possession of the apple\u2019. The answer is promising and we probe deeper. \u2018Tell us more about this mental possession. What are its physical properties?\u2019 For clarity, we also ask, \u2018Do you know what physical properties are?\u2019 The machine can answer \u2018Yes\u2019 because it has a body schema that describes the physical body and it has an internal model of an apple that describes a physical object. Reporting the information available to it, it might say (if it has a good vocabulary), \u2018I know what physical properties are.

            "answer_text": "In my view, to ask how the brain creates consciousness is like asking how an abacus creates math. The brain has its own context which has little to do with us. We use the brain, and our awareness is limited and shaped by its function, but there is no reason to suppose that any part of the brain even knows that we exist. Many have understood that there is a problem with connecting the activities of neurons or molecules with direct experiences such as colors and flavors. I grew up with a materialistic view and was unaware that there were other possibilities, except for religious views. I did not know that many philosophers throughout history had intelligent arguments which brought materialism into doubt, but eventually I began to develop questions about materialism on my own. The most problematic issue in my mind was why something like a brain or a body should feel anything at all, when all of its functions can be explained without any such feelings. Without knowing it, I had stumbled upon what David Chalmers famously called \"The Hard Problem\" of consciousness. Since that time, I have put together a synthesis of ideas from many different disciplines to come up with a solution that I think might be crazy enough to be on the right track. If I'm right, the brain does not create consciousness, nor do cells or molecules, but rather consciousness or sense is the fundamental condition of all possible existence (including physical objects, information, and subjectivity).  Consciousness is not like other things. To study it we must 'break the fourth wall' so that our own direct experience is featured in that experience's model of itself. It turns out that this is a trick that not everyone can do. For many people who have grown up in Western culture, especially those who specialize in science, engineering, or mathematics, the idea of objectifying objectivity itself is abhorrent. So critical is the presumption of objectivity to the scientific tradition, that it has literally become unthinkable to question it scientifically. For those who are interested in transcending their Western education without rejecting science, here are some resources to explore: Philosophy David Chalmers Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness and Philosophical zombie  Thomas Nagel What Is it Like to Be a Bat?

            "answer_text": "Maybe it doesn't create consciousness. It could very well be an interface that consciousness uses to operate the nano/biological machine that your body is. From observation it appears that when a person goes through death their body will still exist for quite sometime as it decays, yet the consciousness appears to leave this object known as the body. So, what is this consciousness and where does it go? Does it just fade away being absorbed as energy following the laws of physics? Humans have yet to really offer any proof that I am aware of, proving or disproving any theory associated with consciousness or souls or their existence. This is more than likely a question that you will have to wait until the end of your living journey to know your answer for sure. You are Your-self, I am My-Self together we may form a Greater-Self. There really is no proof that we even exist beyond being thoughts in a greater mind. We may just not posses the knowledge or even the ability to see what existence really is. Our universe may not have the physics compatible tools necessary to allow us to view or understand what reality even is. We may even see what it really is one day and still never understand completely until after that last breath. We are in a stew of many things, much of which we have very little understanding of and everything affects all else. There may be no you or me, we may exist as we see our cells under a microscope, part of a greater organism. So, this is not really an answer to your question I know; but who has such an answer? ",

            "answer_text": "Somewhere in there. But empirically, consciousness is in neither the left nor the right brain hemisphere. The evidence: My stroke of insight Jill Bolte Taylor, neuroanatomist, had a stroke that affected her left brain hemisphere. In that talk, and from its Ted Talks transcript: 03:33 Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment. It's all about \"right here, right now.\" Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful. 04:44 My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere, is a very different place. Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details, and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes all that information,associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, \"Hey, you've got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning.\" It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important, it's that little voice that says to me, \"I am. I am.\" A voice does say to her \u201cI am. I am.\u201d It can\u2019t exist in the left brain, because she is aware of its activities. To be aware of its activities, \u201cI\u201d-ness has to be independent of the activities it is \u2018measuring\u2019. The same holds true of the right brain, of picture thinking as Taylor describes right brain activity. But to describe right brain activity, she has to do so from a point independent of right brain activity. [Edit] There\u2019s another observation to make here. Bolte Taylor\u2019s right brain is speaking to her, saying \u201cHey, you[\u2018ve]\u2026\u201d. Are there two objects, Bolte Taylor\u2019s \u201cI\u201d-ness along with an independent \u201cI\u201d-ness possessed of her right brain? [End Edit] Motion is a relation. In order to distinguish change, a constant vantage point must exist from which to make an independent measurement. To measure the change in an object, at least one other object is physically required, that other object(s) being stationary (or presumed stationary). Our stream of consciousness is comprised of an observer amidst the observed. The observing self, or the self-knowing self, has a quale of invariance. As an invariant, it is fixed. As a fixed point, it concomitantly is a fixed point of observation. All else is perceived variation, that variation not discernible, not information, except from a fixed point of observation. So empirically, consciousness exists in the brain, but we have no account of its origin in species. I don\u2019t see then how to avoid a possible conclusion, namely, that personal identity and matter itself in a complementarity are the origin of species.. ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness does not evolve from the brain. According to the Ancient Egyptian writings, consciousness is a dimension of the Soul element known as the Ba. The Ba was understood as the essence of the soul responsible for consciousness, intelligence, kindness, compassion, honor, balance, quietude, tranquility, happiness, personality, and so on. As such, Ba can be understood as the element of the human soul that can affect and be affected by physical reality. Its properties are essentially human energies of thought and emotion. When a person transitions, their Ba is reunited with their soul essence of Ka (vitality) to form the Akh, a re-animated spiritual essence that lives forever. Thus, consciousness survives the transition of the body and retains its memory, relationships, and all the wisdom acquired during life on the earth plane. The following is a list of the nine elements of the human Soul, as understood by the Ancient Egyptians: 1) Ka\u2014The soul essence that provides the life energy in every human. The Ka is eternal. 2) Ba\u2014The essence that provides humans with their consciousness and unique personality. Ba is a quality we associate with the soul of an individual in modern time. This essence survives the transition of the body and is reunited with the Ka to give life to the Akh. 3) Akh\u2014The reanimated life essence (being) of a person after the transition by the coming together of his or her Ka and Ba. 4) Sekhem\u2014The immortal spiritual life force (power or might) connecting humans with the primordial vibrations of the entire universe. Sekhem was associated with the Goddess Sekhmet.  5) Khat\u2014The body. A separate entity that houses the soul. In ancient Egypt, the body was mummified upon transition in order that the person may continue to live in the afterlife. 6) Sahu\u2014The immortal spiritual body of a person. The Sahu is the spiritual or higher form of the physical mummy, often referred to as the divine mummy. 7) Ib (Jb)\u2014The heart. The seat of the soul, thought, memory, emotion, intention, wisdom, love, sadness, and so on. The heart was the entity measured against the principles or feather of Ma\u2019at in order to determine a person\u2019s fate upon transition. This measurement took place in the Halls of Judgment. 8) Sheut\u2014The shadow. The shadow is considered to be part of a person\u2019s soul. It represents the unanimated essence of a person. 9) Ren\u2014Name. A person\u2019s name is part of his or her soul essence; an entity that survives as long it is written and spoken. These nine elements of the human soul worked in harmony with one another to sustain life both in the physical and the netherworld or spiritual plane. ",

            "answer_text": "How does the brain create consciousness? Late to the party, as always, I\u2019ve started and paused this answer a dozen times. Not simply because there are some excellent answers already, which there are, or even because of my general acceptance that we simply don\u2019t yet know. Rather, I\u2019m not even sure what consciousness is, or even if it exists. OK, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m conscious right now. Something individual, self-reflective and dare I say analytical is going on. But what if we have invented it, to explain, describe or rationalize the \u201cinner workings\u201d we feel underpin our own behaviours? We then describe the \u201csystems\u201d of memory, attention and processing logically required to support our contention. It\u2019s possible. But is it a thing? Does it have mass? Can it be measured, or even clearly and unarguably defined? Perhaps, but perhaps not at our current levels of technological sophistication and instrument resolution. Let\u2019s assume it exists, anyway. Perhaps it\u2019s simply a useful virtualisation or \u2018working model\u2019 that the brain synthesizes to assist us with placing ourselves within our world. That seems likely, to me anyway. I know this isn\u2019t really helping, but it\u2019s helping me preface my ramblings. Perhaps we should also ask, how did we get here? I briefly wrote about the evolution of our mammalian ancestors and the seemingly important divergence away from olfactory dominance (to a visual-auditory dominance) on our branch of the family tree in my answer to What is the most sophisticated form of communication that we see in other life forms?. It may provide a clue to how we leveraged some \u2018abandoned\u2019 wiring as it were to do \u2018new stuff\u2019, or to do old stuff differently. An earlier example, much earlier, as in way back when mammals invaded the niches left by dinosaurs after their overwhelming if partial demise 65 million years ago, may be when \u2018we\u2019 (in a very vague mammalian sense) expanded beyond our previously nocturnal habits yet retained and possibly re-purposed some of our enhanced night-vision processing capability (which evolved from hiding from those dinosaurs) to do neat things like \u2018emotions\u2019. It made a good fit with placental behaviour, anyway. Which is to say that to my mind \u2018successful adaptation\u2019 seems a likely \u201creason for being\u2019 here. \u2018Higher\u2019 forms of consciousness arose from such successive, incremental changes. More so than simply being a property that serendipitously emerges from a gathering complexity of suitably self-referential and highly integrated connections, feeding forwards and backwards, persisting just so and attaining some temporal phase alignment or resonance. That may well be true, at least in part, but it\u2019s a sign also of many underlying, incremental changes: smaller, successful adaptations that build up into what we much later have labeled a \u201csystem\u201d, or even a collaboration of systems. Enhanced consciousness was thus selected for its survival value. How we view such things depends upon dimensions of breadth, depth and scale. I won\u2019t use the words \u2018wholistic view\u2019, tempted as I may be, but I acknowledge that we exist as a \u2018whole thing\u2019 operating as an agent in a survival context. Whatever it is, and however it arrived, we seem to possess it (consciousness, I mean). It probably exists on a sliding scale of sorts, a continuum that may well yet reach beyond our own modern human experience. You can obviously ascribe varying levels of conscious perception and awareness to other animals, and our very much shared origins would suggest that it\u2019s only by degree that some \u2018luxury options\u2019 are deleted as we move further away from our own \u2018lofty\u2019 position of self-appointed \u2018deepest thinker\u2019. We can\u2019t be absolutely certain what a bare-bones consciousness-enabled brain looks like neurologically, either in a gross regionalized morphological or neuron-specific sense (Pyramidal cell, anyone?). Many of the mammalian brain\u2019s feature set has correspondences right down to insect level. Whilst they may operate and behave in a far more reactive way than our more contemplative selves, they get around quite successfully without the bells and whistles. Perhaps \u2018insect consciousness\u2019 is a thing? I wrote about insect cognition and neurology in my answer to How do insects store memory? But back to the question. Koch, Tononi and others (I\u2019m simply too lazy to name them, sorry, but there\u2019s a link below) have recently suggested that \u201cthe anatomical neural correlates of consciousness are primarily localized to a posterior cortical hot zone that includes sensory areas, rather than to a fronto-parietal network involved in task monitoring and reporting\u201d. So is it all a matter of sufficient complexity, connectivity and timing in the sensory pathways? Perhaps. It\u2019s an idea that appeals to me, anyway, more so than systems of focus and attention, important though they may be. I\u2019m not always focused or attentive, yet I remain vaguely conscious of what is happening. And what happens when I am immersed in thought, dreaming, unconscious or even sub-conscious seems mysteriously disconnected from clear explanation. Getting the timing right does seem critical. Holding onto a target just long enough to make relevant connections without becoming overburdened with data, yet not so quickly that the \u201cimage\u201d is too faint, or merely lost in the background. An integrating orchestrator or \u201ctheatre\u201d would be helpful here and the claustrum is just one such target for investigation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1569501/). But the overall consciousness \u201csystem\u201d, if that\u2019s what it is, is far more complicated than \u201cjust one thing\u201d or even a bunch of \u201cthings\u201d. Integration is clearly important, but neural plasticity may well play a role, too. As may the effect of Degeneracy and complexity in biological systems. (Degeneracy? That sounds wrong to me, too. It\u2019s about time those degenerate neurons grew up!) It seems likely that sharing and storing memory data along multiple, interconnected paths, in a sense averaging out many near-identical \u2018copies\u2019 of our perceptual experiences helps us to retrieve and select data quickly and \u2018accurately\u2019 upon demand and over time. It\u2019s all back to timing. I wrote at length about consciousness, timing, electrical coupling vs glutamatergic transmission and the balance between metabotropic and ionotropic receptors (which alters significantly by the way when you compare and contrast the evolution of sauropsids and mammals) in my answer to How are the many ways electrical activity in the brain and consciousness related? It\u2019s not just about whats \u2018under the hood\u2019, either. It\u2019s also about how the \u2018wetware\u2019 is used. Language is implicated in all of this, if only because it has been pivotal in modern human development. Symbolic, representational language makes consciousness somehow richer and more useful to us. Such sophistication may however work against us here, in that we tend to over-emphasize ourselves and our capabilities and forget that less complex animals with seemingly very basic communication methods are \u2018aware\u2019 of us, too, and to varying degrees aware of \u2018themselves\u2019 and their \u2018place\u2019 in their own social context. Which takes us back to that continuum. We should also be mindful that human social and technological development generally is also intimately associated with what we today perceive as consciousness. Just to illustrate this, consider that spoken language as we use it today may go back only 70,000 years or so; written, symbolic representation much less again. Early stone tools date to around 2.5 million years ago, but truly sophisticated tool use and manufacture may only date back 300,000 years or less. Whatever the age, it takes a personal focus and broadly communicative social \u201cmemory\u201d to make a useful tool and to \u201cpass it on\u201d. It\u2019s a conscious act. Yet we are not alone in this, then or now. More likely to distinguish modern humanity from other species, ritual burial first occurred perhaps just 130,000 years before the present. Covering a body in ochre, burning and burying it with artifacts certainly puts a definitive stamp of \u201chigher consciousness\u201d upon this time or shortly thereafter (there are disputes over dating). All of which prompts the thought, how did our ancestors \u201cthink\u201d and perceive of their world before developing the skills and technologies we take for granted today? And what implications does that have for the brain-based \u201csystems\u201d we assume shape our consciousness? Knowing that the wetware was the same - or similar - probably matters, but we can only infer the programming from a scant fossil record. Behaviours don\u2019t fossilize well. Again I investigated the genetic origins that may underpin some of these developments, including language itself. It\u2019s worth noting that much like the emergence of consciousness itself, specific genetic changes are usually subtle enablers that work in concert with many other genes to produce a measurable variance. Anyway, I wrote about this in my answer to Is there any evidence from what we know about languages and linguistics that suggests that the human brain has changed somewhat significantly in the last 5,000 years? (The answer was no, by the way.) In any case I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m conscious right now, but how much of that reflection upon my personal self-awareness is because I\u2019ve been taught to think like that? Which is to say, is human consciousness as much a cultural meme, added to, analysed and passed along for thousands of years, as it is physical manifestation of underlying neurology and genetics?

            "answer_text": "Modern science can show clear evidence that the brain produces consciousness. Any musician can pick up their instrument and show that it makes sound. The question then becomes, when does sound become music, and when does consciousness become intelligence? And is that produced in the brain? I suspect both the heart and body give rise to our particular form of consciousness, and perhaps what we consider intelligence. The belly has more nerve endings than the brain and is responsible for much of we consider mood [1]. While mood may not be considered consciousness itself, it definitely has an affect on the quality of consciousness. Magnetocardiography is the measure of the the magnetic fields of the electrical activity of the heart[2]. While the science is thin, there is good reason to believe the heart has more to do with brain function than merely supplying blood and oxygen. It likely has significant influence on the level of consciousness of the person. So while yes, the brain produces consciousness, it is likely that it would not be intelligent in any way we could conceive without a heart and body to turn the sound into a song. Perhaps consciousness exists in all living systems. From the ones existing as a part of us like bacteria (epi) to the ones we exist as a part of like the Earth (meta). Maybe all has some form of consciousness and it all interferes in harmonious and disharmonious ways.

            "answer_text": "My personal theory is as follows (albeit non-academic it explains a lot of observations): Our brain is basically this set of routines that try to make sense of what they observe. The inputs for these observations are obviously what they receive from the external senses, but also from internal senses, a.k.a. from introspection. The (set of routines that is the) brain can observe itself, and tries to make sense of what it thus observes. Note though, that it cannot see all (introspection is limited) and that it can only interpret what it sees, just like it can only interpret what it sees with the external senses. (Even though the brain is the only observer of itself, it is after all only an observer, so its interpretation of what it sees can be flawed.) This observation of self is what consciousness is. Note that the brain observes *itself*, so consciousness is not something that is external to the brain (no homunculus that is in control) and neither do you actually need consciousness to operate. That\u2019s why animals can exhibit higher-level mental processes without necessarily being conscious.. That\u2019s why you can drive home while immersed in thought without actually realizing that you are driving and without realizing where you are driving. There are a lot of things you can do on automatic pilot, because that\u2019s what your brain does, it\u2019s not what your consciousness does. Consciousness only adds to the brain the awareness of what it is doing, but it is not needed. And as we can see from animals, consciousness \u2014 or the ability to observe inner processes \u2014 is a matter of degree. Some animals have it less, others have it more, humans have it a lot more.. (I suppose once you surpass a certain threshold, a positive feedback loop is created, which is responsible of the exponential evolution of our knowledge..) Heard of these tests where they determined that the electrical impulses linked to a decision actually happen some small amount of time before the mind actually thinks it decides..? From which the researchers conclude that we don\u2019t have free will because the brain already fires before the mind decides..? What actually happens is that the brain does decide, which fires the electrical impulses, which triggers the observation of these, which is fed back to the brain which after all is observing itself, which triggers the interpretation that a decision was taken.. So, it is not the decision that comes after the electrical firing, but it is the observation that a decision was taken that comes later. There is also no such thing as the conscious mind and the sub-conscious mind as two separate \u2018areas\u2019 of the brain. What happens is that introspection only can see so much of the inner processes. So, there\u2019s only one mind, which can observe itself, but only in a limited way.. That gives the false perception that there is some unconscious mind at work that we the conscious mind cannot see. However, whatever it is that is happening in the mind that we cannot see is still us observing and reasoning about the world. We just don\u2019t have the full view on how we come to conclusions.. But whatever \u2018we\u2019 is, it is the whole brain.. One conclusion that I draw from all this is this: it is impossible to \u2018know\u2019 yourself\u2026 your image of self is only a flawed interpretation of a limited observation.. ",

There is nothing in our laws of physics and chemistry that remotely suggests how or why collections of non-conscious particles become conscious. Hence we have the hard problem of consciousness. Most philosophers of mind concede we have made little (if any) progress in understanding how consciousness emerges from matter (or our brain). Alternatively, consciousness may in some sense be fundamental. There are a number of ways this could be. One is that matter is dual aspect: it has both physical and mental qualities. Then the problem of how our consciousness emerges is how collections of particles (that possess some rudimentary degree of consciousness) combine to create the kinds of experiences we have. However, this \u201ccombination\u201d problem is also extremely daunting. Another possibility is that mind and matter are fundamentally different things (dualism). But the problem here is how two fundamentally different substances can interact. Idealism proposes that everything is fundamentally mind. However this view also has its critics. Bertrand Russell proposed neutral monism. Here mind and matter are two aspects of a more fundamental (neutral) reality. Perhaps using such a framework we might posit that the brain filters out the aspect of consciousness awareness that we experience (while other living creatures filter a different kind of experience, based on their particular biology). Obviously, this is another controversial move for many. ",

It will need a motor to run the heart and respiration, it will need a visual cortex to see, it will need an auditory cortex to hear, it will need spatial awareness to move around, it will need emotional response to regulate behavior, it will need motor control to navigate challenges, it will need an efficient method for storing new memories, it will need sophisticated mechanisms to hold all these systems together\u2026 By the time you add up all the things you need to create consciousness you have described all the functional areas of the brain. So yes, consciousness resides in the brain. The brain holds all the systems that process higher consciousness. Once you damage the brain, you also damage consciousness. That fact alone should be proof enough that consciousness resides in the brain. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cIs the brain the source of consciousness?\u201d Later this was revised to, \u201cDoes consciousness emerge from the brain?\u201d No. The body has about 100 trillion living cells. It also has about 100 trillion other living cells, like the flora and fauna in the digestive tract. None of these are the source of consciousness, either. When a living cell replicates, or reproduces, it makes an exact duplicate of itself. The duplicate is exactly like the original, including all of its memories. The parent cell is alive and the daughter cells are alive. When a sperm cell and an egg cell get together at Conception, they change and absorb some of the content of the other, and this content is then duplicated. Cells change and replicate these changes in this way to form multi-cell organisms. Any consciousness that these cells have is not the consciousness of the being. The being part of \u201chuman-being\u201d is not the brain. The being is a spirit. The being exists near the body and may be inside the body, or inside the brain, or or some other body part, or some distance from the body. The spirit can determine its own location. The being has its own consciousness, quite independent of the body, or the brain, or any of the 100 trillion living cells, and even whether the body is alive or not. I believe and would like to test someday, the idea that when the being enters the body it changes the body\u2019s electrical resistance. A dead male body has a resistance of 12,500 ohms. A dead female body has a resistance of 5000 ohms. Just before the human-being dies it might have a high resistance of up to a million ohms, or a much lower resistance, lower than 5,000 ohms, or anywhere in between. This is caused by the being. When the being leaves, then the male body returns to 12,500 ohms, the female body returns to 5,000 ohms. This change in electrical resistance, is a measurable change in resistance a specific pattern of change, should also be true when the being enters the body, or leaves the body when the body is alive. This might happen during an accident, or a moment of urgency. So, one should simply be able to have the person recall or place their attention on such moments and then one could detect the same pattern of electrical resistance as when each of the events occurred. I know these experiments have been done in one form or another. I have done a few. This is the simplest of experiment to do. It is a measurement of electrical resistance. The observation of a specific electrical pattern coordinated with a specific type of event. Apparently when the being enters a body, or leaves the body it does not just relocate from point A to B. It vibrates at a specific observable frequency in a specific pattern that is recognizable. It goes AB\u2026BA\u2026AB\u2026 at a rate of 4 to 10 times per second. These things are all known, and have been observed by many. This is an easy experiment. The consciousness or spirit is not caused by, or does not \u201cemerge\u201d from the brain. The spirit enters the body. This instant in time, the point in a person\u2019s life, is called an assumption. The spirit leaves the body and this is called death. The spirit may leave the body or re-enter the body at most any time it wishes when it is able. When it is less able it still does this and all of these moments are measurable by detecting the pattern of electrical resistance in the body, a distinct pattern, that is formed in one\u2019s memory of this life. I submit this as my hypothesis, subject to experiment, such as a Science Fair Project done by students, that the spirit is independent of the body and does not \u201cemerge\u201d from the brain, it is not a by-product of the brain, it IS the individual person, the individual as a being. This is the individual, unique and not the body, this is the person him or her self, and it is demonstrable. Best regards, Leon ",

            "answer_text": "It is definitely true that the brain is, in some way, involved in the process consciousness. Damage the brain and consciousness is compromised. Stimulate the brain and new objects appear in consciousness (phosphenes, faces, sounds, memories etc). The reverse is also true. A particular state of consciousness, such as remembering someone\u2019s face, will have clear neural signatures appear in the brain\u2019s face area (known the fusiform face area). These location and pattern of activity will be correlated with the conscious process at play. However, does this imply that consciousness is confined to the brain and/or produced by the brain? No, it doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s try to understand this with a simple analogy: a smartphone. Because it is fashionable these days to talk about the brain in terms of computing analogies, this is an effective analogy. When you wish to watch a news video on your smartphone, such as CNN (hopefully not Fox News), you open your browser and enter the url to stream the video, and the video-stream is displayed on the screen. If you had a way to monitor the electrical activity in the circuitry of the phone, you\u2019d see the specific patterns underlying the processing and streaming of the video. Moreover, if you damage the circuitry, the video-streaming will be disrupted. Does this mean that the the CNN video is created by the phone? Surely not. The CNN signals are distributed across space, at least the the proximity of a base station. The smart-phone is merely a receiving device that is able to process the signal and display it on the screen. The electrical activity patterns are highly correlated with the scenes being displayed. But correlation, as we all know, is NOT causation. Could consciousness operate according to similar principles? Although the physical basis of conscious phenomena is not well understood (actually, far from well-understood, despite several theoretical attempts), and how the neural circuitry of the brain is able to interact with it remains a complete mystery, the evidence is quite strong that consciousness does not emerge from brain activity. This is a materialistic assumption and has no basis in facts or experiment. ",

Some cognition/thinking is conscious and we can explain what exactly constitutes conscious thinking. Like another answer mentioned, you can drop the word emerge from the question. Consciousness is happening in the brain and their is no consciousness without a brain. Living brains can also be completely unconscious, as in non-REM sleep. Consciousness is when two or more behavioral actions are vying for motor activation. This is why consciousness has always been tied to volition. Consciousness is in that sense a plurality, never a singularity. There is always at least two behavior options on immediate cue during conscious thought - that is what conscious thought is. Not very mysterious when understood in this empirically verified way. Most animals do not have the human ability to be consciously aware of multiple behavioral options simultaneously and they operate on immediate awareness and single-option behavior. But of course there is a continuum (just like wakefulness exists on a continuum) and there is more to be understood about this very special cognitive ability. But yes. Brains. ",

As pointed out by many other posters, it is an open question as to whether the brain generates consciousness, or simply receives it.  It has been an open question since Ren\u00e9 Descartes first posited cogito ergo sum, or, \"I think, therefore I am.\"  As far as I know, no scientist has come up with any testable hypothesis with regard to essence or existence, although existentialist philosophers and epistemologists sure like to debate these sorts of questions. For me, a memory of events with some sort of continuity into the past is a key ingredient of how I define and experience consciousness, and yet I often find myself \"waking up\" into a moment as though it was a dream.  This speaks to the fact that most human beings seem to experience the universe through the lonely island of consciousness that is an individual personality.  Two books that might add fuel to the fire of this debate are The Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley and Beyond Theology:  The Art of Godsmanship by Alan Watts. ",

The question falsely presupposes that consciousness is some new entity distinct from the brain, that presumption makes it incoherent, a metaphysical pseudo- puzzle which can only be satisfied by more metaphysical woo- woo. A real question would be , what are the neural correlates for specific conscious experiences? Once neuroscience can specify these then nothing further is required. Just as life requires no more explanation that a detailed biochemical description of the processes involved so consciousness needs no more explanation than a neurological description of the processes involved. Just as the search for the \"life force\" ,which was thought to imbibe inert matter with life was futile and incoherent, so is the search for a \" special\" explanation of consciousness over and above a detailed description of the neural activity involved. What \" special\" explanation would satisfy those who require it? Certainly not a scientific one, it would have to satisfy a need to be accepted. A blob has a light sensitive patch connected to a few internal neurons, a light shines on the patch and the neurons fire in a certain way, the blob is aware or \"conscious \" of the light. Roll forward a few million years, light shines on the eye and we are visually conscious of, say, a tree. Where is the mystery? Complicated surely, and not yet fully specified by neuroscience. But why the need for consciousness dust? Why the need for the God of the synaptic cleft? The consciousness of, say, a tree is not \"created\" by neural activity, it is the neural activity. No special explanatory woo- woo is needed, no creation of some mysterious consciousness substance . Alternatively you can, if you are of a metaphysical bent, invent dualism , stipulate that mind and matter as two seperate \" stuffs\", and then futilely search for the answer to the self- created inexplicable pseudo- problem of the interaction between mind and matter.

            "answer_text": "WARNING: technical discussion follows I\u2019ve arrived at the following conclusion: A pain as one usually conceives of a pain, in mentalistic terms, is that which appears as the (so-called) neural correlate on the screen of a brain monitor. To be sure, this is a somewhat peculiar factor, that which appears as the neural correlate. Here is my explanation: The nervous system of the individual in question, call him Smart (after J.J.C.), does not subject the neural correlate, a neural event that occurs in his brain, to perceptual processing of any sort, and hence Smart does not perceive it in any way. To put it the other way around, the neural correlate does not appear to him in any way. Nevertheless, he does pick up on it through neural pathways in his brain\u2014that is, if he picks up on it at all, for he might not. It is plausible to conjecture that he picks up on it even though he does not perceive it, since it occurs right there in his brain as a natural operation of the brain. For the sake of an expression, I say that Smart registers the neural correlate. Registration, then, is not a form of perception, in that it does not involve perceptual processing of any sort, but it does yield awareness of the neural correlate. How does Smart conceive of the neural correlate, then? He does not perceive it in any way, and hence he does not conceive of it as a neural event, even though that is what it is. Since he does not perceive it, but does register it, it stands to reason that he registers that which lies at the first step of the perceptual process when the perceptual process does run its course. Unfortunately, English does not afford any graceful way to say this, but the perceptual process begins with X, the material on which it works, if you will, and Smart registers X. But X is that which appears as the neural correlate when the neural correlate does appear. That which Smart registers, then, is that which appears as the neural correlate. It appears on the screen of a brain monitor when it does appear, since, as it happens, there is no other way to capture an image of it. To answer the question, then, Smart conceives of the neural correlate as a pain, since he has learned to call events like that pains. That which appears as the neural correlate, however, is of course numerically identical to the neural correlate, and it appears as a neural event because that is what it is. The so-called neural correlate, then, is not a correlate at all. It is the pain as the pain appears, and that is to say, it is simply the pain. Nothing occurs but that neural event. Generalizing from this case, if that is permissible, it follows that consciousness is a purely physical phenomenon that can be understood only in physical terms, and that to understand it thoroughly in those terms is to understand it without remainder. The brain, then, generates consciousness in that it generates the neural activity that constitutes consciousness, and there is no suggestion here that anything else occurs, besides that neural activity. None of this has anything to do with emergentism. *** *** *** Ryan Fox Squire (or another specialist), Granted that the neurological details are missing, why doesn\u2019t this work?

Somehow I was designed for them, I guess. As a teen in my first year of college, I literally gave my life to know truth through a Near Death Experience. I wrote about it more seriously in Near Death of a Different Sort - Dying to Know the Truth. As a result I became aware that consciousness is outside the body yet linked to it through the brain. It is a receptacle, not a generator. Consider the atom. Most of it is space. Therein is the consciousness that defines its configuration. The same is with consciousness, it defines our configuration but does not reveal it. Thinking, on the other hand, is different. The brain does generate thoughts, processes information and provides linear responses. As knowledge grows, it may lead to revealing consciousness. Consciousness, in addition, provides non-linear and often non-local responses to serious inquiry. ",

If you forget a memory and never even speculate about it like what you had for tea 189 nights ago it is nothing to you because there\u2019s nothing in your mind that fires the neurones.

            "answer_text": "Awareness is only work form of inert energy like talking; walking etc. It is a specific form of work. Awareness is only the work of thinking. Work is not an entity like the worker or working element. In essence, it is only inert energy. The inert energy is transformed into a specific work when enters a specific system called nervous system. The same inert energy, entering into a specific system called throat and tongue, is transformed into a specific work called talking. The same inert energy, entering a specific system called the legs, is transformed into a specific work called walking. Similarly, when the same inert energy enters into lungs, it is transformed into a specific work called breathing. We can understand this with the help of the current entering different machines doing different works. The current entering a grinding machine performs a specific work called grinding. The same current entering a cutting machine performs a specific work called cutting. Grinding is specific and unique because the grinding machine is specific and unique. Similarly, awareness is a specific or unique work because the nervous system is unique and specific. Any work is unique and specific due to the unique or specific nature of the system in which such work is generated. Therefore, awareness is unique and specific like any other work. Essentially, it is inert energy only. No special astonishment need be done in the case of awareness. The essential basic form of awareness is the inert energy, which is all pervading cosmic energy. This all-pervading cosmic energy is called as Atman or Brahman. The word Atman means that which pervades. The word Brahman means which is huge and infinite. Both these words indicate the infinite inert cosmic energy only. The inert energy generates, controls and destroys all the items of the universe. Therefore, this Atman or Brahman or the inert cosmic energy is the generator, controller and destroyer of the universe. The word Atman is used in the finite limited inert energy in this human body or any living body and this word is justified here also since the inert energy pervades the little space occupied by the little body. The infinite cosmic energy of the Universe is denoted by the word Brahman since it is huge. Thus, there is no difference between Atman and Brahman in qualitative sense. They differ in the quantitative sense. Shankara also agreed to this quantitative difference by comparing Atman to the wave and Brahman to the ocean (Satyapibhedaapagame\u2026). The Gita also says that Atman is the inert energy (Sthanurachaloyam\u2026). This Atman or inert energy is transformed into a specific work called awareness after entering the specific system called brain and nervous system. This awareness, which is only a specific work, is called as Jeeva. Thus, Jeeva is a form of work (Karma) only. Jeeva is the doer (Kartha) and enjoyer (Bhokta). Atman being inert energy is neither the doer (Kartha) nor the enjoyer (Bhokta). In deep sleep, the Jeeva disappears and only Atman remains and this is accepted by Shankara (Shushuptyekasiddhah\u2026). ",

            "answer_text": "* * * Noumenon and Phenomena * * * It was one of those mornings, perhaps a Monday, when there were only a few of us, the regular 'addicts'. Maharaj sat with his eyes closed, still like a statue. After some time he suddenly started speaking softly, so softly that we unconsciously moved nearer to him. He continued to sit with his eyes closed, and went on speaking, or rather thinking aloud: People think that I am a Jnani. They come to me from all over the world - from Canada to Australia and New Zealand, from England to Japan. Most of them have read I Am That and come all the way to Bombay only to meet me. With great difficulty they are able to locate this little old house of mine in a dirty, narrow street.They climb up the stairs and find a small dark man in the simplest of clothing, sitting in a corner. They think: This man doesn't look like a Jnani; he does not dress impressively, as someone known as Nisargadatta Maharaj could be expected to do. Could he really be the one? What can I say to these people? I tell them quite frankly that my education is up to the level which can barely put me in the category of the literate; I have not read any of the great traditional scriptures and the only language I know is my native Marathi. The only enquiry I have pursued, but pursued it relentlessly - like a hunter pursues his quarry- is this: 'I know I am and I have a body. How could this happen without my knowledge and consent ? And what is this knowledge I am?' This has been my life-long pursuit and I am fully satisfied with the answers I have reached. This is my only Jnana, yet people believe I am a Jnani. My Guru told me: \"You are Brahman, you are all and everything. There is nothing other than you.\" I accepted my Guru's word as truth, and now, for forty odd years I have been sitting in this very room doing nothing except talking about it. Why do people come to me from distant lands? What a miracle! After pursuing my enquiry to its logical conclusion what have I arrived at ? The whole thing is really simple, if only one sees the picture clearly. What is this 'me' that I am concerned with? The immediate answer, of course, is \u2014 'this me, this body'. But then the body is only a psychosomatic apparatus. What is the most important element in this apparatus which qualifies it to be known as a sentient being? It is undoubtedly the consciousness without which this apparatus, while perhaps technically alive, would be useless as far its functioning is concerned. This consciousness obviously needs a physical construct in which to manifest itself. So, consciousness depends upon the body. But what is the body made of? How does the body come into existence? The body is merely a growth in the woman's womb during a period of about nine months, the growth of what is conceived by the union of the male and female sexual fluids. These fluids are the essence of the food consumed by the parents. Basically, therefore, both consciousness and the body are made of, and are sustained by food. Indeed, the body itself is food - one body being the food of some other body. When the food-essence, the vital sexual fluids, grows from conception into a tiny body and is delivered out of the mother's womb, it is called 'birth'. And when this food essence gets decayed due to age or illness and the psychosomatic apparatus happens to get destroyed, it is called 'death'. This is what happens all the time \u2013 the objective universe projecting and dissolving innumerable forms; the picture keeps on changing all the time. But how am 'I' concerned with this? I am merely the witness to all this happening. Whatever happens during the period of the happening, in each case, affects only the psychosomatic apparatus, not the 'I' that I am. This is the extent of my 'knowledge', basically. Once it is clear that whatever happens in the manifested world is something apart from me, as the 'I', all other questions resolve themselves. At what stage exactly did I come to have the knowledge of my 'existence'? What was I before this knowledge 'I am' came to me? This knowledge 'I am' has been with me ever since I can remember, perhaps a few months after this body was born. Therefore, memory itself must have come with this knowledge 'I am', this consciousness. What was the position before that? The answer is: I do not know. Therefore, whatever I know of anything has its beginning in consciousness, including pain and pleasure, day and night, waking and sleeping \u2013 indeed the entire gamut of dualities and opposites in which one cannot exist without the other. Again, what was the position before consciousness arose? These interrelated opposites inevitably must have existed but only in negation, in unicity, in wholeness. This must then be the answer. This unicity is what I am. But this unicity, this identity, this wholeness cannot know itself because in it there exists no subject as separate from an object \u2013 a position that is necessary for the process of seeing, or knowing, or cognizing. In other words, in the original state of unicity, or wholeness, no medium or instrument exists through which 'knowing' may take place. Mind cannot be used to transcend the mind. The eye cannot see itself; taste cannot taste itself; sound cannot hear itself. 'Phenomena' cannot be phenomena without 'noumenon'. The limit of possible conceptualization - the abstract of mind - is noumenon, the infinity of the unknown. Noumenon, the only subject, objectifies itself and perceives the universe, manifesting phenomenally within itself, but apparently outside, in order to be a perceivable object. For the noumenon to manifest itself objectively as the phenomenal universe, the concept of space-time comes into operation because objects, in order to be cognizable, have to be extended in space by giving them volume and must be stretched in duration or time because otherwise they could not be perceived. So, now I have the whole picture: The sentient being is only a very small part within the process of the apparent mirrorization of the noumenon into the phenomenal universe. It is only one object in the total objectivization and, as such, 'we' can have no nature of our own. And yet \u2013 and this is important - phenomena are not something separately created, or even projected, but are indeed noumenon conceptualized or objectivized. In other words, the difference is purely notional. Without the notion, they are ever inseparable, and there is no real duality between noumenon and phenomena. This identity - this inseparableness - is the key to the understanding,or rather the apperceiving of our true nature, because if this basic unity between the noumenon and the phenomenon is lost sight of, we would get bogged down in the quagmire of objectivization and concepts. Once it is understood that the noumenon is all that we are, and that the phenomena are what we appear to be as separate objects, it will also be understood that no entity can be involved in what we are, and therefore, the concept of an entity needing 'liberation' will be seen as nonsense; and 'liberation', if any, will be seen as liberation from the very concept of bondage and liberation. When I think about what I was before I was 'born', I know that this concept of 'I am' was not there. In the absence of consciousness, there is no conceptualizing; and whatever seeing takes place is not what one - an entity - sees as a subject/object, but is seeing from within, from the source of all seeing. And then, through this 'awakening', I realize that the all-enveloping wholeness of the Absolute can not have even a touch of the relative imperfection; and so I must, relatively, live through the allotted span of life until at the end of it, this relative 'knowledge' merges in the noknowing state of the Absolute. This temporary condition of 'I-know' and 'I-know-that-I-know' then merges into that eternal state of 'I-do-not-know' and 'I-do-not-know' that 'I-do-not-know. ~ Pointers from Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj ",

            "answer_text": "The physical processes in the brain are the cause of your conscious experience (the only caveat to that is that if you ignore the rest of the body, you'll miss some crucial effects). Here are some glaringly obvious facts regarding the cause and effect of consciousness: If you remove your arm, you can still retain consciousness. You can turn consciousness off by brain damage or anesthetics that specifically target the crucial brain processes. The property of sweetness and color are not out there in the external world as they seem to be. Your brain models the outside world and color and sweetness are proxies that exist within the brain attached to the proxies of the relevant objects. The color red is not attached directly to a rose as science has clearly demonstrated. The proxy for redness is attached to the proxy for the flower within the brains model of the external world. Likewise, when you decide to look at the flower you focus your 'attention' on it. Your brain also models your  ability to focus attention. That is to say, there is a proxy for the physical process of 'attention'. The proxy is called 'awareness'. So awareness is a proxy for attention. Just as color is a proxy for the frequencies of light that reach your retina. ",

            "answer_text": "Giancarlo Frigato, Degree in Biology, University of Ferrara (1984) In recent studies, through functional magnetic resonance, Dehaene, Tononi and other neuroscientists have identified the brain areas that are active only during conscious perception but not in simple unconscious perception. Other studies on \"hemineglect\" highlight the areas of the brain whose injury causes the loss of Consciousness but does not prevent the unconscious perception. These researches have as a result that specific areas of the Cerebral Cortex are the neural correlates of Consciousness. Instead, for example, the removal of the cerebellum damaged by trauma does not prevent the explication of Consciousness. The injury of the brain stem causes the loss of Consciousness but also prevents unconscious perception. Consciousness ensures that within the vast unconscious perception, information selected in a utilitarian way is quickly memorized. Such information, once present in the Memory, may be producing mental images that alone or together with conscious images from the external environment are used to reason (and to communicate with other subjects in the case of Man or the apes). Oakley and Halligan (2017) based on studies about hypnosis (eg, Schlegel et al., 2015, Lush et al., 2017), the divided brain (Gazzaniga, 1988), decision making (Libet et al., 1983 ) and neglect (eg, Driver and Mattingley, 1998; Frigato, 2014), have come to the conclusion that brain operations responsible for all our mental activities take place at the unconscious level. Activities that include perceptions, actions and emotions, but also reasoning, self-control and sense of self. Oakley and Halligan do not use the generic concept of \"Consciousness\", but they operate the very useful distinction between Personal Narrative (contents of Consciousness) and Personal Awareness (experience of Consciousness) emphasizing how the latter constantly accompany the first in parallel, without minimally influencing the mechanisms responsible for our mental abilities. On the other hand, the Personal Narrative \"serves the powerful evolutionary function of enabling individuals to communicate (external broadcast) the contents of internal broadcasting\" and its contents are deposited in the higher level Memoirs: Semantic, Episodic and Autobiographical. Reading this article helped me a lot in revisiting the theoretical work I have undertaken to try to identify the neural correlates of consciousness (Frigato, 2014). Something I haven't done in my analysis was making the distinction between Personal Narrative and Personal Awareness. Another distinction that can be made is that between simple automatic unconscious mechanisms and complex unconscious mechanisms (e.g., Gazzaniga, 1988; Moscovictch and Umilt\u00e0, 1991; Frigato, 2014). The first are not accompanied by the Personal Narrative and therefore not even by Personal Awareness, the latter instead yes. An example of automatic mechanism is to drive along a road well known to us, perhaps even overtaking, stopping at traffic lights, etc., and realizing only after a certain time, to have passed through it without remembering that we did it. There are therefore unconscious automatic behaviors which we cannot refer about and that we cannot memorize in the 3 higher level Memoirs. Instead the most important and complex unconscious experiences, being able to give rise to the Personal Narrative, can be deposited in the 3 Memoirs which are the source of mental images. In my opinion (Frigato, 2014) the images of the external environment and the mental images present in the Personal Narrative are used not only to exchange information with our neighbors (Oakley and Halligan, 2017), but also to be able to learn in a manner complex through reasoning. Therefore the Personal Narrative not only provides the great evolutionary advantage of being able to communicate with others, but also gives reasoning ability. It can therefore be assumed that up to fish and amphibians there are only automatic learning and memory mechanisms and, starting from the reptiles, a minimum capacity of reasoning appeared, which evolved in birds and mammals to reach the highest levels of efficiency in man (Bitermann and Mackintosh, 1969; Denton,2006). Through a review of the literature related to neglect, I hypothesized (Frigato, 2014) that the mechanism that produces the Personal Narrative is made of 8 + 8 large areas specularly present in the two cerebral hemispheres. They all work simultaneously in parallel as \"points of convergence\" between the 3 higher level Memories and other 8 + 8 brain areas specialized in perception and movement. The latter are responsible respectively for the recognition of a specific object, its position in space, the emotions it produces, the position of the body with respect to the object itself, the state of the body at the moment of perception and the 3 motor potentials related to that object. In the specific case of visual Personal Narrative (Frigato, 2014), the medial-superior temporal lobe work as a \u201cpoint of convergence\u201d and keep simultaneously active both the occipital and inferior temporal cortices responsible for visual perception and the precuneus-posterior cingulate, the seat of 3 Superior Memories. So, to obtain the Personal Narrative of external perception, in addition to the image that come from the environment, the mirror memory corresponding to that image should be simultaneously activated and superimposed. Conversely when the Personal Narrative is arrived at through visual mental images that comes from memory, the superior-medial temporal lobe simultaneously maintains active the neurons in the sensorial cortices (occipital and inferior temporal), which have been the source of external visual perception in the corresponding previous experiences. There would therefore be a continuous feedback and alternation between activation of the neurons responsible for perception and those responsible for memory. With mental images there would obviously be a predominance of precuneus memory, while during external perception the prevailing activities would be in the sensory cortices (Ganis et al., 2004; Mechelli et al., 2004). As already highlighted, Oakley and Halligan operate the very useful distinction between Personal Narrative and Personal Awareness. They say that after trying to explain the Personal Narrative, the \"New Hard Problem\" still remains to solve the identification of the neural mechanisms of Personal Awareness: \"How and why do neurophysiological activities produce the \"experience of consciousness\"?\"; (Chalmers, 1996). My theoretical work (Frigato, 2014) tries to explain the feeling of Personal Awareness with the fact that, in the production of Personal Narrative, are involved the 8 + 8 \"points of convergence\", the 3 Memories, and 8 + 8 sensory and motor areas. All these areas acting simultaneously and in parallel could create a wide \"psychophysical activation\" such as to produce Personal Awareness. For example, the images coming from the external environment or the mental images of a red sunset, of a green landscape, of human faces and so on, would create practically infinite different combinations of psychophysical sensations. Such as to explain how Personal Awareness varies at any moment and is absolutely private and personal. The presence of these almost infinite combinations would also explain why the problem of Personal Awareness appears as a \"Hard Problem\": the human brain usually reasons on at most 3-4 spatio-temporal dimensions and therefore finds hard to explain rationally such large and complicated combinations.

We can show this through various ways, such as brain damage, probing the brain, drugs, etc. These all alter your perception of reality. However, consciousness itself is not a tangible thing. You cannot touch it, feel it, or even measure it. To ask where it is in space or time is difficult because it is a subjective exoerience; you cannot observe it from the outside. This is one of those questions which I think are unsolvable, but there are many theories on it. Many people believe it is in the brain, and the brain only. Many people believe that awareness is something separate which views consciousness from the outside. There is the idea that awareness itself in an intrinsic part of the universe, and given the right ordering, anything can be made concious. That the brain because of the way it is structured is able to filter this surrounding awareness into something coherent, which we call ourselves. But there really is no way of knowing, at least not yet. ",

So there is no question of brain create consciousness. It means consciousness exist independent of the working of the brain but it can't exist without it. If it so what happens to it in deep sleep and how it reemerge when we wake up. Only conclusion is brain acts like a radio receiving signals from outside source and interpreting it to us. Some basic acts like walking may by repetition somewhat registered in the brain and induce us to act unconsciously. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a neuroscientist but I respect those who doubt whether the brain can create consciousness. What we know is that changing the activities of specific neurons changes the contents of our conscious experience in specific ways. We know that we stop having any experiences when the brain stem (etc) is not properly activated. So it seems that certain brain states make consciousness appear. But it seems to me (and others) that current \u201cfunctionalist\u201d theories fail to account for how consciousness arises from non-mental physical matter. I think we may have to \u201cbite the bullet\u201d and accept a \u201cmental aspect\u201d as a new property of matter just as we successfully did with \u201ccharge.\u201d That would be admitting that the brain doesn\u2019t magically create consciousness out of nothing, while still recognizing the critical role it plays in generating and shaping experience as we know it.

            "answer_text": "Trying to explain how Consciousness works is a little funny in light of the absence of having described Consciousness and understanding what Consciousness is. The Theory seems sound, to recognize Consciousness as a State-of-Mind. A State more easily recognized during the pause, just before one reacts to Fear. The almost instantaneous reaction animals have, whether it is to fight or flee. Which action will the animal CHOOSE, as the best action to take? That short instantaneous reaction is a delay in doing either. The reaction will be due to our choice. That once short moment of conscious thinking became extended in humans. The extension has become 24:7 now. To say that man is living in a constant state of fear, one which he calls consciousness, is the Theory. There is no other comparable theory available. Consciousness is at work, deciding what actions or avoidances ought be taken. Every moment, we are aware that outcomes will follow from our decisions. We are making decisions all the time. We are taking actions which we realize will have consequences. We are thoughtfully choosing exactly what we ought chose to do. But what we will choose to do depends upon our Myers/Briggs Personality Type.  Carl Jung said Choosing is dominated by one of our Freudian archetypes. The decision, to act this way or that way, is influenced by this Dominant Archetype in our mind, assisted by another of the seven Archetypes called the Auxillary.  Archetypically is how the Mind knows what to choose, using all the recognzed environmental realizations available to it. Learning is due to an outcome of the Reality which follows. Pro 2:5 then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. What we see in this process is that this constant State-of-Mind, awareness, is a learning opportunity. The results of the constant State-of-Consciousness can be seen by the fruits of our own technological advances today. ",

Consider that there is some arbitrary point at which someone considers awareness to become self-awareness-consciousness. Researchers have  widely divergent views of that issue.You have made points that make me wonder if subject to influence  is an aspect, and maybe a beginning, of being aware.If so, then an intergalactic mote of dust, or cosmic ray, is aware of everything, because everything affects it, even if that happens over event durations that make a human life seem less than anything countable.That is the condition of hell, where you are subject to influences without volition, or control.It goes from there to polar atoms, to molecules, and we are off to viruses, and on.At some point, as said before, these complexes begin to have internal feedback loops, and the discussions begin.

Actually human thinking involves seven stages, resulting in seven levels of consciousness. They are, Day dreamingIllusionCreativityStabilizationDeterminationStatus alterationCompulsionHigher the stage better is the perception and more is the preparedness for action, and more is the energy consumption. Stage 4 is the default stage. Perception, preparedness for action, and energy consumption are 50% in this stage. This stage is maintained by the brain. Normally the correct level of consciousness is selected automatically. Thus, we feel as though we have one level of consciousness. However, if the right level of consciousness is not selected we may have huge energy expenditure while day dreaming and no energy for a battle for survival. It is this abnormal energy expenditure that makes us wonder what consciousness is and what maintains it. Since from the default state we can select any level we want at will, it raises the question whether it is \u2018I\u2019 or my brain, which maintains consciousness. Adding to the confusion is the fact that religious people suppose that it is god that maintains consciousness. ",

Not saying I agree (no brain surgeon here), but it's an interesting thought and I'm not sure how one could disprove it.

Those humans able to transcend the facade of the ego find it is possible to expand awareness beyond  the \"I gotta be me.\" level.  Expanding awareness immediately allows each of us to begin to comprehend the integral, immutable, and eternal  nature of Consciousness the fountainhead of all creation and source of all that is.  Moment to moment. In past answers I have used the term Cosmic Consciousness numerous times to give name to this idea while in this answer I have simply used \"Consciousness\". It was  recently suggested to me that Cosmic Consciousness was an outmoded if not actually antiquated term and I found myself inclined to agree since I'd been using it since the 1960's. I've seen documentaries lately where both physicist and philosopher seem to have agreed on Proto Consciousness as acceptable. To avoid semantic confusion, I too will use Proto Consciousness in future answers to name that level of Consciousness which I regard as the very raison d'etre of the entire Universe.   ",

Looking for such phenomenon using man made machines would prove futile if that which they are looking for is not stored within. When we develop an appropriate detection system, we may \"explain\" it but at the moment it's like scanning for tv signals using your radio.  I think consciousness needs to be defined first. Do we only become conscious when we are born or are we conscious in the womb? Are we conscious before we learn a language? When we learn a language do we become more conscious as we develop the ability to 'think'? What happens when we fall asleep? There appear to me to be many 'stages' of consciousness which separate us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Are other animals conscious or just aware? Some demonstrate, like octopus and monkeys, the ability to think without the privilege of the human brain and they clearly slip from conscious to unconscious states.  I haven't answered your question but I feel better for sharing. ",

            "answer_text": "Defining consciousness is possible but does science know what produces it? What is it? What distinguishes a living being from inanimate matter? Everything is formed according to the same atomic elements and the only things that seem to separate the living from unliving is a combination of complex biochemistry, organs, electric impulses and intake from the environment. Does this \"magically\" lead to consciousness? If we don't know how it is produced then the only assumption we can make from observation is that our nervous system is used as a sensory feedback network that can interface with whatever we call consciousness since an individual is \"aware\" and responds to stimulus unless they're in some kind of coma. There is that point of view that complexity can lead to consciousness. However, shouldn't this lead to computers and other complex systems such as the biosphere and telephone networks being conscious one day? What is life? Can we produce it artificially in a laboratory? Or is it a property that is transmitted from an existing organism? Life and consciousness do appear to be interlinked. So, for all we know consciousness may be a property of matter and a rock could have a very, very low degree of it. It just wouldn't be aware of it's surroundings and might not be aware of itself without a nervous system. ",

In other words, our awareness level is extremely low, because our consciousness is trapped in the desires of our ego and the illusions of our intellectual mind. Unlike the intellect, the consciousness, when awakened, does not need to speculate about the nature of reality, because it can perceive reality directly. Illusion can be shed and the consciousness can be awakened through proper meditation practice. ",

            "answer_text": "To understand consciousness one must first recognise that time is three dimensional. We only exist in 'real' time, the present. Our brains, however, also perceive 'unreal' time, that relating to the past and 'imaginary' time that pertains to future events. 'Real' time's continuous monitoring of the body's senses allows the body to relate to current circumstances and environment. It is a measure of our existence. 'Unreal' time is responsible for knowledge, accessible by the application of recall or memory. 'Imaginary' time, responsible for dreaming, allows us to contemplate the future and therefore plan. It is also responsible for the appreciation of the arts, the ability to contemplate the abstract and the divination of gods. The application of all three in the brain allows us to sense the flow of time. If 'unreal' time gives one KNOWLEDGE (gleaned by inheritance from ancestors and experience in life), then 'real' time, allied with this, gives us UNDERSTANDING. Armed with the knowledge and understanding, the 'imaginary' time component brings one WISDOM. It is my opinion that the presence of all three aspects of time working in the brain defines CONSCIOUSNESS. For more on this and time with proofs please go to: The DAVIES Hypothesis - YouTube ",

            "answer_text": "Specific brain regions are not responsible for specific mental faculties but instead are elementary processing units, though more recent studies have shown that there is localisation of brain functions to a certain extent. Perception, movement, language, thought and memory are all made possible by the interlinkage of serial and parallel processing in these discrete brain regions for specific functions. For example, knowledge about grandmother is not stored as a single representation but rather is subdivided into distinct categories and stored separately. One region of the brain stores information about the invariant physical features that trigger your visual recognition of her. Information about changeable aspects of her face\u2014 her expression and lip movements that relate to social communication\u2014 is stored in another region. The ability to recognize her voice is mediated in yet another region.  Interconnected neurons form anatomically and functionally distinct pathways. The neural pathways activated by receptor cells in the retina that respond to light are completely distinct from the pathways activated by sensory cells in the skin that respond to touch. Only two features of the conducting signal convey information: the number of action potentials and time intervals between them. When an action potential reaches a neurons terminal it stimulates the release of chemical substance called neurotransmitters. For example, when a muscle is stretched, the amplitude and duration of the stimulus are reflected in the amplitude and duration of receptor potential generated in the sensory neuron. Rapid changes in membrane potential that underlie signaling throughout nervous system are mediated by ion channels, a class of integral membrane protein found in all cells of the body. Different types of pumps maintain the concentration gradients for Na+, K+, Ca+2, Cl-, and other ions. The functional properties of the Neuron can be intuitively represented as an Electrical Equivalent Circuit.  References Principles of Neural Science by Eric Kandel ",

You might find this interesting with relation to consciousness  . ",

You can think about it like a corporation. There are employees (aka neurons) that gather information from the world and that orchestrate basic responses to the world. Then there are other employees (neurons) that are \u201cmanagement\u201d. They use what has been gathered to decide how the corporation should proceed overall. \u201cManagement\u201d decides on responses to how the company is doing. \u201cManagement\u201d also decides what the corporation \u201cshould\u201d be and how it compares to other corporations.

It is by far the best resource I have found so far in understanding consciousness. In several chapters you can track which molecules are moving where and why particular atoms do what they do in the process. The book is clear on both the physics and biology without being more than an average person who has taken a biology course some time in their life can handle. My major in college was philosophy with post graduate work in art history but the physics and chemistry in this book were not too difficult for me to follow. I had to read some pages two or three times once in a while (O.K. several times) to figure things out but the effort was very much worth it. If you have a biology background you will sail through it.

'It is the stick which does the stirring', he says. Socrates corrects him by saying that, in fact, it is the man moving the stick who actually does (causes) the stirring of the water. Similarly, as quite a few contemporary physicists, as well as all advaitists or non-dualists hold, consciousness is that which produces the brain (and all bodies, etc.), not the other way around. ",

This results in interference of the impulses already present in the brain leading to a blackout which is the unconscious state. Hope that serves the purpose. ",
