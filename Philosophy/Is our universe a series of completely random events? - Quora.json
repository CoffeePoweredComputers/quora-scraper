            "answer_text": "There is a theory for everything in this universe and everything is connected, scientifically. Now if we can explain anything and everything correctly, nothing is going to seem random, don\u2019t you think? The only thing that allows random events in universe possible, for a human mind, is not knowing anything about it and all we can do is predict. False knowledge is misleading too. Looking at the size of the universe, there are so many hidden and mysterious events and phenomenon which we still can\u2019t explain because of constraints like earth\u2019s science itself. On Earth we have explanation for everything but nothing definite about starting of universe i.e. big bang and it\u2019s possible ending like big rip, big freeze or big crunch. If we find out the starting point and ending point of our universe, it will all be a series of chronological events, universe won\u2019t be a series of complete random events after then. ",
