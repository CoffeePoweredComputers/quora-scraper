            "answer_text": "That largely depends on just what you mean by \u2018pure objectivity\u2019; allow me to explain. Pure objectivity could mean several different things: A subjective perspective which somehow avoids being tainted by the nature of subjectivity - biases and limitations. This is pure objectivity articulated subjectively.Reality as merely the object of existence, paying no heed to the perceptions of subjects entailed by that object - this is pure objectivity or Truth, defined by me as that which is, as it is, independently of subjective perceptions of it, and this Truth doesn\u2019t require subjective articulation.Reality as the object of existence entirely excluding subjects, pure objectivity could mean the abject denial of subjectivity in favour of the purity of its opposite. This \u2018pure objectivity\u2019 is entirely abstract to our experience and it cannot be coherently thought of - our mere thinking about it degrades its purity, because it means that subjectivity exists to contemplate it.If you mean the first, then I\u2019d say it doesn\u2019t exist as far as I know, and I don\u2019t know how it could ever really be achieved; we can approximate it, and perhaps get very close, but I don\u2019t see how you could entirely shed subjective limitations while retaining the status of subject. If you mean the second, then yes I think that exists. I would say the object of existence is the absolute grounding for both our physical system and our subjective experience - pure objectivity which entails subjectivity is, simply put, complete reality. If you mean the third, no. I don\u2019t think that exists and it seems manifestly incoherent to me since I\u2019m here to talk about it. I hope that helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "Some philosophers maintain that True Objectivity is possible, while others do not. Generally, from Socrates to John Locke, we find most philosophers will maintain that True Objectivity is possible, and even easy. It is mainly after the rise of David Hume (ca. 1750) and his thought-provoking works on Skepticism, that Western Philosophy has seriously doubted the possibility of people attaining True Objectivity. This tendency increased with Immanuel Kant (1780), then further increased with Arthur Schopenhauer (1820), then exploded with Friedrich Nietzsche (1880) and his doctrine of the Will to Power. In the view of Hume, we can only trust our five senses, and these fail to provide enough data for us to achieve Total Objectivity. For Kant, we can add to our five senses the a priori synthetic Categories of the Pure Understanding, but even these will fail to provide enough data for us to achieve Total Objectivity. For Nietzsche, we never contact Objective Reality \u2014 we can only see the world through our individual Will to Power \u2014 and that is all we can ever really know. GWF Hegel, back in 1810, challenged Immanuel Kant and those who would agree with him. For Hegel, the human mind is powerful enough to grasp Objective Reality, the Absolute Idea, the Geist, and although this has not yet been attained by the majority, it can be, by using Dialectical Logic and his Encyclopedic Outline. Karl Marx failed to grasp Hegel\u2019s meaning, although he believed he did grasp it, and he told the world that his Socialist political position was \u201cLeft Hegelian.\u201d That is nonsense. In any case, even Marx denied that we attain Total Objectivity, because the majority, the working class, is dominated by \u201cruling class ideology.\u201d And for that reason, he claimed, only the Marxist has seen Objective Reality, so that the majority of workers should (blindly) follow the Marxists. The USSR was created in 1918 due to such Non-Objective thinking, and it and fell in 1990, because it\u2019s dream failed to match Objective Reality. In conclusion, in order to grasp True Objectivity we must get back to Hegel. ",

            "answer_text": "Not so far. There is no truth or objectivity because our understanding of the world is through our senses which cause us pain if we don\u2019t get the right answers. Individuals might ignore the pain to stick with a truth but it really doesn't work long term, like playing chess against yourself, doesn\u2019t work. The reason to know anything is driven by our feelings, nothing makes sense without them. And then the world and life, (I mean we have no clue how life started) is a complete mystery. We can\u2019t know what the truth is until we know everything about everything, and all indications to me are that we\u2019ll never know. I think we built our lives and beliefs out of thin air, surround them with structures so complex that they feel real enough to live by. And that\u2019s good, like building a raft in the sea, making it stronger and bigger so it feels like the whole world, and might last a thousand years. But a bad storm might destroy it all as might happen to our society or planet because we are not in complete control of the universe. So how could we know the truth or be objective! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m interpreting your question to mean is it possible for people to have pure or objective knowledge. To experience reality objectively would seem to be impossible, since each of us looks though a certain set of lenses. In other words, because we are products of given cultures and develop certain world views, preconceptions, and biases, we interpret the world and experiences of the world accordingly. So how can anyone claim to have a truly objective view of reality? Well, it\u2019s not as though no one has ever attempted to view and experience reality without preconceptions or biases. One attempt that comes to mind is phenomenology and the \u201cphenomenological reduction\u201d and the \u201cexperience of astonishment.\u201d The idea here is that my immediate experience of a phenomena, prior to my preconceptions kicking in, is when I may have a \u201cpure or objective\u201d view of reality. Another source to explore when attempting objectivity is \u201cOn Education,\u201d by Krishnamurti. His ideas on what education should consist of involves developing a consciousness that sees what is, i.e., that sees reality. There isn\u2019t space here to explain his teachings on how to do this, but a phrase that he is famous for is to \u201cobserve the observer.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if either the phenomenologists or Krishnamurti\u2019s teaching are entirely successful in leading one to a true objectivity. Perhaps we can only approach objectivity on a continuum. It\u2019s a really interesting idea to investigate. ",
