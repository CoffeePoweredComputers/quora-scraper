            "answer_text": "You have no other choice but to look forward - past has already happened, and your life is happening now, so past is not an option. As they say - it does not matter how many times you've been knocked down, it only matters how many times you got up; if you were down 7 times but you got up 8 times, you are still better than those laying on the ground. Past is something you already know, something you can examine in your free time, and something that has made you who you are now - all those happy and sad times, all those lessons, all were in order to get to where you are now. If you are happy where you are, which is not exactly evident from the wording and the tone of your question, then you can stay where you are - there is no future police who are checking on everyone's personal growth. If you want something different, then you must move forward. That's your only option. There is a wonderful quote, Only dead fish go with the flow - and I doubt you are among that dead fish just yet.  And should you again be down in your mood or your luck or whatever you want to call it, just say to yourself, Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. Pain will always come - from you and from others, from events, from accidents, and without any reason - but you can refuse to suffer from it. And if you refuse to suffer, it means you need to figure out the way to the light and do all in your power to deal with the consequences of your pain. No one else will come to your rescue, unless you're a President or someone who can afford to have bodyguards, so you are all that you have. You should keep yourself focused.  About life itself - each of us makes sense of it to the best of our knowledge and abilities. Some love the journey, some want improvements. It does not matter what you choose, as long as you do not deliberately harm another person (except in self-defense) and try to help others whenever you can. ",

Is life just a journey or a chance to prove yourself to the world? \"The unexamined life is not worth living\"  --  Socrates \"There is nothing to prove. There is nothing to disprove. There is nothing to be gained by seeking approval. There is nothing to be gained by seeking disapproval. Improvement comes from living life fully.\" -- Lar Short The way my life has played out so far has been one of continual self-improvement. It is probably due to being suicidally depressed since I was five years old. I started questioning the religion I was born into at 12 years old. I entered therapy at 13 years old. By 16, I was a Buddhist.  I did EST (See Stephen Martin's answer to What is a time that you drank the koolaid and why you were happy that you had?). I tried everything from A to Z, acupuncture to Zen. I tried evidence based psychotherapies and some really way out New Age healing techniques. I got certified in neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). My sister calls me the therapy junky.  I've been on medication cocktails for my depression for the past 20 years. I have done two series of electoconvulsive therapy (ECT). I have done various meditation retreats including a 5 day mindfulness retreat that was followed a weekend long solo dark retreat. I've been hypnotized hundreds of times. The list goes on. In summary, life for me has been a journey of introspection. At 54 years old, I don't think I will be stopping anytime soon.

Thinking Life being an incredible journey or chance to prove yourself to the world or some other wonderful metaphors whichever we feel it to be close to us. IMHO, the life is never constant.  At any point of time, the life has can give you all possible scenarios. Some time the life will be like an incredible journey, and some times like a scenario where you need to prove yourself to the world. Both are possible. And the trick lies in when you need to stop the journey and decide to prove yourself to the world.  Learn as many things in your journey and disembark at a place and show who you are to the world. Knowing the structure of this metaphor means knowing a number of correspondences between the two conceptual domains of life and journeys, such as these: The person leading a life is a traveler.His purposes are destinations.The means for achieving purposes are routes.Difficulties in life are impediments to travel.Counselors are guides.Progress is the distance traveled.Things you gauge your progress by are landmarks.Choices in life are crossroads.Material resources and talents are provisions.                                                                 - Justin Rossow Travel how much ever you want, learn how much ever you want, choose any direction from the crossroads you meet, but, when you see a place where you think you can fully utilize the lessons you learned on your journey, just get down and start living and show who you are to this world.  Always a hybrid of things gives you more advantages and less disadvantages, if you know how to balance it properly. So, IMO, Balancing the Journey and looking for the chance to prove to the world is what I try to do and look towards in my life. Thanks for the wonderful A2A. Cheers :) ",

            "answer_text": "I strongly believe in the maslow pyramid of needs. If you are always struggling on the lower levels, there will be never a chance to prove yourself to the world. Lets take a boy who lives on the street in a poor country such as Bangladesh, Somalia, etc. From his early childhood on, life is about to survive. He will definitely many tricks to survive better. But there is almost no \"free will\" involved in a way that he can shape his own destiny. He will most likely always need to react on his environment to make sure that he survives. Lets take then a girl who is the daughter of a millionaire in a rich country. From early childhood on, she is the center of everything. She has lots of freedom, she can choose what she wants. Maybe she plans to be an actress, maybe she decides to give live a more deep meaning and get involved into humanitarian project or she simply decides to do nothing than just spend the money of her daddy. Lets take another example. This time, we have a boy who is diagnosed with down-syndrom or something even heavier. His lifespan will be short, his potential to do something \"bigger\" is small. It is a huge life success, if he will be able to live in a community and handle some basic things by himself. To answer your question: * Do they have to prove themselves to the world? Absolutely. But everyone in each own way. The first kid has to survive. The second may struggle with boredom and maybe has to find her meaning of life. And the third kid targets maybe to do what the others are able to do since they were very small in later years * Is life a journey for them? They might perceive it that way, although most likely at least two of them will rarely reflect on that. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: How do you look towards life. Is life just a journey or a chance to prove yourself to the world? Life is an ever changing landscape of hope, fear, and death. If one is lucky in this journey he finds love and peace on this trip, but he knows all is fleeting. Life is therefore a struggle between good and evil. One's life is spent discerning what is good and what is evil. If he is able to, or thinks he has learned from these forces, he must then set about how to adjust his life to minimize evil and maximize good. This is why life is a battle of the will and the world. Some succeed and some fail, but sadly, most never understand much of this. Why? They are consumed by their own survival threats- poverty, disease, water, and food. We all start out with these same forces present in our lives. What we do with what we experience measures our lives. Any proof of our abilities is told of us once we enter the grave. Those who knew us are the judges. Ask them about those you knew, who have gone on in life without you, for their answer to this question. Thanks, Anusha Sridharan, for the A2A. I hope this answers your query. ",

Life means different things to different people.  A famous saint of India Sai Baba described life in following words Life is a song - sing it.  Life is a game - play it.  Life is a challenge - meet it.  Life is a dream - realize it.  Life is a sacrifice - offer it.  Life is love - enjoy it.  Sholom Aleichem described life as Life is a dream for the wise,  a game for the fool,  a comedy for the rich,  a tragedy for the poor. Maxim Gorky said, When work is a pleasure, life is a joy!  When work is a duty, life is slavery. In the words of Nikita Khrushchev Life is a great school.  It thrashes and bangs and teaches you. In fact, when search Google with the word \u2018life is like\u2019 it threw so many results of images.    The fact is that life is everything as this ancient story of \u2018Six blind men and an Elephant\u2019 explains Six blind men were asked to determine what an elephant looked like by feeling different parts of the elephant's body. The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe. A king explains to them: \u201cAll of you are right. The reason every one of you is telling it differently is because each one of you touched the different part of the elephant. So, actually the elephant has all the features you mentioned.\u201d  Let us learn to enjoy life in all its colours and shades.  ",

Is Life a journey to me? Well Life actually does n't have a starting location and ending location. While yes it has a start and end in time. From that angle yes it is close to that B. Is Life a chance to prove yourself to the world? Well I was thinking of this when I was young. Later realized all that is useless. If possible I would like to 'prove' for myself - but not for the 'world'. World as a group of individuals are least bothered about what you do or dont.. Any thing you do to prove to the world still does n't qualify that you will be satisfied OR world will be satisfied. So as far as the civilization is concerned, we just need to contribute our might back..to its cause ! Need not worry about 'proving' etc.,  So what actually I would like to accomplish in my life - A. Learn and Learn to become more simple and simpler And also win over all the falsities I have experienced when young and shatter those and come out as much as I can B. Be helpful to others in every manner easily possible ",

            "answer_text": "For me, Life is a beautiful journey and the destination is unknown. Its like travelling on a road which is not smooth. There is something great in the end, so its a journey worth it.  Its a journey with ups and downs. You face challenges, hardships, joys and pleasant moments. Its like travelling in a path which is not known, but exploring whatever comes by. Indeed there is a chance for proving yourself- you can take the path followed by everyone or take something that is less traveled and find a way out. There are obstacles, that come in your way, stopping you from reaching the destination. How effectively you make use of your strengths, resources available and overcome those obstacles indeed matters-its a way of proving yourselves.  You meet people while travelling. They may travel with you till a particular destination and then get down when they find their way. Some may continue the journey with you, some may leave. Some guide you to reach your destination, some may misguide you. They are all a part of your journey. The memories you get through the journey is something priceless. You can call it treasure. All in all, its a journey that is to be explored, and its worth it. There is ample space for proving yourself and have no fear on moving a step forward. Thanks for the A2A,Anusha :) ",

Brick is surjective of collection. Wall is injective to output. I know it might really seem like some stupid relevances with absolutely no correlation.My fortune mind gazes at things that way. What do I conclude of things I shared right now?Milestones are meant to be made for what life is a journey and you need to know your progress levels.See the point I made?

At the end of the day, you will die and be forgotten. You only need to prove yourself to yourself,because its people who hold themselves back. And when you hold yourself back, you never really live. Because you are too afraid to take that risks, you are too afraid to demand more from life, you are too afraid to be yourself.....etc Anyway, I believe Life is all about the journey, because at the end of the day, it will be about how you lived your life, what you did and the people you did it too, the hearts you touched and hurt, the memories with your loved ones, you remember your first kiss, how your heart melted when you first met the love of your life, etc...I'm getting a little bit carried away here.

Become what? Fuller. Richer. More experienced. More compassionate. More loving.  More you.
