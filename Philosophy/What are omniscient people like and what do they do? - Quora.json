Also, if two omniscient people were in the same room, they would not have anything to say. A conversation would go like this. Me] Sorry about your toenail fungus. You] I know you are . Thanks. Your car will get stolen next week. Sorry about that. Me] I'll make sure my laptop isn't in it and increase the insurance. You] You sure enjoy those porn sites. Uh Oh! . . . ",

There are at least six basic theories of omniscience that I know of, and I have attempted to provide formulas which solve the problems native to each domain: Programmable Heuristics Objective Knowledge: categorical deduction.General Solution to All Problems: paroxysm.Psychic Prediction: oracles and psychic techniques.Knowing the Nature: formula for the souls of literature.Guessing the Appropriate Thing: formula for knowing the ideal question.Formula for Creativity: How to do something new if desired.I suppose someone with eidetic memory and some creativity could act omniscient using these formulas.
