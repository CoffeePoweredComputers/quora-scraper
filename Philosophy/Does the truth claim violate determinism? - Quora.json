            "answer_text": "I may be missing something here, but I would say that whether a claim is ultimately the result of an unavoidable chain of events (determinism) or whether it is just the result of a more random, non-deterministic consideration of ideas doesn\u2019t make a difference as to the possibility of its truth. I would say that we probably don\u2019t know anything for absolutely certain, but our decisions tend to be made on the basis of what we think could possibly happen. Therefore, we make our choices on the supposition that something is true, because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t perceive the choices to exist in the first place. Put more simply: I see no reason to think that non-predetermined thought provides a more adequate basis for reasoning or certainty than predetermined thought based on past events does. ",
