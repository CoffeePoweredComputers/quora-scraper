            "answer_text": "No it doesn't. Some people are rich because they won the lottery. Some people are rich because they inherited from family. Some a rich because they worked hard to get it. Success is not always about money, it is about achieving aims and goals. Good athletes are successful at what they do but it doesn't follow that they will be rich , a lot are mere amateurs such as Olympians. Some people become wealthy through achieving their goals , but is usually superficial to what they originally set out to achieve. That was their success, not the wealth it brought. That happened to be a bonus. Money to a lot of people means everything , especially when you don't have it. But it is not the b all and end all of life. What has fame and fortune done for Macaulay culkin , only brought him misery . I bet sometimes he wishes he was never famous. ",

            "answer_text": "Both rich and successful are relative terms. Having 2 million dollars is being rich to many people but probably not to Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Being successful is also relative. We all have our own goals and dreams and if we achieve them we can feel we are successful. To me being successful means having a rich life. The term rich life has little to do with money and far more to do with having a life that feels fulfilled. That may often be a life that is rich with a good family life, good friends and having the kind of success in life you hoped to have. Now everyone might want to be a billionaire but most don\u2019t set that as an achievable goal. A doctor may find satisfaction knowing he has helped people lead a healthier life and a lawyer may feel satisfaction knowing he has helped people with life\u2019s problems. The average person may feel he has had a good carrier and provided a nice life for his family. Those things are what makes someone successful. Some of the richest people I have known were really miserable inside. Money is not happiness and money is not success. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. Being rich is having a large amount of money, but there are other life aspects to be filled out, like family, friends, even personal goals. For example: Imagine you love piano and spend your free time listening to instrumental piano music but when you where young, your family encourage you to a more profitable career (from their perspective) and you became an investor, earned big, but still wanting to learn piano\u2026 no matter how large you made, you won\u2019t feel complete. Being successful is reaching your goals. They don\u2019t have to be money related. ",
