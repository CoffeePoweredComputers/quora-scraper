            "answer_text": "What causes family estrangement? Usually some sort of unresolved wrong. My ex wife relocated with our kids numerous times, over my futile objections. To the next county, then a different city, then across country and then bounced around a few more times. Every time, chasing or following some guy. My two oldest kids resented it, complained about it, and eventually rebelled and refused to go back to their moms. My oldest did it as an 18yr old high school senior so that she could get instate tuition. She resented her mom for not going along with it and then for not helping her with college, but eventually they got past it to have a functioning, if somewhat strained relationship. My middle child refused to return after visiting me over the summer. She\u2019d been lobbying to live with me and her older sister was was living with me and going to college, but her mom refused, so she took matters into her own hands. I told her mom that she was refusing to go and she was welcome to come and talk to her about it. So she did. She flew here in a rage and showed up at the door with a cop, who she had told I was refusing to return our daughter. I went outside and chatted with the cop while she went in to take our daughter. She never got past her locked bedroom door and eventually stormed off in a rage. Some words were said\u2026 For a long time after that, my daughter refused all communication with her mom. She eventually agreed to see her, but only in a situation where she felt like she had some control (as if her mom was going to kidnap her). It\u2019s been a while. She\u2019s now a college senior and she will talk to her mom, but she won\u2019t go visit. ",

            "answer_text": "Selfishness , irresponsibilities , not ready to sacrifice . Accepting they are not part of the family may cause the family to split or their existence seems in a denial . In many cases it can stretch further that they will not see or meet each other . If they are fortunate and there is some body with in them who tries to keep in touch . He can feel the sense of responsibility that he needs to take the lead . He is capable to save them reaching to the brink of disaster . Unless there is no sense of realising the importance of the family . The flaw will be very obvious .Even an outsider can tell how close nit is the family . Do they respect each other , Do they love each other . Do they maintain a regard for each other or no. Each member of the family needs to know he is part of his family . He is proud to be one of that family . Which is his family . Their shortcomings no doubt can be covered up by the one who is more alert and concerned . He is protecting the family by most of the means . But at a larger scale not all can afford to remain responsible . In most cases the parents are playing a very important role to keep the family intact . The children are bound to meet each other as long as their parents are alive . Their presence plays a vital role . We siblings were obliged to meet each other as long as our mother was alive . There was a drastic halt the moment our mother passed away . The house closed down . Where we all would gather regularly . Slowly all ceased and stopped . The house sold away . We had no excuse . No place to see each other . Slowly gradually we all dispersed . Two of my brothers passed away . Their absence gave us a biggest excuse. Unfortunately one of the two was keeping us together . It fell like a jolt on our family . I am trying to cite example of my family . As how we became estranged to each other . We were left with no space , nor reason or excuse to remain in the same shape as what we used to be when my mother was alive . On top most of us left the town where my mother lived . Though it was only a chance that a vacuum is created among us , Which in a way could not be avoided . Sooner or later it had to dawn on our family and finally it did . Well , these are the harsh realities of life that the family at one stage becomes estranged and are stretched apart . This is how we human race grow further . ",
