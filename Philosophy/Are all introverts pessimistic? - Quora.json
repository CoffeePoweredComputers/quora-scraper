Urban Dictionary: Introvert In short, an introvert is someone who feels drained after too much social interaction. I can see how one might think all introverts are pessimists (introverts tend to be more quiet and reserved than others), but the truth is that this belief is a false generalization; There are plenty of introverts who have just as much, if not more, optimism as ambiverts and extroverts. The same way all extroverts aren\u2019t optimists, all introverts aren\u2019t pessimists. ",

            "answer_text": "Positive emotion disposition is significantly related to the personality trait extroversion. Therefore the more one is extroverted, the more likely one is to experience positive emotion. See Shiota et al 2006 (The Journal of Positive Psychology) for a study on this. It wouldn't be correct to say that all those who are introverted are pessimistic or that all those who are extroverted are optimistic. ",
