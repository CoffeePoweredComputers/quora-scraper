            "answer_text": "Observation: One finds truths contrary to popular opinion by means of observation, using your own first-hand sensory data. Stop caring whether you have permission from your group to see what you saw and hear what you heard. The group may determine group policy, but it can\u2019t determine what you really saw and heard, or what it means to you. Critical Thinking: Critically analyze the evidence for yourself. Employ intellectual discipline, reasoning on the available evidence. Don\u2019t rush to belief, but rather take your time forming conclusions based on evidence. Understanding: Compare new evidence and tentative conclusions to facts you\u2019ve previously verified and conclusions you\u2019ve previously formed for yourself. Question things that contradict facts and conclusions you\u2019ve already verified. Intuition and Metacognition: If you can, use intuition to plausibly fill in the missing gaps. In that case, metacognition is important to discern between what you really know and what you\u2019ve only estimated. Intellectual Sovereignty: No one has a right to tell you what to think. You have as much right as anyone to consider the evidence and draw your own conclusions. Stand up for that right. You can tell. Trust yourself. There is no one more worthy of your trust than you yourself. Question \u201cauthority\u201d. News Sources: Compare reports about the same events from independent sources and see where they overlap. Understand the agendas and compensate. Learn to detect deception and filter it. Never trust any one news source 100%. Trust is always relative until you can verify first hand for yourself, if ever. Popular Opinion is not an indicator of truth. It is often an indicator of falsehood. Truth has nothing to do with popular opinion. Popular culture is heavily manipulated by propaganda, and more often false than true. You only begin to discover how false it is after you begin the search for truth. Truth Is the degree of alignment between an idea or statement and the reality it is claimed to represent. It\u2019s not that complicated. Why Does It Matter? Like a clock that doesn\u2019t care whether you\u2019re in a hurry, veracity is unaffected by who believes it. Truth is unchanged by bias, agenda, or propaganda; and can save you from lies, and make your response informed, and therefore effective. Insisting on reality is how you choose the soul-nourishing elegant simplicity of the pristine natural world over the garbage dump of delusion, artificiality, illusions of \u201csophistication\u201d or prestige, self-serving deception, mind games, and authoritarian mental slavery. The truth matters because living your life, thinking your own thoughts, and owning yourself matters. You are free.  ",
