            "answer_text": "I work as a nurse and a lot has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic. I can't even enter the hospital without filling out a mandatory questionnaire regarding COVID-19 symptoms. After providing negative answers to all of the questions I am provided a surgical mask to wear for the entirety of my shift. All of my patients are swabbed for COVID-19 before they are admitted to the labor and delivery unit. COVID-19-positive patients are kept on the antepartum unit at the end of the hallway. Every so often I am pulled to antepartum to take care of COVID-19-positive mothers and their infants. I have to wear full PPE and do my charting in an empty room far away from the nurses' station. I get my blood drawn every two weeks to test for COVID-19 antibodies. It has been a big adjustment, but I actually don't mind taking care of COVID-19 patients. Sometimes I go in place of co-workers who would rather not do it. Once I meet the patient with COVID-19 my anxiety totally subsides. I'm reminded that I'm caring for an actual person rather than a scary diagnosis. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, I have had to train most of my clients online using Zoom, Whatsapp, Skype, or Webex, or any varient of a video-chat app. Also, as a personal trainer, I am limited to the amount of exercise accessories I can use on my clients because, well, most of us don\u2019t have a well-stocked gym in our homes. Some clients do have dumbbells, barbells, weight balls, a squat rack, etc. But many of my clients just have a few little dumbbells or they may not have anything at all except the furniture in their home. In addition, because I am training clients in their homes, I have to take in consideration the space where they work. fortunately, staying fit with limited resources isn\u2019t hard. For one, I have them get creative and use water bottles for weights, towels for sliders (if they have hardwood floor) or rice bags for lifting. In addition, much of my training has shift to functional/bodymovement exercise, and one can do a lot with just their body alone when it comes to different exercises. I have also become more adapted to teaching fitness classes on line, which means I had to rearrange some things in my bedroom so that I could be fully viewed by those taking the classes. Of course, there\u2019s still some things I have to work out, such as video lighting and what not, but so far it\u2019s been good When I do train people in-person, I wear a mask while training them, and for the part, I no longer touch them (when you are doing personal training, you may touch the person to make sure they\u2019re in proper form, etc). Also, so far, I\u2019ve been training my in-person clients either outside or in the garage, but not in their homes. And since gyms are no longer open (or at least, not in my area yet) I have had to build up my own gym, and I have learned more about body movement, and this is what I have been teaching my clients. I have never been at home so much in my life, but it has had advantages and disadvantages. In some ways I have had some better success with online training than when I was doing training at the gym, even. Anyway, that\u2019s how things have changed for work, at least for me. ",

But, as this whole story unfolds, it is obvious even for the deaf and blind, that there are OTHER motives beside the ones stated..! Bringing all these restrictions and shutting down the economies worldwide helped to create the crisis that is still only on its way. They do not concern themselves by the fact that their medicine is worse than the disease\u2026 It is a feature, not a bug..! This crisis will enable our Dear Leaders to rework the money-system and take us into a new era of slavery and terror. I hate to tell you, but within a year the world will be unrecognizable\u2026 You know how, if you seen the foretelling \u201928 days later\u2019 movie. There will be no escape. So, be prepared..! The door is still open. ",

I still have to go into work if I need to use the high-end mapping program. Google Maps is fine for preliminary drafts, but sometimes you need something a little more professional. Our IT department is working to get me access to almost everything online, but it requires using a company laptop which are in short supply. I can wait. I have been using my personal equipment so far and I don't mind going in to work a couple of times each week. ",

However, I\u2019m 78, have a compromised immune system from arthritis treatments, and have COPD. If I get the bug, the chances are pretty close to 100% that it will kill me. Right now, Instacart shoppers \u2014 I know a few who are still doing it \u2014 are making very good money. Tips are way up, I guess because people appreciate not having to shop for themselves. It kills me to hear how much I could make if I were still working. But you can\u2019t spend it if you\u2019re dead, and I do have some fallback savings. Life is all about reacting to the curve balls.
