            "answer_text": "No. Critical theory is not one thing. The term \u201ccritical theory\u201d refers to a number of diverse approaches in the social sciences, all of which have a critical approach to understanding questions of how power is organized and structured in modern societies. Most schools of critical theory are anti-racist and attempt to analyze and deconstruct the causes that give rise to racism, mostly with the intention of combating it. ",

But they feel they have to be cautious a while longer, like the suits at Wannasee. So it\u2019s nebulous words.. \u201cwhiteness\u201d paint a picture around the edges of the crowd of people you don\u2019t like but don\u2019t quite fill it in, the exact designation .. not yet. Time will come.. when it\u2019s you, you, you and you. Names and wrist numbers. Jesus, it takes circumlocution to a whole new level, to build a whole syllabus and system around a nebulosity of \u2018whiteness\u2019 to justify fear and loathing.
