            "answer_text": "Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives, we may not feel good without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day...for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. God is testing us in our short life on earth; the wealthy father has the right to test his children before distributing the wealth. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. The test environment necessitates struggle between good and evil. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that test as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-our-purpose-of-existence-in-this-world/answer/Sabri-Shahin We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. For those who have doubts, they can ask God. All prophets have urged us to ask God and taught that God would answer us. Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us.

            "answer_text": "Do you know what makes the answer of \u201c42\u201d so funny? The joke behind this scene from \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d is that you, as a person that seeks meaning, expects a specific and definite answer - and here you get an exact answer - 42, to be specific - as if life was a mathematical equation with a definitive and exact solution. The lesson of that anecdote from the movie is that life\u2019s has no accurate meaning. You can\u2019t turn life into a mathematical equation and expect an accurate answer for its hidden meaning. Life isn\u2019t equivalent to a math problem with a specific result that we have yet to discover. Life isn\u2019t accurate like the calculation of numbers are. The question remains: what is life? Life is simply a biological occurrence, and there is no exact purpose for that occurrence beyond the one or even the several that you choose to grant it as long as it lasts. And you know what? You don\u2019t even have to adapt a meaning to your life if you can do well in life without it. Therefore even having a meaning is not necessarily life\u2019s meaning. You can do (or not to do) whatever you want in your limited time being alive. There is no equivalent result, there\u2019s no \u201c42\u201d that we should all aspire for. The joke\u2019s probably might not on the issue about meaning of life, but on us, believing that there\u2019s an exact and universal one as a justification for going on in life and not killing ourselves. Thanks to Jenna Ravenstone for requesting my answer. ",
