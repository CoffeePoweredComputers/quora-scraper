            "answer_text": "That would primarily depend upon how you would define MGTOW and its core as well as peripheral ideas/attitudes Just the pure \u2018go your own way\u2019 part or all women are demons from hell incarnated on earth solely for the purpose of inflicting mental (and/or physical) pain upon men for kicks. If you were to subscribe to the \u2018go your own way\u2019 portion alone, then ideally there shouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with that regardless of the useless and nonsensical extrapolation of if all men were to do so, our society would be doomed. (In japan however they even came up with a simulation as well as an actual date for when their race would go extinct due to the prevalence of \u2018otaku\u2019 as well as other demographic conditions. But I think thats all pure conjecture. ) And more importantly there should be nothing stopping Indian men from making that decision if they wish to. If men cant make these decisions then, they arent truly free, are they? But given that most of us have strong familial ties (ma dearest included) along with the constant \u2018abhi tak shaadi kyu nahi ki\u2019.. \u2018shaadi karo.. ghar basao\u2019 etc etc like a persistent nagging from all quarters makes it most difficult. Also its not like after marriage, we all step into some utopian cloud of happy ever after. People are messy, complicated bundles of emotions and irrationality. Men and Women. hmm... maybe women a bit more. Everyone claims that successful marriages are built on willing to make sacrifices. That itself is a big problem. Who makes how many sacrifices? And if one person is willing to make more sacrifices, can that be used as leverage by the other? Marriages/Relationships are no guarantee for happiness. Lots of them gradually end up losing the so called \u2018spark\u2019 and then lead to infidelity, arguments and just a sense of apathy if it doesn\u2019t end in divorce/split. And this is without the messy complication of kids. But on the other hand given that human beings generally do better in close knit groups and relationships, having that close bond generally has benefits like longer life and better health. Though getting say 5 more years and so you can reach 90 instead of 85 may not seem like a \u2018great\u2019 benefit. My personal issue with MGTOW is that its a bit too new to certify that going your own way is going to make you more happy than capitulating to societal demands and traditions and getting into relationships/marriages. What if after 40 years all MGTOW-ers end up having regrets? After all, the statement \u2018its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved\u2019 is pretty old.. And maybe.. just maybe.. those old timers had more wisdom that we do nowadays. ",

            "answer_text": "My opinion on what MGTOW should be: The label isn\u2019t important, just like other labels, but the philosophy might be. MGTOW is for men who are fed up of relationships or chasing women or dating/arranged marriage search, etc. I don\u2019t like to think that MGTOW is necessarily due to women or feminism, but mainly due to the unreasonable demands put upon men these days. Women are doing as well as men in terms of careers and earning money, however, they (or their families) still expect that a man should be earning several times over her. I feel that some sense of self entitlement is also there in many women, for example, the man should take her to expensive hotels, buy expensive gifts and so on. Further, dating is still frowned upon in society. As long as arranged marriages are the norm, couples will not get time to adjust and know each other beforehand, this often leads to frustration, resentment and divorces. Overall, I feel there is a demand supply gap too. There are still lesser women than men in colleges, universities and work places, and that leads to more demand for educated and working women than men. Simple economics wins and some men are left out with nothing on their hands. Some men accept whatever woman they can get to date/marry, while the more selective ones wait for the right woman, or temporarily engage in whatever flings they can get into and again get out disappointed by the whole thing . An important issue these days is the hyper sexual stimuli prevailing everywhere in the mainstream media as well as over the internet. Hyper sexual stimulus misguides male minds from properly choosing mates and developing relationships. To illustrate, see figures below:  Idealized Indian Woman  Real Indian Woman Overall, various factors contribute towards male disappointment from relationships with women, perhaps some women are also to be blamed for it, but not all and some societal/modern trends are also to be blamed for it. So, ultimately the philosophy for MGTOW should be: Keep away from pornography/sexually stimulating material on mediaStop any form of online dating, online marriage, hanging out in bars/pubs etc for women. Stop chasing women.Learn to stay comfortable with yourself. Know that you complete yourself.Start working on larger goals like doing that PhD you wanted, or starting your own business, writing a book, or becoming financially independent.MGTOW doesn\u2019t mean that one should be disrespectful or resentful of women. They are individuals like us and deserve our respect.MGTOW also doesn\u2019t mean playing video games all day and living with your parents. If that is supposed to be the outcome of your philosophy, then its better to go out and date women.Finally, although you don\u2019t make an active effort to get into a relationship, but if things begin to work out with someone, you can get into a relationship.",
