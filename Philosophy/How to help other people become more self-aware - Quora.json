            "answer_text": "Hi Sara, Thank you for the A2A. Anyone who wraps their lolly stick in tissue paper is very careful. I may be answering a very self aware person here! I don\u2019t know how one makes others interested in self awareness. I have been very interested in this topic for a while. I started writing answers in the Meditation/Mindfulness/Enlightened sections of Quora and noted a bizarre lack of self awareness in approx 50% of the Quorans claiming to be Enlightened. That fascinated me. I\u2019m always intrigued by incongruencies. I find it\u2019s where the richest learning is to be mined. So I dived in. Where I found them I started pointing out inconsistencies and contradictions in the \u2018Enlightened person\u2019s\u2019 answers. I know language and words are crude and so the point wasn\u2019t really about the logic as much as about the person\u2019s reactions. It was very clear that self awareness was evident in some of them. The conversation flowed and there was no resistence to exploring things that might otherwise prick the ego. Exploration happened both ways. In quite a few of the \u2018Enlightened responders\u2019 the reaction was to become more and more grasping at being right and clinging to a position. I would then point out the behaviour I saw. This would get them irritated (although they wouldn\u2019t admit such a thing, being Enlightened) In one case they told me that I was annoying and to fuck off. In another case I offered to skype with the \u2018Enlightened person\u2019 with a view to give feedback on where I perceived blind spots in their self awareness. They initially were very keen but then wrote back that they felt very uncomfortable with such a situation and blocked me. There were other similar situations and the outcome was blocking. The answers they often gave on Quora re awakening were very good. So the only conclusion I could come to was that Awakening does not in itself cause Self Awareness, nor does it cause the humility to even explore it on a personal level. I suppose another conclusion could be that they were frauds but I\u2019m not sure about that in all of the cases. One or two I think were academically understanding of what awakening constitutes, they were fundamentalists and never veered from quoting texts and refused to share any personal experiences. Others, did seem to have had an awakening experience, but definitely lacked the capacity (humility, lack of fear) for consideration of any feedback. One demonstrates psychopathy and sadism and yet talks a very good game. Another just found it scarey. A few others were spiritual obsessives and the mission was proseltysing. Self awareness was not even on the agenda. As I mentioned, there were some who were totally flexible, open-minded and had no resistence to the process. Interestingly I observed that they had the least contradictions and incongruencies in their anwers to start with. My conclusion is that I think the un-self aware ones had awakening glimpses but ego had come back to the extent that there was no capacity for self awareness to grow. They were able to wax lyrical about Enlightened mind but had sufficient ego and lack of self awareness to be oblivious to their incongruencies, contradictions and character flaws. In the one case psychopathy and sadism had continued, I suspect, from prior to the glimpse of awakening, to after it. They have quite a few followers on Quora including others claiming to be Awakening Guides etc. Again self awareness is not sufficiently present to spot the glaring dysfunction and abusive desires in others. If some awakened people can\u2019t cope with looking at themselves objectively with external feedback how hard must it be for people who have not had that ego relaxing experience. My current observations about self awareness is that you can be born with it and you can develop it. To develop it humility must be in place. Nothing reduces humility like being brought to ones knees by suffering. Counselling can be an extremely rich environment within which to develop self awareness, personal development courses can too. Spiritual groups can too,but without the ego crushed by suffering, spiritual bypassing can be the truth of that environment a lot more than genuine self awareness. Ironically the spiritual scene is full of people desparately hiding from their shadow side. Given what I\u2019ve found above from my limited exploration into this on Quora I now understand much better how dodgy gurus and dodgy teachers carry dysfunction, a lack of self awareness and some deep insights into the nature of reality. The glimpse of the true nature of reality can leave us with the knowledge and the ego intact. It can also leave dysfunction, sadism and abusive tendencies intact. If this has piqued anyone\u2019s interest in self awareness then I may have inadvertantly answered the question in a small way. Hope you enjoyed the lolly! ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t. Many wise men throughout history have realized how futile it is trying to make someone do something they don\u2019t want to. Sure, we can make life unendurable for them\u2026. but even then it\u2019s still their choice. Fundamentally, we simply cannot force someone to do anything\u2026. and if we succeed in doing so short term, it will certainly backfire in the long run. With that being said, now you need to get them to want to do it for themselves. Now the game is all psychological. This tactic works much better if they believe that they themselves somehow arrived at the realization of their own accord. You simply plant the seed\u2026.. and then they do the rest. Just like with anything organic, not all the seeds will germinate. Just keep trying new approaches and eventually something will resonate. Dale Carnegie speaks of this better than I ever could in his epic, timeless book \u201cHow To Win Friends and Influence People\u201d. All you can do is plant the seed, and create the conditions where that seed may grow. The rest is out of your sphere of control. ",
