            "answer_text": "Psychology is great. I'm biased, I'm a psychologist - I work in research, and some of the time I'm a professor teaching psychology. But I suspect psychology is not what he thinks it is. Freud was mentioned in my undergraduate studies, perhaps four times.  His interpretation of dreams was never mentioned. In a university I have worked at in the past, Freud would never have been mentioned - a student who mentioned that they were interested in Freud would not have been admitted (for their own good - they were going to be disappointed). A big chunk of psychology (perhaps approaching a quarter at universities I have taught at in the UK) was research methods and statistics. Students who came expecting to learn about dreams, and instead  found me teaching you what looked a lot like math (it's not math - just because it involves some numbers does not make it math) were surprised, and not always happy.  However, if he's interested in electronics, he might do well in psychology. It's a much more scientific and rigorous subject, and someone who is (or was) interested in electronics might actually do well.   Psychology is versatile because, although it's a science, it requires thinking about people - thus psychology graduates have picked up analytic skills, but also the softer skills associated with people. I'm not sure if this increases employability relative to other subjects.   I would try to get hold of a university level introductory textbook - there are several out there called \"Introduction to Psychology\".  Get one that's a couple of editions old, that will be much cheaper and will be just as good at telling him if he's interested.   Alternatively, get him a more specialized book that he might be interested in.  I read this book: http://www.amazon.com/Social-Animal-Elliot-Aronson/dp/1429233419/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1344920602&sr=1-1&keywords=aronson+the+social+animal when I was 17, and that's what decided for me that I would study psychology at university.   This is a book from a very different branch of psychology: http://www.amazon.com/Gut-Feelings-Intelligence-Gerd-Gigerenzer/dp/0143113763/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1344920648&sr=1-1&keywords=gigerenzer . It might be interesting for him if he's interested in 'unconscious' cognitive processes. (There are a couple of others by the same author - they're all good.) ",

            "answer_text": "The dream of my life was to study psychology. It started out when I was in the 6th grade as one of those \u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d kind of thoughts and it stayed with me for years. In the 9th grade I started going to what we call here olympiads (interschool competitions) in psychology, I was obsessing about it and studying all the time, I was even helping others study, I was the best in my school at it etc. Four years later I applied at the Faculty of Psychology and I scored extremely poorly at the exam (to this day I don\u2019t know why). I was pissed off that, after so many years of work I had so little achievement, so I withdrew my application. I ended up studying foreign languages, one of the other two things I was very good at. It went well and I loved it. I later found out that what I thought I would study at the Faculty of Psychology had NOTHING to do with what I was expecting to study, so I realised that my \u201cfailure\u201d was a blessing in disguise. We didn\u2019t have \u201ccoaching\u201d or \u201ctraining\u201d back then, there was nothing like that and no word for it, but a few years ago I started realising that my expectations regarding psychology were actually lined up with coaching and training. THIS was what I actually wanted to do, not to be a psychologist, I just didn\u2019t know what it was called and psychology seemed to be the closest. Now I know that there is a cold war between psychologists and coaches. The former say the latter is bogus, and the latter say the former are too rigid and stuck in traditional methods. I studied both and I think that\u2019s the best way to approach someone: by knowing both what a psychologist and a coach would say. I\u2019ve helped a lot of people and there will be more to help, and, frankly, I think this is what all of it is about: helping people. Therefore, to answer your question, why don\u2019t you try to find out if your kid: Really finds meaning in helping others (because this is not for everyone);Doesn\u2019t mistake psychology for coaching/training;Has the true means to pursue this (I know you are a psychologist, but sometimes parents are not the best mentors\u2026 sometimes\u2026).I wish you both good luck and clarity!
