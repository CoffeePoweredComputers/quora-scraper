            "answer_text": "There are so many! Many philosophers and psychologists wrote with some good inspiration about human nature. Some examples : Freud, Jung, Adler, La Bruyere, Vauvnargues, Socrates, Platon, Dostoevsky, Hassel, Balzac and many more authors wrote with inspiration about human nature, life, love and everything. Dostoevsky has ones of the best novels ever written. All his novels all full of scenes and descriptions, which make you to see with clarity an world which seems to be real, despite the fact it does not exist! \u201cThe Brother Karamazov\u201d it is definitely his best novel. The action is a surrealistic one, which captivate you\u2026. totally. The message moral exists and make the readers to admit that Dostoevsky is one of the finest knowledgers of the nature human. Raymond Chandler is the best author of policiers. All his novels are well written. His main character Philip Marlowe inspired many movie directors to ecranize the novels of Chandler. Humphrey Bogart made a great role in one of movies inspired by this character ( Philip Marlowe). \u201cThe long good bye\u201d is clearly his best creation and probably the best ever policier. The action of the book is well structured. Marlowe has another great and tough mission. He must solve a crime (a fake one!) and then a double crime! An unsatisfied and very beautiful woman made these crimes with cold blood. The action is very well presented. Many excellent descriptions about morality and human nature we find in this wonderful world: Marlowe's world. Marlowe is a moral personage in a world lack of morality. You cannot love his way of action! Finally he caught the bad/ poor woman who must suicide herself. Terry Lennox \u2014 one of the main characters of the book, who is a un interesting man, being, like Marlowe said, feeling good with the bad people and in the same way with the good people\u2014 had ability to disguise himself and to simulate his dead. Marlowe discovered this and we have a great final: the lonely detective, who had the ability to solve what the police did not succes. Sven Hassel is a writer who participated at whole second war. All his books are inspired from this experience. He described with a lot of talent scenes from this war, which are very dramatical ones. A lot of history is in his books. A lot about nature human also. He written 14 books about his experience ( according with my knowledge about this). All of are very captivating ones. Many scenes of fight are described by Hassel who was lucky to survive the war. His style is a great one and he must be considered like one of the best ever writers. ",

            "answer_text": "To Kill a Mockingbird(by Harper Lee): The book depicts the hardships of a devoted father & a dutiful lawyer who fights a case for a black man. His kids, Jean and Jim are the main protagonists and their lives are vividly portrayed by Harper Lee. The author dissects every emotion and serves it raw.Misery (by Stephen King): Stephen King has always been appreciated for his art of storytelling,but this book takes it to a whole new level! Its about a writer Paul Sheldon who after falling prey to a car accident, is held hostage by his \u2018greatest fan\u2019 Annie Wilkes. The way hardships and life threatening situations change human beings is portrayed well. Annie is a psychotic who thinks she frees people (fondly calling them \u2018little things\u2019 ) by killing them. Her mood swings and her lashes of anger frighten Paul and in the end it starts affecting his mental and emotional well being.Gone Girl(by Gillian Flynn): The extent to which we humans can go to take revenge is the theme of Gone Girl. Two people madly in love marry each other and that is when everything starts falling apart. As quoted from the book:\u201cWe weren\u2019t ourselves when we fell in love, and when we became ourselves \u2013 surprise! \u2013 we were poison. We complete each other in the nastiest, ugliest possible way.\u201d",
