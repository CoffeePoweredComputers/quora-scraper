            "answer_text": "Rationalism is about reason preceding all. Therefore, reason is the only thing you can be sure of and it is in direct contact with the truth. It apprehends logic, geometry, mathematics and so on. Those are called real concepts that exist according to rationalist criteria and they are true in rationalism. Two special rationalist grades of understanding were framed by Descartes, they state that for any idea and concept to be true it has to be both clear and distinct. There can be no ambiguity in the concept of a circle and it's different from a square, it cannot be both at once and this is the example of true concept. The problem is that we can have clear and distinct ideas of many nonsensical things, but we'll come to that. Empiricism goes against rationalist state of affairs. In Empiricism everything is observational data and we are almost tabula rasa when we are born. As such, Empiricism is a base for modern science since it's grounded in observational data, however, it historically struggles to account for things that it cannot observe and experience. It was notoriously difficult for diehard empiricists (logical positivists) to speak about non-perceivable phenomena, which made them reevaluate their dogma (Quine, The Two Dogmas of Empiricism) as at some point they couldn't speak about atoms, for example, as these couldn't be directly observed by a third person. It is still notoriously hard for empiricist to give a convincing account for mind, since it doesn't exist in the current physics. The tendency is then in Empiricism to reduce these non-physical phenomena to non-existent, or illusions, or to quote P. Churchland, to \u201cbelief in magic\u201d if you believe in them. The hallmark of Empiricism is physicalism and materialism. Pragmatism accepts Cartesian rationalistic points for conceptuality but extends it by one point. Charles Sanders Peirce formulated a so-called pragmatic maxim that includes the special third case; to clear and distinct grades of understanding Peirce adds a third one: effects. In other words effect is a practical bearing of a thing in question. For example, if we think unicorns the idea is clear and distinct for a rationalist, but useless for a pragmatist because it cannot exist, therefore its real application is zero. As such, the nautral progression from stressing effects is that when two concepts lead to the same outcome a pragmatist has little concern for the method involved, as he cheifly values only the outcome. Pragmatism has no preference for rationalism or empiricism as long as they lead to the same extent of progress. ",

            "answer_text": "It is appropriate to start the assessment of these term\u2019s differences by using a dictionary. I refer to Webster\u2019s Collegiate dictionary. The pertinent definition for rationalism is \u201ca theory that reason is in itself a source of knowledge superior to and independent of sense perceptions\u201d. For empiricism, it is \u201cthe practice of relying on observation and experiment especially in the natural sciences\u201d. For pragmatism, it is \u201ca practical approach to problems and affairs\u201d. These definitions seem fairly cut and dried. For humans, empiricism is the direct sensory integration between the person and her environment. Once the environmental stimulation becomes interpreted then rationalism is the conceptual way the interpretation can help implement a pragmatic environmental response if so desired. The differences between these terms can be explained this way. Empiricism is the direct observation of the objective world. Rationalism is the manipulation of the concepts that have been derived from many observations. Pragmatism is the formation of this conceptual manipulation so that the organism can physically achieve its conceptual desires. ",
