            "answer_text": "Short version: No. Details: Common sense is a collection of common ways to react to a situation. It covers everyday life situations but also rare situations. It\u2019s more so about how to navigate a common problem like \u201cDon\u2019t forget to wear your seat belt\u201d or \u201cUse an umbrella to avoid becoming wet.\u201d Philosophy, the love of knowledge, is the study of reality, logic, and our understanding. It covers abstract ideas that can easily go beyond an individual\u2019s life such as \u201cWhy does anything exist?\u201d and \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d From the use of logic, it also shows common sense can be often wrong. Sometimes, it\u2019s more narrow like \u201cDo we still need an umbrella at a water park?\u201d ",
