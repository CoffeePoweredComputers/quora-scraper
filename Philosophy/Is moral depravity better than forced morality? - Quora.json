            "answer_text": "Is moral depravity better than forced morality? I do not think this question can be answered unless the terms are defined by the person asking the question: What is meant by moral depravity? What is meant by forced morality? [I will suggest that the opposing of these two terms (moral depravity v forced morality) is incorrect.] Moral depravity is variously understood in different fields from popular psychology, through behavioural psychology and neurology, forensic definitions and (Reformed) theological dogmas. Popular perceptions do not do anyone justice, the psychopath or victims of psychopathy. Theological perceptions are skewed by sectarian and popular religious presumptions that are not easily connected to actual common experience or practical remedy. They become dogma to be merely assented to and are of little value regarding \"good behaviour\". Far from offering hope, they have historically confused and depressed large groups of sincere \u201cbelievers\u201d. Neuroscience is likely to opt for bio-mechanical interventions at the level at the brain matter. Psychological measures\u2026 well\u2026 I guess we do our best regarding containment but we seem to inevitably fall back on or ultimately depend on enforcement via fear of consequences, fear of society or via drugs. These things seem to be unavoidable according to present understandings and therapies. So, my question is, what is meant by 'moral depravity' and what is meant by 'forced morality'? In any case, I am not so sure that these two constitute a valid coupling for contrasting options, opposites. Perhaps the latter feeds the former in some important ways. The question at hand may well arise from a common notion which assumes (very roughly) that (Reformed) theological definitions of \u201ctotal depravity\u201d mean humanity is (totally) depraved and needs saving from that depravity by force of law or by the divine (unilateral) imposition of the Spirit (mind and character) of God on the individual. This latter might well be understood to be \u201claw written upon the heart\u201d in which case you have a kind of 'moral transplant', somewhat along the lines of the likely outcome of a neuroscientist's tinkering with the brain which would produce largely choice-less conformity. This kind of application of the theological dogma is misguided and destructive; it arises when the apologetic context of the dichotomy of Law V (Gospel) Grace is overlooked in favour of preserving the invalid Law & Grace dualism (i.e., Christ v Judaeo-Christianity). What is missing from this dualism is the fact that the Gospel understands objectified morality (Law) to be a contributing factor to the acting out of moral rebellion; prohibition ups attention to, the value of, the energy of and the cunning of rebellion. This last point is worth considering. What are the sociological and personal (moral) impacts of our legislated societies, of societies and cultures as formed, guided and suppressed by legislators and legislation? e.g., the restraint of psychopathy by law (and even by drugs) is considered necessary under many circumstances, but what is the potential of that basic assumption and practice especially, but not only, when it is used as society's short-cut to dealing with criminal nuisance and psychological disorders? To what extent is psychopathy a result of the pre-emptive suppression of criminal or depraved potential? That, after-all, is to a large extent the structure of legislated cultures (including my native culture) and of the particular popular understanding of the theological dogma alluded to above. [Theologically, the suppression of evil by law is an instrument of \"Caesar\" (who \"does not bear the sword in vain\") while the liberty unto mutual compassion is the business of the gospel which is the assurance of God as all loving Father. \"Welcome home son. Let's feast.\"] So I challenge the coupling and contrast presented in the question. What if \"forced morality\" is a primary cause of moral depravity? That probably should be restated thus: What if pre-emtively forced morality is a primary cause of moral depravity? I think it is an important question and that the obvious implication in the affirmative has theological validity. However, the justification of this view is very threatening to a hell of a lot of religious presumptuousness and influence. Pastoral (approach) notes: 1. The dogmas on depravity must be understood in their technical context which is somewhat polemic in favour of the relatively humanistic (of Jesus, St John and St Paul) in conflict with religious cultures that thrive on prescribed behaviour and conformity to technical abstractions. 2. One most unfortunate consequence of subjective interpretations of (Reformed) theologically defined \"depravity\" (the supposed fundamentally evil nature of all humans) is that preaching gets lost in a broad spectrum of therapies, mental contortions and suggested practices and the purely declarative (fiat like) nature of preaching is lost to folk psychology or even informed psychological exhortation. 3. Pastoral preaching is required not as a therapy but as an all-embracing statement of cosmic fact that undergirds all other efforts, disciplines, fields and arts: God is all loving. Pastoral preaching declares the cosmic setting of grace that makes all other fields (some say 'spheres') worth pursuing, even such that they bear real and lasting fruit. Grace means God approves such efforts. Pastoral preaching cannot assure people in their various fields and efforts when it becomes those other fields, i.e., when its content is reduced to discrete fields even though grace makes those fields and their content powerful tools of divine love. When pastoral preaching, which now only happens once a week in many parishes (for heavens sake!), the congregation inevitably slides into performance measuring which is the antithesis of the Gospel ethos, the ultimate context of all things. 4. ...
