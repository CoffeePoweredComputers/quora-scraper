            "answer_text": "We're definitely perceiving an impression, because perceiving happens in the brain, which is blind, deaf, and unable to smell, touch, or taste. It interprets signals from the sense organs and, from that data, evokes images, sensations, memories, mental models and ideas. Even the raw data isn't the same was what's \"actually out there.\" It's a low-resolution sampling, based on the few signals our bodies are able to detect. For instance, ultra-violate light is just as real as the spectrum we can see, but we can't experience it, except in the form of a metaphor, created by equipment. Some other animals can experience it.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, VR and Reality were fathomed in your own perception of time and action. It leads to the state of confusion then proposing questions about the state of your being. One of our members asked me question similar to yours so my clarification to him was we defined time into several moments in our own conscientiousness. We called them Past, Present, Future so we can somehow intentionally or falsely label them with what we did, doing, will do without giving theses moments a demarcation transitive period. We do have impression but confusingly determining its state of progress based on our own premeditation. So what are you doing you should ask whether you continue what you possibly did (virtual reality) or it has no beginning in the past (reality) or both but it won\u2019t be finished till another time not belongs to a timeline which may started the day before or today (not Virtual Reality nor Reality) because you can\u2019t decisively mark its transition. Future is not present because Future is an imagination resulted from the circumstance of your confusion. Hope you understand. ",

            "answer_text": "No because we are a particular of a perception of reality itself. Everyone has a tiny slice of reality in their being and memories. Reality as a whole, for one entity to experience it would represent more of what people see gods to be or have, the full scale realization of everything in reality itself; including us.  So we are experiencing a real reality, its just an infinitesimally small percentage of the total real reality in the universe. ",
