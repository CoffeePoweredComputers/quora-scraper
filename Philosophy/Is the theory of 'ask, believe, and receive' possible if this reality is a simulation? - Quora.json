            "answer_text": "Possibility of reality being a simulation is zero, as matter alone moves matter and there is zero possibility of mind, either a Devine Mind or a computer simulation Mind of influencing material particle motion. The idea of a Being produced by Reason is false ( as proven by Baruch Spinoza in Principles of Cartesian Philosophy); true Being is discovered and objectified by mind moving mind from inadequate to adequate ideas, and from muddled and confused ordering and connecting ideas to clear and distinct ordering and connecting of ideas. True Being is knowable. Being produced by Reason is refutable. Simulation physics is science religion. I don\u2019t believe in religions of any type. ",
