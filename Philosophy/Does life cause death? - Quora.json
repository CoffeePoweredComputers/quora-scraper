            "answer_text": "No. Early organisms reproduced by simple fission and therefore are effectively immortal unless there is some other cause to terminate their living processes. Death is not a product of living for such organisms. In this method there were sometimes errors in fission. Mostly these were harmful and the organism died. However, there were millions of perfect versions which continued. Very occasionally an error would be slightly advantageous in some way, perhaps enabling a new food source or location to be used, which was evolution. Death as an inevitable end to life only came about with more complex life-forms where they mixed genetic material. Thus the original organisms were not renewed in the process, but new ones produced. This enabled much faster evolution, but meant that the original organisms had to get out of the way to allow their offspring to have sufficient space and resources. This could either be done by the children consuming their parents (many species) or by the life system eventually failing, because it was not being renewed. Death is the price you pay for sex, not living. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. Life needs a new iteration with new abilities and it can't have the used up iteration using up the new iterations resources. For example. There are some organisms that appear to live forever. Clearly life has tried that route, and deemed it to be insufficient for some(most) organisms (at this time). Imagine if every full grown elephant who ever lived never died. There wouldn't be any peanuts for any new elephants. It is the same think for computers. Would you want to keep an entire building for an original computer? Or would you rather kill that old giant computer break it into reusable bits, build a house with a pool and have a laptop to use whenever wherever you want? Death is a necessary part of life's progress. What life is trying to achieve is a mystery. ",
