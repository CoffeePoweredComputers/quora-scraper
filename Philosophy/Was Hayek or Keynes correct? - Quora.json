            "answer_text": "Both. But if it's a choice, clearly Keynes. The core disagreement between Keynes and Hayek was whether government should try to address a recession by spending (if interest rates are already as low as possible). This is a normative question, and as such does not have a single \"correct\" answer. However, they based their views on various empirical arguments, so we can judge which one of them was right more often on those. On the issues where they flatly contradicted each other, most often Keynes was right and Hayek was wrong. However, Hayek did raise several valid points that Keynes falied to address at all, and so his position does still have some validity. The core of their disagreement was over public spending. Keynes argued that, in times of high unemployment and low interest rates, the main economic problem is a lack of demand. In those conditions, he thought that public spending could be good for the economy, over and above the value of the public goods it buys. In particular, he did not think it would drive up interest rates and thus \"crowd out\" private investment. Hayek disagreed. He believed public spending \"at best... tend[s] to drive up the rate of interest\u2014a process which is surely particularly undesirable at this juncture when the revival of the supply of capital to private industry is an admittedly urgent necessity.\" He also argued that public spending was inherently allocated more inefficiently than private investment, driven by perverse incentives and tending to follow a \"ratchet effect\" where increases are politically easier than decreases. On the question of interest rates and crowding out, Hayek was simply wrong, and Keynes was right: recent economic history has plenty of examples of interest rates remaining low regardless of the fiscal or monetary factors Hayek saw as key:    Hayek would not expect graphs like these. However, some of Hayek's other points were not rebutted by Keynes. On the \"ratchet effect\": it's certainly possible to find plenty of examples of governments reducing infrastructure investment or antipoverty spending without paying a political price for it, but on the other hand broad-based public spending such as old-age pensions and medical support seem quite sticky. On government inefficiency: Keynes did not engage with Hayek here, seeing Hayek's arguments as secondary to the main issue of economic expansion, but there is certainly evidence to back Hayek's point of view. Still, if we have to give the win to one side here, it would unquestionably be Keynes. Without Keynes's insight, an insight flatly denied by Hayek, it would have been impossible to predict the differences in how countries have begun to recover, or not, from the 2008 crisis. ",

            "answer_text": "Von Hayek has become the patron saint of the anti-government economic movement and is often seen as an equal to John Maynard Keynes because of the popularity of the book \"The Road To Serfdom,\" and his split Nobel Prize.   Many think the two works are interrelated but they are not.  The 1974 Nobel Prize was award for \"pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and for their penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena.\"  It was a balanced award given to two people at the extremes of the political spectrum for their approaches to a common issue, Von Hayek on the Right, and Gunnar Myrdal who couldn't have disagreed with him more if he set this as his goal.  The Prize itself wasn't a recognition of correctness of either one, but in the expansion of thought around a particular topic. At Von Hayek's acceptance speech, he summarized his ideas behind the award in a way that still rings true today (The Pretence of Knowledge).  The human equation is so complex that outcome prediction is extraordinarily difficult, bordering on impossible.  This part of his economic philosophy lives on quite well, and the attempt to tame this dilemma has many children in the rise of the behavior economics discipline over the past couple of decades.  As a critique of permanent, quantifiable, predictable solution, Von Hayek works lives on, as well it should.  Unfortunately, when the modern followers of Von Hayek aren't talking about this part of his theory.  They tend to consider the part that stands in contrast to Keynes, about macroeconomic policy and philosophy.  In this particular area, it would be a bit of an exaggeration to give Von Hayek's work much more credit that a footnote in history.  Keynes rules the day in this area. Basically, unless your government is currently in a state of anarchy (where economic policy is not normally a concern) or active monarchy (where strong vestiges of mercantilism still rule the day), all governments are Keynesian.  And most all of the Monarchs who wish to rule with some concern for his people are too.   Economists line up behind labels describing where and how Keynesian stimulus should be applied. The question is like asking who is better at Association Football, Brazil or Canada?  The folks who understand economics (or Soccer) just sort of chuckle at the very concept of comparison. Not to dismiss Von Hayek completely, his criticism of the predictability of social, institutional, and economic phenomena, the source of the '74 split Nobel Prize is the first thing one should think of when a leader with in the world talks about specific macro outcomes.  When the policy advisor says, \"x tax cuts will increase the GDP y amount\" or \"x dollars in government spending will produce y jobs,\" Von Hayek grimaces from the beyond.   The leaders are making these claims because of the success and unanimous support for Keynes theories.  And they are virtually 100% correct about tax cuts raising GDP and government programs creating jobs.  Where Von Hayek show them to be wrong is in the knowing the exact magnitude of how much they help.  The equation of a human-based economy indeed has too many variable to be considered with scientific or even statistical accuracy.  The Experience of the modern economy has show that tax cuts are much less effective than jobs programs in stimulating the economy.  It also shows that both work most of the time, which is why everyone is a Keynesian now. Keynes wins this battle virtually by forfeit.  Von Hayek never put forth a viable policy, just an effective critique of a part of one.   Both thinkers have impact, but Keynes is universal and mostly effective, while Von Hayek is simply a good place to start looking when the Keynesian policies don't live up to expectations. ",
