            "answer_text": "This is a very difficult realm in the discipline of moral philosophy. Let's go through the history of this topic. Initially, say around 800 BC, an individual's moral duties stemmed from his or her position in society. This was because society was composed of very tightly knit clans which placed loyalty to clan above everything else. Thus, Achilles or Odysseus had to behave in certain ways because their identity as kings enjoined upon them a particular code of moral behavior, the violation of which would be a crime. One can find a similar position in the Ramayana in India.  By around 5th century BC in Athens, as the strength of clans declined, moral dilemmas began to crop up. What may be considered moral from the standpoint of the clan can be considered immoral from the standpoint of the Greek city-state. When these moral dilemmas arose, people found it very difficult to resolve them. One can see in Greek literature of this time that such dilemmas were usually resolved by the intervention of the gods. Again, this is very similar to the Mahabharata in India, where moral dilemmas are resolved through the intervention of Lord Krishna.  However, some philosophers in ancient Greece were smart enough to realize that the gods don't really intervene to help us resolve our moral dilemmas. Therefore, with the lack of divine intervention, moral dilemmas will forever remain unresolved. Thus, these philosophers, known today as the Sophists, argued that there are no foundations to ethics, and that one must be able to argue for either side of the moral dilemma.  The incoherence of such a view generated a reaction in the form of the great triad of Greek philosophy - Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. All of them argued for strong foundations for ethics. Their views, especially Aristotle's, formed the general backbone of moral philosophy in Europe and the Islamic world until the 17th century.  The Aristotelian framework of ethics had three interrelated components. 1) Human nature in its raw form2) Human nature when it has reached its highest potential3) System of ethics Thus, for Aristotle, the philosophical foundations of ethics lay in its ability to transform human nature from its raw form to its highest potential. Ethics, is therefore, animated by a teleology (Greek telos meaning 'purpose'). In other words, ethics is important because it serves a purpose (raising human nature from the raw to the finished state).  From the 17th century, however, European philosophers started to discard Aristotle's teleology. They saw it as remnants of superstition and fought tooth and nail against it. But consider what happens to a framework of ethics which now lacks teleology. The three components outlined above is reduced to only two components - human nature in its raw form, and the system of ethics. Now that ethics no longer serves the purpose of raising us to our higher potential, the question now arises - \"Why should I follow ethics?\" - in other words, \"What are the philosophical foundations of ethics?\" Two schools of thought emerged in modern Europe to salvage some foundations for ethics. Utilitarianism tried to ground the system of ethics in the first component, ie, raw human nature. It argued that human nature compels us to move towards pleasure and move away from pain. Thus, a good system of ethics will allow the maximum number of people to move towards pleasure and away from pain - in other words, \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\" Deontologists, on the other hand, tried to argue that morality must be followed for its own sake. According to them, a good act is intrinsically good, and that it must be performed without regard to consequences, but because it is our duty as rational beings to perform good acts.  Both these schools of thought have been roundly criticized for their multiple failures, both philosophical and practical. But the most damning criticism came from Friedrich Nietzsche, a late-19th century philosopher. Nietzsche saw this entire business of laying foundations for ethics as a foolish business, and that these so-called foundations were nothing but mere rationalizations that concealed the Will to Power, that is, the desire to dominate others (in simplistic terms). With Nietzsche, the entire project of justifying morality from the ground up became a fool's errand, to the point where it is but inevitable to end up in moral relativism and nihilism. Moral philosophy has since never really clearly recovered from Nietzsche's assaults.  But there are a small group of philosophers who consider themselves to be Aristotelians who argue that Nietzsche's critique is plausible only if we reject Aristotle's teleology. Led by Alasdair Macintyre, these Aristotelians claim that teleology is what provides the philosophical foundations of ethics, and that this teleology is provided traditions (or religions, as has generally been the case). But their voices are a minority. The larger consensus in the discipline of philosophy is that it is no longer useful to talk about philosophical foundations for ethics.
