            "answer_text": "I am currently undergoing Stoic conversion, because I want to be an excellent man, although my indifferent wish is longevity. According to virtue ethics, the sole thing you need to live a happy fulfilled tranquil life is virtue. Unlike Aristotle who advocated the \u201cGolden Mean\u201d (i.e. that moderation was the key to virtue), Stoicism (and especially Cynicism) takes this a step further and advocates asceticism. The reason is The Hedonistic Treadmill, where a person might live it up, but that it takes more and more to get the same good effect, so why not live it down, and it takes much less to get the same good effect (and be virtuous at the same time, reaping the benefit of happiness/tranquility)? While there is a lot of reading and listening material you can draw on, essentially Stoic conversion involves the realization that you can only control how you think, feel, and act IN THE MOMENT, and that is where you ought to concentrate your efforts. Furthermore, you ought to kindle virtue and stifle vice, especially negative passions. It depends upon habituation for a person eventually living ascetically as second nature, without the strong effort at first. To summarize: to live the life of an ascetic utilizing the life philosophy of Stoicism, a person follows their very concrete and practical formula, and habituation will eventually make it second nature. It ought to be noted that Stoicism does not recommend extreme asceticism (i.e. starvation, severe social isolation, or extreme poverty) since that would be contrary to acting in accordance with nature.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking Suryasis. I have been experimenting one such life style at different patches in life. I admit, it was not that continuous.  What I mean by Ascetic needs to be expressed here.  To me it is a complete \"self-discipline\" | Basically I have listed down for myself, what is GOOD for my goal/life and I have listed down for myself what is BAD for my goal/life.  And then I  translated the listing into what to do at every day level and what not to do.  And meticulously stick to those decisions.. and for prolonged durations of time.   The daily items would could be say fasting, amount of sleep times, time for meditation or several other habits I have consciously observed in me and even other chores.. So that way I have a routine which I consider 'Ascetic'. Now what I observed is - due to different worries in mind primarily I force myself  into that state to let-go. Else, I do n't even feel a need to separate myself from my worries in order to calm-down. So basically some confusion in mind ONLY can give an opportunity to settle down ! Generally I get drawn back otherwise into the fight to collect more worries and keep my combat intensive life going. But once I decided on Letting-go several things I get into one \"reasoned - routine\" and that proved very useful for regeneration and recuperation of my own principles.  But what is the challenge with getting into that state. It is \"distraction\".  This state is like a \"tapas\", a penance, and the killer of this state is \"distraction\".. We can see lot of Mythological morals around the same where a sage gets distracted by a beautiful nymph from heaven sent by Gods in order for sage not to reap the benefits of the penance !  Its like that. We need effort to battle out \"distractions\" and believe in staying in that state ! Practically put with all these experiences, I feel growing my rationale to combat the following questions helps me stay put when I encounter a  'distraction' and get my focus back on the letting-go process : A. Is it needed in this life to just calm ourselves and stay balanced OR we should just get swayed away by the daily ripples of desires/unhappiness there by chasing the endless chains of problem-solution-problem etc.,? [ This should create a need in us to think something possibly can be done ] B. Is it so important to experience everything that comes our way in life with out discerning OR have just a limited set of focal points to experience so that life does n't appear monotonous? [ This should help us channel our energies into that one or two simply-vital targets] C. Is it so important to use our mind for \"solving every trivial problem\" and feel pride in our mental agility? OR scale our awareness and become humble? [ This should help our spirit become so no-obstructing to the flow of nature through us, that a problem no longer appears a problem ! ] ",

            "answer_text": "In the present age of Kali it is not possible to live like a traditional ascetic. A traditional ascetic performs yoga and mediation and avoids all contact of the senses with their objects, the whole day that\u2019s all he does. The only austerity you have to perform in the present time of history is to call upon God as in the Hare Krishna mantra. Of course, just to be a proper human being you have to practice non-violence, so therefore no meat-eating, no sex outside of marriage, no intoxication and no gambling. In the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, we learn that the four pillars of religion are cleanliness, austerity, compassion, and truthfulness. There is a systematic and well-rounded process to religion, whose foundation is structured on these four pillars. Religion is not simply a matter of faith, nor just a system of morals and ethics, although it is often portrayed as such. It is more than faith, it is a science - in Bhagavad-gita, Krishna calls it the science of the self. As these four pillars are the foundation of religion, the Vedic scriptures also teach that there are four main sinful activities - illicit sex, intoxication, gambling, and meat eating. Why are they \"sinful?\" Because they each attack and destroy a specific pillar of religion. Cleanliness is destroyed by illicit sex; austerity by intoxication; compassion by meat-eating; and truthfulness by gambling. Thus it is clearly seen that modern, contemporary culture is consistently trying to destroy religious principles by undermining the four pillars of religion. For example, the vast majority of all TV and movies out of Hollywood are based on the repeated and glorified practice of the four sinful activities mentioned above, which destroy religious principles. There is a constant propaganda going on to normalize and make acceptable illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. Thus, the modern global culture, which is being hailed as the pinnacle of all human progress and knowledge, is actively seeking to destroy the eternal religious principles mentioned in the Vedas. Another sign that contemporary culture is thoroughly degraded and guided by atheistic principles is that the most intimate dealings between a man and a woman, ie. kissing, is depicted in minute, graphic detail on big widescreens. According to the Vedic standard that is tantamount to pure pornagraphy. Now, when we point that out to mainstream people, it is rejected and scoffed at as being backwards and primitive. But when one of the most intimate exchanges between a man and a woman is engaged in freely and publicly without any restraint, what does that tell us about the culture we live in? Why this observation? Because as devotees of Krishna, we are trying to emulate the Vedic culture and values. At the same time many of us live in a society, where these values are regarded as primitive and back-wards. In fact, as westerners we have grown up to see the standards of the modern consumer culture as normal and even coveted and glorified. Srila Prabhupada said, that the difference between him and his disciples was that he was afraid of maya, they were not. This is to show how important it is for a devotee to understand how harmful and degraded the modern culture is. Things that according to the Vedic standard are considered extremely sinful are considered completely normal in modern society - cow-killing, publicly kissing and fondling, scantily clad women and so on. The global culture is merely an attempt to make the whole world into a market place of McDonalds, Levis and Coca-cola. It is being hailed as the info-age, but when examined closely, the info available is more or less a barrage of propaganda to make the general population into good and loyal consumers and usurpers of nature. The goal of life, instead of being knowledge of the self and an end to the existential problems of life, is now centered around getting an education, then a job that will enable one to spend money for sense-gratification. The goal of life has become to spend money on consumer goods, and the producers of these goods spend vast amounts of money to convince people to buy their products. Basically the whole world is running on trade. It is a business-culture governed by vaishyas not by brahmanas, as a proper human culture is meant to be. So Srila Prabhupada ordered us to create a class of brahmins to guide society, and the only way to do that is by preaching sanatana-dharma - the eternal religion, and that is exactly what ISKCON is doing all over the world. Krishna says: Those who are free from false prestige, illusion and false association, who understand the eternal, who are done with material lust, who are freed from the dualities of happiness and distress, and who, unbewildered, know how to surrender unto the Supreme Person attain to that eternal kingdom.

            "answer_text": "Ascetic life can bring long lasting benefits to one person. The simple principle on which ascetic life is based is: Have a strong control over your emotions, not seeking any pleasure in day to day life. Having a logical/rational perspective of life rather than an emotional one. Browsing through quora for pleasure reading is also an example of indulgence. On other note you will need something to focus on, all past seers who followed asceticism had some thing to work/focus on in day to day life. You just can\u2019t switch off all activities. So my advice would be first find a thing which is worth indulging, even if it doesn't give pleasure now that\u2019s ok, find it and indulge in that activity, and now switch off all other pleasure seeking activities. Have some balls and keep pushing, don\u2019t give up until you only pleasure source becomes the activity you choose to indulge in. Also keep avoiding all other pleasures.Now you have learned how to live like an ascetic and still enjoy life! Any activity that gives pleasure to any of our five senses eyes, ears, mouth, skin and smell should be avoided. Good Luck! Hope this helps! I am also trying to lead ascetic life, after years of indulgence. ",

Really really hard. You have to struggle with the mind and senses every second of every day as you progress. You have to give up all thoughts of sense-gratification what to speak of the acts. They must be rooted out mercilessly by whatever means possible. To try to do it in the company of materialists is out of the question so you have to live away from the rest of the world, disinterested in all that is going on. If you can achieve that you will become peaceful and then start to become happy. If you find a nice society of people that are also practicing asceticism, then you will have a ball. Forget the struggles, you can go straight to the happy stage and can dovetail the senses in activities that assist and not hinder your ascetic life.      ",
