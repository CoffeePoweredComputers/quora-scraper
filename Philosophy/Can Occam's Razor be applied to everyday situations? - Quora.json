            "answer_text": "Science is about the differentiation between cause and correlation. In a statistical analysis we may often include all possible explanations, as in a statistical model of an observation. Upon the collection of data and input into the mathematical model, it might turn out that some can be causes and others are correlations. The model can then be simplified. Most statisticians and those who are into related studies use this approach. This is very similar to the principle of Occam\u2019s Razor. Other scientists like Newton and Einstein used a similar approach. While this might be more heuristic than scientific, it is a good place to begin as it makes for the familiar the likely cause for effects. The statement just now might be the basis of of making conclusions which is what Occam\u2019s Razor suggests. ",
