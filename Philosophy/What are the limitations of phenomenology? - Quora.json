            "answer_text": "(Note - the following is a copy of Jeff Wright's answer to What are the weaknesses of phenomenology as a philosophical system?) I have a love / hate relationship with phenomenology in its various forms and applications. Critique is easier than reconciliation or synthesis. It's worth also considering What are the strengths of phenomenology as a philosophical system? Here are some personal opinions on weaknesses of phenomenology. The term \"phenomenology\" does not designate a consistent \"philosophical system\". There are a lot of different approaches and schools with differing methodology and ontological assumptions (realism, idealism, transcendentalism, empiricism, you name it). This makes it hard to know what the term refers to, other than by studying a particular \"school\" in detail.Most writing about phenomenology is long on attitude and short on examples, methodology and practice. It's hard to find the protocols and examples of best practices.The idea of phenomenology as a systematic and \"scientific\" treatment of subjective observables has multiple problems.An emphasis on detachment and description (non-interaction) ignores the nature of observer participation and active cognition. \"Bracketing\" the observer (excluding personal influences for observations of non-personal phenomena) is impossible.The subjective world is hypercomplex and multi-layered. A scientific approach has a hard enough time with the arguably simpler \"objective\" world. The subjective world does not take well to systematization and reductionism.Subjective states are subtle and ambiguous. This makes it hard to report findings. If this can't be done, then intersubjective knowledge is hard to achieve, define, and replicate.Objective science has its instruments to stabilize and replicate methodology. For traditional phenomenology, the \"instrument\" is the mind and training of the practitioner. This makes replication of results and training difficult.It is sometimes understood as the study of \"consciousness\" itself rather than phenomena (appearances to conciousness). Some schools are influenced by quasi-religious forms of transcendentalism analogous to moral quests for mystic perfection of the individual's consciousness: the myth of future mystical state. Enlightenment, in other words, something that they can't really define how to achieve but that will eventually, if one practices hard enough, result in a breakthrough. This is, structurally anyway, a disguised form of Christian theology.Purist versions of the philosophy reject the idea of admitting any \"objective\" observations or indirect knowledge (via inference, models, etc.). Not only does this exclude most human knowledge sources, it ignores the idea that there are no pure subjectives, that subjective \"observations\" are likely to be interpretive models in disguise. In this sense the notion of \"experience\" as an unstructured ground for appearances is naive. There's not enough emphasis on the \"subject\" side of the notion of \"intentionality\". Purist phenomenology does not seem interested in projects with multiple epistemological or methodological sources, such as Neurophenomenology(see below).I haven't seen many evaluation criteria for assessing which phenomenological observations are useful (in any particular research program) or whether specific guidance is used to aim at particular types of observables.This sounds like I soundly reject phenomenology. Not true. I do reject the purist versions, but I think many of its ideas are applicable to mixed-method and Qualitative Research. I think structured protocols and focus on limited domains of phenomena (e.g. ethnography) can overcome some of the problems with complexity and lack of specificity. I expect it will get a nice boost from new sciences such as Neurophenomenology, which can work simultaneously with the phenomena of consciousness and their objective neural correlates. I also think a lot of traditional \"expert\" knowledge -- the tacit aspect of it -- is implicitly phenomenological. One of the ways phenomenology goes astray is a creeping emphasis on ontology and abstractions like consciousness, rather than a focus on epistemology and methodology. This is not unique to phenomenology but is a characteristic of many branches of western philosophy. It represents an assumption that a fundamental methodology of philosophy is to reduce knowledge to a system of propositions based on fundamental axioms and ontological assumptions. The problem for phenomenology is that this process distorts phenomenological observations by conforming them to the a priori conceptual constructs that are part of the ontological \u201csystem\u201d. At that point the \u201ctail wags the dog\u201d, and any further observations become concept-bound. At that point they are likely to depart from various criteria of realism (for example, being referenced to human psychological behavior or neuro-psychology). If that happens then the \u201cobservations\u201d of the phenomenologist are increasingly likely to be available only to practitioners trained in that specific conceptual system and not available to others (as comparable inter-subjective observations). I would say that at that point the practice loses whatever claim it hoped to have on being a \u201cscience\u201d of phenomena, and is something more like a personal or group mysticism. In all fairness, this is a widespread characteristic of Western philosophy, the preference to reduce epistemology to static formulations couched in terms of ontological constructs. In fact in some ways phenomenology resists this, but then, like some kind of addict, relapses to its allure.

            "answer_text": "Phenomenology is important, but not complete. Phenomenology takes consciousness seriously, something modern science / physics / biology fail to do. But we can\u2019t get behind phenomena to find the reason / reasons why there are phenomena. We need physical science of course, but physics is not complete. It doesn\u2019t account for consciousness. It doesn\u2019t account for why mathematics is so effective in describing physical phenomena; we just have to assume it that it does. I started studying phenomenology because I thought it would be an empirical science of consciousness, but found Husserl and Heidegger disappointing. Sartre is interesting, and makes many good points, but reading him is like walking into a fog where there are diamond like flashes of brilliance in the gloom. What I suspect is that Sartre is trying to make the same points Buddhism has been making for the last 2500 years, but using the Western conceptual apparatus of Aristotle and Scholasticism. In \u201cBeing and Nothingness,\u201d Being is phenomenal, a \u201cmonism of the phenomena.\u201d Nothingness, surprisingly, is consciousness, which he calls \u201ca hole in being.\u201d Buddhism is very similar, with it\u2019s concept of anatta or not-self, and sunyata, or emptiness. Sartre was limited in that he didn\u2019t get beyond anguish, which he identified with freedom and the nothingness of consciousness, the ego for him being \u201cout there,\u201d in the world, unlike subjectivity. I take Buddhism, Zen say, as just such an empirical and phenomenal study of consciousness. ",
