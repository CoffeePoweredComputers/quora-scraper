            "answer_text": "The German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976) saw 20th century Europe as a historical period dominated by the being of all entities construed as available for use and manipulation (by human beings). Thus, the natural world (forests, rivers, animals) is understood as a giant stockroom of material waiting to be used up in human projects. It\u2019s easy to misunderstand Heidegger\u2019s point if you see all this as something that modern people (we) project onto already existing and perceived stuff (out there)\u2014he claims that this is how the being of all entities is unconcealed and disclosed in the first place (in our era). It is not one human perspective among many that we might adopt (and then discard for a different perspective). Heidegger was not a humanist. He did not believe that all meaning and significance and understanding derive from human cognition or consciousness (as Sartre did). Heidegger was aware that over the last 3,000 years there have been different manifestations of the being of all entities (during the Middle Ages all entities were experienced as creations of God). But Heidegger doesn\u2019t think that we today can recapture this particular dispensation of being anymore than the experience of the unconcealment of all entities by Parmenides and Heraclitus in pre-Socratic times can really be shared by we modern people. Note: None of this has anything to do with, as you put it in your question, \u201capproaching truth\u201d. When discussing Heidegger it\u2019s best to avoid the term \u201ctruth\u201d altogether (he uses this term in an eccentric manner). ",

It all looks like a retard trying too hard to cope with his own mental weakness by pretending to be more valuable then he is by writing words that confuse the shit out of other people and don\u2019t really make any sense, thus giving an illusion of higher intellect, thus making it possible to create an environment where a bunch of dumb people are listening attentively to someone who\u2019s just bullshitting his ass off for one or the other reason. Probably with some political agenda in mind. Humans are retarded.. lets not get too exited about the whole sapient larp. We are intelligent, yes.. sort of. We are smart enough to pull down our pants when we have to take a shit and sometimes we can avoid traffic successfully without accidents and dead people, but that\u2019s about it. Humans are weak thus have to rely on lies to survive. Accept this fact. We are all snake oil salesmen. For a human to see the truth, one has to become super-human, invincible. Otherwise.. the truth is inaccessible. But lies.. lies are very accessible, just say whatever the fuck you want and you got it. ",
