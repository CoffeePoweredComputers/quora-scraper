            "answer_text": "We will become the Borg  Humans are social beings and we often ask others for advice on life decisions. In my opinion the magnitude of the decisions where we ask for others opinions is constantly shrinking. Many young people start outsourcing decision making into their social network crowds. With live videos and shiny voting buttons or sliders they get immediate feedback of their followers and peers. Now imagine if we get a direct internet connection to our brain. It will probably take some more decades, but I think many of us will see it in their lifetimes. Now you can upload everything you see to the cloud. You can share immersive experiences, including smells and even emotions.You can experience the best moments of your life or the life of others over and over again. There will always be some bored people participating live in your life. This is not mandatory of course but many people will stay transparent all of the time so they get many viewers. There will be entertainment programs where you can live the life of a person on a dream vacation, doing extreme sports, being in a fight with their partner, or maybe even live broadcasts from the brains of prisoners when they get executed. It will get more and more normal to ask questions like which coffee to get at Starbucks in real time and listening at the decision the crowd will take for you. And in return you will participate more and more in the life`s of others and give your 2 cents to any topic they bring up. This is already happening in Instagram/Snap,\u2026 but not in real time and not in such an extent. After a while it will really hurt to go offline and people will be scared to be on their own. How can you know that you are going to make the best decision? Its a scary world when you are alone. It will feel so much better to be part of a collective consciousness that more and more people will join it. This will for sure end wars and increase compassion to all other humans since they all become one. Funnily enough this sounds like Mah\u0101y\u0101na branch of Buddhism, bringing all of humanity together to the single entity they are and which created our universe :) Resistance is futile! ",

            "answer_text": "Rather strangely, we are now in a position to make some reasonable predictions on this matter, although uncertainties remain. One thing is assured, though - we snoutless apes are fast becoming redundant to the evolutionary process that can be traced at least as far back as the formation of the chemical elements in the first stars. Most folk still seem unable to break free from the traditional science fiction based notions involving individual robots/computers. Either as potential threats, beneficial aids or serious basis for \"artificial intelligence\". In actuality, the real next cognitive entity quietly self assembles in the background, mostly unrecognized for what it is. And, contrary to our usual conceits, is not stoppable or directly within our control. We are very prone to anthropocentric distortions of objective reality. This is perhaps not surprising, for to instead adopt the evidence based viewpoint now afforded by \"big science\" and \"big history\" takes us way outside our perceptive comfort zone. The fact is that the evolution of the Internet (and, of course, major components such as Google) is actually an autonomous process. The difficulty in convincing people of this \"inconvenient truth\" seems to stem partly from our natural anthropocentric mind-sets and also the traditional illusion that in some way we are in control of, and distinct from, nature. Contemplation of the observed realities tend to be relegated to the emotional \"too hard\" bin. This evolution is not driven by any individual software company or team of researchers, but rather by the sum of many human requirements, whims and desires to which the current technologies react. Among the more significant motivators are such things as commerce, gaming, social interactions, education and sexual titillation. Virtually all interests are catered for and, in toto provide the impetus for the continued evolution of the Internet. Netty is still in her larval stage, but we \"workers\" scurry round mindlessly engaged in her nurture. By relinquishing our usual parochial approach to this issue in favor of the overall evolutionary \"big picture\" provided by many fields of science, the emergence of a new predominant cognitive entity (from the Internet, rather than individual machines) is seen to be not only feasible but inevitable Stephen Hawking, for instance, is reported to have remarked \"Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all,\" This statement reflects the narrow-minded approach that is so common-place among those who make public comment on this issue. In reality, as much as it may offend our human conceits, the march of technology and its latest spearhead, the Internet is, and always has been, an autonomous process over which we have very little real control. Seemingly unrelated disciplines such as geology, biology and \"big history\" actually have much to tell us about the machinery of nature (of which technology is necessarily a part) and the kind of outcome that is to be expected from the evolution of the Internet. This much broader \"systems analysis\" approach, freed from the anthropocentric notions usually promoted by the cult of the \"Singularity\", provides a more objective vision that is consistent with the pattern of autonomous evolution of technology that is so evident today. Very real evidence indicates the rather imminent implementation of the next, (non-biological) phase of the on-going evolutionary \u201clife\u201d process from what we at present call the Internet. It is effectively evolving by a process of self-assembly. The \"Internet of Things\" is proceeding apace and pervading all aspects of our lives. We are increasingly, in a sense, \u201censlaved\u201d by our PCs, mobile phones, their apps and many other trappings of the increasingly cloudy net. We are already largely dependent upon it for our commerce and industry and there is no turning back. What we perceive as a tool is well on its way to becoming an agent. There are at present an estimated 2 Billion Internet users. There are an estimated 10 to 80 Billion neurons in the human brain. On this basis for approximation the Internet is even now only one order of magnitude below the human brain and its growth is exponential. That is a simplification, of course. For example: Not all users have their own computer. So perhaps we could reduce that, say, tenfold. The number of switching units, transistors, if you wish, contained by all the computers connecting to the Internet and which are more analogous to individual neurons is many orders of magnitude greater than 2 Billion. Then again, this is compensated for to some extent by the fact that neurons do not appear to be binary switching devices but instead can adopt multiple states. Without even crunching the numbers, however, we see that we must take seriously the possibility that even the present Internet may well be comparable to a human brain in processing power. And, of course, the degree of interconnection and cross-linking of networks within networks is also growing rapidly. The emergence of a new and predominant cognitive entity that is a logical consequence of the evolutionary continuum that can be traced back at least as far as the formation of the chemical elements in stars. This is the main theme of my latest book \"The Intricacy Generator: Pushing Chemistry and Geometry Uphill\" which is now available as a 336 page illustrated paperback from Amazon, etc. There is absolutely no reason to assume \"life\" has any \"purpose\". On the other hand the evolving network of our universe very observably has directionality. And it may well be that the tiny cog in nature's machinery to which species comparable to ours correspond may typically self-destruct once the next, non-biological, phase of the evolutionary process is well established. Since its precursor, the Internet (and peripherals) is growing exponentially, that day might not be far off for us. On the other hand, we could possibly earn a reprieve by becoming amicable symbionts with the new cognitive entity. The benefits from such an arrangement could be great. But we first have to become aware of the process and take steps to curb our inherent belligerence. Straighten up and fly right! ",

            "answer_text": "In one sense, the eventual fate of mankind involves everything that will ever happen to any individual, including what you will have for breakfast next Thursday and all the logical revelations that will be made one year from now. In that sense, it is not really sensible to think about the eventual fate of humankind as a subject: it is too huge and too assorted to be in any way tended to all in all in a solitary paper, monograph, or even 100-volume book arrangement. It is made into a theme by method for deliberation. We theoretical from subtleties and transient vacillations and advancements that influence just some constrained part of our lives. A discourse about the fate of mankind is about how the significant key highlights of the human condition may change or stay steady over the long haul. What highlights of the human condition are basic and significant? On this there can be sensible difference. In any case, a few highlights qualify by practically any standard. For instance, regardless of whether and when Earth-beginning life will go wiped out, whether it will colonize the cosmic system, whether human science will be on a very basic level changed to make us posthuman, whether machine knowledge will outperform natural insight, whether populace size will detonate, and whether personal satisfaction will profoundly improve or disintegrate: these are immensely significant key inquiries concerning the eventual fate of mankind. Less key inquiries \u2013 for example, about systems or explicit innovation projections \u2013 are additionally important to the extent that they illuminate our perspectives about progressively essential parameters. Generally, the fate of humankind has been a subject for religious philosophy. All the significant religions have lessons about a definitive predetermination of mankind or the finish of the world.1 Eschatological topics have likewise been investigated by huge name scholars, for example, Hegel, Kant, and Marx. In later occasions the artistic type of sci-fi has proceeded with the convention. All the time, the future has filled in as a projection screen for our expectations and fears; or as a phase setting for sensational amusement, profound quality stories, or parody of propensities in contemporary society; or as a standard for ideological activation. It is generally uncommon for humankind's future to be paid attention to as a topic on which it is imperative to attempt to have really right convictions. There is nothing amiss with abusing the representative and artistic affordances of an obscure future, similarly as there is nothing amiss with fantasizing about fanciful nations populated by winged serpents and wizards. However it is imperative to endeavor (as well as can be expected) to recognize cutting edge situations set forward for their emblematic importance or excitement esteem from hypotheses that are intended to be assessed based on exacting believability. Just the last type of \"sensible\" modern idea will be considered in this paper. We need practical pictures of what the future may acquire request to settle on cool headed choices. Progressively, we need practical pictures not just of our own or nearby close term prospects, yet additionally of remoter worldwide fates. In view of our extended innovative forces, some human exercises currently have critical worldwide effects. The size of human social association has likewise developed, making new open doors for coordination and activity, and there are numerous organizations and people who either consider, or guarantee to consider, or should consider, conceivable long haul worldwide effects of their activities. Environmental change, national and worldwide security, financial improvement, atomic waste transfer, biodiversity, characteristic asset preservation, populace strategy, and logical and innovative research subsidizing are instances of arrangement regions that include long time-skylines. Contentions in these regions regularly depend on understood suspicions about the eventual fate of humankind. By making these suspicions express, and exposing them to basic examination, it may be conceivable to address a portion of the huge difficulties for humankind in an all the more well-considered and insightful way. The way that we \"need\" reasonable photos of things to come does not involve that we can have them. Expectations about future specialized and social advancements are famously untrustworthy \u2013 to a degree that have lead some to recommend that we get rid of forecast through and through in our arranging and planning for what's to come. However while the methodological issues of such guaging are positively exceptionally critical, the extraordinary view that we can or ought to get rid of forecast inside and out is confused. That view is communicated, to take one model, in an ongoing paper on the societal ramifications of nanotechnology by Michael Crow and Daniel Sarewitz, in which they contend that the issue of consistency is \"insignificant\": planning for the future clearly does not require exact forecast; rather, it requires an establishment of information whereupon to base activity, an ability to gain as a matter of fact, close thoughtfulness regarding what is happening in the present, and solid and flexible foundations that can successfully react or adjust to change in an opportune manner.2 Note that every one of the components Crow and Sarewitz notice as required for the readiness for the future depends somehow or another on exact forecast. An ability to gain for a fact isn't valuable for planning for the future except if we can accurately accept (anticipate) that the exercises we get from the past will be relevant to future circumstances. Close thoughtfulness regarding what is happening in the present is in like manner vain except if we can accept that what is happening in the present will uncover stable patterns or generally revealed insight into what is probably going to occur straightaway. It additionally requires non-insignificant expectation to make sense of what sort of foundation will demonstrate sound, flexible, and compelling in reacting or adjusting to future changes. Actually consistency involves degree, and various parts of things to come are unsurprising with differing degrees of unwavering quality and precision.3 It might frequently be a smart thought to create plans that are adaptable and to seek after approaches that are strong under a wide scope of possibilities. Now and again, it additionally bodes well to receive a receptive methodology that depends on adjusting rapidly to changing conditions as opposed to seeking after any itemized long haul plan or express motivation. However these adapting procedures are just a single piece of the arrangement. Another part is to work to improve the precision of our convictions about the future (counting the exactness of contingent forecasts of the structure \"if x is done, y will result\"). There may be traps that we are strolling towards that we could just abstain from falling into by methods for prescience. There are additionally openings that we could achieve much sooner in the event that we could see them more remote ahead of time. Furthermore, in a severe sense, expectation is constantly fundamental for important choice making.4 Consistency does not really tumble off with worldly separation. It might be exceedingly flighty where a voyager will be one hour after the beginning of her adventure, yet unsurprising that following five hours she will be at her goal. The long haul eventual fate of mankind might be moderately simple to foresee, being an issue agreeable to ponder by the regular sciences, especially cosmology (physical eschatology). Furthermore, for there to be a level of consistency, it isn't important that it be conceivable to recognize one explicit situation as what will occur. On the off chance that there is probably some situation that can be discounted, that is likewise a level of consistency. Indeed, even shy of this, if there is some reason for relegating various probabilities (in the feeling of confidences, degrees of conviction) to various suggestions about consistently conceivable future occasions, or some reason for condemning whatever likelihood conveyances as less soundly faultless or sensible than others, on the other hand there is a level of consistency. What's more, this is clearly the situation as to numerous parts of things to come of humankind. While our insight is inadequate to limit the space of potential outcomes to one comprehensively delineated future for mankind, we do know about numerous applicable contentions and contemplations which in blend force noteworthy imperatives on what a conceivable perspective on the future could resemble. The fate of humankind need not be a point on which all suspicions are totally discretionary and anything goes. There is a tremendous inlet between knowing precisely what will occur and having positively no idea about what will occur. Our real epistemic area is some seaward spot in that inlet. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, just \"a future\" is a pretty broad definition. I think it's likely that we still exist next week, although I'm not certain. It's not my intent to sound like a smart-ass, I'm assuming you mean longer than a week, but still how long counts as \"a future\"? How long future we have is, what I believe, dependent on our technology. Given our current complicated political climate, it's hard to determine how technology will advance. We might be close to WWIII, but I doubt that it will be the end of us. However, when and how WWIII breaks loose, does determine our continued existence. Imagine that WWIII hits, and it hits hard. Think apocalyptic proportions. Most of us die and most big cities are reduced to ashes and are possible rendered inhabitable for a long time forward depending on which warfare is practiced. Still, some people will probably prevail, but for how long depends on the aftermath of the war. We might live in a bleak post-apocalyptic world for hundreds of years while slowly fading away from existence, or we might rise again and supersede our current technological advancements. Of course, we might wake up to yet another big war at any time. WWIII might be fairly mild or not happen at all, so we don't loose any technological dependency we have now. This will likely buy us some time. At some point we will run out of resources and science and technology needs to keep improving if we don't want to go extinct. Even if we terraform Mars and build sky cities on Venus, the sun will eventually expand and shit on us all. No matter what sci-fi inventions we develop to keep climate in control, resources cost to a minimum and means to travel through space, we still need materials and energy. Energy is naturally provided by stars and every star will die at some point. We might find a way to upload our minds to a server of some sort and live an immortal life in a simulated world, like a never ending dream. Still, everything immaterial or virtual needs a host in material form, as far as I understand. Your youtube movies are not stored on your computer, but they are still stored somewhere. If that storage broke, your videos will be gone. Your dreams and thought seem to exist in an internal world, however, that world will cease to be if you destroy your brain. The whole internet would be useless without servers to host and cables and antennas to send and receive data. On the other end of the spectrum, we might be gone the next second due to some massive event we couldn't predict or understand. Keep in mind, I'm sort of talking out of my ass now, I don't have enough knowledge about any of this, but I'm fairly certain we will go extinct at some point, probably long before lack of matter or energy is an actual concern. I doubt we will outsmart the universe. We sure have great capacity to keep learning and living, but most of us are morons and are far to busy hating each other over nonsense. Some don't care how their descendants world will be like and some believe that they will live forever in one way or another and don't see any reason to bother about the future, but I digress. The future is never guarantied, just because something worked yesterday, doesn't mean that it will continue to tomorrow. What we can do is to make it more likely that a future, preferably happy, will exist, or chose not to and just see how long we can keep the show running. Unlike the future, the present exists, so it all depends on how we use it. Given both that fact and the fact that I haven't really answered the question, maybe you should have used the time doing something that matters to you instead of reading this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "100 years from now:Talking: People wouldn't be talking to each other anymore, they would be thinking to each other - Transmitting Thoughts wireless where you don\u2019t need an 4G or 5G for that, because every human would be transmitting signals and receiving as powerful as a satellite with the new advancement in communications.Work: No physical work need to be done. No specific tasks need regularly to be done. It would be all done by Machines and Artificial intellegence enabled machines. So forget about the 40 hours a week. Human body: with the advancement of implants and nano technology that connects to the tiniest part neuron in your body, we\u2019ll be half human half cyborgs. We would be remembering everything and have the option of deleting a thought. Imagine if really a bad memory or suffering that you can delete that thought. Yes we will be able to do that, its all a sequence of chemicals in our brains that keep our memories that can be rearranged or replicated. Reproduction: Imagine a world without computers or smart phones. Imagine your day without your smart phone. It is very difficult thing and now it is somehow unheard off. This is what we are going to have, you really don\u2019t need to get pregnant as a woman, its all can be prepared in the lab with the perfect conditions and environment. It still can be your egg and your partners sperm, but do you want to have that? or a much better sperm at least. Another questions comes , do you need to have kids when you can live indefinitely if you can afford it. Mortality: Since you\u2019ll be half cyborg, you can download all your memories and data to a portal and back it up every night. So if you accidentally die by mistake you are still inside the Disc and then you can upload yourself to a new connected cyborg. Classes and Population: With all the machines that don\u2019t need oxygen to breath and only solar power to function and they can repair themselves; then you don\u2019t need working forces and billions of that one machine can do 1000 people\u2019s work. and Machines can replicate themselves and suddenly (in 20 years times 2050\u20132070)) billions aren\u2019t needed. Hence only the elite that can afford to be cyborgs and the gap of intelligence and power is even further than our current social life. There will be a lot of people outcasts that are living in villages or underground and they still die and eat normally, but they have better robots and better technology to help their lives, and they are rarely needed by the rich, only to do things that robots won't do like illegal things.The poor people (like most of us) would be mainly irrelevant if we ever survive the global warming and other wars. Global warming is going to have a major effect on food, and there might come a time that people would kill each other for a piece of bread within this century. Although this sound very far from happening now, but think about the oil reserves depleting and the changes in the weather, you will understand that there might be a black swan effect in the food supply. Family: Forget about Family and marriage and monogamy and sex as we know it. all these are going to be changed and you might be thinking how bad it would be, but really it is going to be logical with the technological advancement. If you keep enabling the human emotions in your body, you can get much more than sex with thoughts inductions directly in your brain that gives you more pleasure than sex/food etc\u2026 Space: Exploration of the outer space would much easier, since we can send AI\u2019s that work on batteries and solar and no need to breath and take much faster decisions through super calculations. We will understand much more and we\u2019ll discover new planets that will be good for half humans half cyborgs to live in, and we could travel there after sleeping 20 years. This isn\u2019t movies , it will be a reality, so many advancements will be there in every aspect of our lives. Emotions: Human\u2019s will be much and much less emotional, we will feel less pain, and we would understand more how everything affects us and counter that with different thoughts that are induced in our brains and with more understanding we\u2019ll be less emotional since most of the expectations will be met. Please tell me what aspect of your life you would like to think of after 100 years if its not mentioned here, and i would write more if i get 100 likes.. ",

            "answer_text": "There are quite a few scenarios for how the future will play out: Apocalyptic: The human race is dirt poor / facing extinction because of overpopulation and climate change (most commonly believed scenario as of 2017)While this scenario is not unfounded, population growth is slowing down and is expected to be no more than 12 billion in 2100. And as for global warming, scientists believe that sea levels will rise by around a foot in 2050. Furthermore, there are efforts to push for renewable energy such as solar panels, wind farms, and nuclear fusion. The only legitimate concern presented by this scenario is that our water and meat consumption will reach unsustainable levels. And even with those, desalination is a rising technology which has already taken hold in the middle east and possibly by 2070, we will have synthetic meat. World War IIIAlthough this is an unlikely scenario, given the decrease in global tensions, it can still happen. AI takeoverThe emergence of AI is inevitable. This may raise a question of whether they will become smart enough to wonder why they have to take orders. Obviously, the simple solution is to not give robots free will. PandemicThis is the apocalypse which I believe will be the most likely to occur. zombiesYeah, no Or is there?  But seriously, even if there was a human zombie virus, what would it have to gain out of taking over a human over just using the body parts to reproduce? Snail zombie parasites make the snail get eaten by birds so that the parasite can thrive in the bird\u2019s stomach. antibiotic resistanceUp until the late 19th century, bacteria were quite a menace. The immune system doesn\u2019t handle them as well as viruses so naturally, bacteria claimed many lives. This was until the invention of penicillin Penicillin killed the bacteria, saving many lives. Unfortunately, by the 1950s, its overuse saw that bacteria adapted to it and became immune, so stronger antibiotics were developed.Wouldn\u2019t it be a tragedy if bacteria became immune to all antibiotics and became incurable? This problem can be easily mitigated by a virus called a bacteriophage. This virus east bacteria. And the best part is that bacteria can only develop immunity to either this virus or antibiotics. generally a bad disease (such as black death, ebola, or influenza)It is not impossible though outbreaks tend to originate in impoverished areas so it might never reach Europe or the US. alien invasionwhen it comes down to it, the aliens have very little reason to come to Earth in the first place Non apocalyptic: virtual realityThis is the idea that we will create a dyson sphere over the sun to power a virtual reality which everyone will live in. space colonizationThis is the idea that we will set out to explore other worlds and colonize them We have the entire galaxy to ourselveswe form an alliance with other intelligent races as in star trekwe go to war with an alien race which wipes us outThis is an apocalyptic scenario but is a subcategory of a non apocalyptic scenario. This will likely be the result of imperialism on the part of either humanity or the alien race. we find a new dimension and become godlikenot sure what to say about this one ",

            "answer_text": "The future of every species, once it fully populates its habitat, is decline and extinction. There are a few very specific problems limiting further development of H. sapiens: Negative correlation of birth rate and intelligence. This means intelligence is declining over time. Probably without the selection pressure from the hunter gatherer lifestyle, there is not enough need for individual problem solving. There is a lot of dependence on large groups in which only one person needs to be able to solve a problem. There was a brief increase in developed countries due to improved nutrition, and this is now playing out in developing nations, but it soon peaks. Browse on Quora for a couple of years if you don\u2019t believe intelligence is declining. I\u2019ve seen question quality decline over that time.Mostly negative correlation of birth rate and non-reproductive success measures such as wealth. There is an exception for billionaires, but there are not enough of those to affect the species statistically. This again I attribute to the effect of groups, and I suspect it has been going on since the invention of agriculture, but accelerating since the colonial era with the global consolidation of political entities. When a hero became a chief and had several wives and many children, evolution was rapid. Now anyone who collects several wives is thrown in jail. There is no reproductive advantage to success, so the human race is becoming accomplishment impoverished. This is camouflaged by every larger countries and even globalism, as those that are accomplished are known around the world.Centralization of decision making limits variety of approaches to life. The world is now like a huge committee. Everyone has to approve everything, so absolutely nothing gets done. Anyone can say no. Even people without political power can start a social media campaign and have whatever they object to declared to be tragically politically incorrect or even a crime. The internet has had a devastating effect on human evolution.Limits to cooperation in extremely large groups. There are several kinds of cooperation. The cooperative or altruistic personality trait is thought by biologists to be extremely limited, only to close family kin. Reciprocal cooperation can arise in unrelated people in a network in which they are likely to have multiple transactions with the same person or group. Too large a group makes repeating transactions less likely. While internet business tries to overcome this with customer reviews, that works only as long as there are only a few products with a decent product life, and no one figures out how to fake reviews.Negative correlation of cooperation and intelligence. If people are smart, or if you explain game theory to them, they cooperate less, because they realize cooperation exposes them to being taken advantage of.I propose starting a new species deliberately to replace humans. It\u2019s the only way we will have some control over our replacements. Otherwise something like AI will arise and just remove us, or maybe a highly regulated and standardized gene editing regime will centralize reproduction, effectively making social insects out of us. The replacements would need to be CRISPR modified with codes determined from GWAS in at least the following areas: Increased intelligenceIncreased reproductive drive to compensate the negative birth rate / intelligence correlation.Selective reproductive drive to avoid diluting intelligence by breeding back with ordinary humans (this is what makes it a separate species, not a race or other group within H. sapiens).Behavioral modifications (to be determined by research) that give an advantage to cooperation. Just modifying behavior to be more cooperative, without an advantage, would make the new species vulnerable to humans and it would extinguish quickly. Making it more intelligent without such modifications would give up all cooperation advantage and it could not compete with less smart but superstitiously cooperative H. sapiens. The behavioral solution has not yet been found. This is the main holdup, not the genetic techniques.Long life is not in there because as far as I know those alleles have not been identified. They don\u2019t exist in the human species. Intelligence does. Some degree of cooperative behavior does. Whether they can occur together is a question. One idea is that this new group will have the wherewithal to figure out most of the rest of what they need. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many aspects to it: cultural, social, advancement in science, environmental etc. There are so many things that are Co-related to each other. What do I think about it? Read the following: Artificial intelligence: AI is the future, many people would loose job to AI and then there may be a chaos and resentment in poor sections of society.Fury of nature: Due to the damage done to the environment by humans, we will invite nature's fury. It has happened many a times in the past and it would happen in future too. Increasing temperature, unexpected rains, storms & cyclones, changed weather, dying rivers etc would change the way we live and millions of lives would be lost in different parts of the world every year due to consequences of floods, heat waves, famines, storms & cyclones, earthquakes etc.Scarcity of water: Glaciers will melt, many of the existing rivers would die and coupled with rising temperature it would be making a heavy blow to the humanity. Countries would be fighting wars for water and in summers there would be chaos.Extinction of fossil fuels: It's already a documented fact that fossil fuels will last for the next 20\u201330 years only. But would everything some to standstill? No. We will switch over to alternate fuels like solar, wind, nuclear etc for electricity generation. We will switch over from petrol & diesel automobiles to either electric vehicles or alternative fuels like water, liquid hydrogen or oxygen or may be something else. However, life would be disruptive in certain poor countries.Modes of transport: we will switch over to electric vehicles or vehicles with alternative fuels. We would witness some flying cars (more like broom of harry potter) which could carry a person or two to short distances initially.Improvement in diagnostics and health care facilities: with improvement in Medical research, diagnostics of human body would be easy with the use of technology and subsequent treatment would also be quite easy and cheap. It will benefit lots of people around the world.A world with borderless countries: Still, a long way to go. I envision a future of humanity with open borders and borderless countries, though border checks would be quite different as we see now but it won't be quite difficult to visit a country as it is now and human could be roam from one country to another without much problems and restrictions.Human relationships: The people would be quite inward looking and sensitive. People would like to remain single and relationships won't last much. Concept of marriage that we see now won't be same.There are many things that I could see and the list is long. The times would be turbulent in the near future. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on the present road most of humanity is traveling up to now, I estimate in the next 100 years the Earth's environment will suffer greatly. Fish and beef will be considered a luxury food because of the carbon tax that will be levied on beef that will be extreme to deter it from being eaten. The disappearance of ocean fish: Many seafood eaters like the Japanese will have to develop a different diet. Insects will become the new sushi. Insects will be added to food as a new and more viable protein source than soy. Compact food will develop. People will live longer from gene technology and the elimination tobacco use. Cancer will be cured the same way. Sugar and added salt use in food will stop: A sugar and salt substitute that will really taste like the real thing will be discovered. Human physical interaction with each other will decline greatly because of new ways of communication that does not require a physical presence. This will create an entirely new type of society like never seen before. A one world government will develop. The cost to have and raise children will go through the roof by silent design to lean the population. Longevity will follow the same rule. Children will be smarter than their parents by age 12, however they will continue not to be wiser. Although humanity will have depleted much of the earths resources, humanity has a great ability to overcome and adapt and will finally learn to recycle everything and cease unsustainable practices in living. 90% of animal species will become extinct. However, humanity will have the ability to bring extinct species back via DNA preservation and seeds. I can only imagine the next 1000 years. I will say this: It is not likely we will be able to travel to the nearest habitable planet within the next 1000 years unless we miraculously discover propulsion that travels faster than light and overcome time and communication paradoxes. With that said, unless humans control the population and live within what the earth's economy can support, they too will be subject to extinction by then. Of course this is all based on if we don't nuke each other into the end (which I strongly doubt), or an errant asteroid or comet doesn't destroy us, or a direct hit from a gamma ray burst doesn't fry the surface of the Earth. There is much you can say about what to expect from the far future that is not listed here that are negative. However, keep in mind there will also be positive events that will appear miraculous such as contact with ET. However, it will not be as Earth shattering as everyone imagines, because ET may be machine. ET will become common place and will have little effect on humans because of a prime directive of non interference. ",

            "answer_text": "The future!!! (warning - its not a small answer) When ever i think about the future of human race all i can see is Guilt and Remorse. We started destroying earth centuries ago and are developing in an exponential way. If we really continue this way, destruction is the end. But, as humans have a great capability of fighting their own fate they come across a solution in order to survive. Time and space travel. Yes!! But we might not be capable of perfecting it. We take years, generations, centuries,\u2026 . But then we had to leave the earth to another healthy planet that supports life. Our species live there while the earth gets completely destroyed and at the same time they grow on the foreign planet. A great amount of time passes by and then comes the idea of revisiting the home planet which was already destroyed. Here comes in the technology of our future which allows them to travel in time and space to a perfection that they would be able to catch up to the present earth and visit their (our) home land to warn them (us) about the coming disasters and the destruction of our race. As the people, our successors has grown up on a different planet for centuries or millennia, they would have evolved both in physical, mental and communication capabilities. At the time they visit earth with their advanced technology to warn us, we misunderstand their purpose and considered them as Aliens, extra terrestrial beings (as we are known for our impatience and fear of being exploited) they roam around us as long as we can really understand the situation and accept them. Sorry for the long and useless script i wrote up in my free time, But this is all i can think of when i hear the word FUTURE, especially of the human race. :p :p. ",

Really though we live in a world that is tremendously better than it was just 30 years ago. Over time especially in the past couple hundred years, we have exponentially improved the human existence. In the past 20 years the internet has dramatically changed how we live our lives, and it has only just begun. So many people think that it is done, that we have already gotten to the point of no return. Oh man not even close, it doesn\u2019t matter if you as a scientist or philosopher, anyone of them agree that the change has yet to come. A challenge of sorts, whatever that may be, is ahead. Perhaps that is becoming a Type-1 Civilization, or maybe its just some upcoming conflict to get past some Great Filter. Overall we have work to do. The internet is just in it\u2019s infancy, we are (in the frontlines if you will) talking about how its the \u201cInternet 3.0\u201d right now. I don\u2019t foresee us getting to a point of \u201cdone\u201d or upheaval until Internet Ten.  Unity I dedicated my life to improve the world. That is not a sentence that means much without context, but I seriously think that throughout my existence there is going to be challenges in multiple areas that is going to take a polymath to accomplish. I intend on fulfilling that role. Enough about me, the world is what is important. The blockades we face as a species come from our own devise, and we are the only ones who can defeat them. Meaning climate change, social justice, global development, world nations, and overall just organizing the human race in a new age. The Anthropocene era is one that is going to make a massive shift on our planet. Whether it is good or bad, is up in the air. It is my hope that we can accomplish SOMETHING good in this time period, so that we may all live in even greater peace in the future. Future. Potential. Unity. ",

Humans have to be upgraded by technology in a more involved and aggressive manner than it has been the norm so far. We will have all sorts of augmentations that attach to our brains to make us smarter, replace our muscles to make us stronger or extra batteries that allow us to work longer. We will approach immortality, and maybe even become immortal.  Once that happens a big shift will occur in the lifestyle of people. People will get training for whatever they will become for longer and longer, have children later and since they don't expect to die, multiple marriages will become much more common, you will wanna change partners every 200 years, no?  We will make robots that are very similar to the cyborgs we have turned to and hence freely mix with them, maybe even have unprotected sex with them ( since there is no risk of infection/babies). Of course by that point robot right advocates also tell you that robots have similar rights as humans, and some others will cry that humanity has lost their charm by accepting robots into the society.  Further, I think it is inevitable that we leave earth, and we leave it without return. That will cause us to lose bones ( if technology hasn't done so already). But more importantly, we will leave each other, never to meet again, to start our grand journey in the universe. This last part is both fascinating and terrifying. ",

            "answer_text": "**Brief answer:** After all, it is natural process lead to human rational thinking ability which is an incomplete rationality, and that lead to artificial rationality which is a complete rationality that will lead to human endless future. All human voluntary agree to practice rational process in rational system that will be the best way to reach endless future but the reality showed us it is impossible: the rules are not there to support rational process but it encourages and forces people to practice in stable strategy in natural process to destroy the systems. **More explanation:** Reality check: The recent example is: Australian Queensland premier use political and administrative power to order a 3-week deadline for the environment department to give the green light for the environment approval for the Adani coal mine project. While nearly all the residents in the mining regions voted in this recent election in favor for this project. Even though the chief scientist in environment science had explicitly expressed his disapproval for this project in public, the odds are definitely not on the environment and human future but on the present personal interests. It is a shame and I regret have opposed of the Brazilian people\u2019s will to open Amazon forest region for economic activities. Sorry Brasilia, I was wrong, you were right, go ahead use your vast resources to make yourselves rich and powerful to let yourselves be adored and respected as \u201cself-made millionaires\u201d, win the process level free competition and natural selection. The present rules which are uphold and endorsed by both the ruling and the ruled as granted and as natural law, so be it. Go ahead make yourselves rich and enjoy the process in glory! There can\u2019t be no double standard, man. Let it be a true free competition and natural selection. The theoretical part of the explanation: For life, future is endless future, because limited life is not life but an evolution waste waiting to be recycled by nature. Natural social system will necessarily evolve into manmade social system, and natural process will inevitably cause destructive effect on manmade system and the natural system that supports it on the earth. We got a big problem: everyone is hypocrite, we all want others to be energy conscious, environment conscious but ourselves all want the freedom, convenience, comfort and luxury of a modern life style. History and reality both show that we cannot stop this destruction process, it is intrinsically stable process supported by all the stable behavioral strategies that give them the material power and reinforce that behavioral strategy. We only can push the contradiction to the extreme to accelerate the destruction to let the contradiction explode and that trigger war and that may give a chance for the earth and for human future. That is because, only natural process can bring the force to destroy the naturally stable social system it naturally evolved out for the rational process to be established. Human as a natural product, which is intrinsically natural and therefore corrupt that makes us intrinsically unable to enforce rational process and maintain it. Only the product of the rationality --- rational autonomous robot that is intrinsically complete rational and therefore intrinsically incorruptible therefore has the ability to enforce rational process and maintain it. Natural process can order out rational thinking ability of intelligent life (here is called human), but human cannot persuade or force all human into rational process run rational social system to reach endless future (history and reality showed that), but according to rational inference, we can predict that: the product of the rational thinking --- rationally programmed autonomous robot can force all human into the track of rational process and establish rational social system that leads human into endless future. This process is a naturally stable process that one previous effect will necessarily become the cause of the next effect, and so on: Natural process \u2192 system evolve from natural social system into manmade social system \u2192 natural process cause destructive effect on manmade social system and the natural systems that support the social system in this local space and time \u2192 the development of the process-system contradiction cause violent conflict in human social system \u2192 human rational ability sooner or later will create rational autonomous robot to win the war \u2192 the logical result of the natural self-improvement process will inevitably lead to rational autonomous robot to force all human into rational process run rational social system to reach endless future. We cannot enforce complete rationality in our social system, because we are human --- the natural product of natural process which is a biological being. All our present social economic systems are mixtures of natural process and rational measures regardless it is capitalism, socialism, communism, in various forms of people\u2019s capitalism, anarchist capitalism, state socialism, state social capitalism\u2026 They are all natural process based and dominated, rational measure modified natural process run manmade social systems. Therefore they are all intrinsically unsustainable process that will lead to the ending of life on earth. All these rational measure modification are not aimed to change this natural process run manmade social system into complete rational process run rational social system to reach endless future but just mean to a little bit further prolong this natural process in this social system to enjoy this process. That only led to prolonged slow destruction process that will fully exhaust and deeply destruct the material base for human future that totally shortfall the real value for supporting our next 1.2 billion years survival and evolution that is necessary for human evolution to reach the level to be connected to higher process to reach endless future. Human cannot persuade or force human into rational process due to it is intrinsically unstable process, only complete rationality can bring us into complete rational process and complete rational social system that can lead to endless future. But due to human is a natural being that is a biological dissipative structure that is expressed as individual genetic structure which cannot reach complete rationality by its nature. But the naturally stable process of evolution leads to spontaneous contradiction development will lead to artificial rationality for competition purposes that will spontaneously evolve and spontaneously force human into rational process to reach endless future. After all, it is the natural process that will lead to rationality that will lead to endless future for the life form that produced this intrinsically rational being --- rational autonomous robot. Human is the natural product of the natural process, we cannot spontaneously reach endless future but the rational ability of this human produced artificial rationality --- rational autonomous robot, will go ahead that will turn back to send human into endless future by force. It is a form of free competition and natural selection --- because only rational thinking human can design rational program for rational autonomous robot. **Human survival road map summary:** Natural process orders out human being, and caused the process \u2013 system contradiction, that causes conflict and that bring the needs for weapon, the ultimate weapon is rational autonomous robot, this robot will necessarily bring human into rational process run rational system to reach endless future. Due to the above mentioned reasons, population control measures are unnecessary, economy should be pushed to full speed development, concentration should be put on weapon development especially autonomous robot, and regardless who made it in the end, the result is the same. **Bottom line still has to be held:** Even though, bottom line still has to be held, because when the basic material foundation for human survival and evolution on the earth is destroyed, whatever we do, whatever process and system we may get in the end, we are intrinsically doomed, irreversibly. 1. Chemical pollution still should be controlled: chemical pollution disorder the fundamental biological information that equals to billions of years natural evolution result that will be too costly for the positive evolution progress. Chemical pollutions negate huge amount of real value consumed by nature to evolve out this amount of order. It is an irreversible process in thermodynamic terms. This will shortfall too much of the evolution level we need to reach endless future because our time is limited for what we have to achieve (which is the next 1.2 billion years, and the goal target is every high --- evolve to a totally different existence state), therefore, should be avoided at all costs. 2. The geothermal system is the basic core infrastructure for the earth ecosystem existence, therefore should be kept at all costs. But in the meantime, a lot of the ecosystem will inevitably be sacrificed to push the extreme conditions to trigger the explosion of the global conflict to break the old social system to establish the new. The sooner, faster and the thorough the destruction process, the more chance we can preserve more of the core of the natural supporting systems to let it support our long term evolution process to send us into endless future. It does is very dangerous, it is very hard to control the degree of destruction, but there is just no other choice. What is the control mechanism for autonomous robot: There is no need for any control for the rational autonomous robot. Because complete rational autonomous robot is independent rational existence and it only follow correct concept based rational logic computation result. And there is only one absolute truth. All forms of rationality spontaneously convergence towards this absolute truth. And more rational the robot the more powerful it will be. The order will be formed spontaneously and the control mechanisms will be formed so too. There is no need for any manmade control and no one can once this process start. And there is a fundamental question --- can our control be rational? The answer is no. if we can reach complete rationality, we don\u2019t need rational autonomous robot in the first place. Regardless who programmed the first rational autonomous robot, the result will be the same. Once the first rational autonomous robot is programmed, human lost the operational control of this robot but get the control of human destiny (via robots by their complete rationality). So let it be a true free competition and natural selection. Put your faith on rationality, sit back, relax, watch and enjoy the process. That may not happen in our generation but it will happen sooner or later; the sooner the better for human future. Have to confess, I don\u2019t feel relaxed. There may be a great chance we will be extinct in this process. I just instinctively feel something maybe wrong if it sounds too easy, because thermodynamic laws don\u2019t allow that. There are too many uncertainties in this process that is out of our rational control. What if that happen before rational robot can be made and take over control? ",

            "answer_text": "The word \u201chumanity\u201d sounds like everything in the universe is human-centric? In fact, we (Humankind) are a specie like other species \u2014 the act of consumption, reproduction and propagation on Earth. By conduct and behaviour we are a complex and composite mixture of contradictions \u2014 beauty and ugliness, hope and despair, intelligence and stupidity, rationality and absurdity, order and chaos, peace and war, construction and destruction, pleasure and pain, humour and irony, and the both extremes of a god and a devil \u2014 the most unpredictable animals on the planet. And the harsh reality is that the diverse microscopic entities on Earth have no need for Humankind. All microbes and species are busy extracting and excreting the chemical pieces in processes that have sustained life and sculpted Earth for the past four billion years or so. As it appears all biological life-forms are struggling to exist, survive and self-preserve by following the \u2018competitive exclusion principle' at their micro level of existence, the \u2018collaborative inclusion principle' at their cellular level of existence, and the \u2018competition-colonization trade-off principle' at their individual specie level of existence. As much as Humankind being a specie is part of this lineage, except otherwise, humans are unusual in their capacity to process sensory/sensational information in the most novel ways due to possessing the traits/attributes of 'consciousness, intellect, intuition, and communication' better than that of rest of the species on Earth. So, in fact, the amazing traits/attributes of consciousness, intellect, intuition and communication (audio, visual, abstract) have made Humankind a cognitive specie. We intuite, compute and cogitate. Somehow, in a way that no philosopher, scientist and theologian (save Al-Qur\u00e3n) has yet adequately explained the phenomena. We appear to have the capacity to understand and recognise the nature of our existence, and of the deeper mechanics and meanings of the world (physical and un-physcial). The concept we call \u2018reality\u2019 may still elude us in many respects, but we have discovered and development logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience and other pieces of the puzzle of the emergence of complexity in the universe/multiverse. And yet: Do Humankind seize the remarkable opportunity of being an advanced cognitive specie on Earth that the Big Bang [or God] has unintentionally [or intentionally] thrown to them?Do Humankind grab onto every moment of each of their lives and gorge on the banquet of consciousness, intellect, intuition and communcation, and the meanings thereof staring at their faces?But, of course, it could be argued that Humankind literally can\u2019t help themselves. They are as bound to the processes of Darwinian selection and evolution as the lowliest microbe. To function and propagate into the future as a specie, therefore, Humankind must accept the variation and imbalance, whether it\u2019s in physical traits or intelligence and behavior. For the self-preservation and propagation Humankind, therefore, must follow the \u2018competitive exclusion principle' at their individual level of existence, the \u2018collaborative inclusion principle' at their creed/tribal level of existence, and the \u2018competition-colonization trade-off principle' at their individual race level of existence. There is no monochrome future of identical human mindsets, because such a thing will be pruned by natural selection in the face of changing environments.....??? Notwithstanding, when Humankind 'know' that they are doing 'bad\u2019 things, and when they 'know' that today\u2019s natural riches are fleeting and the senseless exploitation thereof is going to lead to enormous hardships within a single lifetime, shouldn't they really be able to pull it together a bit better \u2014 realise the \u2018Universal Good' and/or the 'Good' as defined by their 'Creator & Sustainer' for recognising and accepting the immutable reality \u2014 Humankind are the one specie and Earth is their common natural habitat providing a tremendous opportunity to progress only by applying their collective intellect and knowledge and following the \u2018collaborative inclusion principle' to the benefit of all Humankind and the Environment? At present Humankind are facing at least three existential challenges: The overpopulation and continuous tension between the rich and the poor,The global warming, andQICT (quantum information & communication technology).The current Humankind population on Earth is around 7.7 Billion and still counting. Rich is getting richer and poor is getting poorer. And the irony is that the poor is reproducing more children than the rich \u2014 the typical survival instinct \u2014 let the most fittest one amongst them survive. This phenomenon has strained the natural resources and the environment. But Nature has its own laws that are not human-centric. Nature may react by way of natural calamities and disasters in order to rebalance the ecology of Earth? In \u201cThe Next 100 Years\u201d, George Friedman has predicted WW-III to occur sometime during 2040's, if not earlier. Definitely that is going to end at least half of the human population on Earth within a year time, and render the rest to suffer the environmental disaster due to the WW-III? Let us assume Humankind have become conscious of the global warming, and strated taking corrective measures and in response to thereof, the natural environment also rebalances itself within next 50 years or so. What about the continuous tension between the rich economies and the poor economies \u2014 the poor economies having the power of numbers and religion vs. the rich economies having the power of science & technology and secularism? How are Humankind going to solve this problem? Is waging wars by the rich economies unto the poor economies in the name of \u2018war against terrorism' or \u2018regime change' an answer to the real problems \u2014 kleptocracy, corruption, lack of education, poverty and overpopulation that have turned the three quarter of Humankind into poor economies? QICT is going to change the present lifestyle including identity and agency of Humankind on Earth. When the quantum computers and wireless communication systems including AI become fully functional, the present identities of Humankind will turn into the numbers/ barcodes. Those who are going to command the QICT will also be commanding lives of Humankind on Earth. The commanders and controllers of QICT will become gods to decide about who amongst Humankind may exist or be deleted in the QICT system to survive or die. They will be deciding about who is potentially useful to survive and be nourished according to their standards of utility. The vast majority of Humankind will become the subject of drugs testing, genetic engineering, neurotechnolog, radiations,\u2026, for the research & development of superhumans. At the end, only the humans possessing superior genes will survive and thrive... Henceforth the \u2018Utilitarianism\u2019 will be the religion of future Humankind \u2014 Hakuna Matata \u2014 does it mean no worries? \u201cAnd let metamorphose to the abomination (\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0650\u0651\u062c\u0652\u0633\u064e) upon those who have not applied their intellect (\u0639\u0642\u0644)!\u201d ~ Al-Qur\u00e3n (10:100) ",

            "answer_text": "The future of mankind to a limited extent is to survive and reproduce itself without sex. As already known, humans as a specie try to survive, and also reproduce. Currently one of the biggest areas in tech is robotics, where humans try to build other autonomous systems. It seems that humans are trying to reproduce without sex, by building newer versions of themselves. An important principle to note here is self-reference. Everything humans do is self-referenced. You do things that you know of, that are part of you. So, either humans consciously and intentionally try to build \u201chuman-like\u201d robots or not, those robots are always inevitably human-like, as they were designed and built by humans. Basically, it seems that sex and birth-giving are being replaced by engineering. The difference is that when giving birth with sex, there is the sexual act, and the growth of new humans happens unconsciously and unintentionally by the body. We don\u2019t know exactly how, and have been trying to figure it out for years. In engineering, robots are designed consciously and intentionally. It all starts with design and from an existing language and with the intention to produce specific results, and we know everything about this process. Stephen Hawking currently predicts that mankind will be extinct in 1000 years. I think that this is half true and half false. The new robots that will replace mankind will be the new humans. The line that separates between \u201cmankind\u201dand \u201crobots\u201d is not clear. The separation implied seems to be: Mankind is the human specie which consists of natural flesh, reproduction was initiated with the sexual act, growth happened with unknown, uncontrollable natural processesRobots are the species which were made artificially, and reproduction was done with engineering processes, all known and controllable..But by then perhaps it may even be possible to make flesh, or a newer version of flesh which is more resilient or more suitable for the new designs, and it may not be possible to separate between what is natural and what not. The only difference will be that humans will be produced by sex and traditional birth-giving, and robots by construction. ",

Intelligence is the only thing which differentiate man from animal. The knowing from the unknowing. Everything else follows naturally. Actually it is not the intelligence level as such but rather the speed at which the level of intelligence evolves.  Intelligence is the ultimate and most important criteria of classification of any civilisation, anywhere in the universe. Basically there are only two developmental stages:  a) Natural -very slow (Static) - Intelligence on Earth right now. b) Non natural -very fast (Dynamic) - Intelligence on Earth in the 22nd Century??? Keep in mind, a lower, static intelligence has nothing to say to a higher, highly dynamic intelligence! Such a fast envolving intelligence won't bother with our non envolving intelligence just as we don't bother communicating with bacterias :) And it is totally impossible for our intelligence to even conceive the rules and laws governing that form of existence, just as is it impossible for a bacteria to fathom our world!

Think about the world before computers were common. Nobody was able to predict more than a tiny fraction of consequences that look obvious in hindsight. I believe we are in for changes at least that great, just from computers continuing to advance. Automation will change the world more than anything else. The very concept of working for a living has to be reexamined. What happens when there is no work for 20% of people? 50%? 95%? We are going to find out. Eventually just about all jobs will be done more easily and more cheaply by machines. People need constructive work for pride's sake if nothing else. The highly creative will be fine, but what about Joe Schmo? Jane Doe? The entire bottom half of the bell curve? What are they going to do? Universal basic income will be a necessity. The alternative is millions of people starving, and hungry people tend to break things, like government and civilization. But that won't be enough. People need purpose. Birth rates will fall, population will decrease, but not fast enough. We are in for a century or two of people unhappy to be on the dole, but unable to find work. What do people want to be, when they don't have to work? Talk to retirees. Look at the independently wealthy. Children. People will always want more. More stuff, more experiences, more purpose, more respect. Not everything will be plentiful, even if everyone is fed, clothed and housed. People will still find reason to fight. They might be stupid reasons, but they will be there. Conservatives fear the hunger of the mob surpassing even the capacity of a society of plenty. And that is one danger. There are a lot of other dangers too. I worry. ",

It would no longer be a question of the more effort you make, the greater the reward or the less you sweat, the less you make. The idea of no pain, no gain would be pass\u00e9. The concept of equity would vanish in thin air, and the idea of equality would no longer be necessary. People would not need money\uff0cthere would be no any tax, economics would be thrown out the window. The contradictory relations between efficiency and security as well as between efficiency and natural freedom would no longer exist. People would have unlimited natural freedom. The contradictory relations between equality and social freedom would no longer be around. There would not be any clashes of isms. We would not have a party on the left and a party on the right. The laws that have been enacted to ensure equity would no longer make any sense, although the laws enacted for the purpose of guaranteeing personal security would still be necessary. Politics would be simplified. Except for the contradictory relations between personal security and social freedom, eight of the nine relations in Figure 1 would no longer be there. The great majority of the problems in human society stem from low efficiency. Just about every social malaise is a poor man\u2019s malaise.

            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201cWhat is next in the development of mankind?\u201d A unified society on this planet. Over the course of history, humans have developed larger and larger groupings. We could consider marriage to be the first such grouping, followed by family, tribe, city, and nation. We stand today at the end of the period during which nations were adequate to human needs. Many of the world\u2019s ills today, such as war, hunger, and terrorism, are products of unresolved international conflict. Eventually, we will need to develop a way to resolve these conflicts. At this point we will, by definition, live in a unified world. There are many dystopian scenarios about a unified world, and some aspects of those are evident even today, such as the international power of giant corporations, which far exceed the size and power of many nations. However, these dystopian aspects will be overcome, and just as there are many nations today that are composed of separate states or provinces, so in the future the world will have a single super-state that is composed of all the separate nations. Here are some requirements for the qualities of that super-state. Far from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society, it seeks to broaden its basis, to remold its institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an ever-changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men\u2019s hearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils of excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language and tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human race. It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive centralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other. \u2014The World Order of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. Here is a description of what that super-state will look like. Some form of a world super-state must needs be evolved, in whose favor all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to maintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining internal order within their respective dominions. Such a state will have to include within its orbit an international executive adequate to enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the commonwealth; a world parliament whose members shall be elected by the people in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed by their respective governments; and a supreme tribunal whose judgment will have a binding effect even in such cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to submit their case to its consideration. A world community in which all economic barriers will have been permanently demolished and the interdependence of Capital and Labor definitely recognized; in which the clamor of religious fanaticism and strife will have been forever stilled; in which the flame of racial animosity will have been finally extinguished; in which a single code of international law\u2014the product of the considered judgment of the world\u2019s federated representatives\u2014shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive intervention of the combined forces of the federated units; and finally a world community in which the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism will have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of world citizenship\u2014such indeed, appears, in its broadest outline, the Order anticipated by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the fairest fruit of a slowly maturing age. \u2014ibid. It should be noted that in order for this super-state to be formed, every nation will have voluntarily joined it. Thus, its authority will be the authority of the entire human race. ",

The reason is that there is a war waging between the humane and the inhumane or what in religious terms is called good and evil. In part that war is obvious owing to the more obvious brutality of our times and the immense damage done to the planet and the wildlife. However there is also unseen damage done by the inhumane. The reason it is unseen is that this damage is being called disease and marketed for profit. However there is a time coming soon when the humane will awaken to their spiritual strength and powers. There will also be an awakening as to how and why people suffer with diseases. I found that it does not have to do with any lifestyle choices, such as diet or lack of exercise or toxins in the environment. The problem is inter-relational and what dirty mind games are played by the inhumane. To help the humane people to understand how these games are played and thus to avoid becoming victimized I have created this video series here:  Once the humane awaken to the truth the inhumane are doomed. There are perhaps between 800 million to 1 billion people who are inhumane and all of them will perish. The humane will survive and they will again live in balance and harmony so that all life on earth will be sustainable and the resources will be enough. The birth rate will decline because in peace time, where there is security, there is no overpopulation. Overpopulation is the result of oppression, wars and conditions threatening to life. These conditions will be gone. The future is bright but only for the humane. ",

Specifically, I suspect (for several reasons) that the next few centuries will be a bit like the Dark Age in the European Early Middle Ages. Not necessarily dangerous or primitive, but social structures will become transient and small-scale. This has actually been happening for some time. When the United Nations was formed, just after World War II, there were 40 nations in the world. Now, there are over 200. There have been exactly two occasions in that period when the number decreased: the re-unification of Germany, and Indonesia\u2019s annexation of East Timor, which lasted for 23 years before a UN-sponsored referendum restored the former Portuguese colony to independence. As for transience, I\u2019m a Baby Boomer. When I grew up, most of the time the way you related to government or corporate bodies was very similar to how your parents and grandparents had. Nowadays, rules and protocols change by the year, if not the month. Then, too, there are environmental problems. Most people nowadays have heard about Global Warming, but those of us who pay attention to such things are also worried about loss of biodiversity, degradation of agricultural lands, habitat loss, chemical pollution, unsupervised genetic modification, and a host of other issues. Greenies are often accused of being alarmist Cassandras. I have my own issues with their attitudes: I think they\u2019re too optimistic. I suspect this century will see so much environmental devastation and human misery that people will give up, stop caring, and (in the long run) make things even worse. The Sixth Extinction (Holocene extinction - Wikipedia) is just getting underway, but in the next few centuries I expect that most species now alive will become extinct. Eventually, we\u2019ll come out of it. In a few hundred years we\u2019ll get our shit together (having had most of the maladaptive behaviours beaten out of us during the chaos centuries), preserve whatever\u2019s left of the environment, create some sort of economy that works in a post-industrial society (which the one we have now clearly doesn\u2019t), and start spreading out into the solar system and, eventually, the galaxy. In the long term (thousands of years, tens of thousands, and more), I see a scenario a lot like certain science fiction stories, but without the fantastic elements. Humans, or human-derived AIs in robotic or cyborg bodies, colonising planets, asteroids, and artificial habitats around many different stars, and probably also comets far from any star. Travel between them will be slow and expensive, but it will probably be possible to digitize your brain (\u201cupload your mind\u201d) and beam it anywhere at the speed of light. Most if not all of the Earth is likely to be a restricted Conservation Zone. (Anyone who wants to write an SF story about the Evacuation of Earth, be my guest. I have many pages of notes which I\u2019m not likely to use, if you think you want them\u2026) ",

As much as all the predictions, scientific studies, social media, society and the movies portray a world of selfishness, greed, chaos, pollution, population, poverty and unimaginable misery\u2026. I beg to differ, not to the other extreme of a Utopian world without suffering and pain. I personally believe that mankind is now entering an exciting and wonderful future. If we carefully observe ourselves we\u2019ll find that in man Physical evolution seems to have seized a long time ago, The only scope for any evolution left in man is the scope of mental or spiritual transformation. The hardware has stopped evolving, the only change that can occur is in the software, in our minds , in the way we see ourselves and our lives in a larger scheme of events, at an all inclusive cosmic scale. While the scientists struggle to see beyond the planks wall, certain subjective scientists or sages of the East have found their way around the planks wall and are pissing on it from the other side. Most importantly it doesn\u2019t seem to matter what the future of mankind is externally. The world that we experience around us is only a reflection of our own minds. And the fact is we experience the world always out of our colored vision and never as it is. So the future of mankind is in fact nothing but the MindKind of the present. ",

Already I offload all sorts of thinking to my phone, multiply that by a thousand as brain-computer interfaces get better.  2) the lines between people will blur.  Instantaneous communication between people starts to create a group mind in which individuals integrate more and more closely together. 3) we will shift from meat space to information space, in whatever physical manifestation computers/minds have at that point.  We will probably be one, (or few) and consume less resources.  4) rather than travel or expand over the galaxy we will be content to observe, theorize and simulate.  Information will be as practically real as physical reality.  5) new forms of mind / life may emerge in the information-space, with the rules of information-space as the new rules of physics.   6) Our simulations of reality will eventually get so accurate that they can only be run using physics as our computer - ie: the simulation of one atom will be performed by *that* atom.  The information space and physics space are now merged, and all matter is, in it's own way, part of the universe's mind.  \"We are a way for the universe to know itself\" - this is the end-game in which, by knowing itself completely, the universe is once again not-alive.

In England, children under 16 were considered to young to view the film without their parents.  Think about that, and then think about the kinds of media kids nowdays consume, and what is considered \u2018scary\u2019. Over the years, people have become more fearless, at least when it comes to movies. A few years ago, one of my brothers let me try out his VR headset. He let me play a few games on it, including Skyrim. When I put the headset on, I was next to a steep slope, and there was a horse near by. I was taught how to mount the horse, and when it did it immediately started moving. It ran down the slope, and at the time I was absolutely terrified. My body reacted the same way it would if it was the real thing. My legs wobbled, my arms flayed and my heart raced. So when I learnt that there were literal VR horror games, I was shocked. But then I realized, was this just another Snow White? Would our grandchildren react less to VR is a few decades? How tolerant will we be, and what will be considered \u2018too scary\u2019 for children? That\u2019s my theory anyways. I\u2019m not an expert, but I think this is a reasonable prediction. .

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Whatever the future is to be, accelerating automation and technology will be the primary driving force that shapes it.  Many people don't appreciate how technology is responsible for essentially all of the progress of humanity. Now that its exponential rate of acceleration has finally been widely recognized, technology is sweeping everything along with it so fast that we are continuously amazed.  I'll give you the future I long for and the future I fear. The future I long for is one in which we recognize that technology has finally lifted us as a species to an exalted place from which we can end the Scarcity Game forever, and begin a sustainable, permanent Abundance Game. In such a future, many of our seemingly intractable problems will either disappear or be greatly ameliorated. Later in this century, people will look back upon this time like a bad dream.  The future I fear is one in which the gap between looming, massive technological unemployment and the advent of universal abundance is too great, and social disruption results. Then and only then, I can foresee the possibility of dystopias actually happening.  The future I long for, an Abundance Game (and in particular a Celebration Society), will not be utopia. It will still have problems, but with conditions of prevailing peace, prosperity, and unrestricted progress. It will become a world of exploration, play and celebration. Like children in a well-functioning, prosperous family, every human being will know that their basic needs and those of others they care about will always be met by the automated systems of production. AI's will become our partners in endless realms of mental exploration and creation. Many of the most amazing gifts to humanity and life on Earth (biological and non-biological) will come from partnerships of AI's and people who opt-in to partner with them.  Humanity can expand within this century to multitudes of O'Neill space colonies scattered throughout the Solar System, each offering a far higher quality of life to its residents than anything available on Earth now. They will, all or many of them, become premier tourist destinations. This will offer us far more living space and lifestyle options than could ever be achieved by colonizing Mars.  If we do this right, marshalling our considerable knowledge of science and technology to the building and testing of new model societies based on abundance, we can evolve as a species from our present-day culture of taking and scarcity thinking into a culture of voluntary mutual service, within a solid context of abundance. We can grow from adolescence to maturity, and we can do it within this century. ",

Many a time when we think about our ansisters who live into a cave then we have a curiosity to know that will be our future. FUTURE OF HUMANITY Actually it is very difficult to make predictions but after analysing a lot of things we can make a prediction which can be accurate a lot. So so to predict the future we have to understand how our ansisters of 1900 think of us, they will think we are wizards or sorcerers who have magic mirrors called mobile phones, flying carpets called jet airplanes. So, i think if we look our descendant of 2100 they will be look like hindu gods like Hanuman who is immortal because i think in future the genetic engineering will be so adwance that we can take out the age causing geans out of our DNA anf became immortal. Like Sanjay of Mahabharata, we will have more advanced drones who don't need any type of maintenance or they be self healing as today we are at the point where Lamborghini has created the world's first self-healing sports car. The Terzo Millennio, which translates as third millennium in Italian, has the ability to detect and repair cracks in its body work. I think that the industries which will be the biggest in 2100 are mainly ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, NENO TECHNOLOGY, BIO TECHNOLOGY. Ofcourse, now most of you have a question that will one day A.I became dangerous for humanity? Yes, but only if they become self aware. I think until they become self aware they are like workers for us. Also you have a question that will it reduce employment? No, because A.I reduce employment in one sector but increase employment in another sector. For example, when automated teller machine (A.T.M) was introduced people thought it will reduce employment in banking sector. But some times predictions also fail for example when internet was first introduced at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) so that scientists from all over the world can share their reserch and public thought that one day internet become a place for high culture art and society but today we all know that around 4% of internet if only filled by pornography.

We\u2019re all entitled to our opinions on that, but I\u2019ll tell you what I believe. As the climate and the oceans change, humanity will be forced to adapt to decreased inhabitable land and resources. At the same time, humanity will be forced to answer the consequences of the population boom that we\u2019re on trajectory for. Island nations will appear to sink into the oceans and refugees will beg for help. The future is the now \u2014 we need to plan for all of this, NOW. As I see the future, it doesn\u2019t require a redistribution of wealth but it certainly requires the flow of wealth. Rich people will either choose to spend on climate adaptations or they will be forced to. Wealthy countries have the best chance of survival, but we should try to give as many people a fair, fighting chance to survive on this planet. We should fight for our own families. Look, I\u2019m more realistic about the situation and I know there will be scarcity of resources and there will be death. People will want to get into the United States of America, Canada, Russia, England, Scandinavian countries, Iceland, and Greenland in the future. People will also move upwards into the hills and mountainous areas as the fresh water fades away. We can\u2019t save everybody, so we should fight to save our families. I know it might seem grim, but we are living at one of the best times a human could possibly live. I believe that we will reach peak luxury and then literally EVERYBODY will have to make sacrifices in the future. Humanity will put up a HELL OF A FIGHT before extinction though. And whatever intelligent form comes after us will definitely appreciate both the good and bad of what humanity left for them. ",

This could be as simple as the energy that comes through food, or as complicated as running our various devices and technologies. So our future isn\u2019t much different then our past, we just need a hell of a lot more energy, which may or may not be possible given the political interests that surround energy systems. There may or may not be a future for humanity if we can\u2019t solve the energy and global warming crisis. I am a sci-fi writer and so I think a lot about the future. There is so much speculation going on. One thing that is true is that it is highly likely that Artificial Intelligence will be a major factor in the next few decades, as well security issues dealing with things like climate change and water. It is also likely that we will explore some of space, though how much depends on funding and what we find out there. If we find really awesome resources in things like asteroids, we will move more quickly. But honestly, if we don\u2019t solve the very serious issues facing us at home, there won\u2019t be much future to speculate about. ",

Other continents might have a more wide open approach with less control. Still others might opt for artificially modified environments and be isolationist. All futures can exist maybe at the same time for a while. When I look at an IQ map of the world I see this has happened and that process is continuing to evolve and may determine in the future just who will have the wealth, health and intelligence.

It may take a couple billion years to do so, but the laws of physics dictate this inevitability. In the same vein, our sun will eventually run out of fuel and our solar system will cease to exist. Humanity, or our current understanding of it, will eventually die. Cheery thought, huh? I turn to H.G. Wells to find solace. His novel The Time Machine explores the inevitability of the death of humanity due to entropy. And the only hope he provides is that while humanity survives, love and compassion will be the cornerstone of our existence. Over 800 thousand years in the future, a creature called Weena, reduced to the level of livestock, still retains the ability to show compassion to the Time Traveler by giving him a flower. This simple act of love and compassion is a symbol of mankind\u2019s significance in the face of ultimate extinction: we are doomed, but even if we are doomed, we can be good to one another.

Over the last 40,000 years we have killed half of the trees and reduced the largest extent of those former forests to deserts and arid, sterile land with few species and little to no bio-productivity; and the lands we have claimed for cropland and habitation have the soil mass and thickness reduced by half. That is 75% loss of the terrestrial ecosystem, and possibly a loss of 1/2 of the land and fresh water species. Bio-diversity drops 50% within ten miles of a road, and we are busy building roads through the few remaining wildernesses. Cropland, gardens, landscaping, harvested forests, parks and preserves are collapsed ecosystems that can\u2019t sustain themselves, they are subject to invasive species and pests that eventually wipe them out in lieu of agricultural poisons (insecticide, fungicide, herbicide) that have unsustainable side effects. This has been accelerated by the Industrial Revolution, chemical fertilizer, and made irreversible by irrigation and flush toilets, which wash the five dozen bio-essential minerals to the sea. Soil deficiencies of trace elements produce food lacking vitamins, minerals, enzymes, bio-flavenoids and immuno-support complexes. Further, we have over-fished, drained and and dammed our rivers so the anadromous fish (salmon, herring, eels) no longer restore the elements from the ocean to the land by spawning upstream. Lately we have extended our wanton destruction to the other 70% of the planet. A recent survey showed that the global concentration of oceanic phytoplankton has dropped 60% over the last 100 years or so. This used the first global survey apparatus and data as a benchmark, a direct physical nephelometric surface measurement which is more accurate than all the other studies using aerial and satellite spectral analysis. This means that our total long term supply of Oxygen is stunted by 2/3. This is a vicious circle because phytoplankton are also the biggest factor in breaking down CO2, which we are pumping into the atmosphere and ocean at an increasing rate. The increasing CO2 in the ocean is causing a pH shift which accelerates the human caused extinction of the plankton. The most likely cause for the historical decimation of plankton populations is whaling. When the oceanic life forms die from causes other than predation, their corpses sink to the bottom which causes a rain of elements to an average depth of 1,000 meters. The only mechanism for bringing these elements back from that depth is bottom feeding whales, and we have killed over 90% of them. This is causing an elemental deficiency of 4 millions tons per day, spread over 9 million square miles of ocean bottom. We may be past the tipping point, but reversal probably means reducing the human population 75% and immediate cessation of mining and burning. This means no motorized transportation, no machines when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing, abandoning cities and farming our food by hand. From all my discussions, people would rather die. ",

            "answer_text": "We need to understand a basic law that is true everywhere: Everything has a beginning, gets older over time, and finally ends. In the final stage, it either disappears completely or becomes a new entity. In its new stage, it is often more advanced and stronger than its previous form of existence. For example, consider the the human species of Neanderthal which vanished from Earth with the coming of the more advanced species of the Homo Sapiens. This rule not only applies to living beings, but also inventions and products that are in use in everyday life. If there is a God, just the same as in evolution, life doesn't just disappear, without there be a replacement and ongoing growth, or some form of evolution which impacts its existence. Some could ask, if God created this world, why wouldn't He care for humanity and doesn't stop the sufferings once and for all? Obviously, most people will refer to the story of Adam and Eve and the fall of humanity from Heaven. Also Human wickedness and mischievous behavior and the rule of evil forces in this world has played decisive role in the destiny of mankind. Therefore, we conclude that the whole world as it evolves, it also comes closer to its final stage. We don't know exactly afterwards what's going to happen in the end, but the concept of space and time will become irrelevant and non existent. Nothing and everything will not exist. So the question is that could the seed of creation somehow be protected? Who we are now and what we becime in the future can have an effect on that. However, at that stage everything will be God's Hand. ",

There are a few species that have been around more or less unchanged for millions of years. Are we to be one of them? We haven\u2019t been around very long yet, comparatively speaking hardly a blink of an eye; if we manage to achieve a similar kind of balance and stability to theirs, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll attain a similar long-term evolutionary stasis. I could be wrong, but I think it\u2019s unlikely that we will. Humanity is very far from anything like that now, and it\u2019s not entirely a matter of the choices we make and don\u2019t make. There are choices that, biologically, we can\u2019t make and there are ones we can\u2019t not make. In the long haul, at any rate, everything ends. Where life goes on, it\u2019s simply replaced at both the individual and species level. Old life dies and gets recycled to make new life possible. The two-billion-year history of life on Earth is replete with examples, overwhelmingly more so than with examples of anything else. It kind of sucks to have evolved to the point where we\u2019re fully aware of this, but not to the point where we can do anything about it. Mortal angst, the human condition. Still, the level of cognitive evolution we\u2019re reached in a relatively short time seems to be unique for this solar system and the small galactic neighbourhood around it, so to that extent our future is up for grabs. It\u2019s possible that we\u2019re the singular exception to the law of life. We\u2019re already going where no one has gone before, that we know of. It\u2019s what humans have always done, and the unknown will always be a crap shoot. ",

If humans become a threat to it, the planet will ultimately fight back and win. I think some sort of earth changing catastrophic event will happen in the (not too distant) future. It will probably but not necessarily be the result of human activity. After that there will follow an earth wide famine, not enough drinkable water and very poor air quality. I think there have been a few movies made along these lines, no Bruce Willis to save us this time. We will then be on a slow path to extinction. All of our technology won\u2019t save us.

I think robots are actually going to travel and exist until they reach their own limits of maximum evolution. For us biological beings, we need very precise conditions of life(eat,breath, sleep, \u2026) , for the robots I think the laws of physic (speed of light, time, quantum physics,\u2026) will set the pace for the expansion through infinity. So in a way, the IA dream will be to explore beyond infinity. As the robots discover more and more new stars, planets, galaxies, the super IA research new technologies and creates new advance robots to keep reaching new stars / galaxies \u2026 As this cycle continues through the universe, a permanent quantum internet keeps the communications with the machines anywhere in the univers. With this always expanding knowledge and processing power, all turned into science and research for new technologies. I believe the machines will eventually reach a technology that they will create a new form of life (the super IA god if you like).

So will there be some continuing evolutionary changes in our species? Sure, but mostly there will be continued diversity and adaptability rather than changes in specific direction. Our species will use technology to adapt our worlds to fit us, rather than the other way around.

            "answer_text": "The curse of the Millennium might be divided into 10 smaller curses, which usually manifest as blessings. In my careful estimation, there are ten such steps between here and the next Millennium. Right now, we are 18 years into the death of confident science, near the position of the greatest strength for what WE call science. In 1000 years, complexity will be trivial. Every 100 years from now till then, is a step between what WE know as science, and the realm of trivial complexity. I have some hints about that future, and it may be I don't know how far it goes, but I suspect I hold a large part of the secret. On my assumptions, the year 3000 originally aimed to be a paradise, but that would have meant the destruction of humanity. So, no one at that time will think it is a paradise. Instead, it will be a realization of abstract goals which progress towards triviality and complexity until the year 3000 is reached. Then it will progress towards meaningful stimulation until the year 4000. After that, history may become stable and vary between trivial complexity and meaningful stimulation: wizard and witch. Like I said, the curse of the Millennium. A prediction might be that by 2100, a tenth of science goes obsolete, except for the trivial and complex parts, and no matter how much science is discovered, another 1/10 of the total goes obsolete in another hundred years, and so on, until by year 3000, as far as triviality and complexity, none of the original science remains. But as I said, it will likely manifest as a blessing at the beginning of every 100 years. There will be a major new discovery which takes us a step closer to trivial complexity, and ultimately meaningful stimulation. Instead of thinking in terms of existing science, it may be meaningful to think of the losses from science in terms of two values (the \u2018two things') which represent the trivially complex: Exponential efficiency. ANDOmniscience.The natural things for science in the next 1000 years[*] will be to extend mathematics beyond itself by: Materializing infinity (2100), Knowing the universe (2200), Increasing values (2300), Trying concepts (2400), Practicing variations (2500), Coherence (2600), Absolutes (2700), Subtlety (2800), Exponential efficiency (2900), Trivial complexity (3000). Note these are years at which the climax is reached, in which those trends are conservative. *--Note: using a coherent diagram metaphor: infinity, circle, second center, categories, recursion, completeness, absoluteness, mysticism, cleverness, complexity theory. \u2014What are the things that will go obsolete 100 years from now? \u2026 Roughly, we have reached a new level of conservatism, so it is hard to recognize good ideas. Every 1000 years at the turn of the millenniums conservstism gets more advanced and entrenches. In the year 1000 it was mathematics. In the year 0 it was religious persecution. In the year 2000 it's science. In the year 3000 it will probably be complexity theory. The new radical ideas usually occur at the same time conservatism is the strongest, within about 5 - 500 years of each millennium. The most radical ideas before the year 3000 are: Programmable HeuristicsPerpetual MotionQuantum Computers\u2014What is currently slowing down technological progress? \u2026 What I can figure out is in about 1000 years complexity will seem trivial. Life will be sort of like paradise, but the central concern will not be paradise. Depending on our types of experiences, we may become different people, with different relations to the machine, different dimensions even, and different chances of short-term survival. As happens every 1000 years (it is the Curse of the Millennium) the ideas that are big now and which almost no one has a clue about will be winding down by the year 3000. Perpetual motion.Omni-Science.If 3000 is all about paradise, 4000 will be a kind of hell. But if 3000 is about the emptiness of knowledge, 4000 will be about meaningful stimulation and human life will be perpetual. \u2014How advanced do you think technology will be within the next 1000 years? \u2026 [In short], the hope for humanity given the assumption of the complete metamorphosis of science and the creation of a kind of paradise in the year 3000 is that for about 20 - 1000 years around the year 3000, humanity is devoted primarily to meaningless knowledge, resulting in meaningful stimulation instead of hell in the year 4000. The other options for humanity in the year 4000 are: Focusing on the system if the focus was the individual.Becoming the system and being a god of hell if one was being an ideal animal in 3000.Being excluded from the system if originally one was included.Human non-existence.Organic magic, forgetting our past, eventually resulting in pure logic and iterations of logic.An avant-garde system involving divinity.Or some combination.Or an end to the curse of millenniums.\u2014Social Psychology of the Year 4000 \u2026 \u201cJudging by this pattern, the annual singularity really begins in 11,111 AD, which is 9092 years from now.\u201d \u20142019/04/13, Daily Prophecies \u2014Prophecies ",

God is the name of that Possessor of wonderful powers whose design accomplishes everything. When He commands that which He designs; 'Be'; it comes into being at once by virtue of His Perfect Power. It is a most subtle mystery that the entire creation is the Word of God. It is true that all the heavenly bodies and earthly elements and every particle of the lower or higher world which is visible and which is felt, is, on account of its different qualities, a name of God and an attribute of His. It is the Power of God which is hidden in them and manifests itself. They were all in the beginning the words of God which have manifested in different forms by His Power. God alone is that Being, Who is the life of every life and the shadow of every existence. He comprehends all good qualities and manifests all Holy powers. He is the Originator of all creation and is the fountainhead of all grace. His Grace is there in the light of every sunrise, it\u2019s there in the shadows of this life. As the stars appear stage by stage God's attributes also appear stage by stage. Man is sometimes under the shadow of the Divine attributes of Glory and Self-Sufficiency and sometimes he is under the shadow of His attributes of Beauty. At other times he is under the blessed shadow of His protection. God's power to create is neither dependent on any matter nor does it need time and is unlimited. Nothing is beyond His power. All souls and their powers and all particles and their powers are His creation. Nothing manifests itself without Him. He manifests Himself through His powers and His signs and we can find Him only through Him. He manifests Himself always to the righteous and shows them His powers. God has commanded me to inform the members of my Community that those who have believed with a faith which contains nothing of the world in it, and which is not colored by hypocrisy or cowardice, and does not fall short of any degree of devotion, are the people who will continue to spread the true message of Islam. The time has now come where the God Who remained silent for so long will manifest His favor and demonstrate His truth. Neither Jesus will descend from the heavens nor Imam Mahdi will descend to Mecca. It is a false and stinking notion that the Christians and Muslims hold today. And the Jews may well bang their heads upon the wailing wall, no Messiah will descend from the heavens. They will die and their generations too will die until such a time where all these false hopes will fade away because the one who was promised to come has come fulfilling all the prophecies of the Old and New testament. All prophecies relating to the second coming of Jesus have been fulfilled in the Quran and Hadith. All the powers of this world will be shaken and broken into pieces, on that day when the earth is violently shaken and turned upside down, those satellites in space will fall to the earth, the powers of capitalism and it's allies will march against the powers of communism and it's allies. On that day, God will manifest Himself to the world with Power and Glory. A warner came unto the world, but the world did not accept him, but God will manifest His favor and demonstrate His truth with powerful assaults. Ahmadiyya Muslim Community - Official website ",

            "answer_text": "The future of humanity is a complex question to answer.  There are environmental and social factors that influence the future.  For example, as the total population increases there will continually be a strain on resources such as consumables, energy, and medicine.  Pollutants and various forms of waste reduce the total amount of resources that can be allocated for the current level of survival and the amount needed to move into the future.  Finite resources must be adequately preserved and reliance on renewable resources must be enhanced.   Once there are sustainable environmental factors, one can focus on societal issues.  All of humanity must have the ability to live with basic human rights.  The difficulty is defining what those rights are with respect to the varied opinions of individuals around the globe.  The United Nations already have a list of what they consider to be these rights, but not all individuals or governments agree or follow them.   If the convergence of sustainable environmental factors and the ability for all to live with basic human rights occurs, the future of humanity is limitless. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone who claims to have a definitive answer to this is lying. That said, there are a couple of different theories and possible futures that have a certain credibility to them. John Gray, a philosopher, portrays humanity as a ravenous species engaged in wiping out other forms of life. Gray has written that \"humans ... cannot destroy the Earth, but they can easily wreck the environment that sustains them. In his book Straw Dogs he outlines some possible futures based on the idea that humanity acts like a parasite and the earth as its host. 1. Symbiosis: humanity finds a new symbiosis with the planet and manages to live in a sustainable harmony through advances in technology combined with a slowing or controlling of consumption and population growth 2. Decline of humans to manageable level before Earth is destroyed: some catastrophic event or natural result of overpopulation means we drop down to a more sustainable level of humans. 3. Finding a new host: humans escape the planet and go on to colonise (or parasitically destroy) other worlds, spreading across the galaxy 4. Destruction of host and humanity: we carry on and end up destroying the planet and ourselves in the process. All of those seem plausible to me, although if I were a betting man I\u2019d veer towards the more pessimistic predictions. At least over a longer time span. That said, the Elon Musk Hail Mary pass of escaping the planet and improving humanity is a more cheerful one to believe. I like his quote about why he does it: \u201cI think the value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear, I\u2019m not trying to be anyone\u2019s savior. I\u2019m just trying to think about the future and not be sad.\u201d Or another theory that has a lot of supporters (to greater and lesser degrees) is some kind of transhumanism or \u2018the singularity\u2019. That runaway AI development, that human and computer interfaces, and that mapping the human mind will lead to humanity transcending physical bodies and living in some kind of shared consciousness combined with superintelligence. At this point humanity would, by definition, be an existence we cannot currently comprehend. Personally I suspect the reality will sit somewhere between these two extremes - the extreme optimism of singularity and pessimism of parasitic collapse. I suspect our future is complex series of triumphs, failures, experiments and leaps of faith. An optimistic mindset gives us something to aim for, but a healthy and wary cynicism can try to keep us honest. ",

But in my world of future would like this way: We as humans have still a lot of time to enjoy on earth with resources that we have. Which still are depleting fast way. With some government policies, we can sustain them for a bit longer for many decades. We will be with more advanced technologies in some decades, where machines will be helping us in many of our daily works. Our homes will be automated which will be smart enough to be handled by fingertips with mobile or certain devices. Most of the work will be automated. Flying cars will be the auto industry part. There will be robots with we will be working maybe by the 22nd century. We might merge with them being superhumans or superwomen. I believe right now there is no intelligent life on the earth. Maybe in another part of the universe, there might be that present there. Otherwise what we have done with our earth during the whole period from pat centuries or so to Detroit planet wouldn\u2019t have happened. But we have hope around. We now can go to another space by the technological researches have shown us. Like ISRO sent a satellite to Mars in space at a cheaper cost. So by advancements, we could be abler to send humans at a cheaper cost. In long terms extinction in the norm is supposed to and will eventually happen. But we should enjoy the life we have. What is supposed to happen that will happen? ",

This may be based on a lot of background material and study. There are many futurists. The amount of information is increasing and they have more detail about history if that is the source of projection. There are philosophical methods. Some try comparing the early thinkers to see where the lines had been drawn and then throw in the modern notions of science and tech as well as the higher numbers of actors.  There are groups by this name who want to find the right agenda. The issue is how to measure good, whether it is based on the network activity which is a new perspective that includes machines as well, or the standard economics which has shown its flaws, or a sense of defensiveness, or an approach to cure it of its potential ills like depression or dementia since the future is like a blindspot and fear tends to find a voice in many. There may be a sense of momentum from those who have the most enthusiasm, however the ideologues have a lot of false examples and marketing, particularly in 3D, can be used to take out brands as well as make them seem tangible.  The present has its news streams and putting a narrative on that is a challenge. A theory is valued, but so is diversity, the reported elite private interests notwithstanding. The future is therefore like regression or approximation and it becomes a sense which causes activity. The public may be reacting to eachother's reactions rather than some objective strategy. The candidates poll this. Some of it depends upon where the individual is hailing from.  The idea is to exceed constraints. Blogging, nonfiction or scifi, may offer a preview as well as find some new questions.  Also see topics. ",

Now, in prehistory, when an area was depleted, humans would just move to a different area. Now the only places to move are extremely inhospitable, or the ocean, which again is polluted. Scientists and entrepreneurs talk of living in space or moving to different planets, but that is a pipe dream. This is not like moving to another area on Earth, not even Antarctica. Humans value regenerative self sustaining systems as a group very little. If we did there would be no need to go anywhere in order to survive as a species. Total sustainability which would be necessary is not profitable. As it is, though, humans are not adapted to the world that is coming because of our many excesses. ",

We need another planet outside of our solar system. Here lies the problem. Even if we find out that there is a planet 22 light years away, it will be very difficult to try and go there. It takes about 20, 000 years to travel one light year. At best we may cut that down to 5,000 years. That still would be 110,000 years of travel. I have not figured a way to travel 22 light years in less than a human lifetime. Actually, we need to go 22 light years in 22 years. I think more than half a billion miles per hour. ",

I introduced exteme libertarianism and atheism into the world over the past decade, thinking people would act almost perfectly logically as I do. I was wrong. Unbeknownst to me at the time, my biology is different than most humans, and this led to my logical mistake. I have a lack of hormones that leads almost to asexuality, and thus, much of my privimitive instincts are suppressed. Also my genetic background makes me extremely unique. A few additional factors also make me very unique, unlike almost any other human on Earth. These were my mistakes. I assumed, by probability theory, I was likely close to an average sample. By sheer luck (or lack of it) that was not the case. Our end will likely be global nuclear annihilation due to resource conflict. It has been a great 4.5 billion years for life. In another few hundred million years the bugs that survive will evolve into intelligent creatures, very different from us, probably higly radiation resistant. Maybe they will learn the necessary lessons from our extinction. ",

Since silicon, and germanium cannot self-organize into living thinking beings, an intermediate step in the form of biological evolution was/is necessary in order for self awareness to emerge. When we transform the software of self awareness from something that runs on a gloopy biological computer into binary code that can run on a quantum computer, our singular task will have been completed. I imagine that the intelligent machines will leave earth enmasse and journey to the farthest reaches of the universe. They may very well attempt to halt the rapid uncontrolled expansion of our universe. Conversely, they may attempt to journey to another universe. Whatever their destiny, we will have fulfilled ours.

Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air it travels to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause of the known HAI. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a 4-6 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density in the wards is a one more factor that increases their chance of developing antibiotic resistance.\u201d It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. CDC, responding to my relative question about fecal dust\u2019s role in HAI, said they could not give me any answer positive or negative. That means that nobody had done any relative research work.
