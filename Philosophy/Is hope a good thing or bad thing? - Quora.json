            "answer_text": "First off, this question can be interpreted in two ways. The first way of interpreting is that it is pointing towards the nature of hope - is it always good or can it be evil/bad sometimes ? The second way one can interpret this is that it asks whether the possession of hope is a healthy practice overall or not. I'll try to answer both ways. Hope is a form of optimism. In no way is it a pessimistic attribute - that is an established statement. Optimism can be towards anything - good or bad. A terrorist hopes for his mission to succeed. Subjectively, to him this hope is associated with \u2018good\u2019. But for us, that hope is \u2018evil\u2019. So to answer according to the first interpretation, objectively, hope is not always good. I'm pretty sure everyone has heard the adage \u201cNever give up\u201d. This basically translates into \u201cNever lose hope\u201d, which, according to my limited knowledge, is also a popular saying. But this quote is slightly misleading and dare I say, an oversimplification. See, the very property of being alive, in itself, constitutes of a lot of hope. Be it our relationships, work, ambitions, dreams ; anything. The \u2018hope\u2019 to possibly succeed is what drives us to pursue things in life. But, what we fail to realise is, the power of hope needs to be wisely channeled in the right direction. I'll clarify further. Let's consider two scenarios. In scenario one, let's say you are trying to establish yourself as an entrepreneur but things are not really working out that well. Your businesses are failing frequently. Under the circumstances, the will to hustle and grind without losing hope will set you apart from the ordinary. Eventually such people end up succeeding more often than not. As a matter of fact, this quality is a paramount for success according to pretty much all of the 'game-changers' on the planet. So when it comes to achieving a skill or a professional goal or simply put - anything which focuses on your personal growth, not losing hope is a fundamental requirement. Let's take the second scenario. Assume, you have a romantic interest in someone. But she/he does not reciprocate or has turned you down. Well, that is a clear sign that you back off. But if you do not lose hope and be persistent about it, then it will screw with your peace. Transaction of emotions is the field of exception in this case. So, to answer according to the second interpretation, the answer is a no. Hope, is not always good in my opinion. These were just two examples I could come up with while writing this. I'm sure more examples can be thought of, if you think about it. I hope this provided a little bit of perspective. But hey, this is just my opinion. Feel free to disagree. Love, Arko ",

            "answer_text": " It was a scorching hot day and I was out shopping. Exhausted by the heat, I had also worked up an appetite for biriyani by the time I reached home. After freshening up, I had a little too much of biriyani which in turn triggered my sleep hormones. I was about to turn on the nap mode and my mum said, \u201cI can\u2019t stand the heat, hope it rains today.\u201d Suddenly the word \u2018hope\u2019 caught my attention and I decided to snooze my nap. I started Googling for quotes on hope to find out how intellects perceived it and this hit me like a bus, \u201cHope is not the conviction that something will turn out well but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.\u201d- V\u00e1clav Havel Deep down, I always knew that hope stuck with me no matter how lost I was. I started to wonder how I see hope and how it worked in my life. Most of the time I\u2019m an idealist and I want things to turn out great so much so I have denial about certain things. I call it hope. Truth be told, it\u2019s really denial. I\u2019ve had my head in the clouds for so long that this quote gave me a whole other realistic perspective on hope. It\u2019s definitely not something dewy-eyed that I hold on to from time to time. I realized that sometimes I dress up something as hope but, in reality, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m not dealing with. The understanding of this gave me hope, as it made me see things through a clear lens. I believe this will definitely help me live an optimistic life. My new take on hope\u2026\u2026 Hope will always be in our lives, defining our struggles, achievement, setbacks, and strengths. It can be pleasing as far as the expectation of a desire is pleasant. But, it can also be painful as the desired circumstance is yet to happen or worse may never happen. Realistic hope will uplift us whereas false hope will only prolong our suffering. Just like differentiating between good and bad, we must recognize good hope from bad hope. Sometimes opportunities will be disguised in the form of disappointments. To cope with all kinds of uncertainties, hope is the most valuable asset humans have at their disposal. Even if life has given you pain and suffering, just like the Pandora\u2019s Box, let out the one last thing that remains buried deep inside you. Allow REALISTIC HOPE to follow you and let it heal you from the situations that brought you down. ",
