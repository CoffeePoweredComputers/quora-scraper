            "answer_text": "While I think the better suited responses may be around usage of weed and/or psychedelics in coordination with philosophy, I can provide a reflection on an experience I run into often. As you go about through your day and handle different tasks, it can be easy for your worldview to click into a specific model that works out for the most part. This worldview can include your relationships with other people (how much social credit is between you two, etc.) or how your endeavours function in general. As most worldviews tend to go, they fall apart at some point. Whether it\u2019s a promise that doesn\u2019t hold through or it\u2019s behaviour from somebody that you didn\u2019t anticipate. What usually occurs after that is you solving that particular instance and returning back to another worldview (it could be the same one however). My \u201ctranscendental experiences\u201d would have to be when I observe whatever worldview or model I have from a spectator\u2019s perspective while piecing things together sensibly. An example of this would be as I\u2019m engaging with people and holding my viewpoints about where I stand in relation to other people. After a few mishaps and poor predictions, I come to the point of observation where (I know this may sound rather native and adolescent but I\u2019d like to note that I\u2019m only 17) people really do things for their own benefit/agenda. Not to tie that to rational egoism or the such but, this consideration has impacted my later models/worldviews. So, in short, thinking in a higher perspective about my beliefs and perspectives in ways that impact my future ones. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition, transcendence isn\u2019t an experience. Here\u2019s how Maharishi Mahesh Yogi discussed the issue: The state of Being is one of pure consciousness, completely out of the \ufb01eld of relativity; there is no world of the senses or of objects, no trace of sensory activity, no trace of mental activity.There is no trinity of thinker, thinking process and thought; doer, process of doing and action; experiencer, process of experiencing and object of experience. The state of transcendental Unity of life, or pure consciousness, is completely free from all trace of duality. The state, sometimes called samadhi, is thought to emerge when the awareness-of activity in teh brain has temporarily shut down while still allowing long-distance communication between brain regions to continue. This allows the brain to rebalance itself without outside or intellectual interference. The aftermath of samadhi is sometimes called \u201cBliss\u201d but one cannot be aware of the state while you are in it. Maharishi liked to call the aftermath, \u201cthe feeling that mother is home\u201d \u2014 that all is right with the world. ",

Please Note, SGI or Soka Gakkai is NOT part of Nichiren Shoshu. SGI is a recognized CULT that was excommunicated in 1991. I can answer your question as a lay member. Our Priesthood has kept the Tenets, Practice and Doctrines pure for over 800 years. Yes would be answer. On numerous occasions. A form of astral travel. Our Nichiren Shoshu practice is the most powerful practice on planet Earth. Why? Because it is TRUE and Irrefutable. For example, I could tell you sit and eat the feces of Obama and you will be enlightened! You may say, \u201cNo, I believe eating the feces of Bernie Sanders will make me enlightened.\u201d The REALITY is neither will. ",
