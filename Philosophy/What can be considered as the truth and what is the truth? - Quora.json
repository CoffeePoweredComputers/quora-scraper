            "answer_text": "There are certain types of philosophy in the areas of idealism that indicate that nothing is true and that everything is an opinion. But my minor materialist tendencies always over-reach me when debating philosophy. There is no denial that gravity exists. Or that matter exists (unless you are a berkley idealist etc. In which case we can discuss). The problem is that even though we take these things into consideration the kant idealists like to argue that there is no way to tell if the world around us even exists. There are many different perspectives on the physical world and thus truth. But matter does exist. Atoms exist and the physical world exists. The physical world - the material world - directly corresponds with our emotions and thoughts. See, I love this area of philosophy. When it comes to truth, there are some undeniable things. Because gravity does exist. And this is proven through the material world and how we interact with it. As to what truth is? Something that is undeniable - something we all as a species experience and corresponds with - like gravity. We jump up and down making us feel certain sensations in our bodies - that feeling when you are landing back on the ground on your feet etc. But\u2026 These arguments are endless and you can bully yourselves over these questions. The important thing is that you are asking questions the other sheep in the herd haven\u2019t even encountered yet, so you are on the right path in terms of thinking on deeper levels. Well done. These questions, however, honestly have endless perspectives. In my opinion? There are some undeniable things, but I keep my mind open. ",

            "answer_text": "We can only wager. There are two kind of truth in the world. The universe and life as the ultimate truth, as they are. The second is the human truth what we seek in the world, is an illusion. There\u2019s no such thing we call it truth. The universe isn\u2019t linear, humans in order to understand the world they make it linear in their imagination. All the equations of physics are mostly linear, so there\u2019s no linear system in the universe, everything is nonlinear and nonlinear systems are very hard to grasp by us. It\u2019s hard for us to grasp the truth that the universe isn\u2019t linear, even that it goes in our daily life, we like our lives to be linear even if the reality teaches us another thing but we protest and we hurt ourselves we become anxious and angry. Life is unfair, it\u2019s not supposed to satisfy what you want to be fair with you. Life is a process, and that process has moments of pick and downs. Move with life, notice and live the truth about us is we never want to see things deeply from the inside and going to the depths of something. We contempt ourselves by watching the surface and making prejudices about it. Are we far away from knowing what is the truth? We say what is true is what is real? What is real isn\u2019t just what we know through our senses and ideas. We must dig deep to know what is real, for that we moved from believing in myths, religions, and philosophies to the physics to tell us what is real so we can know what is true, and physics is considered to tell us in every exploration and search what does the world look like? Does the study of nature satisfies us? Should we look for truth in nature? Why not considering the fact that myths and religions were also truths? Should we experience everything to know what is true? ",
