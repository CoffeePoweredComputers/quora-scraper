            "answer_text": "You have a sacred legal right to say almost anything you want in return if I offend you.   If I say to you, \"God is a jerk,\" you can tell me, \"You're the jerk, jerk!\" or \"You're gonna burn in all the hells so hard!\" or \"Suck my holy balls, infidel!\" or \"I hope you choke on that crack pipe you're so clearly smoking\" or \"You really really piss me off when you say that\" or \"Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?\" or \"I knew a guy like you once... But then I graduated from preschool.\"   You can hand out pamphlets explaining that Jason Coston is the worst person alive.  You can partner with my ex-wife when you run into her doing the same thing.  You can organize a World Theists Frazzle Jason Day.  (WTFJason! Day.) You can write me a 30-page letter explaining why I'm wrong.  Or a poem.  Or a song!  You can make it a really catchy song that becomes a huge radio hit and then I am remembered forever as the asshole who inspired that great song.  And then I have to hear the song in elevators and supermarkets for the rest of my life.  And watch my kids and grandkids and great-grandkids dance to it at a dozen weddings because it's so timelessly catchy. All of this is your sacred right and it's exactly what I fight to protect.  The only things you can't do are:  You can't hurt or take away my physical property (body, possessions, money) (Note, physical violence isn't ever speech... It's what creatures that don't have speech use, e.g. animals, toddlers, brutes, people living under dictators)You can't use speech to try to make people believe lies about me that destroy my career or social lifeYou can't use speech to try to get someone else to take away my physical property (ask someone to beat me up, say you'll pay $10,000 to whoever beats me up, lie to get me put in jail)It's a really good system.  I fight to protect it and I enjoy your freedom to use it, so please by all means respond when I offend you!  It's the only way we'll ever reach a real harmony.  Forcing people to stuff their real thoughts and feelings just creates a brittle skin of harmony over an endless sea of resentments and fears and suspicions and stifled dreams and abandoned inspirations.

            "answer_text": "Every citizen of the United States enjoys freedom of speech that is protected by our Constitution. That means that while you certainly have every right to speak your mind, anyone who disagrees with you has the right to voice their opinion as well. Just as you do not have the right to prevent others from speaking, neither does anyone else have any business telling you that you are not allowed to express your point of view.  Freedom of speech is just that: freedom of SPEECH. It is not the same as freedom of expression and it has no physical component. If you are unable to debate with someone who is voicing an opinion that is very different from or contrary to your own without resorting to physical means, then you are probably not the best person to refute what they are saying and it would be best if you simply removed yourself from the situation.  Being offended by anything is ultimately a choice made by the person who is offended. No one has the power to \"make\" you feel a certain way or to do anything. Our feelings, our actions, and our words are all things we choose. If you notice that you feel a certain way when you hear or see certain things, the best way to handle that is to look at yourself and to try to figure out what is going on with you that prompts you to feel offended (or happy or sad or whatever.) Blaming or attacking someome else because \"they offended you\" is the action of an unintelligent, emotionally unstable person. Another freedom protected in the Constitution is the freedom of religion. While you are free to practice whatever religion you choose, everyone else is also free to believe as they will. That means that sooner or later, you are going to run into someone who believes very differently than you do. You don't HAVE to be offended, and if you are offended it is your choice to feel that way. That other person has no more power to \"make\" you angry than you do to \"make\" them agree with you.  Grow up and take responsibilty for your own crap. If the god you have chosen is truly worth worshipping then that god does not need emotionally unintelligent followers angrily defending him/her/it to non-believers. Any god worthy of devotion can handle such things far better than you or any other mortal believer can. However, if you don't think the god you choose to believe in is capable of standing up to non-believers, then please by all means get your drawers all knotted up and jump on in anytime. Just let me fix some popcorn and a drink first, okay? ",
