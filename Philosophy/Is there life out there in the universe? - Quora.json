            "answer_text": "The chance that there is life elsewhere in the universe logically it extremely high. But as other other posters have noted, the universe is an incredibly big place. Most recent estimates on the size of observable universe put it at about 46 billion light years with upwards of 2 trillion galaxies. And that is the \u201cobservable universe.\u201d The actual universe may be up to five time bigger. The issues with evaluating the situation in very general terms are these: As of right now, we have only one example of life anywhere in the universe and that is here on earth;No other planet in our solar system has been proven to harbor life, though it still remains a possibility;Earth is a planet well positioned around its star, in a solar system with high metal content, plenty of water, and a large satellite that\u2019s protected it;We have already discovered thousands of extra solar planets, and at least a few dozen are earth-like in good solar locations, which extrapolated to the whole galaxy probably translates into several million planets at least;Life on earth developed relatively quickly after the formation of the planet, roughly 3.8 billion years ago, however it was microbial;It took over 3 billion years thereafter for multicellular life to evolve;It seems a reasonable hypothesis that on an earth-like planet the development of microbial life would not be extraordinarily rare which would suggest that in the Milky Way alone there are tens of thousands if not millions of planets harboring some form of primitive life;The development of multicellular life seems much more problematic, and it is not terribly improbable that earth is the only planet in the galaxy to have developed it;However, even if that is the case, and mulitcellular life develops only very rarely in a galaxy like the Milky Way, that would still suggest that in the whole universe, there are billions or trillions of planets with life, and some with intelligent life.Obviously these assumptions would change radically with the discover of even a very simple form of extra-terrestrial life on Mars, or a Jovian satellite. Another possibility would be finding long range indicia of life on an extra solar planet, which probably will become possible in the coming decades. If none of this turns up evidence of life, it certainly doesn\u2019t help the \u201clife in the universe case\u201d but hardly kills it. Since the universe is so big, and there are so many galaxies, there may well be trillions of planets out there with life of all kinds, but unless we find some in out own galaxy, we may never know for sure.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I believe that the limited thought process by which other people conclude that life can only exist on this planet is simply too Earth-centric. It is just as outmoded as the idea that the Sun revolves around the Earth. So, yes. I believe there is \u201clife\u201d out there. Whether humans will be able to recognise another life-form is up for debate. Personally, I believe that fire is a life form, particularly if you look at the example of a bush-fire. It will continue to reproduce itself (a-sexually) for as long as bush \u201cfood\u201d remains available, only dying out when the food supply has been exhausted. On that argument alone, I would like to see someone prove that fire is not a life-form\u2014consciousness, or traditional biology, has nothing to do with it. Given that we are still discovering new life forms on Earth\u2014in long cave tunnels in Central Australia a completely new form as been found, called a Nanobe, because it is too small to fit into the category of a Microbe. On Earth, we are still discovering insects, animals, plants, and bacteria. There is now a bacterium which consumes plastics\u2014we can\u2019t prove whether it has always existed, lying dormant, or if it\u2019s an evolutionary mutation. With billions of stars and galaxies of which we are aware, the potential for planets that support some form of life is too great for us to turn our backs on the idea, particularly if the Universe was created for the purpose of life. One tiny little planet in all that infinite space? I just don\u2019t buy it. ",
