Teachers often say, \u201cYou can do anything,\u201d so too do commencement speakers at graduation, but the reality is, most people have one or two talents or skills, and that is the best-case scenario. From this group, an even smaller percentage will be more talented than their competitors are, and distinguish themselves in any given field, and an even smaller group, an elite subgroup, will be able to profit from it and gain recognition from the wider world. Most people live ordinary lives that are difficult, boring, and resemble the fate of Sisyphus. For most people, saying, \u201cyou can do anything,\u201d typically just means you can do anything that\u2026anything at all\u2026involving low-skilled work at a low-skilled price.
