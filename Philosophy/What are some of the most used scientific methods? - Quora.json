            "answer_text": "It is a systematic method at determining \"the truth.\" There is an entire branch of philosophy, called epistemology, dedicated to figure out how we know what we know. In religion, for example, \"God\" or \"gods\" or \"the voices inside my head\" or \"the Book\" or \"the books\" are the sources of revelation.   In science, the standard method to arrive at a valid understanding is to propose an explanation based on what you know. This is called a hypothesis. You then test the hypothesis by doing experiments. These experiments can prove your hypothesis correct or incorrect, or just yield ambiguous results. If the results are ambiguous you do more experiments, but once you have determined whether your hypothesis was correct or not, you have advanced knowledge. You have either confirmed that your understanding that led to your original hypothesis is correct, or you have provided one piece of evidence to contradict the established understanding, thereby leading to better explanations and theories.   As an example: John Dalton's atomic theory stated that the atom was like a pudding, with things like protons floating in it (like fruit in a yogurt). Then Rutherford did his gold foil experiment, where he shot a stream of alpha particles at a very very thin layer of gold. Based on Dalton's theory at the time, Rutherford predict that most alpha particles would be deflected back, but in fact most of the particles went straight through. Since that observation was not consistent with Dalton's model, Rutherford then eventually worked to a different atomic model where most of the space in the atom is empty space. ",
