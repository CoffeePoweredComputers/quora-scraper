            "answer_text": "Yes and No. It is a very successful government for a long time. It failed badly in the end. For governing Italy and Rome it was very successful, but once Rome spread it began to break down. Part of the problem was that Roman Republic depended upon the Rich to lead and the poorer to support. Rome as it conquered came home with huge amounts of slaves. These slaves became agricultural workers on the huge estates of the wealthy. These size of estates were illegal under Roman law but since the Wealthy ran the Law courts, they pretty much just ignored it. The Legionnaire was a small farmer who could afford his own armour, sort of like the upper middle class. What happened when he came back from conquering Spain? His farm hadn\u2019t been looked after, after all he was out fighting, it probably was taken over by a Rich Roman family and now be run by slave labour. Even if it wasn\u2019t how could he compete? So basically the rich got Richer, the middle got squeezed out and the poor got poorer. Attempts to reform this kind of abuse bogged down in Partisan Political Fighting. Factionalism spread and became difficult to reach consensus and critical Political norms that were essential for Democracy under the Roman system were breached. Each step made it easier to break the next norm and pretty soon Rome really wasn\u2019t a Republic any longer, this happened long before the Republic officially fell. Below is link that gives a short answer. I think the major question should be how do we not fall into the same trap. Today\u2019s US political climate of extreme Democrat vs Republican does not seem much different to me. Where did consensus go? The Brothers Gracchi - How Republics Fall - Extra History - #1 ",

            "answer_text": "The Roman Republican government was an outstanding success over multiple centuries. The Roman Republic conquered most of what later became the Roman Empire. The Roman Republic provided the constitutional benefits of separation of powers, free elections, power limitation, checks and balances, multiple power sources, and provisions to prevent and discourage monarchy and dictatorship. The Roman Republic was a victim of its own success. It grew so large and conquered so much territory that a single city-state could no longer control or effectively govern and protect the vast stretches of the provinces. A limited number of people in Rome could no longer provide enough troops to hold and protect all of the conquered territory, and therefore additional soldiers had to be found and paid in order to hold the conquests. The Roman legions began to exercise political power through their generals. The legions demanded payment in land or money for their services. The Republic was assaulted when property owners were evicted without compensation and their land given to military veterans. Successful generals with veteran troops, including Sulla and Caesar, marched towards Rome and assumed dictatorial powers. ",
