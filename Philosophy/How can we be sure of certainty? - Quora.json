            "answer_text": "Short answer \u2014 If what you mean is, how one can be sure of something to be certain, I\u2019d say you can\u2019t always be sure of anything 100% of the time. But if what you mean is a kind of absolute certainty, then I will say you can\u2019t, and I will argue that one should not be obsessed with being absolutely certain about anything. Long answer \u2014 Certainty, just like another kind of notion of very strong modality such as perfection, only sounds good in writings. In practical sense, being certain of anything\u2014as much as to strive for perfection\u2014can be a very unproductive mindset that would often lead to disappointment in oneself or in the state of affairs. In one sense, certainty is one form of perfection\u2014it is the perfection of knowledge of something, sometimes to the point that no other possibility is allowed especially when what you\u2019re looking at is a case for absolute certainty. cer\u00b7tain\u00b7ty \u2014 \u02c8s\u0259rtnt\u0113/ nounfirm conviction that something is the case. \"she knew with absolute certainty that they were dead\" synonyms:\tconfidence, sureness, positiveness, conviction, certitude, assurance \"she knew with certainty that he was telling the truth\" antonyms:\tdoubt By that standard, it certainly will be very difficult to negotiate with any sort of conviction, idea or belief that resides in the area of an absolute certainty, that we might as well forget the idea to have an honest discussion to find a mutual agreement. This kind of phenomenon occurs mainly in religious discussion, where as the position of absolute certainty will always resides on the religious, out of dogmatic belief in their teachings, often without a shadow of doubt. While being certain in moderate amount is important to make decision in life, I will argue that it should not be relied upon as the main position for the majority of our lives. It\u2019s true that to make a decision and act upon it, some amount of certainty had to be there, else none of us would be able to be convinced to do anything. But as much goodness might come out of something, anything in moderation is better than excess of it. Cheers. ",

You can go from \u201cHomeless to Harvard\u201d From majoring in psychology, but taking computer science electives, creating Facebook and ending up being a millionaire. So as paradoxical as it may seem,  But then again, the best version of certainty we can have is having the belief in ourselves, in our potentials, trusting our intsincts and guts. So let them flow with passion and curiousity just because life is too short and uncertain! After all,was the lottery winner certain of his/her numbers? ",

We know that $<(\\Delta A)^2><(\\Delta B)^2>\\geqno\\dfrac{1}{4}||<[A,B]>||^2$, where A,B are operators and [A,B]=AB-BA. Also, <X> denotes the expectation value or rather the mean of X. And <$(\\Delta X)^2$> denotes the variance or the mean square deviation from the average value. This $<(\\Delta X)^2>$ is what we call uncertainty, the measure which tells us to what degree the values of X differ from the mean value. Now, what you know about u ",

And your perception is colored by your past experiences and judgments. Your perception will be different from mine because we have different experiential history. ",
