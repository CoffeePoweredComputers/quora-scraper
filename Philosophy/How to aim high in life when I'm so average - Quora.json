            "answer_text": "A short story might probably change your mind set. A story of Indian cricketing legend: Rahul Dravid.1996 January. Bengaluru. Conditioning camp of Indian cricket team. Azhar's team for ODI world cup will be announced later that day. Punjab opener Vikram Rathore was hopeful about getting a chance. After the team announcement, I went to Rathore's room at night to note his reactions. He was devastated for not making the cut. He made the following remarks: \"I can't imagine they left me out. How can they? How can I forget this pain?\" He later added, \"My roommate is peculiar, he had no reaction at all. No disappointment, nothing. (He) heard the team, said: 'Oh, I'm not in it' and went straight out with his kits.\" Fifteen years later, one night at a restaurant in Kolkata, Rahul Dravid  would explain his silent exit from that Bengaluru hotel : \"What could I have done? Cry loudly? Leave cricket? I quickly calculated (that) I'm getting four Ranji matches before team selection for the next England tour. (I) told myself not playing the world cup means you need four centuries in those four matches. (I) did that.\"  Some succeed because they are destined to. Some succeed because they are determined to. Never lose faith in yourself, always aim high in life. ",

            "answer_text": "Aim high because even you miss the moon ,you will land on the star . and  its free Moderation? It's mediocrity, fear, and confusion in disguise. It's the devil's dilemma. It's neither doing nor not doing. It's the wobbling compromise that makes no one happy. Moderation is for the bland, the apologetic, for the fence-sitters of the world afraid to take a stand. It's for those afraid to laugh or cry, for those afraid to live or die. Moderation...is lukewarm tea, the devil's own brew. There is no need to search; achievement leads to nowhere. It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life, just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, just be happy. You are already free! ",
