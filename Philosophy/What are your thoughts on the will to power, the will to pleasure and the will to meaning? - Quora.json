            "answer_text": "Well, it turns out we just can\u2019t avoid the human condition anymore, as most of our self-transcendent meaning making structures are rapidly crumbling (due to things like science, critical thinking and comparative mythology among others), for example, religion (the pope recently asked everyone to pray to make the devil depart in its current incarnation as pedophilia in the priesthood), gender roles, marriage and others. The early existentialists, especially Nietzsche, saw the spiritual holocaust coming\u2014knew the old values, morals and belief systems would not stand the test of time, and if something wasn\u2019t done, it just might be our fated nature to destroy ourselves. So Nietzsche came up with a solution: the overman, which is a way of being and moving through the world based in extreme rugged individualism\u2014a person able, via the will to power, to completely ignore preordained, prescribed or otherwise conditioned meaning constructions and authentically decide for him/herself how be and move. In a way, it\u2019s like he\u2019s battling his own conscience. Did he do something awful or pathological narcissism a core concept here (the rest of them simply said the solution was faith and surrender to a higher power). Freud and Jung are interesting comparisons. Freud completely focused his attention on the \u201ccreaturliness\u201d or animal side of people, while Jung did the opposite, deciding instead to focus on universal truths in the form of archetypes, myths, serendipity and many others\u2014the spiritual approach. This is why Freud base his ultimate motivation theory on the will to pleasure, especially perpetuating one\u2019s gene pool through the immortality project also know as children. Many despise Freud, and don\u2019t cut him slack for the time-period and culture he was brought up in. But everyone knows a massive amount of human choice and behavior is dedicated to getting one\u2019s pleasure needs met. And yet, also as creatures of imagination, symbolism and metaphor, historically he misses the boat. This was why he hated Jung. Jung was his very own genius perpetuating immortality project, in the form of his greatest pupil, whom Freud hoped would carry his legacy ever onward. But when Jung left the Freudian circle to create his own belief system, the betrayal was ultimate and unforgivable. Pretty much all existentialists include problems with meaninglessness in their writings. Yalom is the best. For writers like Frankyl, meaning could take any form (kids, any project lasting longer than one\u2019s lifetime), and Becker stated even money was symbolic of immortality (and why so many are still obsessed with it even though they have billions). So what do the three wills add up to?: A reason not to commit suicide. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that using the term Will to describe Freud's work, or Kierkegaard's will lead to misunderstanding, especially when we compare it to Nietzsche's concept of the Will.   For Freud, we have a desire for pleasure and the will only comes in to account when it needs to formulate a plan to attain the desire, in this way, will and ego and practical reason are united into a singular concept, but the desire/need for pleasure does not arise as Will, but from the Id.   For Kierkegaard, as well as for Frankel, humanity is possessed of an unavoidable need to grant meaning to the happenstance of life. If our Will is in charge of granting this meaning, then we arrive at meaning that works for our mind, but does not rise out of our heart. Instead of meaning that falls from the top down, we need meaning that arises from the heart to the head. The leap of faith is not something that one entirely wills, instead the will must will to no longer will in this domain.    For Nietzsche the Will becomes fundamental not only for all facets of human consciousness, but for all existence as well. The Will that we speak of as the part of human consciousness that makes decisions is but one small aspect of the Will-to-Power. Our organs have will, our cells have will, a rock too has will. And I may pick up this rock and throw it because the will of my spleen craves the expression of power, and my higher order conscious Will allows this desire to occur. But the Will that is the seat of consciousness is also determined by the Will of the four fundamental forces (gravity, weak, strong, etc.), by the struggle of atoms against each other, by the struggle of cells with and against each other, and by the struggle of individual against society. The Will continues to function beyond the individual, the rise of political parties is an instance of Will, the struggle of one party against another is an instance of Will, the war between two countries in which political parties struggle against each other, which are composed of individuals struggling together and against each other, who are composed of organs, cells, atoms, etc., all of this is the ever churning Will-to-Power.
