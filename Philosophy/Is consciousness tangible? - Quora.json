            "answer_text": "Some verses in the Bhagavad Gita As It Is about consciousness (life, spirit soul, self): \u201cThe soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can he be burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.\u201d \u201cThis individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.\u201d \u201cIt is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable, immutable, and unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.\u201d \u201cAs the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Tangible means (both adjective and noun) perceptible by touch, so no\u2026. But wait, a secondary definition is \u2018clear and definite; real\u2019 so now it seems obviou that the answer is yes, assuming you accept Descartes\u2019 conclusion that we think therefore we are. How atoms (quarks, etc) become what we claim as our consciousnesses\u2019 remains a big mystery though. ",
