I kept repeating that to myself till I saw me as a third person. In other words, I was able to generate a certain level of consciousness that made me have an out of body experience. It\u2019s very hard to explain but it was scary\u2026 I had these experiences ages 6 through 14, may be longer, but it was never possible to \u2018hold on to the moment\u2019. Like I said, it was frightening to be there. As I grew older, it became more and more difficult to replicate those moments and one day they became a distant memory. I could no longer get into that space of time\u2026 Now, I am by no means a lunatic or a day-dreamer; I have never done drugs or had any kind of hallucinations. I have a very functional brain that allows me a certain level of intelligence that I am proud of. Overtime, I have also learnt to question God or anything that logic cannot explain. The one question that still remains with me is, \u2018who am I?\u2019. What were those moments I experienced as a child. What is the \u2018sense of being\u2019, this consciousness, and \u2018what is the ultimate purpose of life?\u2019. Why are we here\u2026 ",

(Granted my feeling on this will probably change in time) but one thing I have been questioning is- Do I have any living biological (half-)siblings? Having the answer to this, even a simple yes or no, would tell me a lot. Been thinking about what if my biological family could take care of me, what would life be like? Different, but still. Yes would mean my bio-parents are stable. No could mean my b-parents never decided to have another kid (happens)\u2026 I've just been very curious lately. It would just be cool to know\u2026 idk.  \u201cIf you could have the answer to one question, what would it be?\u201d ",
