            "answer_text": "What is the interesting thing in my life, to ME? It's finding such a great tennis partner at age 70, from such a crazy venue as \"Craigslist\". The way to a woman's heart as told by Forester in the movie \"Finding Forester\" is \"an unexpected gift, at an unexpected time\". To me finding a competitive tennis partner at my age is to me, an unexpected gift, and at an unexpected time advertising for a partner on Craigslist is also a gift, in my mind. Our games are fantastic and they are 3 days each week, now going on 18 months of playing. We show up just for tennis at 6:10 a.m., play for an hour, talk about our points and strategy, and then have some wonderful \"chit-chat\" about many different topics on our walk back to our homes. I go back to my life and he goes back to his, which includes a wife who is happy he's found a tennis partner. I am not \"competition\" for their relationship, and she understands this. We live just 5 minutes apart and his home is on my way to my home. In my younger days, I was never able to find such an equal and competitive partner. This morning we gave up at a score of 9 to 9 playing only one set in one hour of play. It can't get more equal than that, and these are games involving a lot of deuces. This may not be interesting to anyone else, but it is to me, in my life. For others of you advancing in years, age does not have to be a reason for not playing at an activity or sport you have a passion for. Just play at your level, and enjoy the journey. Experience an unexpected gift in life, at an unexpected time. That is what loving your life is all about. Find ways to feed your passion for living. This is my way of feeding my passion for life and is the interesting thing (to me) in my life. ",

            "answer_text": "Start a relationship with Nature\u2026! Add a touch of live greens to your denizen.This will transform your life.I know you must be wondering that do my words actually make sense\u2026! Yes , they do, let me tell you how I live with them. I did not have any professional knowledge on planting so I started with aqua plants.I am an art enthusiast too, so I painted few bottles with multicolor fashion and dipped in them money plants.A plant that is so easy to get anywhere, it has a symbolic influence of drawing money in home.Also my kitchnen window sill got a beautiful green aesthetic touch..!!!  When I had moved to my current flat, there were a number of unused pots left outside. I took them inside and started planting in them.Tulsi and Banana were the first among the ones I planted.Tulsi has both medicinal, ayurvedic and spiritual grace along with the banana plant worshiped as Lord Vishnu. Then came the turn of making my room air fresh. The best fit was aloevera plant . On a trip to Marina beach, I had gathered few shells, they landed straight into the aloevera plant, to give a mystic look . It not only did make the room look beautiful but also purified air.  I also planted few money plants in pots. But they took indefinite time to shoot buds.I used to water them daily, all leaves dessicated but stem remained green . It was long journey of patience. One day when I was watering without hope , a tiny shoot was coming out. Well I was so much happy to see my efforts bloom like the shoot..! Now you understand, spending time with nature is not a futile attempt of spending hours\u2026it is a brilliant investment to let shoots of happiness, prosperity and health bloom in our life\u2026..!!!!
