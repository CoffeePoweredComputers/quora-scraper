            "answer_text": "Well when I hear that word I think of the military. Here's why: My husband just retired with 24 years in from the Navy. Every year an evaluation was conducted on each sailor and it was extremely frustrating for my husband because he had to type up an evaluation on anywhere between 50 to 150 sailors ( depending on where he was stationed, ship or shore command) that he was responsible for. He had to do his every day job while at work and then he would bring the reports home to work on. So, that is what I think of when I hear the word \u201cEvaluation\u201d. ",
