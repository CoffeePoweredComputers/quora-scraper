            "answer_text": "Well structured and logic thinking when in depth - has always been a way to search out truth in regard to the human being and what surrounds us. Therefor is philosophy the mother of science - and science as we know it today came in fact from philosophy and the epistemology within it, and the metaphysics. Does this lead to wisdom and truth? NO - truth is the Lord in regard to all existences in the Universe. These are facts in life that you will find if and when you truly search - with an open mind - for the Truth. Is then structured and logic thinking in depth - wisdom? Is the thought based \u201cwisdom\u201d from the hindus or buddists philosophies - wisdom? Or even truth? Now, to be able and capable of judgements within this field you need to understand these matters first. You need to understand who God is in fact. And who God is not. What then comes from God - and what does in fact NOT come from God. Wisdom is considered (on the basis of the thoughts of Aristotle) to be a mixture of the theoretical knowledge (sophia) and the practical (phronesis) \u2026(Kant made the same distinction and deepened the thoughts in regard). And where the human being has integrated these parts into one solid ground/foundation within him/her self. So wisdom would then stand for: a capacity to have a sound judgment and conduct and at the same time a deep understanding of theoretical knowledge of the highest kind. But\u2026 real deep wisdom is something quite different in fact - even if and when a person has acquired the latter in the above mentioned manner- and (also) it is the \u201cfear of God\u201d. NOW, fear does not really mean the lexical definition of the word - but to be able and capable to understand the role we - being humans- have, and the Role of God in all that exists. Thereby act and think, accordingly. In all matters. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition, philo sophia is the love of wisdom. The prescribed method of doing this is to first study mathematics to learn logic, then to study the natural sciences to learn the laws of nature before studying philosophy. This is the path that took. I finished am stars in engineering before starting to study philosophy. Armed with logic, reason and the natural laws you are ready to start questioning, and uncovering rhetoric with the Socratic method. Pealing back the illogical rhetoric is what reveals wisdom. The first this I questioned as a philopsher was the current two-factor model for human behavior and disease. From a pure mathematical viewpoint, the statistics from all the identical twin studies ever done are not represented by two independent factor, but five are required to represent the statistics! The results are published in my paper entitled: Behavior Model Definition With this investigation, I discovered a particular behavior of modern science and the desperate need for philosophy. That is, when science is confronted with a result that they cannot explain, they often ignore the data. In my project Torn Between Two Worlds, I discuss other areas where science is failing because they are not willing to question and discover the wisdom that could result. The founders of science were also philosophers and the wisdom shines through today with theories that survived 2,500+ years. To put it dramatically, once can imagine a scholar of the young School of Athens paying a holiday visit to Abdera (with due caution to keep it secret from his Master), and on being received by the wise, far-travelled and world-famous old gentleman Democritus, asking him questions on the atoms, the shape of the earth, on moral conduct, God and the immortality of the soul \u2013 without being repudiated on any of these points. Can you easily imagine such a motley conversation between a teacher and his student in our days?[i] Erwin Schrodinger [i] Schr\u00f6dinger, Erwin. \"Return to Antiquity.\" Nature and the Greeks, by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, ..Cambridge: U, 1954.
