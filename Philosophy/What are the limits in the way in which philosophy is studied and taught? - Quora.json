            "answer_text": "\u201cPhilosophy\u201d means love of wisdom. Wisdom isn\u2019t knowledge. Knowledge can be passed down, but wisdom must be in each case discovered. To quote that English has \u201ccreated the word \u2018loneliness\u2019 to express the pain of being alone, and the word \u2018solitude\u2019 to express the glory of being alone\u201d sounds clich\u00e9 unless the listener has already found that to be true. In that sense philosophy cannot be taught. It is a personal, creative process. Socratic dialogue is a joint exploration of reality, a collaborative search for wisdom. Some schools attempt to recreate this with varying degrees of success. The actual process would require challenging every assumption held by the participants, questioning every belief, including our self-image. This is an extremely anxiety-provoking experience that teachers generally don\u2019t have the skill or the insurance to facilitate. Doing so would require actual wisdom, an ability to lay our ego aside and face reality without blinking. Remember that, as the story goes, Socrates was killed for it. In a dishonest society, nothing is more unforgivable than speaking truth. What is commonly taught is the history of philosophy and philosophical topics/arguments. The former is very useful for understanding the development of the Western cosmology, view of human nature, religion, and politics. The latter is a guide for young philosophers, giving us ancient \u201cpearls of wisdom\u201d to assist our own exploration. Some are profound; some are total bullshit. Western philosophy is somewhat at odds with the Eastern pursuit of wisdom. Broadly speaking, the West pursued wisdom through the exercise of reason while the East did so through introspective experience. Reason can produce no ultimate truths (except proving the existence of the thinker) but Western philosophy persisted in the search, sometimes at the cost of losing touch with direct experiential reality. Philosophy programs that do not promote cross-cultural philosophy are inherently limited. These are just some thoughts. I\u2019d be happy to get comments and other ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "The aim of any given branch of study is usually realized when it finds practical application in real world. A professional course on medicine can be considered successful if a doctor cures patient\u2019s illness through his medication. A degree in law achieves its purpose when a lawyer wins a case. Similarly, impact of most of the subjects taught in a typical class room environment can be assessed pragmatically. But that\u2019s not the case with philosophy because, it\u2019s not not a subject with limited / specific scope. This makes it difficult (nearly impossible) to pragmatically quantify its impact on real world. I think it\u2019s this disengagement between theoretical and practical facets of philosophy that has restricted its appeal to a large extent. As a result, the subject itself seems dry and lacking in substance when it\u2019s dealt with in a conventional way. ",
