            "answer_text": "Dao and De are the subject matter of the famous Dao De Jing, whose author is known by the name of Laozi. The Dao part starts like this: \u9053\u53ef\u9053\u975e\u5e38\u9053; The very first sign is the character for dao. Remark how it pops up again 2 more times further down. A quite literal translation would thus be: \u2018the dao that can (\u53ef) be dao-ed is not (\u975e) the permanent (\u5e38) dao\u2019 whereby the 2d \u2018dao\u2019 denotes a verb usually translated as to say, to utter . We now have: the dao (Dao?) that can be expressed is not the permanent dao. (another version: the Dao that can be trodden is not the during, permanent Dao - \u2018dao\u2019 = \u2018way\u2019) So the text itself starts by stating the paradox. It then continues in parallel: The name that can be named is not the real name. And goes on: As nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth /Named, it is the Mother of the 10,000 things. Notice how the paradox is continued - any further elaboration of meaning and purport is now a question of interpretation. As to the paradox of giving a name to something that fundamentally has no name or cannot have one: if there\u2019s no name at all for it, it cannot even be named. The paradox needs to be stated in order to live it. The expression of the unexpressable needs to be expressed\u2026 The received text dates from around the 6d century BC. No doubt there\u2019s a religious / mystical component to it. Greetings! ",

            "answer_text": "If the Dao has no name, then how can it be called the Dao? It seems that this question is closely related to the translation/interpretation of chapter twenty-five of the Tao Te Ching. The original sentence of chapter twenty-five related to the question is \u201c \u543e\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u540d\uff0c\u5b57\u4e4b\u66f0\u9053\uff0c\u5f37\u70ba\u540d\u4e4b\u66f0\u5927\u3002\u201d And according to the author of the book \u201cTao Te Ching: The New English Version That Makes Good Sense\u201d, this sentence can be translated and explained as: I do not know its name, just call it the Tao. And reluctantly I name it as the Great. \u201c\u2019the Great\u2019 in this context means not only greatness, but also the ultimate ancestor of everyone (\u2018the mother of all things\u2019). Lao Tzu \u2018reluctantly\u2019 named it as the Great because he understood quite well that he should not give a name to the Tao, the ultimate ancestor of everyone. In ancient times and even today, it is normal for parent to give names to their children, but not vice versa. Obviously, giving the ancestor a name is not considered as a respectful act to the ancestor, although it is technically doable. With such consideration, nobody, regardless how old he or she is, should give the Tao a name. And the Tao has never given itself a name. Thus, Lao Tzu said that I do not know its name. But he could not teach the Tao without mention of its name. Thus, he said that anyway, he just call it the Tao and reluctantly named it as the Great. Though, giving the Tao a name is disrespectful to it, but naming it the Great (which can mean the ultimate ancestor) itself proves that his true intention is to express respect and praise to it, which makes the naming action become acceptable or excusable.\u201d In other words, since no one is older than the Dao, the Dao had not name before the ancient sage started calling it the Dao (or the Tao). Therefore, although \u201c the Dao (or the Tao)\u201d can be considered as a name, but it is not a \u201cformal name\u201d that is usually given and called by parent to their child or by people to a thing. This is not because it\u2019s technically undoable, but because we should not do that or we are disrespectful to it (by treating it as our child or a thing). In ancient China, the character \u201c\u540d\u201d and \u201c\u5b57\u201d had different meanings in terms of naming and calling someone\u2019s name. \u201c\u540d\u201d as a verb means naming and calling children by their parent (we can consider such a name as a \u201cbirth name\u201d. And since the Dao was never born, thus it has no such a name); while \u201c\u5b57\u201d as verb means giving a \u201cpublic name\u201d to someone after becoming an adult so that others (regardless of their ages) can use such a name to call her or him. Therefore, \u201cthe Dao (or the Tao)\u201d can be considered as a name that it is known and called by everyone (the public). That is why Lao Tzu said that I do not know its name, just call it the Tao, And reluctantly I name it as the Great. This could be the true reason that although the Dao has no name (as its \u201cbirth name\u201d), we still can call it the Dao (as its \u201cpublic name\u201d). Or we can say that the Dao has no name (as its \u201cbirth name\u201d); the Dao has a name \u201cthe Dao\u201d (as its \u201cpublic name\u201d). Thus, question is answered and there is no any paradox here. But on second thought, this question may also be somehow related to the translation/interpretation of chapter one of the Tao Te Ching. The original sentence of chapter one related to this question is \u201c \u9053\u53ef\u9053\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u9053\uff1b\u540d\u53ef\u540d\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u540d\u3002\u201d For the explanation regarding to this sentence, please see my answer to the following question: Tiger's answer to What is the meaning of \"The way that can be named is not the way\" in Tao philosophy?

Lucky for you you're in the right place and time to hear it. We know now from quantum mechanics that existence is calculable. It's called the probability function. Moreover, Born showed that the probability function is not a function of a hidden variable but rather that existence is made of probability. This affords us the opportunity to name that which is responsible for probability/existence as Possibility. If we compare Possibility to Tao all the pieces fit. Tao Moves. Possibility has unlimited freedom. Tao is comprised of opposites yin/yang and Possibility is both nothing (yin) and something (yang). While it used to be hard to convince yourself that \"I am Tao\" and thereby gain enlightenment, it's extremely easy to accept that \"I am Possibility\" and be enlightened, not just spiritually but scientifically. How cool is that? ",

            "answer_text": "Language is by its very nature limiting and confining of thought. If you wonder about this, learn a few different languages, and you will quickly discover that certain ideas or concepts are more easily expressed in one, may have to be slightly altered to work in another one, and may not easily be expressed at all in another. When one starts to talk about the ineffable, the infinite, and ultimate reality, this intrinsic quality of language becomes truly limiting. One of the key concepts of Taoism \u2014 and the parables of Christ, even \u2014 is that ultimate Truth is something that can be described as the blind men describing an elephant, with each man not being wrong, but only expressing truth in part, so that ultimate Truth is better yet pointed to. To take another example, St. Thomas Aquinas spent decades writing his Summa Theologica, but in the end also came to understand this particular truth. Hence, when the writer of the Tao Te Ching (\u9053\u5fb7\u7d93) was attempting to describe the Dao, the only recourse was to say in essence that if the reader thinks that by calling the true Dao the \u201cDao\u201d they have then comprehended it, the reader is entirely mistaken. Language can only at best circumscribe in general terms, but not encompass completely. And anyone who believes the latter is quite mistaken and has NOT apprehended the true nature of the Dao. ",

About three months later I returned to this book with a flash of insight.

I continued this exercise right through to the end of the book. Everywhere I overwrote Tao with Wisdom. Then I closed the book and did the same to the title, which now became: The Wisdom of Inner Peace. In some weird way, I felt that I had made this book my own. This, then, became my \u201centry\u201d into eastern philosophy. * * * * * Generally, words and names cannot be important.
