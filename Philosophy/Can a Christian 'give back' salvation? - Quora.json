            "answer_text": "You cannot give back your salvation. Romans 8:38\u201339 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.Once you repent and believe in Jesus Christ as your savior, that\u2019s it. The love of God will never leave you. Salvation will always be yours whether you later try to reject it or not. So what happens to a saved person that later rejects God and his or her own salvation? 1 Corinthians 3:12\u201315 Anyone who builds on that foundation may use a variety of materials\u2014gold, silver, jewels, wood, hay, or straw. But on the judgment day, fire will reveal what kind of work each builder has done. The fire will show if a person\u2019s work has any value. If the work survives, that builder will receive a reward. But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The builder will be saved, but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames.For me, I had MUCH rather be that terrible builder that losses sight of his salvation and screws up rather than be that person who never had the love of God that is in Jesus Christ our Lord.

            "answer_text": "If I understand it correctly the question is whether a Christian can stop being a Christian and give back his salvation. If a Christian feels like \u201cgiving back\u201d his salvation, he or she never had it in the first place. The Christian would be ignoring the sacrifice and divinity of Jesus, which would be evidence that the Spirit of Jesus aka the Holy Spirit never resided in that person. Therefore this person was never born again and was only a \u201cChristian\u201d by title. 1 John 2:18\u201319 - many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us, because if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But they went out from us to demonstrate that all of them do not belong to us. ",

            "answer_text": "Can a Christian \"give back\" salvation? No, once you are born again spiritually, you cannot be unborn. Just like when you are physically born, you cannot get unborn. Once Jesus saves you, it\u2019s a done deal. Jesus doesn\u2019t do things halfway. The thing I think you should understand is, your not going to be saved going in it with a less than a sincere attitude. God knows your heart better than you do and you cannot fool him. He searches the heart and when he sees that you fully trust him and come to the realization that you are in dire need of a savior because we are all sinners in the flesh, He saves you and nothing can take you from him.

It would be an eternal home with bearable ups and down. where do you want to go after giving back salvation. The whole world of heavens can be your home if you attain salvation and never miss the loved ones. It might include dedicating one hour of boring worship in church or immensely interesting one day with God and his ability to preach with an incredibly interesting parables and stories. God worked for six days and rested on seventh day so I believe even angels have a work life, learning about the followers and protecting them. ",

It\u2019s not a bad thing to walk away from salvation but I\u2019m not sure you can give it back. I guess it depends on how you view the nature of salvation. ",
