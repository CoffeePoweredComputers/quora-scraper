            "answer_text": "Nature is not conscious. It is deterministic. Events happen according to rules that are measurable and predictable in as far as we understand them. We use mathematics to measure observable phenomena which obey the laws of physics, chemistry, ecology, economics etc. Human beings have bodies that obey these same laws. They feel hunger, heat and fall to the ground when they step off high buildings.  However, instead of acting on instinct alone like the other animals, human beings are able to choose to make moral judgements that are right or wrong depending on their chosen set of rules. The reason they adhere to these rules is called their values. Together, they form belief. This is the mark of consciousness.    This set of rules is normally followed because human beings have the belief or knowledge that they are created for a purpose, that their creator would like them to obey His or their rules, and that human behaviour has consequences beyond the life of their physical bodies. No other animal, plant or object has been shown to behave in a manner that suggests such belief. In my view, nature does not have consciousness. It is completely amoral. There is no good or evil, right or wrong in nature. It is what it is. There is no Matrix. There is no Tree of Souls. No Force there is. ",

            "answer_text": "Since we can ask the question \"Is nature conscious?\" we are logically bound to either say that we are unnatural visitors in an unconscious nature, or that we are natural and nature is at least partly conscious. It should be noted that consciousness is the faculty which allows there to be a difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, so that in the absence of consciousness, nature could not be defined as unconscious. There would be no definition at all to nature unless we smuggle in our own conscious expectations about nature and consciousness, and the biases which we inherit from our sense organs in defining what we think nature is in the first place. If we look at the fundamental nature of nature, we find elemental forces and concepts such as symmetry, position, frame of reference, level of description, etc, but it is unclear that such concepts could even exist theoretically in the absence of some ongoing experience in which patterns are recognized and interpreted directly. On this level, there appears to be no scientific reason to deny that consciousness of some kind is what we observe, particularly since the observation is being made from such a great distance in scale and unfamiliarity. Just as an alien astronomer looking at our cities from space could derive probabilistic mechanisms governing their traffic patterns and growth, so too could our telescopic and microscopic observations mask the characteristics that might lead us to conclude a deeper sense of meaning and proto-subjectivity.
