            "answer_text": "Does every valid argument have a true conclusion? No. In deductive reasoning, an argument is valid if its conclusion is the inevitable logic outcome of step-by-step valid inference from its premise. Each inference is the necessary and unavoidable deduction from what comes before. If the premise is true, then valid argument means the conclusion must be true. With logic as with computer code, though, we have a \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d situation. If the premise is false, then our logical deductions from it no matter how valid they are may produce a false conclusion. The truth of a valid argument is only assured if the premise is true. The term for a valid argument from a premise that happens to be true is sound. True premise + valid argument = true conclusion. SOUND ARGUMENT. False premise + valid argument = ? conclusion. Valid argument, but the falsity of the premise means we can no longer be sure about the conclusion. True premise + invalid argument = ? conclusion. It goes without saying that a true conclusion is true regardless of how you got there. It\u2019s just not true by reason of your argument, if your argument is invalid or your premise(s) false. It may be only coincidentally true.  By contrast with deductive reasoning, where the conclusion is the necessary outcome that must be true if the premise is true and the argument valid, we have inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning allows generalities, and seeks to establish what is probable. Arguments are \u201cstrong\u201d (or \u201cweak\u201d) rather than \u201cvalid\u201d (or \u201cinvalid\u201d). If the premise of a strong inductive argument is true than the result is a cogent argument. If one or more premises are false, it is uncogent. \u201cValid\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d simply say that if the premises are true, the conclusion logically follows. \u201cSound\u201d (deductive) and \u201ccogent\u201d (inductive) say that a valid or strong argument has true premises.
