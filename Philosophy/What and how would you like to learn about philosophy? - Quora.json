            "answer_text": "I'd love to see a Philosophy Wiki (PhiloWiki), written by one or more reputable authors, that would be an abbreviated version of Philosophy on Wikipedia.  It would have links to relevant pages on Wikipedia for when you wanted a more detailed discussion of a particular subject. PhiloWiki would be written by succinct, eloquent, and clear thinking philosophers.  It would list and have the pages for each of the Big Questions and each of the Famous Philosophers. It would also have an author's page with his/her biographical information and his/her overall philosophy.Each page entry for each question would state the question, the author's clarification of the question, and his/her succinct answer.  It would be followed by the author's summary of each of the famous philosopher's answer to the question.Each page entry for each famous philosopher would state each of the questions that the philosopher made important contributions to, and the author's summary of the philosopher's answer to the question.Remember, that at any point there would be links to the full Wikipedia page for the issue or philosopher under discussion.",
