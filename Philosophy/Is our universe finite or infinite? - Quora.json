            "answer_text": "Once, even I was stuck with the same doubt. Is our universe finite or infinite? So I did this thought experiment and came to an answer. I\u2019d like to share my thought experiment with you. It goes like, \u201cImagine if I\u2019d paint this earth with a pitch black color without leaving any bright spot. Then I\u2019d introduce the led\u2019s into the blank canvas of the Earth representing stars. And now, if I somehow manage to diminish your size to the size scale of an ant, no matter how hard you\u2019d try move to any farther distances it\u2019ll always seem all alike. You wouldn\u2019t be able to locate the center of the earth and it will seem like you\u2019re stuck up in an infinite space which holds you down due to its gravity\u201d. Same is the case with the universe. Whilst mentioning the size we also have to consider the frame of reference you\u2019re considering. If we\u2019re considering ourselves then definitely size of the universe may seem infinite. Even a thing which is 1 mile away from you is at an infinite distance from you. Now, you may say that 1 mile isn\u2019t infinite! but that one mile distance has been mapped to represent it to you. After adding up to small distances differentials we are able to count 1 mile. It represents infinity because that distance is currently unreachable by you. But on a larger scale sure its an finite distance. So as I would conclude that infinite or finite the size of universe depends upon our perception and frame of reference. Got more questions? Feel free to ask! : ) ",

            "answer_text": "Quick answer, without resort to intellectual gymnastics or abstruse philosphy, no. Something that is finite cannot also be infinite. However\u2026 What are you defining as \u201cthe universe\u201d. The matter that comprises the universe, or the space containing it? I used to wonder if, even though there may be a finite number of galaxies and other forms of matter, how far did space extend and, if there were an end to it, what lay beyond that end? Another form of space, maybe a hyperspace? And if that had a finite boundary, what lay outside that? Ultraspace? This form of wondering is another manifestation of the Law of Infinite Regression; e.g if God made the universe then who made God, and who made the god that made god and so forth. Using this, it is, I suppose, possible to conceive of a condition in which a universe has boundaries, but the number of those boundaries are infinite. This goes some way to reconciling the finite and the infinite. There are a few other ideas which reconcile the infinite and the finite. Prime numbers Euclid established, through an elegant mathematical proof, that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/euclids.html However the primes are a punctuated series; a number has to satisfy certain requirements to qualify as a prime; in other words it has limits. As the set \u201cprimes\u201d is a smaller subset of the set \u201cnumbers\u201d (the larger set being truly infinite) it could be argued that the prime number set is both finite and infinite since it forms an ever expanding, but inclusive set of a larger, ever expanding set. Toroidal space I don\u2019t know how much traction this idea has, or who came up with it, but at one time it was hypothesised that spacetime might be toroidal. Under this paradigm, an object could move an apparent infinite distance for an infinite period of time within a doughnut shaped space-time continuum without ever encountering a boundary and, if the time taken to traverse the toroidal spacetime continuum were sufficiently long, returning to the point of origin would meet with conditions sufficiently changed as to constitute an entirely fresh set of conditions. The analogy this brings to mind is the goldfish circumnavigating its bowl, its three-second memory presenting it with fresh new vistas with every lap\u2026 ",
