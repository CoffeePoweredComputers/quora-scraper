            "answer_text": "That\u00b4s so nice question!! The two most common types of matter present in the atmosphere are gaseous nitrogen and oxygen. These particles are most effective in scattering the higher frequency and shorter wavelength portions of the visible light spectrum. This scattering process involves the absorption of a light wave by an atom followed by reemission of a light wave in a variety of directions. The amount of multidirectional scattering that occurs is dependent upon the frequency of the light. ... So as white light.. from the sun passes through our atmosphere, the high frequencies become scattered by atmospheric particles while the lower frequencies are most likely to pass through the atmosphere without a significant alteration in their direction. This scattering of the higher frequencies of light illuminates the skies with light on the BIV end of the visible spectrum. Compared to blue light, violet light is most easily scattered by atmospheric particles. However, our eyes are more sensitive to light with blue frequencies. Thus, we view the skies as being blue in color. the light that is not scattered is able to pass through our atmosphere and reach our eyes in a rather non-interrupted path. The lower frequencies of sunlight (ROY) tend to reach our eyes as we sight directly at the sun during midday. While sunlight consists of the entire range of frequencies of visible light, not all frequencies are equally intense. In fact, sunlight tends to be most rich with yellow light frequencies. For these reasons, the sun appears yellow during midday due to the direct passage of dominant amounts of yellow frequencies through our atmosphere and to our eyes. The appearance of the sun changes with the time of day. While it may be yellow during midday, it is often found to gradually turn color as it approaches sunset. This can be explained by light scattering. As the sun approaches the horizon line, sunlight must traverse a greater distance through our atmosphere; this is demonstrated in the diagram below. As the path that sunlight takes through our atmosphere increases in length, ROYGBIV encounters more and more atmospheric particles. This results in the scattering of greater and greater amounts of yellow light. During sunset hours, the light passing through our atmosphere to our eyes tends to be most concentrated with red and orange frequencies of light. For this reason, the sunsets have a reddish-orange hue. The effect of a red sunset becomes more pronounced if the atmosphere contains more and more particles. So you might be thinking, \"Olga , you half-insane ceiling fan, everybody knows that the night sky is black!\" Well, you're only half right. The night sky isn't black. The link above explains the science of it, but if that's not good enough, try to remember back to a time when you might have been out in the countryside. No bright city lights, just the night sky and trees. Now when you look at the horizon, can you see the trees? Yes, they're black silhouettes against the night sky. But how could you see black against black? The night sky isn't black. It's green thanks to airglow (or, if you're near a city, orange thanks to light pollution). Note well: What we perceive as color is bit of a tricky subject. This is a different question, one that has been asked and answered multiple times at this site. Per the typical human eye response, sunlight at the top of the atmosphere is about as \"white\" as \"white\" can be. Some of that incoming sunlight is reflected back into space, some is absorbed by the atmosphere, and some is scattered by the atmosphere. There are two main kinds of scattering: Rayleigh scattering, which selective scatters high frequency light (violet and blue) much more than low frequency light (red), and Mie scattering, which scatters light more or less evenly across the spectrum. Rayleigh scattering is a clear sky phenomenon. Mie scattering results when small droplets of water are suspended in the air (e.g., clouds). The sky is blue at noon on a clear day because of Rayleigh scattering. The atmosphere selectively refracts the violet/blue end of the spectrum. After undergoing a large number of such refractions, some of that refracted light comes down to the ground. The result: A blue sky. Note that we would see a white Sun against a black background if this refraction did not occur. This is what astronauts and cosmonauts see in space. At sunrise and sunset, the violet, blue, and green parts of the incoming sunlight are almost gone. The result: We see a quite reddish sun. We still see a predominantly blue sky even at sunrise and sunset. It's only at the horizon where we see a reddish colored sky. Rayleigh scattering does affect red light as well, just not as strongly. That red colored sky is partly a result of Rayleigh scattering. The high wavelength light has been scattered away. The red light, to a much lesser extent. The reddish sunlight that makes it through hundreds of kilometers of sunrise/sunset sky is eventually scattered as well, so we see that reddish light as a reddish sky. A slightly cloudy makes for even better sunrises and sunsets because now Mie scattering can occur as well. Mie scattering can spread that incoming reddish sunlight across a good portion of the horizon sky. With regard to green, you can see a greenish sky at sunrise/sunset. There oftentimes is a narrow band between the blue sky away from the horizon and the red sky at the horizon where the sky appears greenish. The above is a clear sky phenomenon, and it's only a narrow band of the sky that appears green. An infrequent event can occur where the entire sky appears green. This is called a green thunderstorm. This happens when a thunderstorm occurs at just the right time of day, with just the right height of clouds, and just the right lighting. This can make the entire sky rather than just a thin band appear to be grayish green, and sometimes very green. So, you see - the sky isn\u00b4t blue, isn\u00b4t always blue at all! ",

            "answer_text": "I have seen skies of snow white, dove grey, and blackest pitch. Sometimes the clouds appear to be silver, at other times cotton white. In the middle of North America, thunderstorms turn the sky a deep shade of what appears to be backlit aquamarine-tinted grey. I\u2019ve seen the sky cycle through various hues of pink, orange, red and purple, from the softest tints to the most eye-searing shades. At times the sky is the softest baby blue, azure, cerulean, cobalt, periwinkle or midnight blue. I\u2019ve seen rainbows, sundogs, and northern lights - turning the sky shimmering yellow, green and lavender. In the arctic circle and close to the equator, there are places where so many stars are visible that it looks like the atmosphere is made of pure diamond. I\u2019ve even seen the sky turn chocolate brown; when forest fires fill the sky with smoke lit by the glow of a burning hillside. So I guess I\u2019d have to say no, as I can\u2019t think of any colour I haven\u2019t seen in the sky. It is already every colour I can imagine. ",
