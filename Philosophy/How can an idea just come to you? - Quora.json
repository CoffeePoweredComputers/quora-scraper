An idea can come to you at any point, you could be procrastinating or working and think 'this would make this better' Ideas are formed daily yet not many are acted upon, even the thought of changing something small in your routine is an idea, people have a misconception that an idea is a money making miracle that forms in the mind when in actuality it is mundane and happens constantly, sometimes a idea may be huge but usually the idea was there the whole time just waiting for you to correct the dots with your already well founded knowledge.

While googling for a product or service that is obvious to you but apparently not anyone else. Our best while using someone's flawed product or service saying to yourself I could do better. But that's only 1% of the issue. The other 200% is executing on that idea. ",
