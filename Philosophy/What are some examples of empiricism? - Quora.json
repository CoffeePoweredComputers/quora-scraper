            "answer_text": "Empiricism is often contrasted with rationalism, a rival school which holds that knowledge is based primarily on logic and intuition, or innate ideas that we can understand through contemplation, not observation. Example Rationalists hold that you don\u2019t have to make any observations to know that 1+1=2; any person who understands the concepts of \u201cone\u201d and \u201caddition\u201d can work it out for themselves. Empiricists argue the opposite: that we can only understand 1+1=2 because we\u2019ve seen it in actionthroughout our lives. As children, empiricists say, we learn by observing adults, and that\u2019s how we gain abstract knowledge about things like math and logic. Of course, ideally, knowledge consists of both observation and logic; you don\u2019t have to choose between the two. It\u2019s more a matter of which one you emphasize. There is a combined philosophy, called constructivism, which represents one way to get the best of both worlds. Constructivists, like empiricists, argue that knowledge is based, first and foremost, on observing the world around us. But we can\u2019t understand what we see unless we fit it into some broader rational structure, so reason also plays an essential role. Constructivism is a high-profile idea in the philosophy of education, and many teachers use it to design their lessons: the idea is to present information in an order that builds on previous information, so that over time students \u201cconstruct\u201d a picture of the subject at hand, and at each step they are able to \u201cplace\u201d the new information in the context of old information.

            "answer_text": "I can only speak about the philosophical end of this, so I\u2019ll give you what I know there. Empiricism is the school of thought that tells us everything we know comes from \u201cSense Experience.\u201d Basically, everything you know and believe comes from what you physically experience. If you know that concrete is hard, it\u2019s only because you fell on a concrete floor once and realized this. If you know that your father is kind, it\u2019s because he\u2019s done kind things in the past and your sense experience tells you that this is true. Basically, they applied this principle to life. You only know what you\u2019ve experienced, anything you have not personally experienced is mere conjecture and not to be trusted. This movement was contrasted by Rationalism, who had their hero in Decartes. He believed that he could know things by logic. In Rationalism, if you meet 10 fathers who are kind you might be able to assume that most if not all fathers are kind. Empiricism would not make this assumption. You would have to meet every father to know from sense experience that they were, in fact, kind. ",
