            "answer_text": "No. The practice of law has pretty much nothing to do with political science unless you\u2019re a lobbyist, and very few lawyers are lobbyists. Based solely on your name\u2014I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not in the U.S. If you are in the U.S. you need to be advised that in the U.S. law is a really bad field to go into. The field has been massively overloaded for generations and continues to get worse. This link has links to some of my other answers that go into details: Joseph Reinckens's answer to Will a second bachelors degree make a difference as to whether I get accepted to law school even if that degree will raise my GPA?

            "answer_text": "Political Science is a broad area. I took several classes taught under the rubric of political science: Constitutional Law, Constitutional History, International Law (which required reading case law and the Law Of The Sea treaty) that were of great help. I didn\u2019t major in it though. Major in what interests you and be sure to take some classes that require a lot of reading and others that require a lot of writing. ",
