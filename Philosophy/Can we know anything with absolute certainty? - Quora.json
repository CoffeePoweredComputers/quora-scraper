            "answer_text": "I would say yes. Pretend a man goes about his day claiming that nothing can be known with absolute certainty. He could suppose that the world around him is fake, and that perhaps the conversation he is having to imagine these things is fake. One could continue to go on in the fog of disbelief that being the idea that nothing can be know. I would ask whether the statement that \"nothing can be known with absolute certainty\" is itself a true statement. If it is, then is a self defeating statement since inherent within the statement is a claim to absolute certainty\". So being in a position of absolute denial doesn't seem to work. But this is only part of it. Descartes once pointed out that a man can go on to doubt anything but would find that it is impossible to doubt that the he has doubt, and that the act itself is being carried out since doubt presupposes a mind. If at least a mind exists according to Descartes then would can be logically certain of that. He then goes to deduce from this line of thinking all other sorts of things. Descartes found himself in a day well this sort of radical skepticism prevailed in some parts of the world and sought to logically reason against that. ",
