            "answer_text": "To be powerful is to render someone or something powerless. So that the one full of power makes the other devoid of power. Rate is Speed, speed is frequency of logical presence tending to 1 from 1 of one Potential Reality. So that speed is the frequency of change in logical presence state of a potential reality from 1 sensible presence to 1 sensible presence. So that Therefore Rate is frequency of zero change in logical presence state with a change in frequency of being. therefore the only thing that is changed in the rate of doing work powerfully is the sound and not the work So that soeed is a measure of noise made in place. So that speed from here to there changes names but the work to there remains the same. so that the powerful are the ones full of noise without substance thus without change in potential presence state. Work is the potential difference between 1 and 1 higher than the first one. So that work is a net gain in potential. While Potential is force. So that Power is the lack of work and the increase in noise while making others do the work and taking credit for it because the noise of the powerful is louder than that of the powerless who are doing work. Power then is s degree of fear of doing work. Power then is a degree of cowardice. Since power can be measured in the fear of work we can say power is the fear of eork. We can then say power is fear. So that the one who wants or gas power is a coward who fears reality if reality is a change of potential into potentiality. Potentiality = Wisdom therefore the powerful are the less wise. To then make everyone agree with you is then to make everyone as less wise as you who disregards the truth that the other sees do everyone falsely claims they see your truth when no one us in you but you to see it as you. Power is gaslighting the truth in others so only your truth is true. Power is cowardice. Example, Slave traders and owners are cowards who boast rendering others powerless. So that to have power is to have slaves. Because slavery is an abomination to have power is an abomination and if your God has power then your God is an abomination because that is the logical pattern of power. Call it by its name! True power is to empower, true leadership is to follow because wisdom counts back to the one calling the many to be as one. ",

            "answer_text": "There are people who have something like this power, in that they can convince nearly anyone of whatever they want (as long as it doesn\u2019t clash too much with what the person already believes, or is willing to believe). From reading about his rallies, I suspect that Hitler had this sort of persuasive power. I\u2019ve read stories about people who were extremely opposed to Hitler who came out of one of his rallies thinking he was a great guy. Only later, did they come to their senses, and realize they had been fooled. I suspect that some famous evangelists also shared this ability. I\u2019ve only really met one person who had this ability. He was also very creative and ambitious and had started a vibrant high tech company (~120 employees). Unfortunately, this ability rather spoils a young man. This guy didn\u2019t consider getting married, as he could convince too many women to sleep with him anytime he wanted. (He was famous for being able to \u2018pick up\u2019 a stewardess anytime he took an airline flight, for example.) I was reminded of the character in the movie \u201cThe Shadow\u201d who could \u201ccloud men\u2019s minds.\u201d I met him when he was pushing 50, however, and I believe that he was beginning to realize that he was missing out on an important part of life. Also, this ability fooled him into thinking that he could handle anything. Unfortunately, only 10 days after I met him, he died in an airplane \u201caccident\u201d. Accident is in scare quotes, since it was entirely preventable \u2014 he tried to fly through a gap in a squall line, which closed on him (as such gaps are apt to do) and destroyed his plane.  I\u2019m sure some people could handle an ability like this and make something of it. The guy I met had come close. It would ruin most people, however. ",

These topics are so superficial and fact-oriented that they are strikingly uninteresting, such as \u201cthe ocean is deep in places\u201d or \u201cthe cloudless daytime sky is blue.\u201d You can\u2019t argue with that. No, to have a thought that\u2019s worth having, you have to think about things that somebody else sees differently, and you will disagree. You may be able to win over a few people with a good argument, but in general, people are intransigent and will always look for a way to confirm what they already believe rather than screw up their worldview with new information.
