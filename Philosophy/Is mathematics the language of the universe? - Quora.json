            "answer_text": "As Galileo said, the laws of nature are written in the language of mathematics, and Richard Feynman always believed that everyone better learns calculus because it is the language God talks. Mathematics is the most fundamental tool in the modern world. You may not realize it, but without mathematics, we wouldn\u2019t have a radio, television, microwave ovens. We wouldn\u2019t have been able to put astronauts on the moon, unravel the human genome, and we wouldn\u2019t have an ultrasound for expectant mothers or GPS for lost travelers. Mathematics was the best tool to explain scientific mysteries. For instance, if you take a magnet and sprinkle some iron filings on a paper around the magnet and then shake it, you will see that those iron fillings will move and make a perfect pattern around the magnet. This pattern tells us that there is an invisible field of force around the magnet, the magnetic field, and these iron filings visualize the pattern of force. In the 1800s was a significant era of discovering the laws of how magnets and electricity work and how they\u2019re interrelated. Michael Faraday was an excellent physicist and tried to understand the physics behind those magnetic patterns. Although Faraday had some exciting ideas of the magnetic field, he wasn\u2019t able to explain it mathematically. Then, Scottish physicist Maxwell decided to improve Faraday\u2019s work and figured out that calculus was the perfect tool to describe electric and magnetic fields. Maxwell encoded all the known facts about electric and magnetic fields into mathematical equations. In other words, he had done a translation from physics into the language of mathematics. Then he did more with math and manipulated his equations. Thus he was transforming the equations from one form into another form that\u2019s logically mathematically equivalent. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to see, but all he wanted to reveal the scientific mysteries of magnetic fields and patterns, and he did it. That was one of the greatest aha moments in human history. First Faraday, then Maxwell was learning the language that the universe is speaking. That was calculus as a language and system of reasoning. Within a few years, Tesla used those equations to make the first radio systems and to do the wireless transmission of energy. Then Marconi sent messages across the Atlantic Ocean. Eventually, people started having telegraphs, radios, televisions, and of course, wireless. I am not saying that math made of all those things. Mathematics was the essential apparatus to enter the modern era. That\u2019s why Feynman wanted all humans to learn math. He knew that all the discoveries and inventions have been telling us something about the universe. Mathematics is not a simple language, and it\u2019s a language that something profound. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine a clear blue sky as the backdrop to a lush green field and within this field grows a rickety old apple tree. Sat under the tree\u2019s cool shade are two young people, perhaps lovers, or maybe just friends, or perhaps they were simply adversaries resting after an exhausting scuffle. This part of the story we will never know for it does not concern us and can be left to the reader\u2019s imagination. One says to the other, how many apples do you reckon are are lying here on the ground? The other glances around for a while and says, I don\u2019t know, perhaps 30. With that, up gets the first and starts to count them and, when finished, sits back down and says, 35. Upon hearing that, the other gets up and also proceeds to count them, but more determinedly and taking care not to miss any, and eventually returns to the shade with a count, sits down and says, 36, you missed one. So the first gets up again and repeats the count, only this time equally determined to be careful not to miss any. When this count is done, the first sits down again and says, yes, 36. Then holding up an apple, says, I think it was this one I missed, and look, it\u2019s so richly red and shiny, and almost perfectly round. The other looks and says, well not quite, yes it\u2019s shiny, and red too, but it\u2019s only somewhat round, I wouldn't say it\u2019s almost perfectly round. Of course you wouldn't, says the first, in a well worn tone, and with that takes a bite, of the apple, not the other. \u201cmmm that's a seriously juicy red apple, so delicious\u201d and then hands it to the other. The second one takes a bite and says, yuck, red apple, I hate red apples\u2026 It seem these two people don't like to agree with each other, if it can possibly be avoided. They do agree however, that there are 36 apples, because they counted them carefully. And if we the reader, were to join them in the scene and also count the apples carefully, we would also agree with 36, although we may discover one of the apples to be half eaten, well, perhaps not half, but somewhat eaten. We would also agree that if we have 36 apples and chose to distribute them to a group of people such that each person received two apples, then we would have enough apples for precisely 18 people. Or if there were only 12 people and we wanted to distribute them equally between those, each person would receive precisely three. On these, there is no dispute. We might speak a different language, for an English person\u2019s Three, a French person may say Trois, but the notion of 3 as a numerical quantity is universal, unambiguous and agreeable. 36 apples divided equally among 12 people gives each person 3 apples. We could choose to represent only the numerical aspects of this as: [math]36 \\div 12 = 3[/math] Had we arrived late to the scene, to find each of the group holding three apples, and we wanted to know how many apples we started with in total, we could reverse the process and ask each of the 12 people to return their apples and then count how many apples we had, and from this we would learn: [math]12 \\times 3 = 36[/math] And there was no good reason for writing 12 first and then 3, it would be equally agreeable to write: [math]3 \\times 12 = 36[/math] And by accident we have now stumbled upon the distributive law: [math]a \\times b = b \\times a[/math] Further, we soon realise that nothing in these expressions of the relationship of numbers requires either people or apples. We could equally have been referring to goats and grapes, although we may have encountered some difficulties in getting the goats to return the grapes. In other words, numbers don't need things in order to be agreeable, they can be agreeable amongst themselves. This is simply another way of expressing the universality of numbers and the relationship between them. If we so choose, we can think of maths as a study in the various ways that numbers can be agreeable. During this study, some people discover relationships that seem so universally agreeable, they give them special names called theorems and demonstrate their universality with proofs. So that\u2019s a bit about maths, but what about language. I could have opened this story with: The sky was as if from a wavelength of 474-476 nm in the electromagnetic spectrum, desaturated by the mixing of further wavelengths in the range 380 to 740nm, where the number of wavelengths in this range could be considered almost infinite were they not limited by the Planck length of 1.616255\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2075m. The grass was reflecting wavelengths in the 495-570 nm range without any significantly noticeable interference from the neighbouring wavelengths. Approximately 70 meters from a west perimetal boundary and approximately 30 meters from a southerly one, grew a fruit bearing tree, some English cultivar of the Genus Malus. The fruit was an eating variety of apple with low acidity and reflected a small range of wavelengths clustered around 650nm in the electromagnetic spectrum. But if I had done that, and continued in a similar vein, what are the chances that you would have continued to read all the way down to this point in the story? Languages have purpose. In the language of story, the purpose is to build a kind of movie or virtual world in the mind of the reader, and to keep the reader engaged until some expected or unexpected conclusion. This is done by describing unfamiliar events using familiar notions and metaphor and, most importantly, by introducing seemingly extraneous details that will serve as clues to occupy the reader\u2019s mind in speculation, to feed the desire for a conclusion. In the language of story, we seek to be informed gradually and indirectly, in a manner where the journey is at least as important as any information conveyed, and often more-so. But in the language of math, we seek to identify and remove extraneous detail, to find the shortest path route for the underlying explanations of the things we observe to be true. Our observations take place in our universe, and as maths, supported by science, informs our understanding of these observations, it is often thought of by some as the language of the universe. In 1623, Galileo di Galilei expressed: [The universe] cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Which is often expressed in quote form as: \"Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe.\" ",
