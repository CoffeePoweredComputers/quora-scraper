            "answer_text": "Yes, evil comes from ignorance; conversely good comes from true knowledge. When you have an untruthful view (which is similar to ignorance) about yourself such as \u2018I am this body,\u2019 it is a LIMITED VIEW. In limited view, it is likely that one would feel\u2014\u2018life is limited, often short-lived and I would accumulate to the maximum I can before the time is due,\u2019 which means self-importance. Scriptures depict how people grew self-important at some point in history using symbols such as Eve, Cain, Sita, \u2026. etc. Eve felt very strongly about her desire to eat the fruit of a forbidden tree even if the consequence is death-penalty. Cain murdered his own brother when he reaped success, thus became symbol of people who are intolerant of others success. Sita too felt very strongly about her desire to possess a golden deer even though her husband said such a thing cannot be real; and she went ahead in spite of objection from her husband\u2019s brother whom she even accused of bad motive. In self-importance, one feels everything strongly. If his desire is not fulfilled, he feels anger; if his desires are fulfilled, then he feels greed and attachment. THUS LIMITED VIEW IS THE BREEDING GROUND FOR VICES such as anger, greed and attachment which further reinforces one\u2019s ego; and cycle of vices continues. That means becoming great (brah) mind (ma) is the answer. It is obvious that there is always something preceding to something which means there cannot be a beginning for anything. Only an eternally existing universe can answer the question of why the universe exists rather than not. If universe had beginning in some past it presents the possibility that the universe need not have existed. If there is beginning, it means before the universe\u2019s so-called beginning, there was nothing, it means that nothingness is possible. If nothingness was possible, such state of affairs would only continue forever, with a universe not coming into being. God\u2019s only role would be to \u201crecreate the provisions for life\u2019s sustenance and enjoyment whenever they are depleted/destroyed by human greed. So is the case with micro universe called your body. Soul is the king over the bodily kingdom, and it changes this costume called body whenever it is no longer found useful. Hence it can have no beginning, and no end. This is UNLIMITED VIEW. In this unlimited view, there is no basis for anyone to feel self-important, but one easily feels his part is too small to measure. In such instrument-mentality, if one\u2019s desire is not fulfilled, he feels no anger (but joy remains); if his desires are fulfilled, then he feels no greed and no attachment (but peace and love remain). And his eyes are civilized viewing everyone as his brother and sister. Thus UNLIMITED VIEW IS THE BREEDING GROUND FOR VIRTUES; and balance rules his life when he goes through all types of dualities. This is what spirituality means. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s certainly isn\u2019t a virtue, despite what the movie Birdman\u2019s alternative title (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) would have us believe. There are worse evils in my estimation. And I don\u2019t mean the likes of Mao, Stalin, or Hitler (just a handful of the most evil humans I could think of for the sake of example) - it\u2019s a much more insidious evil - it\u2019s when good people are aware of the evil being perpetrated, but choose to remain silent. Who choose to do nothing, and just allow it to happen. Ignorance is by no means the ideal state of being, and can give rise to many undesirable character traits and behaviours. Racism, bigotry, and any form of prejudice are chief among them. That\u2019s a form of evil born out of ignorance. But as history has taught us, you can educate someone out of that mindset, the potential for redemption exists. Ultimately, we are ALL ignorant; I\u2019ve yet to meet a human being that \u201cknows everything\u201d. And therein lies the distinction: Ignorance, in and of itself, isn\u2019t necessarily evil. WILLFUL ignorance, on the other hand, is a whole other kettle of fish, and it\u2019s that willful ignorance that has given rise to some of history\u2019s worst atrocities. Hanlon\u2019s Razor: \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\" Thanks for the A2A, Marcus! ",
