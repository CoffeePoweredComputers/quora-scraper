            "answer_text": "The short answer: Not really. This question can be tackled in both philosophical and psychological manners. Every person has grown up differently and have their own beliefs that subject them into building values throughout their life. This upbringing builds certain authorities within their personality that make them feel that Religion, Nationality, Roots, Family and so on are things worth dying for. Although, this view is to that person, and that person only. Someone who feels that it is worth dying for someone they love is their own opinion on how they have built that relationship with that person. But we all know of stories of people killing family members, giving up children, and so on. Same goes for nationality and religion. Your country and faith is not someone else's. it would be your view and your view only to feel that you can and will die for your people, your nation and your \"god\". Philosophically, nothing is worth dying for. Anything can be changed and dying is not the final solution if you are conscious about the problem and the bigger picture, as \"dying\" or throwing away your life for one belief takes you out of the picture and defeats the objective of wanting to fix something, as you are not there to perceive the final outcome. If you're after a stimulating of a question to ask yourself:  Some people spend their entire life trying to get something done, like a political or environmental cause, and they die at old age of natural causes without achieving their cause and objective. Yes sure, you should always \"keep trying!!\" But if you take this entire journey of spending all your life, which ends with death and not achieving the objective, does that mean you have died for nothing? Especially knowing that you are not there to see how things turned out after you. Is your name mentioned for trying? Has it made any difference at all? is this something that you can name as \"something worth dying for\"? The final thought is your values. If something feels \"right\" for you at the moment of choice, whether conscious or instinctive, you will do it whether you want to or not. It is the value that you have built around that choice, and that is yours and yours alone. Would love your comments on this. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has  to draw lines in the sand. Some evils must be fought: I am not someone who says the fight must be with guns, but you must be prepared to die for some causes. Your principles define you. If you have no principles worth dying for then you have nothing to live for. I hate fascism and it's trappings. Broadly I will always fight anyone who says one person is better than another, that one race is superior to another and that some people should have more rights. Again, this does not mean physically fighting: but at least I will tell them they are wrong and tear down posters. I will add myself to the numbers.  I think basic freedoms are worth fighting for----no one can tell me where I can live or who I could be friends with and by extension this means no one has the right to say that to anyone.People could tell me I couldn't do it. but I still would and face the consequencies. I do have a problem with unelected voices. They have no authority. I was bought up with the fantasy of the \"Flashing Blade\"---it is quite a stirring song  There are some things that are just wrong. Slavery. Religious Intolerance. Oppression. Racism.  I know I would oppose these: would I have the courage of my convictions if asked to make the final charge. I hope so. ",
