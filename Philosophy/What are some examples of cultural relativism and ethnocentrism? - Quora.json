            "answer_text": "There is no worldwide and time-irrelevant amount of nudity that triggers feelings of impropriety. In some Muslim countries now the sight of a woman\u2019s ankle is thought to be provocative to straight men; in the Christian West this also used to be the case. In other places like German parks complete nudity is not even worthy of comment. Each member of a given society thinks their attitude is objective somehow when it is in fact relative to where they live and were raised, and fear or hatred or condemnation of the other locations\u2019 attitudes is ethnocentric, not object, either.
