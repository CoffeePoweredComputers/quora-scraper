            "answer_text": "I remember one day in my business ethics class I was asked to come up with a personal mantra. A philosophy of life that worked for me. One to set my focus on and see through much like a lens to see the world. Thinking it was a waste of time I worked on other studies and let the hour go to waste. Near the end of class the professor asked if a few brave soles would like to come up and share their life verse, mantra or philosophy of life. Only 3 dared to come up. I remember very clearly that I felt I was in the mists of something great when I heard them share why they saw the world more clearly through their lens. Each was different and special, not less or greater. I only remember feeling like I missed out by not joining in the conversation. later that day I started working on my lens and I thought I had it all nailed down. I had chosen each word carefully. I put effort into the rhythm and depth of each word. Then later that night, I presented my thoughts to a close friend of mine expecting to change the world in which we both lived in. After sharing my sole, my friend sat on my couch with a hand to the side of is face with his pointer finger raised while he took in my words. With his eye\u2019s closed, he pondered every word. Their meaning, their placement, and then he spoke. \u201cDarren, I have a new lens for you: May everything you do, be because you are loved and not an attempt to be loved\u201d. I would of fell over if i wasn\u2019t already seated. He knew me deeply. He knew me at my core, and although my lens was good it wasn\u2019t good enough. Deep within me I realized that if I could hold this lens to be true I\u2019d see life in a more deep and meaningful way. I\u2019ve carried this with me for the past 15 years and it still holds true for me. It\u2019s my personal philosophy. What\u2019s yours? ",

            "answer_text": "A personal philosophy requires one hugely significant ingredient: self-awareness. One cannot develop a \u201cpersonal\u201d philosophy without becoming truly intimate with one\u2019s \u201cself\u201d. I could argue that a personal philosophy develops in order to mitigate excesses that one perceives in themselves. Understanding whether a certain behavior or activity is sustainable for the course of one\u2019s life is paramount to developing a maintainable version of a \u201cphilosophy\u201d. However, that does not mean that the self-awareness isn\u2019t tainted by a warped perception. This causes personal philosophies to be \u201csustainable\u201d specifically for the perception rather than for reality. In a sense, one should be critical about whether their self-evaluations are capable of bringing a personal philosophy that makes one live a better life rather than a life that fulfills a personal perception.

            "answer_text": "On an everyday level I would say - Thinking, thinking for yourself. It means questioning life, questioning yourself and the very society and world you live in. Understanding yourself - what or who binds you and what sets you free. It is also an inquiry into what your needs are and why do you need them. There is usually no need to philosophise as we are generally kept so busy trying to maintain our position in life or trying the ever more difficult task of having a family. Also we are trying to avoid the repetition of past trauma and we worry about the future traumas. We are part of a herd, a tribe, a people and we can\u2019t always cope. Who here could survive on less? Philosophy as I see it in a practical sense forms part of the script of one\u2019s life and time to reflect can pay dividends. ",

            "answer_text": "Since we, sentient humans, have our own cognitive capability, developed this kind of faculty to question our surroundings and ourselves. The first-hand quandaries that we primarily observe using the senses, or thought as an idea, are being inferred, impugned, and scrutinized; and by our own understandings we form conclusions that is known as a belief. The set of beliefs being accepted and rejected on our inward faculties on the mind is now being deemed as your personal philosophy, or \u2018the interpretation of everything through an individual\u2019 We feel the need of an objective in living and how we form our quest and dreams in life is also part of our personal philosophy. In other words, a personal philosophy is the belief of someone on how should he exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy, which is the spiritual knowledge, travels in one direction in the circle of research. Science, which is the physical knowledge, travels in the opposite direction in the same circle of research. A Philosopher or a Scientist should travel extensively, so that they will meet at the same point in the circle. If they are in the middle of their journey only, they will be opposite to each other and therefore, will fight with each other. The Philosopher says that God is beyond this world and He is inexplicable. The Scientist says that this world itself is God and accepts the inexplicable points in the nature. The Philosopher says that God pervades all over the world. The Scientist accepts the inexplicable nature of the world, though some concepts of the world are explicable. When God is inexplicable, the very characteristic nature of the God is only inexplicability. Philosopher calls the explicability as the creation and the inexplicability as God. The explicable part is agreed by both philosopher and scientist. The inexplicable part of the world is also accepted by both. This inexplicability is called as God by the Philosopher and the Scientist calls the same as inexplicability. The Scientist says that there is wire and heat in a hot wire. The Philosopher says that the fire and the wire are co-existing. The only difference is in words. The Scientist calls heat and the Philosopher calls the heat as fire. The wire is the explicable part of the world, which is agreed by all. A Scientist calls the other inexplicable part as a property by calling it as heat. The Philosopher calls the same as the possessor of the property i.e., fire. The intensive heat is fire. Thus the possessor of a property and the property are one and the same. The Scientist says the independent existence of the inexplicable power as an independent existence of a field of energy. The Philosopher says that there is a substratum of that field of energy, which is called as God and which, is not perceived so far. The Scientist accepts that they have to go still deeper. The Philosopher infers the existence of the substratum in such a deeper state. The argument of the Philosopher is that power cannot independently exist and needs a possessor. Suppose the Sun is not seen due to overlapping cloud, it should not be concluded that the light transmitting through the cloud is independently existing power. The Scientist may see the Sun in future after piercing through the cloud. So, where is the difference or quarrel between a matured Philosopher and a matured Scientist? The inference of the Philosopher is based on the perception of a similar concept existing in the explicable part of the world. The Scientist does not believe this because it is not a perception of the direct concept. Both have not seen the Sun. Both accept the perception of light. Both accept that their search and research has not reached the end. At this stage the Philosopher infers the Sun, whereas the Scientist does not infer the Sun but still accepts that the final truth is still to be achieved after piercing through the cloud of ignorance. At this point the support for the Philosopher is the Human Incarnation, which preaches the existence of such substratum. If the Scientist accepts the alternative genuine path of the miracles, the human incarnation definitely becomes the final authority about the existence of the possessor of such inexplicable power. If the Scientist has patience to reach the bottom most end, he will become a spiritual philosopher. An impatient Scientist existing in some middle place of the path becomes the atheist. ",
