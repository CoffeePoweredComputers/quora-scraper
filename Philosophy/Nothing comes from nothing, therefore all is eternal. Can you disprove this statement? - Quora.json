            "answer_text": "Depends on the definition of \"nothing.\" As well, \"all is eternal\" is not testable; however, the question is asking about the logic, where \"disprove\" means only to identify the logical flaw. If we take \"nothing comes from nothing\" statement and state it positively, then we have \"every thing is derived from a preceding thing.\" It follows, then, that something always existed, so the conclusion is true, but we must note that, essentially, the conclusion was assumed, it is simply another way of stating the assumption. Where does the assumption come from? It is fairly obvious: it comes from our experience of life. We do not ordinarily experience things that come from nothing. Or do we? What is a \"thing\"? Is a pattern a \"thing\"? How do we know the difference between a pattern that is \"real\" and a pattern that is only a pattern of neurons firing, i.e., a pattern that exists in our perception of it. If I shake a tray of stones, and they fall into a pattern, say it says, in some language, \"God,\" is the pattern real? If so, where did it come from? I'd be tempted to say that it came from nothing. What existed before the pattern came into existence was not a \"thing,\" but a *possibility.* Where do possibilities exist? In reality, or in our mind? I'll opt for \"mind,\" except for one thing. The mind that conceives of the possibility was possible, before it existed. That is my concept of reality, not truth that can be proven. This is simply one way to see it, the meanings we place on words. So before anything, there was the possibility of the thing. Something pre-existed, but this, then, presumes time, i.e. ,\"pre-\" The Big Bang can be understood as positing that something, indeed, came from nothing, and that \"time\" was meaningless before the thing existed, because what is time? We *measure* time through change, and if there is no matter or structure, what can change, other than the singularity of matter or structure coming into existence *from nothing.* Those who think that these concepts are simple enough to manipulate with basic logic, well, good luck! What is the point of the question? I suspect there is one, that the answer is to be used in some logical progression to the next issue, etc. But I don't know that. ",

            "answer_text": "The thing is, this statement disproves itself. So - this question is all a bit wrong, ie - incorrectly proposed.It's really a pseudo-problem (rather than, a real one). Unfortunately, Clause #1 above, (ie: `Nothing comes from nothing') does not lead to the conclusion, \"therefore\", <anything>, let alone, the flawed concept in Clause 2, namely: `therefore, all is eternal'. Clause 1 shows a misunderstanding of creativity and evolution anyway (ie How they work). Atoms, for example, have a lifespan. (see the book: `Atom' by Lawrence M Krauss. He talks about how long atoms last. And various elements such as Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen [preconditions for life, etc] are created inside stars/suns, it's a process called nucleosynthesis. Check it out, it's awesome. It's just physics and chemistry.) So - if you want to investigate why `nothing comes from nothing' (and why things have causes), firstly, to keep it simple enough to understand fairly easily, pick a domain: eg, physics, or chemistry, or `the cosmos' (eg planets, solar systems, galaxies, comets, etc), or, maybe even biology, or psychology, sociology, culturology.If you have physics and chemistry, you can have organic chemistry (though it takes a long time) and then, biology. Once you have biology (single-celled life, and plants, and animals) they reproduce, breed, `create' etc. Mainly it's (creativity) about combining things. The Big Bang apparently was caused by `membranes' colliding, and apparently it happens a lot. ie We're not exceptional, and not `special', just one of many universes, and ours happens to work reasonably well, or well enough for us plants & animals to be here for a little while, but it is still actually a pretty-lousy universe in many ways (certainly not so well-designed as to be: perfect). eg See many of the (great!) answers below about singularities, (big bangs) etc So - if you want to know how things are created, (and why things cause other things) read some science. eg Say, just as a random example, read `Cosmic Evolution', Chaisson 2000, say. Over time, atoms combine into other things. (Elements, and Molecules and whatnot) But atoms are certainly not eternal, at all. Guess what that means, if stuff is made of atoms? And - biology is (obviously) far from eternal... some trees live a few thousand years or whatever - but most biology (eg - individuals, plants, animals, including us) last only a few years, if that. Humans and elephants have a longish lifespan, turtles do a lot better.So it's a huge mistake to ever say \"everything is eternal\" as, pretty much nothing is eternal, as even the universe will suffer a heat death eventually. We humans, with our pretty-lousy evolved caveman \"ecological rationality\" are bad at imagining very long spans of deep time. We didn't need it till a few hundred thousand years ago... as we evolved from prokaryotes through sea-squirts, fish, reptiles, mammals to apes and to what we happen to call, us `humans'. (And - we all invented language along the way as a very crude communication tool. Language is a really OLD technology eg only around 200k years, or whatever. Maths is a better one - as many have noted.) Also, this question is a bit annoying anyway, for a Philosophy Q, as it sounds - suspiciously - like an argument that's sort of trying to prove there's a God (using language, which is something that both animals and humanimals invent, or rather that emerges from them over time... ie Chimps, dogs, cats, dolphins, whales etc, have languages too. - Nowhere as sophisticated as human language, sure. But still: languages, and that's just evolution for you, no biggie. Other animals also have levels of consciousness (depending on the animal), and again that's an emergent continuum. See Karl Popper (1999, ALiPS) on how animals and plants have knowledge, and if you have enough of that (knowledge, in Popper's sense) - and a self-aware system you finally get self-aware consciousness, on a spectrum. From plants thru animals, to: us guys.) Then you can start playing philosophy `language-games' - like this question does :) eg: For more of the same silliness - about using `tricky' language (weird loopy, illogical sentences that sound sort of logical but really are not) to try and prove that `a God or whatever exists', or simply MUST exist, surely, because some letters and words prove it... (ie just because a sentence makes some sort of vague, half-logical `internal sense' doesn't mean that it accurately reflects the world anyway... those are the exact sorts of `language games' that Continental Philosophers love to play - and, which doesn't actually prove anything, nor, solve any real-world problems), See for example this similar nonsense: Is there an argument for the existence of God? ie - You can't use logic (in words, maths or whatever) to prove there's a god. (If, that is what this silly philosophical `statement' is trying to `prove')... Symbols and signs (eg languages) are: made-up things.You can't really use the `logic' of language (of a random sentence) to prove, there's anything, in any meaningful realistic way. Language is just a tool, to convey and communicate ideas and/or feelings. Those ideas and feelings don't need to be true... You actually need evidence of: the thing. You might as well say: \"Nothing comes from nothing - therefore, there is a truck screaming right at me at 100 MPH right now\". If you don't get out of the way of the actual (real-world) truck, you will soon find `evidence of its existence', and also of your own looming, imminent lack of existence, at least in the form of a self-organizing system that depends on DNA replication. Though as you decompose some parts of the system might last a while longer (bacteria and whatnot). I know, it takes a lot of the `superstition' and `magic' out of Life to look at reality. But - that's what Science is good at. Superstition and magic don't actually solve any real-world problems, though they can be fun `games' to play, I guess. Science, however, does (ie - solve real-world problems).And now someone can of course say \"Ah yes but science creates many problems too.\"Sure.Welcome to the dark side of creativity. Evolution also creates horror. eg: Predators. The universe doesn't care.Our evolved psychology would rather `think nice thoughts' and ignore the horror. (There is quite a lot of incredible beauty in there, too.)But, mostly horror, e.g. a struggle for existence. Yet out of that horror comes some beauty, now and then. With our puny minds, we like to imagine, there's some sense behind it all. (A God - or whatever. Or something `eternal'. See also: Terror Management Theory, all this transitoryness (ie - lack of anything eternal) reminds us, on some level of: our own death, and - we just don't like it, very much.)  You can of course find some sense, here and there, but - we don't yet have a (space-) time machine - to go back and check out what happened `before' the Big Bang. So that's all tricky. (besides, as someone else here commented, time starts with a Big Bang, so asking what was before it is wrong, but asking what caused it is fine, `Time' isn't compulsory in M-Theory, ie Membrane Theory. There's like also 11 dimensions and whatnot.) But just because (most of) we very-recently-evolved humans don't yet understand it, (ie - can't replicate it in a lab - or make our own Big Bang inside a Large Hadron Collider) doesn't actually change that it happened.  If Science also keeps happening - and Religion just gets the heck out of the way we will soon get more, and more useful, answers.  Anyway - who really cares..?  There is a universe; there's an Earth; it's all certainly not eternal; nothing we know of, is actually eternal; so, stop wanting things to be `eternal'; enjoy your very-brief time in this big crazy mess, and, support science. - It's probably what's going to extend your lifespan. So that: you can enjoy more of your brief time, in: this crazy mess.eg See: Medicine, and, telemerase (the life-extending drug), etc.  Anyway - so, yes - ?I can disprove that sentence above, (as can, anyone who knows a little about Science, ie disproving this sentence above isn't really any big deal, for anyone) but - it also disproves itself (falls apart, pretty quickly) anyway, as it's based on false premises; it also mistakenly draws a wrong conclusion; and it also has lots of weird assumptions that all seem to ignore reality, and creativity, and evolution, and how it works. Also - the Ancient Greeks thought these sorts of (pretty silly) ideas, about 2400 years ago. Cultural evolution (ie - evolutionary epistemology) and Science means that: 2400 years on - we now know a lot more than we did, 2400 years ago.But - not knowing stuff yet, is: fine. You don't need a `God of the Gaps' to `fill in' parts (gaps) that are currently, as yet, unsolved... we just really need to do more Science - and also, probably, stop wasting our time on `philosophical word-games'. :) To be critical of my own answer: I guess this doesn't so much `disprove' the question as: put it in an atom-smasher.  But - this is also what annoys me deeply, about much of Philosophy. It gets abused, to try and get in the way of Science, and/or, to prove `Religion is way better than Science, see??! We have better answers!!!'  - or else, is a waste of time, like Continental Philosophy, in playing silly `language games' (to try and show off) when people should really be trying to solve real-world problems. (See: Karl Popper on all that. Most of Philosophy is actually a stupid waste of everyone's short time. - It's better to stay away from these silly areas - and instead, to tackle real, genuine, important problems. And, unfortunately, Religion isn't going to solve them; Science is. That's how cultural evolution works. Over time you (an emergent intelligent species like us) move from caveman beliefs in `Magic', to caveman beliefs in `Religion', and finally you get to Science, and, you can actually start solving problems. Of course - then there are new problems, but - so what? Science is still there. Use it!) See also, Stephen J Hawking for an even harsher view: `Philosophy is dead, science has taken over' (or - whatever the exact quote is, from `The Grand Design', Hawking and Mlodinow, 2010)  CheersJT ",
