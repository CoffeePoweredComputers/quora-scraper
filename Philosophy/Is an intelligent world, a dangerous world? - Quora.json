            "answer_text": "Intelligent or unintelligent, the world has always been a dangerous place. Before the modern era, there was at least one military battle raging somewhere on Earth every year since the rise of Humanity. Sometimes dozens. Sometimes hundreds. Sometimes a World War. Let us not forget the eternal nature of Crime. Even before Humanity arose, the Earth was a food-chain, where the stronger prey upon the weaker. Add to this the Natural Disasters \u2014 the floods \u2014 the famines \u2014 the plagues. So, as I say \u2014 intelligent or unintelligent, the world has always been a dangerous place. The watchword of every century has always been \u2014 BE CAREFUL! ",
