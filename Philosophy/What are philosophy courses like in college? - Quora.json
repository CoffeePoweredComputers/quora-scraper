            "answer_text": "Question: What are philosophy courses like in college? It always depends on the professor and the class. In my case, I had two classes which stuck out for me. The first was Introduction to Social and Political Philosophy, where my class spent a copious amount of time learning about the political philosophies of Plato, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean Jacques-Rousseau, and John Rawls, with a few mentions of David Hume (his view on social reforms), Ayn Rand (her influence in beginning the libertarian movement) and Robert Nozick (his influence in legitimizing the libertarian movement as a philosophical school), as well as a bunch of major anarchist philosophers (with a major focus on Marx). We also spent a solid week discussing feminism and it\u2019s growth as a philosophical school of thought. This class was incredibly interesting, and I still have the notebook for it (I may take pictures and post them on here). The main idea of the course was to be capable of writing coherently on which political philosophies we agreed with the most and to argue for or against other ones and, as such, the class was incredibly argumentative. The grade in the class consisted of Participation & Attendance (30%), two Exams (25% each), then the final overall Exam (20%). The Exams ended up being very typical, with a large set of multiple choice and short answer questions which were related to information we learned on particular philosophers, and then several big-point, open-ended questions where we argued for a particular viewpoint being valid or invalid. The Exams progressively got more difficult as we learned about newer names and had to inform ourselves on more major political philosophers and ideologies. The second was Introduction to the Philosophy of Science. The professor for this course was incredibly laid back and \u2018chill,\u2019 I guess you can say. He never took attendance and told us on the first day of class that everything we need for his course is on the syllabus. In other words, theoretically, you did not have to attend a single lecture he offered. Rather, you can spend all your time simply reading sections from the textbook or getting notes from a friend in class and you could pass without taking the class. I brought the textbook, but I never used it. I attended every lecture because I wanted to because, in reality, his lectures were incredibly interesting. He had a way of explaining the major ideas of various philosophers incredibly well and I never once had to open the textbook simply because his explanations were so good. He had a very good pace, answered any questions anyone had at any time, and allowed the class to discuss major talking points. He also made the class relevant for each student. Just for one example, this professor knew beforehand that one of the students was a Biology major, when most of the class were social science majors, and he took an entire lecture teaching our class about Willard Van Orman Quine and Peter Singer, despite the fact that neither were on the syllabus. For those who do not know, Quine was a philosopher of science (among other philosophical focuses) who made an argument as to why we should devalue Creationists, while Peter Singer is a contemporary utilitarian moralist philosopher who argues that the consumption of meat is morally wrong. Neither of these figures were going to be mentioned in our class (as the syllabus showed), and yet he took an entire class discussing these philosophers, both of which are in some way connected to Biology (Quine discussing evolutionary biology and Singer discussing the moral implications of consuming meat). It was a sweet gesture, and I think most people failed to see it since nobody actually reads the syllabus for themselves (and this professor made it clear that he would almost never diverge from the syllabus). Quizzes and tests for this class were incredibly straightforward. Much like the previous class mentioned, there were many short answer questions that required you to grasp the main ideas of different philosophers (Quine and Singer appeared both as bonus questions, by the way, on the one exam a bonus question was present), and the tests were typically extremely open-ended, with you having to argue in favor of particular viewpoints. In class, the philosophers were typically discussed were Plato and Aristotle (for the first few weeks), Karl Popper (almost all year), Rudolf Carnap (one week), David Hume (one week), Ludwig von Wittgenstein (a few weeks) and Thomas Kuhn (also a few weeks). I thought both classes were incredibly enjoyable and offered vastly different platforms to discuss ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "Having first taken and then taught philosophy classes for years I can give you some general insights. As another answer mentions there is a difference between lower level general introductory philosophy courses and higher level or graduate courses in philosophy. Your first introduction to philosophy will likely be with some secondary source material (books written about philosophical works) and a few snippets of the primary source texts or perhaps one or two source texts. Depending on the format of the course you will probably be asked to write some essays on philosophical questions or complete exams demonstrating your grasp of the basic philosophical ideas of major thinkers. Higher level courses tend to assume at least some previous background in the subject and some passing familiarity with the basics of the history of philosophy. Though higher level courses do not always require prerequisites it is a good idea to have some familiarity with the basics before taking one. Often such higher level courses focus on one particular area of philosophy. I took courses in Continental Rationalism, British Empiricism, and Existentialism while an undergraduate. Graduate level courses are often conducted as seminars which are usually smaller (10 students perhaps) and meet once per week. They are often directed by the students who are assigned specific topics to address at each week\u2019s meetings and are often much more discussion based than undergraduate courses. Usually there are fewer assignments and often a large portion of your grade is based on one major paper. With regarding to all courses, but especially undergraduate courses, the quality of the course is largely dependent on the willingness of students to engage in open discussion. Of course, it helps greatly to have a professor who is willing to encourage and facilitate this but even with such a professor if the students are hesitant or unwilling to ask questions, make comments, and engage with each other the class will lack something which is essential to philosophy: dialogue. If you are in the position of thinking about taking a course in philosophy I would strongly encourage you to do so. They can be opportunities to open the door to a great deal of insight and learning about not only philosophy but also many other subjects. ",
