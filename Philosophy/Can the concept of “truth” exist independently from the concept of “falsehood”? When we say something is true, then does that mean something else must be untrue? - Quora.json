It is dependent on the lie to become truth and vice versa but there is Truth,which we call in mysticism, which is different from truth you are considering here. It contains both truth and lies in it. We call it Truth because that Truth is you but because we are in delusion of relativity which is nothing but time, we think there is duality in this world. But, there is no duality. Duality is illusion. This illusion is not dream but it is real but it is not the truth. It is created falseness Jiddu Eckhart Tolle sribagavath.org/ebooks/ ",

One\u2019s about the person who actually experiences it and the other one is what you hear through a second person. It's just about point of view. When you hear about a incident by someone else, the truth may be covered up by that person's opinion. It's like a game of chinese whisper. Sometimes a person actually experience it l, may not tell the fabricate the truth. So, what you perceive as a truth may be false for someone else. ",

Some truths, such as mathematical truths, cannot be otherwise ( 2 + 2 must always equal 4). However in the empirical realm what we believe to be true statements are in principle revisable based on new evidence. For example, it was for centuries believed that the \u201catom\u201d was the indivisible fundamental substance of material reality Now we know there are underlying sub-atomic particles. ",

For example God doesn't allow bad things to happen to good people, but is the need of balance what allows this to happen. In order to be \u201cgood\u201d people there has to be \u201cbad\u201d people, and how could bad people be bad if they didn't had nobody to be bad at? So this is why bad people are allowed to cause harm to good people. Same as as there is life, is also death. For every crime there is a punishment. And the list goes on. Day wouldn't be day if there was no night to difference one from another. ",
