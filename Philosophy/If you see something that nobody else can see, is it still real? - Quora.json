I was still able to ascertain those sensory perceptions were real (the smell i smelled and nobody else did turned out to be beginning rot in a bit of ground meat which the others smelled as well as soon as they opened the slightly bloated bag while the trange whirring i could trace back to a small partlet that had got loose near the ventilator of our flat) but most other people still did not hear or smelled them. And i guess the same way somebody with exceptional eye sight or eye sight better than anybody around him/her (the one eyed man being king among the blind and all that) might very well see things others don\u2019t and still be correct. And if we are going into the realm of the supernatural\u2026 well, that\u2019s something you got to figure out for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Many scientific breakthrpughs started-out as something that nobody else could see, but was real only to the scientist that had the initial insight. \u201cReal\u201d tends to withstand the test of time. Alternatively, if you can make something that \u201conly you can see\u201d go away by taking a pill, it\u2019s probably not \u201creal\u201d. One other factor to consider is that in many situations in life there can be a huge difference between what people actually see and what they\u2019re willing to openly admit that they see (not to mention the human propensity for seeing what they want to see). The part of the \u201cEmperor has no clothes!\u201d story that is rarely told (because it\u2019s only \u201creal\u201d in my mind) is that the Emperor later had the boy and his family hauled-off in chains and executed (along with the others that were similarly afflicted). A good reminder to always remain aware of \u201creal\u201d danger. ",
