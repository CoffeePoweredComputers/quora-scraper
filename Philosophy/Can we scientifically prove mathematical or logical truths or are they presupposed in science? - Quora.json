            "answer_text": "This depends on you definition of \u201cscientific proof\u201d. Mathematics and logic are systems of meaning which offer ways of determining formal proof. So by definition, mathematical truths are proven just by the fact that they are shown to be mathematically true. However, if you when you say scientific proof you mean empirical proof things get tricky. Or in other words, can we observe something in the world which tells us mathematics is true? Yes and no. We can to the extent that when we apply mathematics to things, it works. The truths seem to bear out in reality. But does this get around the problem of circularity? The tools of mathematics and logic are ultimately human inventions. I.e. that in order to prove mathematics worked we had to first presuppose it worked and then apply it as if it worked. No. In that sense, it will always need to be \u201cpresupposed\u201d before it can be proven. But that doesn\u2019t make it untrue. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many mathematical systems. Aside from being based on unprovable but carefully chosen axioms, they are all internally consistent and contain elaborate, mathematically provable structure. Some of these systems can be used to model the real world. Many cannot. Mathematics does not care. Its proofs do not depend on reality, only consistent logic. Science does care, and employs only the math it finds useful to model the observations it has made. These are not presupposed, but fitted and applied after the fact. Science does not prove or create reality, but only observes it - often in astonishment - and tries to understand it - often incompletely. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics and logic are abstract reasoning systems. Theorems are true or false according to the rules of production in those systems. 5+4=9 is a mathematical fact. What science can show is the conclusions in those models are good reflections of what happens in the real world. If I take 5 apples and 4 apples and then count all the apples the fact I find 9 apples is well predicted by the axiomatic system of the integers. The integers are a good abstract model of apples. ",
