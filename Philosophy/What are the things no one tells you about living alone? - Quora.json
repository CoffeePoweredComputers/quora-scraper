            "answer_text": "How truly liberating and amazing it is. This can be different for those who get lonely, I don\u2019t. It is truly surreal not having anyone to call your name, just being able to relax and do what you want whenever you want. No one is pestering you. You only have you to cook for. It\u2019s great. You can have company when you want and not have any when you don\u2019t want. Meditation is a synch. I absolutely love it. I won\u2019t be able to live alone again for many many years as I have children now and they are small. But believe me I can not wait until the day. The children I don\u2019t actually mind. They are fun to have around. But I prefer not to share a living space with another adult. I honestly love living alone so much I have 0 negatives about it. Even though I have to lug all the groceries in myself. Doesn\u2019t matter because the alternative is having an unwanted body in my space if i didn\u2019t live alone. But they also don\u2019t tell you that friends will ask to stay with you when they fall on hard times. I always allow it despite my preference. It is nice having extra hands to clean. And well if I let you come stay with me temporarily then that means I spend a lot of time with you any way and we always have fun together. Me nor my S.O. like living with others. And we have decided we won\u2019t even move in together just live not far from one another. Own together our properties but maintain our own space. They don\u2019t tell you that you should learn how to do minor repairs yourself in your living space or you\u2019ll pay out the hoohaa for something as trivial as a broken toilet. You can fix that. You can fix cabinets, repair door hinges. Learn to do that stuff or it will get very costly to live alone. Living alone depending on your area can be quite expensive or it could not be any more expensive than if you were splitting the bills. I keep my bills and rent low. I\u2019m in Michigan and the rent rates range from reasonable to why in the hell would I pay that and I don\u2019t own the place. I stay with reasonable. I won\u2019t spend more than 500 a month on rent; 450 is my target. I keep even my energy bills low. Unplug everything but the refrigerator when I\u2019m not home. In the winter keep my heat at 68 and wear clothes inside lol. Cuddle up with blankets and wear socks. We have horrible heating bills here in Detroit. Make sure your space is well insulated and your window seals are in good condition. This will cut down on heating and cooling costs. You will hear many strange noises. Don\u2019t be alarmed for most of them it\u2019s the place settling. Give a friend or family member a spare key. If you live alone there is no one to let you in if you forget your key. I don\u2019t know where you live but some places have a do not copy on the keys. Spphhhht we get that sucker copied anyway because to replace a key or to have maintenance come let you in costs money. I\u2019d rather spend five dollars making key copies than 35 dollars on a new key sometimes they charge 50. No thank you copy it is. I\u2019ve never lost the keys to my place and I don\u2019t intend to. But I have two small children now who I parent myself. It may happen. So I definitely make copies. If you rent a house you have to mow the lawn, shovel snow (if you live in a place that gets snow). Know when your trash pickup day is. There are places you can find that will pay partial or all utilities. Find those it makes living alone more manageable. If you can\u2019t then what you do is call your utility company and ask them for tips on how to cut down on your energy bills, and water bill. They will genuinely help. Other than that just enjoy the solitude. It is a real work of art haha. Just beautiful. ",

            "answer_text": " I spent my 20s living with multiple roommates in multiple neighborhoods in New York City. I'd never picked out a bathmat or been able to identify all the food in the fridge. On the cusp of 30, I decided I was ready for a \"room of my own\" before fate or family tied me to a life of compromising on couch color. With two months to go until my birthday, I decided to embark on a year of self-discovery and cooking for one. Sure, I had done my homework on the pluses and minuses of single life. Studies show that living alone can potentially lead to a shorter lifespan and poor eating habits. But weren't all those TV depictions of single women who overeat in bathrobes while bathed in light from their open fridge just a clich\u00e9? I quit a long-term job and moved into my sparkly new studio on the same day. I was terrified of starting at a new company but eager to take on new challenges. Plus, after five years of writing my ass off every morning, I had a literary agent and an almost-complete book manuscript. And while my last couple of relationships had ended badly, I was excited about a close friend who was becoming something more. As I began to pack up my belongings, I let myself soak up the last month of my 20s. I was living in the age of Beyonc\u00e9, and I was feeling myself. THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO TAKING CARE OF YOUR MIND AND BODY Subscribe to HuffPost\u2019s wellness email Successfully Subscribed! Wellness delivered to your inbox The move went well, and my \"close friend\" became a fixture at my new place, helping me hang photos and put together furniture. I shared my first few meals with him there, and we spent those early weekends exploring the neighborhood together. I was happy -- independent but partnered, side-stepping the stereotypes I'd feared. My new job and apartment were big steps forward in my life, and having someone to share them with made them seem that much more real. On the cusp of 30, I decided I was ready for a \"room of my own\" before fate or family tied me to a life of compromising on couch color. Then that someone became a no one to me: After six months of dating, I went to his house and found my toiletries are hidden and another woman's toothbrush by the sink. Stunned, I retreated to my apartment. But the place I had envisioned as a sanctuary felt like anything but. The studio that was supposed to be a blank slate on which I'd write my way forward in life was crowding me out with memories I now wanted to forget.  Photo credit: Ed Israel I was single and about to turn 30 -- a birthday that happened to coincide with the five-year anniversary of my mother's death. While I had expected this anniversary to feel like the others -- sucky but bearable -- something about this one stung acutely. At 30, my mother was married and on her way to having me. What would she think if she saw me now, pacing my apartment in mismatched socks? That's when I decided it was time to take charge of this whole living alone thing. I set out to consciously experience what was happening within my own four walls -- and came to some pretty freeing realizations. 1. Living alone doesn't automatically make you OK with being alone. There is a huge difference between signing a lease for a studio and going to sleep and waking up alone. When that door shut behind me the first-night post-breakup, I wanted to crawl out of my skin. Listening to creaky floorboards in the dark and killing that first bug by your big, bad self is scary rites of passage, but the only way to get comfortable being alone is, well... to actually be alone. Getting comfortable with yourself can be uncomfortable, but the process is liberating. With that in mind, I began actively blocking off time to be by myself. I went out alone to crowded restaurants and movies. I went for walks in my new neighborhood and found places I love and return to again and again. Getting comfortable with yourself can be uncomfortable, but the process is liberating.  2. Your smartphone can become your roommate. Don't let it. At first, there were moments at night when I began to feel panicky. I'd reach for my smartphone to soothe my nerves and connect with people via text and apps, scrolling through social feeds to see pictures of the parties I'd missed. I could blow through hours of \"alone time\" connected to a screen and completely disconnected from myself. Then I made myself put the phone down. I'd look at the four walls around me and let myself feel anxious or sad or hungry or whatever it was I was feeling, and then go on with my day. Once I got into this habit, I realized that my inner life was fuller and louder than I had ever realized. I had just been too busy trying to drown out self-doubt to consciously enjoy my own company. 3. Your time is valuable... and you'll finally start to believe that. I had spent the past five years working full-time and writing on the side at the crack of dawn. I was constantly exhausted, but if someone wanted to grab a beer after work, I almost always said yes. At home, I showered -- quickly -- when the shower was free. My life was dictated by what other people wanted or what I thought they wanted. I was great at anticipating everyone else's needs and making sure they felt loved and supported, but not so great at taking care of myself. At 30, my mother was married and on her way to having me. What would she think if she saw me now, pacing my apartment in mismatched socks? Having your own place gives you the breathing room to check in with what you really want. And sometimes, what your body is telling you is that it doesn't want to go to a friend-of-a-friend's concert in Williamsburg at 11:30 p.m. It wants to watch another episode of Transparent and roast some goddamn Brussels sprouts.  4. You're allowed to choose who to let in. In my old life, all I had to do was walk into my living room to have a conversation with friends. Now I have to reach out if I want to see the people I love. Having to actually make an effort crystallized for me the divide between friends I could count on -- the friends who made pasta from scratch and brought over a bottle of wine post-breakup -- and the friends of convenience. Bit by bit, I started to realize an amazing but often overlooked perk of living solo: You can choose who to keep out and who to let in. Being conscious about the people you let into your life can deepen the quality of your friendships.  5. Where you are is who you are. Following the breakup, I rearranged my furniture and put up new pictures -- including my favorite one of my mom, looking confident and happy at the age I am now. I finally finished my book. I served New Year's Eve dinner for four of my closest friends on the plates my mom used to bring out for family dinners. As I looked around at my friends in the last hours of 2015, I understood what Frances Mayes meant in Under the Tuscan Sun when she wrote, \"Where you are is who you are. The further inside you the place moves, the more your identity is intertwined with it. Never casual, the choice of place is the choice of something you crave.\" I have a few months left on my lease, and I honestly don't know where I'll be come August. But for the first time in my life, not having a plan doesn't terrify me. I see the spring and summer stretching ahead of me and envision days filled with breakfasts for one, dinners with friends old and new, and a surprising excitement at the thought of getting to know someone I never really gave a chance: me.
