            "answer_text": "This question has a lot of possible embedded themes, including the nature of knowledge considered as an abstraction, and the conduct of long-term, principled learning under conditions of factual and theoretical uncertainty. You\u2019re referring to making the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d into \u201cknown unknowns\u201d. Regarding the notion of \u201chow much\u201d, we can surmise that the unknowns are larger than the knowns, and the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d would be the largest category. Perhaps it\u2019s silly or misleading to try to specify and quantify knowledge AS IF it existed somewhere else already fully defined, and all we need to do is look and see it. This is the traditional way we face the process, and it has been practical to go about it that way. But we also need to consider that some kinds of knowledge are not \u201calready there\u201d, but that we in a sense create them through the process of looking. This is especially true where the knowledge system is obviously recursive\u2014 for example, we\u2019re talking about social behavior on the internet, that emerges from and is influenced by analysis of the same. This is the kind of circular causality that is a marker of \u201cEmergence\u201d\u2014 which applies to knowledge as well as to the more commonly considered case of, say, physical and material structures. See Also Is there a term for the realization that the information available to us is perpetually insufficient when it comes to making decisions & that ultimately, we will never be able to consider every possible variation, implication, & outcome of something? What is the name of this concept? Nature never moves in straight lines but basic human logic does. Nature creates perfect order from chaos. Human logic creates chaos from order. ",

            "answer_text": "We \u2018should\u2019 know what we don\u2019t know, only if we can. Everyone has their own unique consciousness from which they perceive and understand from. A lot of our accumulated knowledge has been school taught and not necessarily true, but it does fit in with our societies and civilization. The organized systems of our societies are pyramid shaped and work from the top down on a need to know basis. In this way the person at the top of the organization can have lower consciousness feelings of greed and selfishness to keep the organization profitable. If we work in the middle parts of these organizations, then we often know things that we would prefer not knowing, but keep doing our jobs as we are supposed to. If a person gets a change of heart anywhere above the middle levels, they may not survive the fall to the bottom when they are let go. At \u201cWe, the People\u201d level of society, we can develop our consciousness from self-respect and unconditional love. As this happens we will keep getting flash's of insight that open our minds to new possibilities. Our creative juices begin to flow and we can really begin to enjoy ourselves and feel gratitude for the magnificent planet that supports us. The reality of life shows itself and we get a different way of knowing which is based on feeling-tones of unconditional love and the intelligent energy that sunlight has given to all life on the earth. Indigenous Australians were completely in tune with the intelligent energies of the land and the universe. They understood the war between the Orion Conquers and the Pleiades Chicks in their own mythologies that could be 60,000 years old. They could correspond in feeling-tones with the trees, the animals and especially Uluru. They had men's business that women did not know and women had women's business that men did not know. But as tribal unit\u2019s they flowed together with their own unique tribal knowing. It\u2019s handy to know what we don\u2019t know as well as accepting what we do know as being our own truth. It may not be someone else\u2019s truth, which becomes an opportunity for correspondence or conflict based on self-respect and unconditional love. ",
