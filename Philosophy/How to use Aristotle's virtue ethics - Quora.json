            "answer_text": "I use Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics to frame my understanding of myself as a person with certain habits, some leading me to a flourishing life and some the other direction. So when things go wrong for me, the virtue ethics frame encourages me stop to consider whether a habit of mine or my lack of a habit has caused my problem.
