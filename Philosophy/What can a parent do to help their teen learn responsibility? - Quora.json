            "answer_text": "Honestly, responsibility learning continues through a child\u2019s live. So, take time to review the responsibilities that you had when you were a teen. You know those things that you complained to your friends that your parents made you to. First, make their bed every morning - Why you ask, there are several reasons, easier to go to bed, keep the spiders out, etc. Second, brush their teeth and floss, something that all dentist recommend. Third, school and homework. Now, take time to really thing about what you are willing to give your teen to be responsible around the home. Responsibilities are those \u201cchores\u201d that are part of what we do as a family. Once the first three are consistent, your teen should have improved self-worth to do more. However, there are so many factors that can get in the way - peers, technology, and attitude. Be Bold and consistent. Also, consider the consequences when your teen does not do their responsibilities, be consistent. Think about the way your respond versus react to your teen. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Hopefully the parent is not merely beginning to teach responsibility in the teen years because by then it might be too little, too late. As for how to continue to teach responsibility at the teenage level, any time a teenager expresses desire for a privilege of their advanced age, try and tie it to an associated proportional cost which the teenager is expected to pay. This \u201cprice\" does not always mean literal money. Sibling related accountability is a big one. Assign the older children responsibility over the younger ones for babysitting or a task like walking to the store or park. Tell the younger kids in front of the older one that they are expected to respect their older sibling as an adult during this time. Then take the older child aside and privately tell him/her you are holding them individually accountable for the well being of their younger charges. This simultaneously feeds the teenage ego while reminding the teenager that they cannot act like a child themselves in this case. Having a later bedtime comes with the expectation that you're managing time efficiently enough to have homework or chores done promptly and competently. Having extra spending money means you earned it through an increased level of chores, or maybe even a part-time job. Getting a driver's license means respecting the owner of tbe car that you're borrowing enough to bring it back in one piece, clean, and full of gas. Tl:dr \u2014 A teenager needs to be taught, repeatedly, that to get to take more from life means that more is expected to be given from them in return. ",
