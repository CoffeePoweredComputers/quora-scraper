            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if there is an argument, but infinite regresses aren\u2019t very satisfying intellectually, or philosophically. If we want to explain something, and all we can do is explain it in relationship to an infinite regress, then we haven\u2019t really done our job, have we? This is a similar problem with vicious circles, which I suppose are a special kind of infinite regress. Also, in the case of infinite regresses which are not circular, there seems to be a multiplication of an infinite amount of entities. If you have to posit infinite entities as a consequence of your argument, that\u2019s not very theoretically responsible. You\u2019ve just multiplied the amount of entities in the world by an infinite number! I suppose your argument is directed towards the question about the Cosmological Argument for God, one that says there must be an uncaused, cause, because otherwise there would be an infinite number of causes. The biggest weakness of this argument has little to do with the argument about infinite causes, but more so to do with what it actually ends up proving. Say you accept the conclusion and argument, that there must be an uncaused cause. This does not in any way warrant a conclusion that \u2018God as conceived as an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent thing esists.\u2019 It just warrants the conclusion that there is an uncaused cause, which may be much of nothing. A fan of science might say that the Big Bang IS the uncaused cause that the argument proves must exist. After all, from what I know, our best science thinks that there really was nothing before the Big Bang, that nothing caused it. So all the argument has proved is the need for the Big Bang, or something like it to exist. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re referring to the fallacy of the cosmological argument, which states that some \u201cgod\u201d had to have caused the universe to begin existing. The response to that is, if the universe required a creator because something couldn\u2019t just come into being on its own, then who created the creator? Didn\u2019t the creator come into being on its own? And if something created the creator, then what created that creator? And what created that creator, ad infinitum? So the cosmological argument solves that infinite regress by simply declaring that there was a first cause. The fallacy is that, whatever that first cause is, has been arbitrarily chosen for convenience, and not because it is factually or logically true. In other words, it\u2019s a premise that is a non-factual assumption, like saying, \u201cLet\u2019s say that gravity causes things to fall up into the sky\u2026\u201d You can follow that premise with a string of additional statements and relationships to arrive at some conclusion (\u201c\u2026therefore, all kangaroos have 9 legs\u201d) - however, the conclusion is almost certainly not going to resemble any facet of reality, because it all proceeds from a false assertion. In simpler, and more complete terms, I might offer this mathematical proof as an illustration: The number 1 has the same value as the number 5. 1 + 5 = 6 Since 1 = 5, 1 + 1 = 6 Therefore, the number 2 has the same value as the number 6. Clearly, 1 does not equal 5, and 2 does not equal 6. But all the steps in between the first and last statement are logically and mathematically sound and consistent. It\u2019s the fact that the premise (1=5) is false that makes the otherwise logically constructed conclusion also false. So if you start your argument by saying \u201cGod created the universe, and nothing else created God,\u201d you can\u2019t prove your premise to be true, therefore your conclusion cannot be considered to be necessarily true, no matter how watertight the intermediate logic is. Any argument the begins with a claim that God is the first cause, might as well begin with, \u201cThe universe exists because of the color blue\u201d or \u201cThe universe was created by an invisible pink unicorn.\u201d Everything that follows any of those premises (or multitudes of other arbitrary claims) is inherently unverifiable and results in a conclusion that cannot be considered true based on any factual basis.
