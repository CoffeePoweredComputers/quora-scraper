            "answer_text": "You can describe color with mathematics, or physics with philosophy, or morality with science; but these are essentially the wrong tools for the job. * Science excels at answering technical questions. * Mathematics excels at describing quantity and geometry. * Philosophy excels at addressing meaning and purpose (including morality). It always puzzles me when people rely on science as if it is the only valid tool; and that my friends, isn\u2019t science. It\u2019s scientism, a religion. What my philosophy (the more appropriate tool) tells me about morality is that: - Right and wrong are eternal (only childlike memorization by rote of external morality is outdated); - That doing right toward others is the essence of justice (without which peace is quickly lost); - That righteousness and honoring right principle can make the eyes shine, where amorality can lead to resignation in futility; - That manipulated post-modern culture has caused many to abandon morality, resulting in masses of people who now tolerate the intolerable, including civil rights violations which would have resulted in revolution a couple of generations ago; - That amorality results in frequent and casual betrayals where the betrayed becomes angry, and the betrayer hypocritically frames the reactive anger as the transgression; - That while many say right and wrong are too complicated to define, we all really know what they are when we quiet the noise and look within; and - That the world is definitely much worse off because of the current dominant cultural habit of abandoning all moral compasses and pretending that is the sophisticated enlightened position.

            "answer_text": "A lot of related fields are bringing new data from research that helps to explain why and how we are moral individuals and moral societies. I don't know any full account of it, but I'm not an specialist on the subject neither, so I'll paste here some of the authors that have brought some light on the subject. Dan Ariely has become very well known for his research on behavior, cheating, irrationality, reason etc. http://www.ted.com/speakers/dan_ariely.html One of his points, and it has been arising all around neuroscience research, is the major role of irrational decisions on our life, or the other side of the coin, how we overrated the role of reason and free will. This has an impact not yet fully measured and certainly far from being accepted by the way we rule society (all legal systems are based on a free will principle). Free will has always been a controversial point on philosophy, and this question about having or not free will, or how consciousness work, is greatly debated by Danniel Dennet, Sam Harris, Damasio and others. Dan Dennett | Profile on TED.com Sam Harris | Profile on TED.com Antonio Damasio | Profile on TED.com Jonathan Haidt: The moral roots of liberals and conservatives | Video on TED.com Besides neuroscience and psychology, various other fields can jump in the heart of the discussion as well, with cases that question our special moral role on the world. Animals studies shows that humans are not the only species to show some kind of moral behavior. Frans de Waal | Profile on TED.com Finding this links between our behavior and other animals put morality on perspective, questioning a lot of assumptions, including the special place on world humans always thought to have and the treatment we gave other species. Anthropology as well has always presented great discussions about what is moral and if its feelings are universal or not, with a lot of relativists and multiculturalists taking anthropological studies as ground for its argumentation. History and evolution also bring some light on how we evolved over time to behave the way we do, and why this is an advantage. A great introduction is this course:  Coursera - A Brief history of humankind, by Dr. Harari. ",
