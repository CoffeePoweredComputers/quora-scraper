            "answer_text": "It just might be possible. I know a street probably quite near to where you live now if your American. There are two monogamous gay men who have lived together for their whole lives and never had jobsA nice lady fixes household items on the cheap in her flatAnother guy lives in a trash can and is rather belligerent towards other folks. He never works but eating from other people's garbage is a tough live.Many years ago the milkshake bar closed down and is no longer a viable business.A mentally ill man lives in a lane way he doesn't work either. He wears a huge canary outfit and has delusions that there are small woolly mammoths who only he can see and hear.People on this street are so removed from the idea that they should work that they sing songs that idolize anyone who actually has a job.So can you tell me how to get to this street. It's quite simple. If you have left your education at kindergarten. If you want eat garbage and live in an alley way then don't work. So many jobs are there for you. Sing it to yourself if it helps. Post Carriers Police Officers Fire Fighters Yes these people are needed right now in your neighborhoods. After all these are the people that you meet when your walking down the street each day. So if you want to be stuck with your life for 42 years don't work. Otherwise sign up with the man and they will let you keep your IPhone 53 plus when you retire at sixty five. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that it is possible to live a life without working full-time because I did it for years. But that wasn\u2019t out of choice, that was because I was laid off every year for six years. I did not in that time have a profession and so I hadn\u2019t saved much money. But people who know me are amazed on how little I can live from. To live on little means that I didn\u2019t smoke, drink, dine out more than once a year, buy many new clothes, travel, invest. Honestly. Was I happy-not really, but I did it. But my unhappiness had to do with my outlook and not my lack of funds. But did I want new experiences that only money could buy, yes. Mostly travelling. And I became very anxious and worried because my employment situation wasn\u2019t getting better and I was getting older. I think you can live if you have a sufficient amount of savings to last a life-time, but without it, I am doubtful that you can live without a fulltime job or very well-paying part-time job because the cost of living keeps going up and PT work isn\u2019t easy to live on. BUT TO GET MORE TO YOUR QUESTION and concern about having to work for people and big business that is killing your spirit, I too never want to work for others because they were killing my spirit and sense of self-worth. Its a long story. My situation became very difficult a few months ago and so I decided to investigate on-line marketing opportunities. There are true ways that you can make money part time, work for yourself, have pride in your life, and not work full-time and you CAN HELP OTHERS too.
