            "answer_text": "We continuously lose sight of the fact that we process words. Words are differences in sound to which we ascribe meaning that is associated with variations in the steady state of our consciousness caused by sense stimuli. This applies whether we are talking about a grain of sand or the universe. Both are just ideas that are defined by words. So too is the distinction called God. We place the idea of God in a different category since it references cause as opposed to effect or result. Are their many universes as opposed to just one? Nobody knows for sure if we are talking about that which lies outside of our ability to subjectively render such a thing. What we do know is that each of us has our own personal universe in which we function relative to the possibilities that have been accorded to us. And when we die so goes our universe. So in this respect their are currently around 7.442 billion different universes. It is hard to be more exact than that because they keep coming into and going out of existence at a rather dizzying pace. And consistent with the discrepancies between them there are approximately 320,000,000 gods. So you should be able to see how your question gets a little tacky to answer. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an interesting question, let me try and suggest a math-compliant answer. Technically, the answer would depend on whether there could or would exist a wave function of the multiverse, or not (some multiverse scenarios, such as Everett\u2019s, do not allow for separateness, but some others do, thus making wholly separate wave functions in principle possible.) If not, then this would point to different Gods (if there is such a thing as a God), although it would not yet be open and shut. The remaining issue would arise from the fact that in order to exist in the first place, any universe within the multiverse, or for that matter any multiverse, must originally have tunneled out of the Ur-vacuum (the original true vacuum) (for a brief recap of this scenario, see here : H. Chris Ransford's answer to Does anyone really believe that the cosmos was caused by a \"big bang\"? ) Could any independent separate tunneling events (each ultimately giving rise to new universes) exist? In order for such to exist, there must remain areas of true vacuum left over after the first tunneling event that would have given rise to the first instance of false vacuum. Could such remnants exist? Find the answer to this, and you\u2019ll have the answer to your question. It\u2019s probably not trivial \u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "This, obviously, will be a subjective answer, but based on my objective experiences in life. There are a number of different types of multiverse proposed, none, many or all of which may exist - we have no evidence for any of them at the moment. Even if I were to assume that at least one of these proposals represented the true state of affairs, I cannot assume that there are any gods, because I am an atheist. I must comment on one of the other answers: proposed multiverse theories were NOT created to eliminate the need of Gods. In the main they were created in an attempt to provide answers to a number of unanswered problems with the standard Big Bang model of cosmology. ",

It\u2019s a speculation which can lead to some further interesting speculative ideas, but it doesn\u2019t qualify as a scientific theory. Remember that a \u201cscientific theory\u201d is a proposed explanation for something which we can already observe and test. Scientific theory - Wikipedia Multiverse - Wikipedia. The concept of a God or of Gods is speculation. There is no evidence for even one god, and there probably never will be. It\u2019s a speculation which doesn\u2019t interest me personally very much. But as speculations, you\u2019re certainly welcome to combine them and speculate about a god or set of gods overseeing all universes or a separate god or set of gods within each universe, as you wish.
