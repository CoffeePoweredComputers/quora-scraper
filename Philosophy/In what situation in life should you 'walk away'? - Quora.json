            "answer_text": "When I dread instead of look forward to seeing you. When I feel perpetually exhausted. When nothing seems to get resolved without high-octane drama. When the reasons for the relationship are internal. It\u2019s not that I love you, it\u2019s that I\u2019m lonely. When what you think I mean is not at all what I said, and this happens systematically. Or when you say that\u2019s not what you said, and I know that you did, and this happens systematically. When you mistreat me: raise your voice, gaslight me, play games, twist words. When we want different things. When despite our efforts, we are fundamentally incompatible. When there is an absence of trust. When anything in our dynamic is hurting either your life or mine. In particular when what I want is for your life to be better - which is what I always want. When my life is not interesting to you \u2013 or yours to me. When I don\u2019t like who I am when I am with you. When the only time we truly connect is when we have sex. And that\u2019s great but I want connection everywhere. Everywhere. When the most you can give me is less than what I need. After you\u2019ve clearly stated that you cannot love me. (I understand.)
