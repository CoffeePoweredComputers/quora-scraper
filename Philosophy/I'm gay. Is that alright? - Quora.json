            "answer_text": "You ask a very old, and worn-out question. Imagine, if you will, an alternative world, where being gay was the norm, and being straight was different. There is one big difference in this alternate world, people who are straight are accepted for who they are. It\u2019s ok to be straight and to find and hang out with other straight friends, openly. Where you have just as many rights privileges as anyone else does. However, that world does not exist, we have this one, where being gay is judged to be wrong, that gay people are sick, and to show affection towards one another is disgusting. In this world, where being gay is a death sentence, and it once was here in America. If not death, then imprisonment, or locked up as having a mental condition. No one sane would ever be drawn to their same gender. Yet, you look back in history, long before it was deemed to be \u201cunnatural,\u201d it was normal. So, you tell me, \u201cIs it okay to be gay?\u201d \u201cIs it okay to be straight?\u201d That\u2019s like asking if it is okay to be whatever skin color you are, or nationality, ethnicity, and this list can go on and on, to where it becomes rather redundant, and a royal pain in the ass to keep hearing it or reading it. There is nothing wrong with being gay. I buried being who I am for most of my life because society said I was sick. Religions said I was going to burn in hell for being who I am. I am now openly gay, and I do not have to hide anymore. I do not have to pretend to be someone that I am not, or ever really was. I AM NOT STRAIGHT, and I will never pretend to be that way again. I am OKAY, and so is everyone else who is gay, or better yet, LGBTQ+. We are who we are, Don\u2019t try to change us into how you think we should be. If I just broke the Be nice/Be respectful rule, so be it. I stand by it because I am not afraid to fight back, not anymore. Blessed Be. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer your question of whether it is okay to be gay. I\u2019ll ask some questions of my own first, though\u2026 Is it okay for the Sun to come up? Is it okay for the wind to blow? Is it okay for water to flow, smoke to rise up, light to reflect? Will we accept reality for what it is? Or perhaps will we close our eyes tightly, put our hands over our ears, stand astride the road of Time and shout at the universe: NOOOOO!!!!! Rejecting reality, not accepting the universe is like trying to head butt an oncoming jet airliner. You\u2019ll lose and it will be a mess. Homosexuality just is. It is a correct description of how some people are apparently wired. The way they fall in love, find others attractive and so on\u2026 points them to other people of the same sex. That exists. It is real, regardless of if I like it or not. You might disapprove but you might also disapprove of sunsets. For all I know you can force your children to look at the floor all the time and blindfold them at certain times but that Sun is still there. And. it. will. set. Yes, being gay is okay. If that is what you are then that is what you are. ",
