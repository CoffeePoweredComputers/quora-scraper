Have your affinity for yourself first then for other\u2019s and if you feel living life is useless without affinity of anyone then you are on wrong path.A great need to your self affinity worth then expect from others and still you feel you are not recieving that affinity then something missing you not in other\u2019s. Our thinkings and deedsare reflections we see in others its may seem to be a just quote but its truth and true fact. so make your self so self- loved ,full of acceptance that you don\u2019t need to ask for affinity people give you a lot without even asking.
