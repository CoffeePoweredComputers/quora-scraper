            "answer_text": "I think not but then again, I think time is a mental construct and not a property of the real world of vibrating energy. We mobile perceivers observe motion which induces a certain feeling we call time. Entropy is defined in terms of closed, isolated systems, and the closest example to such a condition is the universe which cannot have entropy because it has no time, it exists in a permanent Now. That doesn\u2019t mean that space is static, on the contrary space moves continuously although not inflationary motion as is commonly thought these days. Space is completely curved in on itself (inherent curvature, not induced) and undergoes a continuous rolling action: link to an incomplete YouTube video which attempts to use Riemannian geometry to represent a more correct view of space and how it is shaped, how it moves, which is a better explanation than big bang.

            "answer_text": "I think you need to be more specific, but basically I think what you're saying is, does spacetime have an entropy? In Loop Quantum Gravity it certainly does and the entropy corresponds to the large ensemble of microscopic degrees of freedom, in the form of spinfoams, that describe quantum mechanically quantised spacetime. The veracity of this approach is of course very much open. ",
