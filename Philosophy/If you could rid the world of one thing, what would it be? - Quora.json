            "answer_text": "Organized religion. I\u2019m not talking about \u2018erasing\u2019 god here, or even erasing the concept of a divine being. But I\u2019d get rid of these brand-name corporations that take wealth from the poor and pay no taxes while inciting every kind of social controversy and prejudice, spreading war and terrorism across the globe in the process. I have no idea how many \u2018recognized\u2019 religions there are currently, but let\u2019s just consider the 3 name-brands for a moment. Three clubs whose executive members all claim to have exclusive knowledge of the true nature, behavior, and will of the divine being who created all things. Ask them for objective evidence to support their claim that would stand up in a court of law, and what will you get? You\u2019ll either be denounced as a blasphemer deserving of eternal torture or you\u2019ll get a lecture on \u2018faith\u2019. Or you could be summarily executed if you ask the wrong member of the club. Of course, that\u2019s after they show you their book of holy words written by ancient people who are supposed to have been under the direct supervision of the divine being. Not the other brand\u2019s divine being, but their brand of divine being. Can you imagine a greater form of arrogance or self-righteousness? Bet you can\u2019t. And this is despite the fact that each club is completely aware of the other major clubs making the same claim, and despite their awareness of the hundreds of religions that have passed through human civilization since we started leaving cave paintings and stone monoliths for archaeologists to find. And the biggest \u2018despite\u2019 of all is the existence of all the conflicting variations within each name-brand. Are you orthodox or reformed, protestant or catholic, Sunni or Shiite? And which club of reformed do you belong to, which brand of Sunni? Are you baptist or southern baptist, or are you methodist (dancing baptist)? It matters, you know. It matters so much that if you\u2019re a member of the wrong subset of your club you could wake up with a bomb in your underwear or find yourself disinvited to the hereafter, which will naturally result in being tormented by demons for all eternity. And all for having the nerve to hang around with the wrong sub-brand of the right name-brand. And why all these different name-brands and sub-brands and sub- sub-brands? Because there\u2019s no objective support for any of them, just like there\u2019s no objective support for Druidism or sun-worship. And yet, these name-brand corporations and their sub-divisions are allowed to insert their beliefs into the lives of every living soul on the planet in some form or another. They build castles and buy private jets for their corporate executives from money they take from the poor by threatening them with eternal damnation if they don\u2019t do and think exactly as they\u2019re told. Or they start wars or spread terrorism, again using the poor and mentally ill to carry their name-brand hate to distant places. They manipulate our elected officials who are supposed to provide service to all their constituents, not just the ones who voted for them or those who support the same name-brand of faith. They\u2019re allowed to do all this while paying no taxes and receiving no oversight, and all on the basis of claims with no justification whatsoever. Yeah, get rid of the name-brands and let people find the divine for themselves, as long as they do it without hurting anyone else. The ones that can\u2019t manage that you throw in the loony-bin with all the other messiah-complex nutjars\u2026 ",
