            "answer_text": "First for your question. Uploading into a computer may be possible. However it\u2019s more like copy & paste. Like how uploading torrent works. There will be copies of the original. You can still delete the originals and it doesn\u2019t affect the copies. Which means to say, this computer now behave totally like you. Have all memories and characteristic of you, even having behavior such as eating your own booger, it\u2019s not really you you. Suppose you get revived for any reason, now you have a computer that thinks he\u2019s you, he may even remembered getting transferred over. While you can also be transferred over like pouring a cup of water to another cup. This is very tough as you need to suck out the conscious of one being first, before we can transfer it over to another medium we are not even remotely anywhere close to this. Could death cease to exist? Realistically speaking, no. If you put away religion, death most definitely will occur. Immortals can still be killed, they just they don\u2019t age away but falling into a volcano will still kill them. Even if you put your conscious into a computer, it can still be infected with virus. The whole internet and hardware can experience a super ultimate explosive solar storm and burn up all electronic devices. So it may still occur regardless of technology, except the chance of it happening get reduced exponentially. Now, the more realistic path we will take for \u201cimmortality\u201d would be nano technology. This would be more likely. For realistic level of technology, they will be able to do repairs in your body, reinforcing your body and any unwanted stuff can be removed from your body at the early stage of nanotech. When we are old, we will All these isn\u2019t easy, but in my opinion a more likely path. If our technology is insanely high, nano bot would effectively render you immortal. Everything is build up with electrons & protons, they could forcefully reassemble your waste material into your blood cells etc. I\u2019m just unsure how many big bangs it may cause doing so. if you get my joke ",

            "answer_text": "Well in my opinion, you never truly die. I believe we are all made up of energy. Everything you know of in this world and beyond is created by energy and energy is never created nor destroyed but conserved and transferred. When you die, you just experience life from a different perspective but I don\u2019t think you completely cease to exist. In the future I think something will happen to make humans more aware about the process of dying and what it actually means to die and realize there is no you that exists as an individual and we would be able to transcend our normal pattern of thought and accomplish unbelievable things. Immortality is a mindset not a far fetched phenomenon. ",
