            "answer_text": "The answer depends entirely on how one defines consciousness. Materialists would define consciousness to mean something that happens in a material brain, which they would view as part of a biological machine. For them, the answer is clearly yes, by definition.  For many people, though, consciousnessmeans something more than merely some byproduct of biological brain matter. For them, there is at least an aspect of consciousness that is not reducible to an activity of matter. Philosopher David Chalmers, for example, defends this view and argues that it implies a division between \"easy problems\" of consciousness that pertain to explaining how the brain functions and the \"hard problem\" that pertains to explaining how a physical brain can give rise to subjective awareness. See What is the hard problem of consciousness? I don\u2019t understand what he says, or feel what Chalmers feels. ",

To describe it \"as no more than an accidental byproduct\" sounds a little derogatory, when it is a wondrous phenomenon.  See my answer to What is the evolutionary reason for having consciousness? ",
