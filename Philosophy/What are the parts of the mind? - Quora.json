            "answer_text": "The question contains assumptions that we should imagine are incorrect. The assumptions comprise a frame error, by which I mean we have associated a referent (the mind) with the idea that it is an object. But it gets worse, because we have also rendered this object not in the likeness of organisms (which are not made of anything specific), but machines, which are purposely assembled from materials and processes for functions\u2014by human beings (with minds). So, firstly, living beings do not have parts. This is a convenience of language that deludes us into misframing identity at the root. Consider a word. A word is not originally comprised of parts until we acquire the capacity to write them. Once we have a representational framework we can then invent a sequence of parts that we can learn to associate with the word. But, orginally, words are not experienced as having parts. They are song-like unities. Only later, once writing or linguistic analysis is introduced, to \u2018parts\u2019 seem to be intrinsic to words. The brain does not exist separate from the body, the history of life on Earth, or the universe. There is nothing like \u2018a separate brain\u2019 any more than there is something like a separate heart. Or a separate hand. Except in language. This creates an illusion that \u2018the brain\u2019 is \u2018a part\u2019 of the body and that \u2018this is the thinking part\u2019. Well, no body? No brain. No thinking. So it cannot all be in the portion. There are a lot of things we think of in the wrong frame, a frame that is like machines or objects \u2018with parts\u2019 or \u2018that are made of something\u2019. But a mind is not this species of referent at all. The mind is not an object or substance. Consider the following questions: what is a wave made of? What is a question made of? What are dreams made of? What is an idea made of? These are not substances, and are thus not \u2018made of\u2019 anything, the are slightly more properly understood as processes. But when we ask of the mind we are asking of something almost impossible to know... as it is the mind with which we form and recognize and organize, compare and consider classes of phenomenon. So this question is of an exceptionally peculiar order. We must ask something more like what is the nature of the mind, and then have ways to pursue such a momentous question... or invent them. Neuroscience is not the answer to this question, and is effectively an array of methods for mechanically naming and analyzing biorelational elements and processes. But it cannot tell us what a mind is or is not. Or even \u2018where\u2019 it may be. It certainly cannot tell us what the mind \u2018is made of\u2019. No one \u2018knows\u2019 what a mind is precisely, any more than we know what meaning \u2018is\u2019 abstract from some specific situation or experience. No one knows \u2018what\u2019 a thought or dream is. In fact, when you get right down to it, we have a lot of language that implies we know things that we know next to nothing about. The Sun. Time. Light. Birth. Death. Eyes. Hands. It is a simple matter to invent words and pretend this is equivalent to understanding; but it can become a deceptive habit that acquires compelling momentum any time we decide to take the token for that to which it refers. In every case, that referent will be infinitely profound and inexhaustibly rich. This is and must be true of the mind, whatever \u2018it\u2019 may \u2018be\u2019. So the mind is a phenomenon that lies far beyond the grasp of mechanical explanations or models, for these comprise but the tiniest portion of its own activity and expression. And each mind and moment of mind is unique, to at least the same degree it is similar enough for us to recognize and call it something. A mind is \u2018made\u2019 not of something, so much, as it is informed by experiences, relations and developmental processes. It is not possessed, nor can it be entirely local to a single person. Like the reflection on the surface of a body of water ... endless domains of relation and process are involved, even if the \u2018brain\u2019 is a bit like the body of water in which \u2018this is all being reflected, recognized, related with\u2019... and so on, it is never merely the brain from which the mind draws its sources and with which it is expressed, or transformed. The mind is made of the entire history of everything, and is alive, and unlike machines and ideas of objects. It is a way of riding something that apparently conserves changeable facets of recognition and relation in schemas we can constellate and reforge... but it is nothing like a mere system or \u2018epiphenomenon of the brain\u2019 anymore than life on Earth is \u2018a mere epiphenomenon of the Sun\u2019. So to ask what the mind is comprised of we must move beyond objects and nouns into processes and relationships, and away from \u2018local possession\u2019 as of an object to participation in relations local to time, and also nearly universal in time and location.  The mind is made, then, of relationships and experiences of them. The body and the brain may mediate this, but they are not, and cannot be its local sources. ",

            "answer_text": "Explore this using your own intuition. Do not trust anybody else\u2019s answer on this one. Let us do some exploration together using our most simple faculty called as intelligence. All humans know that they have thoughts. Thought must logically arise from memory. Thought may be looked upon as the recall function of memory. So thought and memory are one and the same. Memory is a huge information bank. The building blocks of memory are habits. Long standing habits become character or personality. All our thoughts are primarily influenced by this habit patterns besides of course the environment. This memory is conceptually called as the mind in common parlance, otherwise there is no such thing called as the mind much less subconscious or the unconscious mind. No human being has ever directly perceived anything called as the mind. Consciousness perceives this thought/memory and so it is an object much like any other object that is perceived by consciousness. Perceptions = Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling and thinking. The first five are called as sensations since these are associated with specific sense organs and the objects of sensation. Thought however is beyond the five senses and yet consciousness can perceive it. Perception of thought is ESP. Dream world consists of time, space and a colorful universe and it is made of thought/memory and consciousness can perceive this dream world without using any of the five senses. Again this is ESP. This shows that thought/memory is subtler than the sub atomic particles which are within the domain of the five senses when clustered together. Consciousness must be subtler than thought/memory since it can perceive it. Consciousness is the subtlest reality known. Thought/memory is outside of the brain and the body mechanism. The habit patterns also called as the mind is much like the physical body but it is invisible and so it is a mental body that is incomprehensible to the human who is constrained by the five senses alone. Any human can develop his ESP and be able to discern the mental body since just plain thought/memory is perceived in an extra sensory way by all humans anyway. This mental body survives the physical body at the time of death and latches on to a new body to express itself and this relay race is endless. ",
