Usually, this involves explicating the meaning of an utterance using a set-theoretic model which represents some or all of the world, and describing its arrangement such that a sentence evaluates to 1. E.g. \u201cJohn is a smoker\u201d is true if and only if the individual John is a member of the set of people who habitually smoke in the evaluation world.
