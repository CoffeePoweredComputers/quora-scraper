            "answer_text": "See the book Fallacies, by the philosopher Charles Hamblin, published in about 1971. Hamblin tries to move beyond an enumeration of Fallacies, typically presented with no clear theories about why fallacies fail. His approach is to formalize what he calls \u2018information seeking dialogues\u2019. Within this framework he can model the ways various sorts of fallacies appear. It's all quite technical and not suited to people who just want to understand how many common arguments used in political arguments etc are fallacious. For that, the best thing is to take some course called Informal Logic at a community college or night school or university. A good teacher of one of those courses can really make the subject valuable. ",

This is wrong because you can imagine a scenario where most People like something, but it does not make it right. Appeal to nature: It happens in nature so therefor it is okay. This is wrong since the People who use it Cherry pick certain parts about nature, but does no hold all nature as their moral standard anyway. Every bad thing happens in nature so that is not a good example to follow. Ad hominem: You are depressed so therefor you are wrong. People are not their arguments and arguments are not their People. Appeal to Law: It is the Law so therefor it is right. strawman: Misrepresenting the argument. Thats what i get the most. ",
