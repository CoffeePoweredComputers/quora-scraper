            "answer_text": "In holographic display / holographic 3D images, we have algorithms for calculating image holograms. These algorithms sometimes are called holographic images algorithms, or holography/hologram/holographic algorithms. So, \u201cholographic\u201d here means its application part, not its contents. To me, I prefer to call it holographic imgae algorithm, or algorithm for calculating image holograms. These two make sense literally while other are too simplized to somehow mislead. \u2014 Maybe one day there will be an algorithm, which somehow uses techniques related to holography, but its application is not for holography. Under this circumstance, it makes sense to literally call it holographic algorithm. As far as I know, there is no such an algorithm yet. ",
