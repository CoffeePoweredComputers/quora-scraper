            "answer_text": "Regina isn\u2019t a sociopath or a malignant narcissist as some believe. She is simply very VERY angry. Her home life isn\u2019t nearly as perfect as it seems, she is always on a diet and is very concerned with her looks, her \u201cfriends\u201d are never honest with her, no one ever sees her as a human being and she is extremely intelligent with nothing to stimulate it with apart from her Machiavellian schemes. The point of the film is that The plastics are just three of MANY mean girls and it comes from their inability to express their anger in a healthy way. This is Regina\u2019s problem, mental illness has nothing to do with it. ",
