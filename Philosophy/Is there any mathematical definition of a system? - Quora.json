            "answer_text": "Absolutely. In fact, algebra in it\u2019s most general sense is the study of structure and systems. Algebraic expressions, matrices (system of equations), tensors, equations, etc are mathematical tools that we use to describe pieces, mechanics, and sometimes entire configurations of systems. A formal definition of a dynamical system: A dynamical system is formally defined as a state space [math]X[/math], a set of times [math]T[/math], and a rule [math]R[/math] that specifies how the state evolves with time. The rule R is a function whose domain is [math]X\u00d7T[/math] and whose codomain is [math]X[/math], i.e., [math]R:X\u00d7T\u2192X[/math]. The rule function [math]R[/math] means that the [math]R[/math] takes two inputs, [math]R=R(x,t)[/math], where [math]x\u2208X[/math] is the initial state (at time [math]t=0[/math], for example) and [math]t\u2208T[/math] is a future time. In other words, [math]R(x,t)[/math] gives the state at time [math]t[/math] given that the initial state was [math]x[/math]. Also, a state space is just the set of all possible configurations that the system can be in. Here is an example of a pretty famous system from which the Lorenz Attractor comes from: Lorenz system - Wikipedia  Systems are prolific throughout the universe even on very practical levels such as biology and economics.

            "answer_text": "Prolly. If you suppose that various theorms depend on a set of axioms, then these might constitute a system. Mathematics is two-leveled. One level is the underlying number systems and geometries, and the upper level is something to do with how rules are formulated, and what prejudices are taken in. For example, it is commonly believed among mathematicians that it is possible to reduce a line to points, and that the points of the line correspond to some alpha-set. Those brought up on the uncrossable void hold that points can be named, and that the line always contain unreachable locations: a point is the intersection of two lines, or three planes, or four hyperplanes.
