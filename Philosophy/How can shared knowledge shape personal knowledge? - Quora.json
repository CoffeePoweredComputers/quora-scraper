            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what shared knowledge is. (And maybe the definition of personal knowledge might be different to what I think it might be) It seems that shared knowledge is shared personal knowledge. If you acquire new knowledge, it gets integrated with what you already know (well, it often does, but there are quite some psychological defense mechanisms that allow you to reject or neglect new information, especially if you don\u2019t want to change your mind).

            "answer_text": "This is social knowledge also called cultural belief. The shaping comes in the form of conditioning or brainwashing. As a child I was told many things that did not sit right with my thinking, such as the moon spun around as the earth does. Or the earth spins at 1000 k\u2019s per hour, or is that miles per hour, either way I never believed it. You find that the human that knows or thinks differently to the rest of the clan is called a black sheep? ",
