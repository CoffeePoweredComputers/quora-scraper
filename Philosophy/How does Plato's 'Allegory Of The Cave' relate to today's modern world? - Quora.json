            "answer_text": "Uhhh what a wonderful question, I was just thinking about that yesterday. I feel this allegory will be \u201ccurrent\u201d or up to date for a long time, as it reflects the idea of the spiritual or philosophical seeker, who after achieving a \u201cfree mind\u201d returns to society and is confronted with society's worldviews. A society that is based on group thinking always has a more limited perception, compared to someone, who has been out of the perception this group of people shares. This is due to the difference in experience. Within a society, there is a limited set of experiences and explanations, whereas when you travel and meditate you gain new insights into new forms of thinking etc. explaining this to others who didn't have the same type of experiences is always a challenge, as certain changes in the mind, can only happen due to experience and not by listening or explanations. hope this helps, all the best!

            "answer_text": "Simple. The cave allegory Is how Plato described illusion from reality. The allegory of the cave from Plato\u2019s point of view is that we humans then and present, are actually experiencing a \u2018 shadow of a shadow of reality\u2019. Today , we experience the same illusion mistaken for reality or in other words, the \u2018Truth\u2019. \u201c You shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free\u201d. I can only point the way to the Truth, the way Socrates expresses it, \u201c Know Thyself\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "The Allegory of the cave relates to today the same as it did 100 years ago. This will never change. Man fights, fears, hates and even loves that which he perceives as (or in ) the world, instead of realizing that the world is reflecting back to him his own belief in duality. In order to change what he sees he must step out of the \u201ccave/mind\u201d. ",
