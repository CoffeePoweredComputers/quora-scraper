            "answer_text": "There are a couple of popular inaccuracies upon which I think this question is based. Cultural relativism implies moral relativismMoral relativism makes morality meaningless either becauseit prevents groups or individuals from passing moral judgement on each otheror it is the belief that morality is whatever people think it is, according to personal preference or conscienceLet me start with the first fallacy. Cultural relativism isn\u2019t a moral framework. Cultural relativism is a tool that was developed within anthropology for the purposes of better understanding cultures in as objective and unbiased way as possible. Cultural relativism doesn\u2019t tell people how to behave in their everyday lives, it tells anthropologists how to think and behave as social scientists in order to better eliminate cultural bias and assumptions from their observations and analysis.a & b. There are several forms of moral relativism. One form, called \u2018normative ethical relativism\u2019 does indeed stipulate some sort of \u2018duty\u2019 to avoid judging other cultures in terms of one\u2019s own culture. This is indeed a a problematic view, since judging others is part of what morality is about. And where do we draw the line between \u2018own culture\u2019 and \u2018other culture? It also leads to a paradox - should the relativism apply to relativism itself? On the other hand, there are forms of relativism eg. descriptivist ethical relativism and metaethical relativism - which don\u2019t have such problems. They merely describe how morality functions. The key here is that they are not itself moral systems - they don\u2019t tell us what to do - they merely describe how morality functions and the limits of moral justification. These are metaethical theories.The answer to whether an action or moral statement is right or not, depends who\u2019s asking. What is right to a Buddhist monk may be different from a Catholic priest, a Wall Street trader, a member of the SS or a gangster. That seems trivially true. But your next question is probably \u2018who is correct?\u2019 And this is the habitual question of all moral objectivists and ex-objectivists. The answer is that none of them are objectively correct. And yet - each of them is correct, relative to their own value system. They may be incorrect from the point of view of other value systems.Without context, moral statements are not facts about the world like the atomic weight of hydrogen or the size of the sun. They are part of us as humans. But they aren\u2019t merely private, subjective opinions either. They are inter-subjective, based on the shared value systems of culture and ideology.",

            "answer_text": "How does cultural relativism promote moral relativism? When two or more people live in the same area they have to adopt some rules about who does what to whom. Any such rule is called a mor\u00e9, French accented e pronounced \"mor-ay\". The adjective form is moral, and the habit of following mor\u00e9s is morality. Mor\u00e9s are arbitrary: they do not have to be right, only accepted. Another group on the other side of the river might have very different mor\u00e9s. A collection of mor\u00e9s defines a culture. All morality is relative. ",

            "answer_text": "People think that Good and Evil is relative but it is really not. Generally speaking, good is define as things that are beneficial and evil is define as things that are harmful. The reason why good and evil seems relative to people is because people define harm and benefit very differently. For example, in Christianity, it is believed that those who commit suicide is deny passage to heaven. Which is why they believe that it is morally wrong for people to kill themselves. In the Samurai Culture, however, it is believed that shame is worst than death. Which is why they believe that it is morally right to kill yourself than to live in shame. To simply put it, moral isn\u2019t what is actually good and evil. Moral is simply what people think is good and evil. ",
