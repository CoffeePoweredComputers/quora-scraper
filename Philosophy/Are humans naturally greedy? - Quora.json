            "answer_text": "To find out what behavior comes \"naturally\", look at very young children whose parents have not quite yet civilized them.  Even among that group however there will not be a typical behavior.  Some of the little ones appear greedy, grabbing the other child's toy.  Or, is it simply curiosity?  As they get older, certain undesirable behavior becomes noticed more in one child than another.  I knew a little girl who was the youngest child to parents then middle aged.  They had more money by then and thus gave this child lots of toys and games.  When this little one had her little neice visit, she appeared very greedy and would not share her toys with the visitor.  But then, that could have been motivated by jealousy because now her mother was paying equal, if not more, attention to the little niece who was after all her granddaughter. Fast forward to adults.  Some are greedy and others generous.  Often the greed stems from fear of loss, or from the pain of a deprived childhood. It's a kind of survival mechanism.  Others, who have been treated generously combined with being rewarded as children for their own good behavior regarding generosity grow up \"naturally\" generous. The next category of greedy adults are those who are selfish for whatever reasons.    Most people are selfish (although may hide it well) unless love becomes the greater factor in their lives.  I am not speaking of just eros love, but also philos and agape love.  Even with love operating in their lives, they find that selfishness rears its ugly head a little too often for their refined spirits, so the old sin nature is not entirely gone, just modified by the altruistic intention that they have acquired, whether it be from loving training or a religious conversion. So back to the question, Are Humans Naturally Greedy, my answer is No to the greed, but to Selfishness, I would say Yes. ",

Children and naturally charitable, can play together in peace, don't eat more than they can handle, and although they want toys, they can be pretty satisfied with an empty box plating with it for hours on end. The problem starts when they notice their circumstances, and they become envious of others. First their integrity goes: they feel no remorse: keeping stuff left behind by others, claiming it as their own, then their greet goes into a stage that nothing is enough anymore. They want everything for themselves, for one reason: so others won't have any! They hate seeing others being happy, enjoying life, so they try to take that away from them. That's the really sick part. That's when the way they see the world changes.  They never stop that cycle, it actually increases, and a little greed grows into a monster greed. They acquire various new vices along the way: lying, stealing, pretending, snooping, cheating, deceiving.  As adults they are the parasites of society: living off of others in small and large ways. If they can by any means get something for nothing, they'll go at it wholeheartedly. They never give you anything free of ulterior motives, there is always a large pay off for them in any giving action. The larger the \"gift\", the more they can claim you as their \"property\", and you'll be constantly reminded of their \"generosity\".  Greedy people have: no integrity in the workplaceno genuine love for anyone except themselvesno people around them who can be called genuine friendTheir greedy personality is as transparent as a slice of prosciutto, and they are disliked by everyone they meet.

If we found something useful we took it and we kept it for ourselves. The ones who were best at this and got the best things not only survived, but flourished. The ones who didn\u2019t\u2026 Not so much\u2026. being greedy and not being satisfied is genetically encoded in us because of our survival mechanism. We don\u2019t need to gather and hoard stuff now. But we still do it. greedy is the bad part of this in my opinion. But never being satisfied is a good trait in my opinion. If you\u2019re never satisfied, you always strive to be a better version of you. You need to do better at life in general and you will tend to accomplish great things. The only time it will be harmful is if your drive to be better exceeds your ability to achieve. Then, that turns into disappointment. If you go to Hollywood with the intent to be a mega superstar in less than a year, expect to be disappointed severely. People who do that is very, very rare. However, if your expectation is to do that within ten years, you\u2019re far more likely to achieve that goal. And that goes for everything you set your mind to do. You can be ok in this world if you\u2019re a little greedy and never satisfied as long as you keep your goals realistic in anything you do. ",

            "answer_text": "100% No. I want more virtue in my life\u2026..I want to helps others to love and increase in virtue, too. Am I greedy? Both the words \u201cwant\u201d and \u201cgreed\u201d and potentially pejorative but that is only true if we approach those words with a pejorative attitude (which is never a good thing). So I say, \u201cSkip all the (hate and condemnation based) pejorative BS\u201d and rephrase the question: Is all wanting more \u201cperverse\u201d? Or the opposite: Can wanting more be virtuous? I think the rephrasing I did here almost answers the question. A mother is desparate to feed her hungry children and works day and night to do so\u2026..she wants more, obviously. Is she greedy? Why not just sit at home (in harmony with the universe\u2026ha ha) and suffer with her children and see what the results will be? You must be kidding me!! I use the example above so that most people will \u201cget the point\u201d. But the same pattern can be extrapolated all the way to major corporations like Apple, Microsoft, Exxon and General Motors. Greed is solely in the heart of each of us including you and me. If you think not, you are either naive or a deceiver. Greed is wanting more at the expense of other people. Only individuals can \u201cbe greedy\u201d and if there is no intent to harm others, there is no greed. Greed is not me thinking you are greedy. In fact, if I do that, I am the one with perverse intentions: condemning you. So it\u2019s best for me to look in the mirror and see who I really am. A condemner of others or a beautiful display of virtue so that the display draws others to become virtuous themselves, not condemners of others. All condemning is a form of a \u201ctell\u201d (like in poker) where the one condemning is desparate to hide their inner neediness/perversion. So like after eating some bad food, we puke it out of us (even upon others). So it is with condemnation\u2026.we puke out our inner condemning spirit (as it eats at us) and try to get it out of us. And almost always, the specific topic we are using condemnation on, is the darkness that is eating us inside as well. A pastor once told me that the best sermons are the ones the pastor themselves needed to hear. It\u2019s the best because they were so motivated by their own neediness on that topic, to really \u201cpreach it\u201d (trying to puke it out?). But Yes, wanting more and more can be highly virtuous or highly perverse. And the wanting action itself, is only a \u201ctell\u201d for the virtue or perversity that\u2019s motivating that individual from within. We call the perverse intention of wanting greed but enormous virtuous good has and continues to occur via that same wanting more and more. For sure, Jesus wanted more and more (of what he wanted), enough so he was willing to die for more of it. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, blaming greed is a much bigger problem than greed itself. It looks more like we are naturally (=hard to change without significant intervention) ignorant, and tend to delegate important tasks too easily. In other words, we refuse reasoning, questioning, knowing, taking responsibility, and learning. These are all things that may require us to change a belief or even a value that we have treasured for long. This is can be painful. Hence we fear and avoid such things. Deliberate ignorance and delegation of important decision making create problematic symptoms. One such symptom is the trouble-causing type of greed. A related and even more problematic and influential symptom is that we tolerate risky second-rate socio-economic power structures like an indirect/representative democracy and central banking, even on a large scale. Also, the fear of losing our comfy ignorance makes us believe that we, of all species\u2019 on earth, are the only one that needs to be ruled by a few on top of a massive power pyramid. It is so much comfier to distract our awareness by playing ignorant and only look right and left, i.e. whether trade is organized centrally or freely. That way we rarely need to do anything too uncomfortable or risky. We also will not see the far reaching consequences due to loss of personal freedom and privacy, which larger ignorant societies have always been developing into, both on the left and right. Blaming greed, and implying it is an unchangeable human trait, is one of the great comfortable benefits of ignorance: We can feel good doing nothing because nothing can be done. [Good luck explaining this to your teacher :)] Blaming ignorance suggests that there may be a way out, by informing people and giving them the chance to practice inquisitive thinking. But this means effort, discomfort, and lots of trouble in the short (and possibly long) term. Few are ready for that but the numbers are rising. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that one of our surviving traits that led our society to where it is now is greed. Just like if you are patient then it is likely you are patient because you\u2019re stubborn; qualities we inherit instincts for are always in pairs. One of the pair is a good thing, or a positive and is considered a gain or increase in your chances of being successful in life, in love, or in the eyes of society. The other side of the coin is the negative aspect. If you look for it you\u2019ll find it. It\u2019s always there. Greed is a negatively viewed quality these days of p.c. driven expectations of people. If you look for the positive of greed you might find something like being prepared, or providing for your own. Is a squirrel who picks up more than his share of pecans only to bury them in a flower bed and virtually keep them from other foragers greedy? Or is he just being practical since he knows if he doesn\u2019t hide them a blue jay will come along and nab them? Hoarding is tied closely to greed. Most types of behavior like greed shouldn\u2019t be so quickly demonized. Greed is another word for capitalism. Our economy is surely based on greed. Those who have had bad luck, or been without while others excel and exceed their quotas are usually not trying to victimize you. They\u2019re simply trying to do for themselves. If people hurt others, or take from others, to take for themselves something they already have will need to answer for that to something or someone, someday. ",

            "answer_text": "Short Answer: Yes. All living things, including humans, have a powerful instinct for self preservation. Long Answer: It can not be denied that some people are more \u2018Greedy\u2019 than others. People act in a greedy way for different reasons. Of course there are the megalomaniacs and narcissist who are completely self-obsessed, just as there are the completely selfless martyrs. For every Andrew Carnegie there is a Mother Theresa. But those types are few and far between. Most of us only act greedy in response to our needs not being met. Abraham Maslow studied this phenomenon in great detail and created the Hierarchy of Human Needs.  When a person does not have enough food to survive, they will go to any length to fulfill that need. Physiological needs like the need to breath, eat food, wear clothing and find shelter must be fulfilled. Once they are met, we move onto the need for safety, then the need to be loved or to belong, then esteem needs and finally self-actualization. But people are only desperate and \u2018greedy\u2019 toward the bottom of the hierarchy, when their physiological needs, safety needs and the need to be loved are not met. A person who does not feel safe is deficiency motivated. They are desperate because something is missing. When these needs are met and they move toward the top of the hierarchy, they are not deficiency motivated, they are growth motivated. A growth motivated person can afford to be giving and generous without the fear of losing what little they have. That is why kindness is the ultimate demonstration of power. Only those who see themselves as powerful can afford to be kind. ",

In The UK bankers, financial people, business people, especially the food giants, which include a Lord, are very greedy people. They are making billions, not just millions. The bonuses they get at the public\u2019s expense is outrageous. The amount of Tax we pay is out of hand. Sales Tax 20%, Petrol (gas) is about \u00a36 (8$) a gallon, Cigarettes are nearly \u00a311 ($15) a packet of 20, Is that enough proof of greed??? The Government is killing us with stupid expenses claiming for things like a toilet seat and housing that they let out. Travel and lavish parties etc. is all out of hand. Even the Queen has to pay millions in taxes. So I would say that in the UK greed is rampant. Every one wants the latest phone at over \u00a3600 ($750 - 800) the biggest television they can buy, and the amount of cars on the road that cost virtually double of what they cost in Europe and the USA is unbelievable. BMW, Mercedes all around the \u00a345\u201369,000 mark ($65\u201385). Terrible prices we have to pay and the amount of people that do pay it is getting more and more. You can check out some of the prices by putting .uk after the name and you will get the prices of things in the UK. Then you make up your own mind if people are greedy. We have very large families that cannot go out to work as the benefits, which would be welfare in the States, is more than they can get working, and all these families have big vehicles, big T.Vs and all the Xbox and Other delightful games and film players you can imagine. Greed is what makes this Country go round, otherwise, if people refused to pay the high prices, there would be a lot of foreign companies pulling out of the UK. Even the Chinese have over $3 trillion gold reserves. So I do not think it makes any difference if you have communism, as it works on paper, but not in action, they are still taking the guts out of the other countries. It is a war without any guns, bombs etc. It is a war of who is the richest. And if that is NOT greed, then tell me what is, Please\u2026. ",

All organisms could be called \u201cself-interested\u201d in that their main goal is the survival of themselves, even if that means dying so your offspring can live on as is the case with some species. Greed is an evolved form of this self-interest and evolves differently, if at all, according to the physical and social environment in which the organism is a part of. If we define greed as the accumulation of life sustaining things which goes beyond the minimum requirements for the organism to live and propagate then we may have an easier time rationalizing the nature of greed. The person who is TOO greedy often becomes a negative figure in culture. Therefore it is in people\u2019s best interest to be both greedy AND altruistic (even altruism just for show, like a politician reading children stories to students when the cameras are rolling). Greed exists as both a concept and a practice in society but it exists alongside other concepts and practices like sharing which is just as ubiquitous. It is human nature to be greedy, sometimes. ",

When someone hasn't eaten for a while or dramatically decreases in their caloric intake, their body goes into starvation mode and it hoards fat like your life depends on it. A lot of people with poverty mentality does the same with money and stuff... That's what brings them security. Humans are also prone to addiction and compulsion. Hoarding is definitely a part of that. Greedy is a type of compulsion that stems from insecurity somewhere where they don't trust they will be taken care of. ",

They could now give their prejudice a pseudo-scientific appearance by claiming that scientists were in the process of discovering genes for such behaviour traits as aggression, selfishness and domination that would make socialism impossible. If our social arrangements were determined by our biology then there would never have been the great diversity of behaviour patterns, relationships and culture that is the real story of our past and which is evident even in the way we live now. The argument that our behaviour is determined by our physical inheritance may pose as science but in reality it is a socially determined prejudice used as part of crude political ideology.

            "answer_text": " Give Up On Your Fears \u201cWhere fear is, happiness is not.\u201d \u2014 Lucius Annaeus Seneca Fear has the ability to take control of your life. It keeps you from doing things that could kill you. It also prevents you from doing things that make you successful. We can all have fears. Some of us have a fear of snakes. Some of us have a fear of heights. I, for one, have a fear of needles. Some of us even have a fear of happiness. It\u2019s true, it\u2019s actually a real fear and it\u2019s called chemophobia. \u201cAversion to happiness, also called cherophobia or fear of happiness, is an attitude towards happiness in which individuals may deliberately avoid experiences that invoke positive emotions or happiness.\u201d \u2014 Wikipedia There are four major reasons why cherophobes fear happiness: They fear that being happy will cause bad things to happen to them They fear that happiness will make them a worse person They fear that expressing happiness is bad for them and others They fear that pursuing happiness is bad for them and others \u201cSome people \u2014 in Western and Eastern cultures \u2014 are wary of happiness because they believe that bad things, such as unhappiness, suffering, and death, tend to happen to happy people.\u201d Wikipedia Unfortunately, fear and happiness can\u2019t exist at the same time. So, fear becomes a problem if it is keeping you from being happy. To overcome the cherophobia, you need to start by taking small steps to reduce your fear. Let yourself feel happy when you have accomplished a difficult task. Learn to enjoy a beautiful sunrise or sunset. Enjoy being present with your friends and family. Once you start being happy with the little things in life, you will see that you have nothing to fear, and you will allow yourself more happiness. Only then will you be able to break the power of fear in your life and begin to live a happier life. Give Up On Your Negative Self-talk \u201cPositive thinking and negative thinking cannot operate at the same level in your mind, one needs to be the master and the one you feed it more will rule over the other.\u201d \u2015 Oscar Bimpong I am my own worst critic. I have a constant conversation going on in my head telling me that, \u201cI will never be successful.\u201d When I forget things it tells me that, \u201cI am such an idiot.\u201d Lately, it has been telling me that, \u201cI suck at writing\u201d (this one might actually be true). Negative self-talk leads to poor self-confidence, low self-esteem, and a bad attitude. Some of the most common forms of negative self-talk include: Filtering \u2014 when you increase the negative and decrease the positive things in your life. Personalizing \u2014 when you blame yourself for things that go wrong. Polarizing \u2014 when you only see things as black and white (this is my favorite). Catastrophizing \u2014 when you expect the worst in every situation. \u201cNever give a negative thought an inch or it will take a mile.\u201d \u2015 Matshona Dhliwayo Negative self-talk will never lead to happiness. If you want to be happy, you need to get rid of your negative self-talk. Pay attention to your negative self-talk and when you hear it\u2026. Stop! Change your thinking and turn your negative thought into a positive. Change\u2026 \u201cI will never be successful\u201d to \u201cI will find a way to make this work.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d to \u201cI can learn how to do this.\u201d \u201cThis is impossible\u201d to \u201cI will give it a try.\u201d You get the idea. You can change the way you talk about yourself. It will not happen overnight, and it may take some time, but you can do it. Learn to be kind, gentle, and encouraging to yourself. Start by not saying anything to yourself that you wouldn\u2019t say to your best friend. ",

Only when the consequences are personally immediately catastrophic are they likely to moderate greediness & exploitation - and even then, some members of the human species do not have the capacity to recognise said catastrophic consequences.

I.e.  third world poverty. The flip side is that the selfish market economy is solving poverty in the Third World it's a rapid rate. It's actually falling by 1% per annum. Just 10 years to go, and no one will be living in absolute poverty. That is not the outcome in the West where govt welfare is making people less prepared for life; more reliant on govt and absolute poverty is increasing because of drugs; whilst the costs of living are kept artificially high by govt.
