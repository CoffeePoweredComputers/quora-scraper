            "answer_text": "These our consciousness questions drive me crazy. Consciousness is a process. Consciousness is not a thing, but a process of inference \u2013 Karl Friston | Aeon Essays Consciousness is like a spotlight that focuses on something. Right now you are conscious of reading Quora. Five minutes from now you may be conscious of something else and soon you will be asleep\u2026unconscious. So, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know what consciousness is\u2026we know very clearly what it is and being able to shine that light on something is, for us, completely dependent upon the brain. Steve DeBerry's answer to If consciousness is energy, and energy can't be destroyed, will our consciousness live as a different form of energy after death? Does the music continue after you turn off the radio? Though, we know what consciousness is, we don\u2019t know why it exists or how it comes about\u2026how it works. Nor, do we know where else it exists but we\u2019re pretty sure our friends have it ( most of the time ) as well as our dogs or cats but when it comes to fruit flies, bacteria or plum trees we\u2019re not really sure. Right now, I favor those who say that science will never provide an answer. Steve DeBerry's answer to What exists, that does not in plants or other microscopic organisms, in our anatomy that gives us consciousness? I\u2019m also in favor of considering the idea that consciousness is more of a universal quality than we realize. Yet, there\u2019s no way to know for sure until we die. Steve DeBerry's answer to Does consciousness take place outside the human brain? But let's, be honest with ourselves and replace the word consciousness in these questions with the words Me or I. Then the question becomes do I die when I die or am I a type of energy that continues to exist? Who knows? Maybe. the pantheist approach ",

            "answer_text": "What do you mean by consciousness? the subjective experience we have of the world? our personality? our memories? a combination of those things? Then yes, consciousness is gone when we die, it\u2019s a property of the brain, a complex interplay between various structures within a very large neural network. If the network breaks, so do all the processes within it. \u201cenergy\u201d isn\u2019t much of a description here, it\u2019s just a different word to bypass the need to give a definition, it\u2019s not a definition in itself. The \u201cenergy\u201d in your brain is made up of gradients or phosphor groups, much like a compressed spring has \u201cenergy\u201d. It\u2019s not some kind of \u201cstuff\u201d wizzing around up there.  (this image is wrong on so many levels) There\u2019s no light pulses, no electricity, no \u201cenergy\u201d in that sense in your head to make you you. It\u2019s very much your brain, in your body, in your environment, with your past that makes you who you are. Once you die, all that is gone too, it breaks apart. It can be very difficult to accept, and most people don\u2019t want to accept it, which is fine. Everyone is entitled to believe what they want to believe, doesn\u2019t mean it corresponds to what\u2019s actually going on though. ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is infinite and immortal. It is the energy of life itself. It does not belong to you, you belong to It. Consider that. Consider the sea of consciousness or the Quantum Field. Everything is created from this. It is ultimately the only reality. This is what you are. The body you call yours will cease to function at some point. The mind you call yours will cease to function at some point. But the consciousness that you really are will continue as it always has and always will. Some who die experience a continued sense of individuality and personality. Some willingly dissolve into the Infinite Sea of Consciousness. But ultimately, individuality is an illusion. The answer to your question could go on and on and hundreds of books have been written about it. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross wrote a number of them. The best one is called, On Death and Dying. It is certainly a worthy field of study and worth the time and energy. You cannot die. It is impossible. Consciousness is infinite and immortal. Even now, today, you can identify as the mind and body you call yours or you can expand your awareness of who and what you are and identify as the Infinite sea of Awareness that you truly are. Your choice. Take care Jon  ",

            "answer_text": "The first problem, for those who believe that when we die then that is the end, is that science has shown that matter is not real. Einstein made this point when he said \u201cConcerning matter, we have been all wrong. What we have called matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses. There is no matter.\u201d Bohr also said something consistent with this. If the material body is not made of real things then how is it that we really die? The second problem is one that was discovered in Tibet many years ago. Tibet is very high and cold and so when people die it is possible to leave the bodies for extended periods before burial. What was noticed was that after exactly 49 days, some of the corpses started talking. In a few rare cases the corpses reanimated, but mostly they talked for a few days and then stopped. This happened frequently enough for scribes to be summoned, who wrote down what the corpses said. Usually it was a description of what happened after death. These decriptions have been integrated into some Tibetan Buddhist teachings on what happens after death. However what it means is that something continues to exist after death. ",

Rather, it is a highly complex process that arises from the information processing activities going on in our brains.

When the computer is turned off, the information processing activities come to a halt and the video game stops. It doesn\u2019t go anywhere else or continue to exist independently of the CPU. The same is true of our consciousness with respect to our brains. When the brain dies, consciousness ceases to exist. ",
