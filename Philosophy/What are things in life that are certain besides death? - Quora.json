            "answer_text": "If I look back at my life, the following events occur frequently. Taxes..If you work in many countries, for different firms, as contractor, taxes becomes a nuisance. But there is no way you can dodge the tax man. I've had years where I apparently paid 5 figures to much in 1 year - without me knowing. The tax authorities actually pointed out to me that I paid too much (and not my employer), so these guys who regularly get hated, I do try to give some love. These guys are certain in life, better give them a hug.People change..The worst thing you can do to a wife or husband, friend or child, is to put a cage on them after knowing them for 5\u201310 years because you are afraid they might leave you. I've had people try that with me - you run away. I've seen people who did that to others - those people run away.Realization you get older..When you get older - you'll often be remembered that you get older.You'll have to piss a few times in the nightRemember when you were 20 and you could eat whatever the fuck you wanted without getting fat? And you see a beer advert where there is a handsome old guy who is fit?Well, where I drink - old people get fat who drink..If you get stuck in repetition - your brain is guaranteed to fry at some point..And as result you can do stupid shit I've seen friends do:Break up relationshipsSpend excess moneyCheat on your partnerAnd so forth.While it's your fault - if you put yourself in repetition modus - write down that you need to smash yourself out of that vicious circle, else you'll do it till your deathbed.",

Changes in your perspective (like when you realize that your mother was *right* about so many things that you thought you understood better than she did). Some wisdom \u2014 yours, and that of others who influence you. Unfairness. Lots of unfairness. Learn to cope: \u201cWhy *not* me?\u201d Gifts, moments of spontaneous generosity and encouragement. Nasty and dangerous people: you may learn to understand them, but they\u2019ll still be who they are. Finding out the truths of getting old, unless you don\u2019t make it that far. Moments of terror and pain. Moments of intimacy \u2014 not necessarily sexual. True intimacy is unconditional trust. That\u2019s why those moments are brief. Surprises, unexpected zingers from Left Field. Enjoy! ",
