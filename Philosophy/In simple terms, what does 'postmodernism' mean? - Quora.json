            "answer_text": "Describing postmodernism reminds me of the descriptions of the 6 blind men and the elephant. They all grab hold of the nearest part of the elephant and describe what they feel. One grabs the ear and say an elephant is like a rough piece of paper. Another grabs a leg and says it is like a tree. A third grabs the tail and describes it as rope. etc.   So I am looking for the common threads people attribute to Post Modernism and I come up with these. Postmodernism is reaction to modernism, which is the enlightenment ethic of rationality, and pragmatism. All philosophies have a mixture of some specific order and some specific chaos. But Postmodernism is unique in its preference for chaos and nearly vacant of order. Postmodernism is the principle advocate of relativism, discarding absolute measures toward a sort of \u201cwho are we to judge\u201d scale where every culture is different, but none is better than the other. This is their large concession to equality: an enlightenment idea. The single exception they make to equality is the postmodern mind, which has no equal. As to means, the Postmodern mind is totally consequentialist, blind to the ethics of means and consumed by \u201cends\u201d. It coined new words, replacing bourgeoisie with \u201cEstablishment\u201d. The establishment is the conspiratorial group that is responsible for all the suffering in the world. Postmodernists identify themselves as being opposed to order, convention and conservatism. Their criticisms of order are legion. all their waking moments are spent in criticizing order. They even go so far as to see self discipline and responsibility as \u201corder\u201d. Everybody else and every other philosophy \u201cclings to guns and bibles\u201d, only the Postmodern mind is beyond reproach. So how does one become \u201cPostmodern\u201d. I believe it starts at a very abstract level and becomes ever more refined until it becomes very personal and identitarian. At first, it is a existential question about the origin of everything. The deep seated distrust of order leads one to conclude \u201cgod is dead\u201d. That leads to the conclusion that there is ALSO no transcendent values worth fighting for. There is only the Postmodern mind in isolation, and nothing can compare to it. Next, comes a skepticism about country and history. Something that isn\u2019t perfect, can\u2019t be good. And because it can\u2019t be good, it is defective. So the national construct and affection for it, is an idea to be ridiculed. Then comes family. Because the patriarchy, is analogous to the already dismissed hierarchies of order, it must be dismissed as well. All of this leaves the Postmodern mind unconnected, isolated in self righteousness: nihilism. This isolation is so powerful: postmodern minds view the stress as suffering. This feeling of connectedness: is especially distressing to young men. Genetically, as the alpha males of the species, the onset of terrific does of testosterone signal to the young men that they have come of age and are due recognition and responsibility. As powerful people do, they look for the recognition their expansive outlook, and incomparable physiques would otherwise command. The respect they expect, and the responsibility modern societies would normally heap on alpha males, just doesn\u2019t happen. Postmodern culture isn\u2019t about giving credit to any individual for anything. It is regrettable because responsibility would calm the burgeoning egos of young men with the realities of making a living and making a life. Young modern women would normally gravitate toward alpha males, but their postmodern selves flee from order. Young women also, are consumed by the impenetrable self righteousness of the postmodern mind. So the testosterone infused young men \u201cgo postal\u201d in, from the outside, incomprehensible fits of rage. The rage is focused in a Postmodern sense at the group who makes the young man suffer so much. It is a genocidal rage, focused on the identitarian group responsible for his suffering.  ",

            "answer_text": "The modernism that postmodernism followed is quite different from the rationality that marked the modernism of the Age of Reason. This more recent version is a catch-all phrase that includes a very big tent: music, architecture, theater, art, and literature. The close of the Victorian Age also marked the close of some pretty strict rules about what art is and how it should be presented. There was a natural tendency for writers, artists, and architects to chafe under the previous generation's hide-bound rules. The horrors of trench warfare, gas attacks, and wasted lives of the Great War convinced the West that there was something seriously wrong with the Way Things Were. Modernist writers of the twenties and thirties sought to redefine not only what their art should be but also what they should be. These decades were replete with writers who endlessly tinkered with what had previously been Universal Givens of writing. Some of the better-known writers who succeeded in this redefinition of art and self included Kafka, Pound, Joyce, and Woolf. What these otherwise disparate writers shared was this redefinition in practice. First, no longer could any writer count on an objective view of reality. Reality itself was a fiction; what was \"real\" could be only a subjective interpretation of external events. This reversal from objectivity to subjectivity was made manifest in the technical tools of writing. Out was an objective point of view that pointed toward some clear-cut sense of morality. In was a fuzzily-crafted point of view whose very fuzziness was a better moral compass than the just discarded rationality of the previous generation. Second, literature itself could no longer be seen as incorporating some unified grand narrative that extols the virtues of one culture or another. Now literature had to be a strange lumping of discontinuities, fragmentations, collages, and mini-narratives. Third, the text itself should not emphasize its content or theme; rather its structure was paramount. It had to call attention to itself with unusual line spacing, pagination, paragraphing, stream of conscious narration, and anything else the author could envision to achieve strident self-consciousness. Just as the subjective modernism and objective modernism of the Enlightenment often overlapped so do modernism and postmodernism of the twentieth century. Though fragmentation of both is a ubiquitous feature, it is their attitude that differs. A modernist of the 1930s would present in his (or her) work a vision of a fragmented society that would feel right at home in the hard disk of a postmodernist of the 1990s. However, the fragmentation of the modernist is the unwanted result of an uncaring society; a character in a modernist novel, play, or poem must suffer in a way that causes the reader to sympathize at the Lear-like tragedy of pathos. The postmodernist, by contrast, would view this fragmentation and suffering as a time for a joyful recognition that art cannot and will not represent a focal point of unity and meaning. One might summarize the Enlightenment modernism as concerned with order and rationality, even if it were occasionally confusing about whether one used objectivity or subjectivity to ensure the continuity of order and rationality. The post Great War version relates to a celebration of disorder over order and subjectivity over objectivity. Postmodernism takes the more recent modernism emphasis on disorder and subjectivity and adds to it a new focus: the long-hidden \"Other\" who only now stands revealed as the eternally suffering subordinate occupant of a polar binary. This \"Other\" is anyone not part of the \"Establishment.\" If one is a person of color, or a woman, or of a non-Anglo ethnicity, or of dual sexuality, then such a person has for centuries been surreptitiously identified as an unwanted and despised scapegrace who must now be isolated from decent folk. Postmodernists like Lyotard intervene on behalf of such outcasts by shouting in essence: \"Enough is enough!\" ",
