            "answer_text": "The concept of Kaizen is simply improvement or change for the better. It could be a one-off change or a continuous change, it could be small or it could be drastic and sweeping. However, in a business context, it is usually used to refer to small, continuous changes. Kaikaku is a radical, intensive change. Hensei is a cultural concept and goes beyond business process improvement where you usually hear terms like Kaikaku and Kaizen. It refers to self-reflection, acknowledging mistakes, and personal continuous improvement. ",
