            "answer_text": "To my knowledge, there are two types of depression: situational depression, caused by a traumatic life event like a death, a divorce, or a terrible breakup, and chronic depression, which is caused by a consistent lack of serotonin in the brain. There\u2019s an important distinction between situational and chronic depression, as one is temporary, and one is forever, and coping mechanisms do differ depending on this. I have severe chronic depression, and have had it since I hit puberty, which was when I noticed that the world just seemed muted, hollow and dull. I was diagnosed with MDD when I was 13, started going to therapy when I was 15 (I went for close to 4 years), and also started medicating for depression when I was 17. Throughout this time, life gave me a couple punches in the face, and I have also dealt with situationally fuelled depressive episodes as well over the years. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found helps me the most for combatting my depression and associated anxiety, based on my therapy, independent research, and conclusions I\u2019ve come to on my own: Refuse to be embarrassed about your depression. When I stopped being private about my depression among my friends and family, they were better able to understand how I was feeling and to not take cancellations or behaviour differences based on my mental illness personally. I even coined a term for when I was feeling particularly fragile: my Down Days. Now I can tell my friends, my parents, or my boyfriend that I\u2019m having a Down Day and they\u2019ll understand, and will interact with me accordingly.Start thinking about yourself as if there are two of you, your depression, and who you actually are, and assume that it\u2019s typically your depression who\u2019s doing the thinking. Once I began to separate myself from my mental illness, I started being kinder with myself and stopped being angry with myself for being depressed. I wouldn\u2019t tell myself that I was stupid if I had type 1 diabetes, so why would I tell myself that because I have depression? This coping mechanism also helps you to become better at gauging when thoughts you\u2019re having during a depressive episode are actually realistic or if they\u2019re intrusive, destructive thoughts.And while you\u2019re at it, stop assuming that you can move mountains when you\u2019re depressed. I would be proud as hell of myself if I were to get a full day\u2019s work done, or cook a fly meal, or even took a shower where I washed my hair if I had the flu, and being in a depressive episode is the mental equivalent of the flu. When I am in a depressive episode, now that I\u2019m a depression veteran, I know to give myself a pat on the back even if the only thing I do one day is brush my teeth. Having the same expectations of yourself when you\u2019re depressed as when you\u2019re healthy will only make you feel worse, and will probably cause you to spiral.Make. Your. Bed. When I\u2019m depressed, remaining completely stagnant just sends me spiralling even further, so I make a point of forcing myself to at the very least make my bed. It takes 3 minutes, it doesn\u2019t have to look like a hotel maid did it, but it makes you feel more capable, which is a huge step in the right direction. I\u2019ve typically found that once I made my bed, I\u2019ll feel a bit more confident to brush my teeth, which will lead to me showering, then maybe eating, then probably leaving my house, then starting to feel better, which very quickly becomes a HUGE win.If you\u2019re able to, disregard societal time expectations as much as possible. A huge reason that I work for myself is to have full control over my time because I am mentally ill, and I need to be able to work around my illness. If I\u2019m having a Down Day, I am completely okay with fucking around all morning reading Quora, petting my dog and doing tiny little cleaning projects to get me out of my Down Day mindset and starting work at 4 PM\u2014 getting upset with myself for not starting work at 9 AM does me no favours. It truly does not matter if you\u2019re getting shit done at 8 AM or 11 PM; you\u2019re getting it done, and you should be proud of yourself.Don\u2019t be afraid to discuss medication options with your doctor. I know quite a few people that view antidepressants as a crutch, or a bandaid solution, but I disagree. After a few years of therapy, I felt that I needed another way to better my mental health. My doctor prescribed me an SSRI (trintillex), and it changed my fucking life. I remember walking down the street to my high school about a week after I started taking it (SSRI\u2019s take 1\u20132 weeks to become effective), and bursting into tears because I realized that I was just smiling and admiring how blue the sky was. I hadn\u2019t done that since I was 9 years old.But do not under any circumstances self-medicate. During a severe bought of situational depression and most likely undiagnosed PTSD (I held my grandfather\u2019s hand and watched him die, and then my stepdad skipped town not one week later, thanks Life), I became a wee bit too fond of Xanax, resulting in me deciding to take a gap year from university after waking up one morning and realizing I hadn\u2019t been sober in 72 hours. That feeling was without a doubt one of the most depressing things I\u2019ve experienced in my life. Just don\u2019t go there. It\u2019s not worth it.If you\u2019re feeling suicidal, find a reason that you can\u2019t kill yourself right now. I can\u2019t count on my two hands the times where I\u2019ve removed the plastic bag from my head, put the razor away or put the pills back in the bottle because I needed to get something done for work, or I hadn\u2019t replied to a text message, or I needed to get a small task done for someone else. Similar to how smokers are told to wait 10 minutes to have a cigarette because the craving will go away, your suicide \u201ccraving\u201d will subside.If you can\u2019t find a reason not to commit suicide, take a few minutes to read about what survivors of suicide attempts have to say about it. Let\u2019s be realistic here: no one who really, really wants to commit suicide is going to call a suicide prevention hotline. Last time I wanted to kill myself, I wasn\u2019t exactly jonesing to chat to a stranger about it on the phone. Reading about suicide survivors\u2019 experiences is a much more accessible way for a suicidal person to expand their perspective, at least from personal experience. It\u2019s not only comforting to know that you aren\u2019t alone, but it also scares you into inaction, which is of course a good thing in this situation. This article is great.Lastly, fight depression anti-logic with logic. I run a successful business as a 21 year old, have great friends, a caring family, I\u2019m smart, I have a boyfriend who loves me, and I\u2019m a model, but my depression has had me convinced more times than I\u2019d like to admit that I\u2019m a failure, I\u2019m ugly, I\u2019m a loser, that no one cares about me, and that death is my only option as a reprieve from the mental anguish I\u2019m feeling. I have found that asking myself simple questions like why do I feel that no one likes me?, or why do I feel like I\u2019m an ugly, disgusting waste of space?, and working backwards to unravel the thought makes it much easier to realize that my mentally ill thoughts aren\u2019t founded in logic. You\u2019ll also start to become more aware of your emotional patterns, so you can combat your depression before you even get to a Down Day. This is one of the foundations of cognitive behaviour therapy!I sincerely hope that one person might find these coping mechanisms helpful, because I understand how hobbling depression and anxiety can be. If anyone has any advice that could be added to this list, please add your thoughts in the comments! Depression sucks, but you don\u2019t. You got this. ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who has had to overcome a miserable life full of anxiety and depression and who was raised by a parent and a grandparent who were chronically negative and miserable, I think I can weigh in on this by telling you a story. My chronically sad father was believed to be a hypochondriac and I was horrified to find that my symptoms were similar to his\u2014chronic pain and fatigue and a negative outlook on life\u2014and my treatment by doctors and others was similar to the way they treated him, scornful for such weakness. Because he was seen with such disrespect, I struggled valiantly for three decades to hide, work around, or otherwise give the appearance of good health and positivity, all while being anxious, depressed, and thoroughly miserable. Then, in trying to get enough exercise, I fell off a horse. It left me in even worse pain and almost unable to walk, unable to work, and feeling like the accident was further proof of my incompetence and that I really was, \u201cjust like your Dad.\u201d It forced me to stop running and accept the fact that it was true, I was just like him, always in pain, always suffering, always, always tripping over my own feet somehow, a worthless weakling, and I didn\u2019t see any way to end it. Knowing that after we die we can see more clearly, my thought was that he, having passed, would know how to stop this so, in tears, I silently asked him, \u201cDad, what should I do now?\u201d To my startled amazement, I heard his voice saying, \u201cWe begin by not feeling sorry for ourselves.\u201d There is such wisdom in this that I was startled. Do you see it? We have pain, yes, we have attitude from others because they don\u2019t understand, yes, we have anxiety, yes, and we have depression, yes\u2014but we begin by not feeling sorry for ourselves. It is that feeling sorry for ourselves that others find so distasteful, so tiresome. As it turned out, I was diagnosed with real, not imaginary, disorders (fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis and a fracture of the spine) and I realized then that my Dad has also been misunderstood because he had all the symptoms of fibromyalgia too, so he suffered all those years alone, with everyone believing he was merely making it up for attention. But this is the way life works. Yes, you have depression and anxiety but we have to stop feeling sorry for ourselves enough to realize that no one in your family wants to hear it. This is just normal. To ask them to feel sorry for you is to ask them to join you in misery, to agree, \u201cyes, you are so miserable. How sad!\u201d But that is not the right attitude but is actually a form of self-indulgence. The real answer is to stop feeling sorry for yourself and take some responsibility to overcome it. This includes seeing a therapist, getting some anti-depressants if necessary, or whatever it takes to get on the road to recovery. Anxiety and depression are common, common, common so having them don\u2019t make you special or deserving of special sympathy. It is like my father\u2019s spirit said, we have to stop feeling sorry for ourselves and take action toward finding solutions. What helped me was Transcendental Meditation and therapy. TM removes the underlying stresses that are the cause of weakness and suffering and it wakes up new strengths and improved ways of dealing with life. I eventually learned how to shake off depression and to ignore anxiety. Even though anyone who had lived my life would have been depressed and anxious, all that finally went away because I stopped feeling sorry for myself, faced reality head on, and worked to change. Your question includes saying that you have done no harm to others, but I disagree. I think when we expect others to listen to us being miserable we are doing harm to them and harm to our relationships. It is unfair that you expect your family to feel sorry for you when you are not doing anything to help yourself, don\u2019t you agree? ",

            "answer_text": "I don't believe that \"overcome\" is the best way to phrase it. We don't (ok-shouldn't) rattle off ways for people to \"overcome\" grief or cancer or MS\u2026 We simply find ways to heal - and hopefully go into remission, or stay more healthy and happy long term. So- with semantics out of the way\u2026 There is no one size fits all solution for healing when it comes to depression and anxiety. There are immensely varying reasons for these things happening in the first place: trauma, chemical/hormonal imbalances, exhaustion, health, things within our control, things outside of our control, horrible relationships, loss, just being within a sometimes cruel and unfair world. One person I know had horrible depression and was told that it was \"spiritual,\" and that one of the best ways to \"cure\" depression was to do more for people. (This was many years ago - not unlike \"curing homosexuality\" that many purport today\u2026) The irony is that this person was one of the most giving, serving people I have ever known. They were constantly beating themselves up about needing to do more and be perfect, etc. I went through a lengthy bout of anxiety about 10 or so years ago. I would keep everything \"together\" during the day, manage what I needed to, and every time I would FINALLY be able to fall asleep I would wake up in a full blown panic attack within seconds/minutes. It would happen all night, endlessly. I went to the ER two or three times over a few months believing that I was having severe heart problems before a dr finally said \"are you under a tremendous amount of stress?\" My answer was that I was under no more stress than most people (so obviously I should be able to deal with it, right? Wrong.)\u2026 In retrospect, there are some situations in my life I should have ended and left far far behind at that point, but * in my case * just knowing that it was anxiety/panic attacks helped begin the journey to combatting them effectively. It didn't take them away, but it did enable me to create some specific coping mechanisms over time, and now I recognize the signs - but have also come to realize over the past couple of years that panic attacks are just one of MANY signs of anxiety- they are a horrific one though, so not having that to deal with constantly is a tremendous relief. (Rabbit Trail \u2192 I didn't realize I'd actually had small panic attacks even during my school years\u2026 I had no idea. We didn't talk about those types of things a tremendous amount in my household at that point - but that was also the time period. There is much more awareness now, thank God. Sometimes it's helpful to look back to what may have been a underlying difficulty all along, even without realizing it!) I know phenomenal people - the best teachers and parents and overall human beings in the world - who deal with depression and anxiety constantly. A large number of them actually. Some have had long term relief, some are on a constant regimen of pills and/or strict exercise and dietary habits (none of these are a magical cure-all btw), others decided to get away for a bit to rest. Some have taken \"spiritual journeys\" (think a week or two at a monastery - in fact, this is on my own list for the future), others said that the electro-shock (though I hate writing that) therapy gave them their lives back, truly good therapists can be key for many, and some healed after leaving a bad situation or cutting off a root source of the underlying problem. (There can be a whole lot of anger / grief that surfaces while dealing with the process too. Never ever ever ever tell someone that they are being bitter or not moving forward or need to \"simply release the anger to heal,\" or they will want to pummel you- even if they don't.) Short version \u2192 Every cause and every solution or coping mechanism is different because humanity and circumstances are incredibly diverse. There is no perfect time line. (If it is any comfort at all [this varies by person as well], it is very common, and thankfully the \"stigma\" that once surrounded it societally and religiously is being shattered.) ",

            "answer_text": " (Edvard Munch Anxiety [1]) I want to answer this from the perspective of C.G. Jung\u2019s depth psychological approach because in my experience, both personal and professional, this way of seeing into anxiety and depression offers not only deep insight into the problem, but also, profound healing. What I mean by healing is that you embrace and transcend the anxiety and depression by consciously working with them, rather than alleviate the symptoms with medication. Let\u2019s start with a quote from Jung, which may strike you as insensitive or arrogant without context, but I promise you, the quote is rich in meaning and it comes from Jung\u2019s own experience with depression and anxiety: The foundation of all mental illness is the unwillingness to experience legitimate suffering. What he means by legitimate suffering is that anxiety and depression are actually symptoms of a deeper problem, a problem of the soul which has not been adequately metabolized, psychologically speaking. (painting, Edward Munch, The Scream [2])  Now, the medical approach to anxiety and depression will say, \u201cit\u2019s a chemical imbalance\u201d and the CBT approach will say, \u201cit\u2019s thought distortion\u201d. The medical approach treats the chemical imbalance with pharmacology. Cognitive behavioral therapy, holding that the distorted beliefs or thoughts cause negative actions or feelings, works to change those distorted patterns by reinforcing not-so-distorted patterns. Psychological suffering is not just a mental or chemical imbalance. To think of it in this way is to fall victim to the misconception of the mind/body split. We are whole beings. Whenever we suffer, that suffering expresses itself at every level. Anxiety and depression affects the whole person: psycho-spiritually, physically, mentally, and physiologically. The signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression will manifest at every level. [3] From the Jungian point of view, the problem with anxiety or depression, as with any form of psychological suffering, is that your whole life system is out of balance. My experience with anxiety and depression Whenever I talk about Jung\u2019s psychology, I am not speaking as a Jungian, per se. I am speaking from my experience with his approach to life. I never say anything is so, just because Jung said it was so. I dealt with psychological issues for decades of my life. I was one of those people who looked like I had it all together, but on the inside, felt like I was falling apart. I could easily point to my childhood experiences and say, \u201cthis is why\u201d, but that did nothing to change the fact that I suffered from severe anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression have an irrational factor that will not yield to intellectualizing your problems, i.e., reducing your problems to \u201cthis is why\u201d or \u201cthis is the cause\u201d. In order to get to that irrational factor behind your anxiety and depression, you have to ask yourself some difficult questions. Asking the Right Questions About Why You Suffer  (Painting, Edvard Munch, Separation [4]) In order to work with the irrational factor, you have to ask yourself not, what is the cause of my suffering, but rather, what is the purpose of my suffering? Again, I draw from Jung: The wise man \u2026 will ask himself: Who am I that all this should happen to me? To find the answer to this fateful question he will look into his own heart. What does it mean - to look into your heart and ask this fateful question about the nature of the things that have happened to you? Who am I that all this should happen to me? It is not the same as falling into the unproductive, why me syndrome. Here\u2019s another quote from Jung: I am not what happened to me. I am what I choose to become\u2026 That is, what you choose to become DESPITE your suffering - or even - because of your suffering. Now this is a challenge because a lot of people don\u2019t like who they are. If that is you, it is only because you don\u2019t see yourself clearly. Believe me, you\u2019ll find something special in there, something precious that has endured \u2026  (Van Gough, Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear [5] Surrendering Yourself You have to find a way to appreciate yourself - love yourself even - and man, is that hard to do for some of us. You have to wade through a lot of self-loathing in order to find what is truly precious in yourself. Sometimes, it\u2019s unconscious, other times, it\u2019s right in our face. For me personally, I had to surrender to some disgusting experiences in my life. There was no medication or thought-reprogramming that could change any of it. I had to ask myself that same fateful question that I encouraged you to ask yourself. Who am I that all this should happen to me? \u2026 and then, dig really deep to find my answers. I have lost clients because they were simply unable to make the transition from holding on to their suffering and sense of injustice to asking themselves what their suffering could mean for their soul\u2019s path. If you can find a way to be open to those kinds of questions, then already your anxiety and depression starts to shift. Find the Meaning in Your Suffering  (Painting, Edvard Munch, Melancholy [6] ) Finding meaning in your suffering - this is very difficult for a lot of people. Again comes the question: Who am I that all this should happen to me? Yes, I keep repeating it because I want you to hear it - really hear it echoing from the depths of your soul. As I said, the question of Jung\u2019s has nothing to do with falling into states of self-indulgent pity. Self-indulgent pity is illegitimate suffering. Don\u2019t read that wrong. For some of us, those states of self-indulgent pity are part of our process. Many people come from a past where empathy or compassion simply did not exist, so we have to find it for ourselves, in ourselves. But the key to not falling into it is consciousness. Conscious suffering is the key. I juxtapose identifying with your suffering and conscious suffering. The difference is this: I am depressed or I am anxious (identification) and This is depression or this is anxiety (conscious suffering). You see, by doing this you immediately separate you from the state of anxiety or depression. Conscious suffering is what Jung meant by legitimate suffering. Anxiety, Depression, and Legitimate Suffering Basically, if you say that you \u201csuffer from anxiety and depression\u201d and leave it there, then that would fall under the category of \u201cunwillingness to bear legitimate suffering.\u201d Again, don\u2019t get me wrong. No doubt that you suffer, but it\u2019s not from your anxiety and depression. It\u2019s that other thing that you won\u2019t look at it: that underlying pain, humiliation, or rejection in your life. Here\u2019s a twist: your anxiety and depression are an attempt at self-healing. Just as a fever raises your body temperature in order to kill an infection, so your psyche produces its own symptoms to kill a psychological infection. Going Inward: the Battle for Your Life  (Painting, Alexander Louis Leloir, Jacob Wrestling with the Angel[7]) In a personal letter, Jung once wrote of his own depression When the darkness grows denser, I would penetrate to its very core and ground, and would not rest until amid the pain a light appeared to me, for in excessu affectus (in an excess of affect or passion) Nature reverses herself. I would turn in rage against myself and with the heat of my rage I would melt my lead. I would renounce everything and engage in the lowest activities should my depression drive me to violence. I would wrestle with the dark angel until he dislocated my hip. For he is also the light and the blue sky which he withholds from me. This going inward begins with your state of mind: the feeling tone of the anxiety or the depression itself. Getting to the Core of Anxiety and Depression  (painting, Vincent van Gough, Sorrowing Old Man (At Eternity's Gate) [8]) It might be helpful here for me to share my own insight from working with the structure of anxiety and depression: Depression is a withdrawal of your vital life forceIt steals your vitality by sucking your life force into your depths. It\u2019s that darkness that you have to enter. That\u2019s why you have no energy.Find the place where that energy is stored, for example, a lost or rejected part of yourself.Give it your attention, even if that\u2019s just by looking at it.Eventually, you will gain access to your vitality again.Anxiety splits your life force such that it scatters and becomes useless for anything other than falling into fear and worry.There will be a center around which all of your fears and worries circle.it\u2019s not money, job, relationships - all of that is just on the surfaceFind out what that core fear is, for example, self-doubt or worthlessnessUnresolved terror, rage, grief, or any other emotions that we push aside or suppress \u2013 these are the places we have to go in order to get to the roots of depression and anxiety. Once you find yourself in the midst of those emotions, you then have to turn them inside out, as Jung suggests below in his letter to a depressed friend. [9] Relief, Restoration, and Healing from Anxiety and Depression  (Vincent van Gough, Landscape with Wheat Sheaves and Rising Moon[10] ) What I have been talking about throughout this post is psycho-dynamics. In essence, when our psychic energy flows outward, we cultivate and animate outer life. When psychic energy flows inward, we cultivate and animate inner life. Both worlds need our energy and attention. When we deprive either of their right to life, then we suffer the consequences of that deprivation. If depression takes your life force from the things you love, then turn inward and search for where that life force is locked away, waiting for release. Tend to that lost place in yourself and it will release that vitality back into your life. If anxiety scatters your life force into fear and worry, pull that energy into yourself. Sit with that tension until it reveals the true nature of your pain. Again, tend to that unresolved aspect of yourself and you will regain a sense of control in your life. Happy new year and all the best\u2026.

            "answer_text": " Immediately stop relentlessly identifying with the beast.With addiction, you must first accept and name your beast as it is: addiction. Reminding yourself that you are an alcoholic or an addict is a cognitive note not to step into a liquor store. It is a reminder that you are susceptible to the vices that trigger you, and it is intended to steer you clear of them. Saying \u201cI have depression\u201d and \u201cI have anxiety\u201d are not analogous to this mnemonic. When you repetitively say \u201cI have depression\u201d, or \u201cI have anxiety\u201d, you are spinning yourself into a cycle of inducing the aforementioned negative mental state. Addiction is physical, depression and anxiety are primarily mental. Don\u2019t conflate these two.Stop giving up on small, innocuous wins.When you eat a chicken breast instead of a bag of Doritos, you win. And I could give a f*ck less about your body at this point. If you tackle minute anxiety-inducing circumstances one-by-one, even if you only partially succeed, you are slowly rearranging your ability to introduce uncomfortable circumstance into your pattern of acceptable behaviour, and you are winning. Start envisioning every action you take as having a direct inflection on the chemical makeup of your mind, because at this point every action does.Know that decadence resolves to disappointment. Every single time.Depression and anxiety cases have a tendency to indulge in the antithesis of the aforementioned small, innocuous wins. A tub of Ben & Jerry\u2019s and drinking cheap vodka often sounds like a great idea. These people become the the progeny of raw escapism. At some point soon, decadence disappears, and we become not just the physical result of poor choices, but we fractionally adopt a neurological affinity for indulging in such a negative habit again. This makes our situation doubly hard to escape. It\u2019s important to end this cycle immediately.Accept your f*cking isolation over unsavory social saturation.The Law of Fives reminds me that we are the average of the 5 people we hang around the most. If you have depression and you indulge often in escapist tendencies with an unsavory 5, at least accept that you are not going to fix neither your depression, nor theirs. You are their problem just as much as they are yours, and that should upset you. If you have anxiety, and you often resolve to habitually victimized conversations about the crippling incarceration of your inescapable fears, then you are not going to fix neither your anxiety, nor theirs.Know that the richest man is rich of mind.I recognized from an early age that the biggest agent of my depressive or anxious state was my self-perceived lack of worldly value. Today, whenever I am feeling low, or worried about my future, I study. It is important to have an interest of study, of course, but when none was found, I let interests find me. I would watch the science channel. I would scour online forums. I would use this ridiculously infinite pool of unending knowledge called the Internet and I would just browse. Today, I still do this. I still seek worldly value in the form of a rich and malleable mind. I know that my career path may change many times through the course of my life. I plant tiny seeds such as this Quora account and I let time sow small harvests in each field. I attempt to practice stranger and more frustratingly complex concepts until I am accustomed to this habitual mental difficulty. So much of any career path is simply being comfortable with complexity. That is something we can always practice. That can make us rich of mind.Grade the effective benefit of every new form of habit and self-talk.You can see, I\u2019ve listed what works for me. What works for me is somewhere near the realm of negative reinforcement, which may seem odd, but that\u2019s my out. I don\u2019t coddle myself. I don\u2019t victimize myself. I recognize Hell, I walk through it, and I build a ladder step-by-step. Maybe this isn\u2019t your strategy. Whatever you try, you must grade. You must sincerely question the effectiveness of new habits or you are wasting your time. Scientists don\u2019t invent new cures by shooting blindly in the dark on every chemical iteration. They use data from previous experiments, and they adjust accordingly. You must operate quite the same. Everyone is different, no one has the perfect combination of outs for you. You must use your vast array of personal experience and look diligently and earnestly for those small, innocuous wins.Look up. No, literally \u2014 Look up.Try this\u2026 Walk along any city street nowadays and notice how many people run through life with their heads down. Just stand there. Count them. Imagine yourself walking exactly as they are. Imagine someone looking at you. Ew.It\u2019s not a cute metaphor; practice actually looking up. Notice things you haven\u2019t noticed before. Identify the types of scaffolding on buildings. Spot the windows that need washing. Notice the clumsy, sheepish behavior of everyone cruising down the sidewalk on autopilot, staring at their phones. Part of breaking undesired habits is just beginning new, monotonous ones.Part of changing our outlook on life is physically changing our perspective. Looking up is a fantastic start. I look up because it makes me feel new. It makes me recognize how much simply happens. It makes me stand out for reasons that I\u2019ve now become comfortable with. When I look up, I acknowledge that life exists. I appreciate the sheer persistence of beauty that will endure despite my being here or not. I feel like I am small, but I appreciate the grandeur of opportunity that renders me such a beautiful size. \u2764\ufe0f Augie ",

Hopelessness and numbness were my symptoms of my depression. I was exhausted. I slept a lot. I remembered I slept 3 days straight once without eating or showering. I felt so guilty about that. I couldn\u2019t do that anymore and I knew I needed to something. So I started to think of a plan. Nutrition. I need to eat even I don\u2019t want to. Health foods. At first, it was hard because I didn\u2019t want to cook or go out. So I mostly ate boiled eggs, fruits and yogurt. Drink water, that was hard for me too. So when I had motivation at some moments, I drank a full glass or 2 to compensate times I didn\u2019t.Self care. No more skipping shower. But this is not enough. If I lived in an unorganized place, I will get frustrated and tired. So I cleaned up my apartment when I had a good moment and I asked my friend to help too.Vitamins. I took vitamin B complex, omega 3 and 5-HTP.Tried to answer phone calls and reply messages. I turned off my phone a lot when I was in depression. One of friend actually came to check up on me, but I shut the door on him. It was a horrible feeling.Sit outside for half and hour in the afternoon when the weather was nice. I actually didn\u2019t see \u201ccolor\u201d during my depression, but I knew it was good me. So if I wanted to get out of that, I needed to do it.Short walk. A small sweat feels good.I did the above steps for 2\u20133 weeks, my sleeping cycle got better. But I still felt hopeless and numb. (Not sad). So I started work on more than basic self care. I started journaling and worked on weekly planning. It helped a lot. It unloaded my thoughts from my mind. More organized, I was very forgetful during my depression.Set goals and wrote them down literally. Set timeline and wrote down exactly how I can archive them. Small, short and long term goals. That helped a lot to improve my hopelessness feeling.Meditation. It was hard at the beginning. I started with 5 mins guided meditate first, then 10 mins, 15 mins, 20 mins and 30 mins.Overcame depression and anxiety was the hardest thing I have done in my life. I was lucky. I had a very good support system. My family and friends didn\u2019t judge me. They also understood depression is not something you can just slap out of it. They were so patient with me and didn\u2019t make me feel guilty when I shut them out. ",

            "answer_text": "Depression & anxiety are both a mental disorder that is based upon negative thoughts, that can result in a mental or hormonal imbalance. There is no one size fits all for defeating either disorder, which can often be linked. Anxiety is fear based, often fear of inadequacy. I was depressed for most of my life. For me, it was a negative self image, partially driven by anxiety that I didn\u2019t even realize I had until after I overcame my depression, and was able to self diagnose. The seeds for my depression were planted early in my childhood. My parents divorced when I was about 4 years old. My family was very dysfunctional. My two oldest siblings went to live with their dad, while we (the younger siblings) were sent to foster care. When my mother finally got her life together and got us back, she was working 2 jobs and left us in the care of my sister. My oldest brother was psychologically abusive, and there was not much my mom or sister could do to stop it. In fact, my sister was as much a target as my brothers and I were. We we\u2019re all dirt poor, as was my dad, so we didn\u2019t have much of anything. All this led to low self esteem. Being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism when I was twenty didn\u2019t help. It caused me to be 30 - 40 pounds under weight, which caused my face to be taught, and made my eyes looked like they bulged. So just as I was getting out on my own, my appearance added to my low self esteem. I turned to weed & alcohol to numb the misery until it just became overwhelming. I wound up going from job to job, getting angry at every one but myself, blaming everyone else for everything that was wrong with the world, and my life. I was angry and hated the world, at least that was the way I acted. The truth was that I hated myself, and that was why I behaved the way that I did. That was the reason for the self destructive behavior. Eventually, I began to recognize that I did not respect myself. I couldn\u2019t be the man that I wanted to be and felt powerless to change. I eventually turned to God through prayer. Then I started reading the Bible and watched a lot of different pastors on Christian networks. This helped to build faith in God, but not in myself, because I recognized I could never live up to those standards. But there was a lot in the Bible that helped change the pattern of my thoughts, and the way that I was thinking. Eventually, due to what was going on in the country, I started reading about the founding fathers, the Declaration of Independence, and the laws of nature & nature\u2019s God. I began studying a lot of libertarian stuff too, like Ayn Rand & FA Hayek. Everything I was learning gave me insight into who I was, and who I wanted to be, and trying to figure out how to bridge that gap. It began with taking responsibility for my life, owning my mistakes, and recognizing the world for what it is and learning to live in that world rather than the world as I want it to be. My perspective on life has changed. I don\u2019t drink anymore, and I quit smoking weed. I\u2019ve begun to eat healthier and to exercise. I\u2019ve also begun to learn not to put all that pressure on myself to meet a standard that I cannot meet. Instead, I\u2019ve learned to love myself for who I am, and to be the best person that I can be, no matter how imperfect that person is. I am much better than I used to be, and hope that I can continue to learn & grow to be closer to the man that I want to be. The most oft repeated prayer request is that God will continue His creation of me into the man He created me to be. From there, I just trust Him to fulfill His promise to complete me. That helps with the anxiety. So the the answer to the question of what is the best treatment for depression & anxiety is #1. Faith #2. Change the way you think #3. Accept the world and yourself as you are. You didn\u2019t create yourself, and you didn\u2019t create the world. The best that you can do is be the best version of yourself that you can be, and hope that will make the world a better place as well. We are what we are. We are human, which means we aren\u2019t perfect. The world we live in is not perfect. But it is beautiful, and so are we. We just have to learn to appreciate the beauty of who we are by being our best. And when we come up short, ask God\u2019s forgiveness, and then forgive ourselves, and take steps to learn from our mistakes. Never forget that when God is finished with us, we will be another of His masterpieces. Till then, we are still a work in progress. ",

            "answer_text": "45 minutes and counting. It\u2019s been 45 minutes and still, my B.P. is through the roof. My heartbeat count is infinity beats per minute. 1...2...3\u2026 Gosh! I literally can\u2019t count my heartbeats. Just stop it. Stop it somehow! I want to stop this right now. Please! What\u2019d you do if you ever got an anxiety attack for an hour? I panicked. More. I have had a couple of anxiety attacks in the past few months, but this was it. This was THE anxiety attack I ever had. I remember the date. 31.03.2017. Somehow it ended. I knew the trigger. I was just denying of admitting that she\u2019s the trigger. That\u2019s the thing - we deny our triggers first. Period. I looked at myself in the mirror. I had grown a fat belly. My face looked chubby. And I was clearly overweight. Depression changes your physique. It either makes you underweight, or a lot of times like it made me, overweight. I could count the people I could rely on, whom I could call my \u2018friends\u2019, on my fingers. Not because everyone hated me. Not at least at that time. But because I had locked myself in solitude and away from the world, in the past couple of months.  I was lucky. I was lucky to come across the right people at the right time in my life. It\u2019s been 2 years since I had my first anxiety attack. And the moment I had it, I knew I\u2019d have to consult a specialist. You have to \u201cwant to\u201d get better. Within a week, via some random Facebook group, I met one of my college alumni who had done her masters in psychology. I texted her and literally used the words \u201cI need help. Help me, please!\u201d Pitty and desperate. But I wanted to get better. And that\u2019s what matters. I hoped to get some reference to a psychiatrist from her. Rather she said, \u201cLet me help you, Dipanshu. Maybe you don\u2019t need medication. Maybe you just need to talk.\u201d You need to open up. And so I surrendered myself. I opened up to her. I started from my childhood and had told her every incident of my life that I thought might have contributed to what I am today. Obviously, this all was confidential. And this is the first condition of any therapy session. They all are confidential. Your therapist doesn\u2019t reveal your identity or the problem you are dealing with. Honesty goes a long way. There\u2019s a saying that you should never lie to your doctor, your lawyer, and to your CA. After having the therapy session, I realized why. I admitted (not soon though) that I had some issues. This honest confession helped me to accelerate the therapy process. I promised myself, no matter how embarrassing or stupid an incident might be, I\u2019d be 100% honest with my therapist. That meant confessing my weird and embarrassing set of insecurities too. But somehow I did share those as well. It takes time. You\u2019re not going to figure out your problems in a day that took years of time to get placed inside you. It takes time. The problem you think is your \u2018actual problem\u2019, might be only a symptom or aftereffect of the real problem. Oh and this is only about figuring out what your actual problem is. Finding a solution comes after the correct diagnosis. \u201cWe must let go of impatience. Because patience is a form of acceptance and acceptance is everything.\u201d I became empathetic. I take inspiration from the people around me. No wonder I am a writer! After having these sessions, I turned myself into a vegetarian. And somehow I\u2019m a pet lover now. I am not sure if all the dots connect, but if I have anything in common with all this - it\u2019s the person who took my sessions, who also happens to be a pet lover and an empathetic and kind human in general. It\u2019s gonna come again and again. But the next time it happens, your diagnosis would probably be easier. It\u2019s a fight. But I am no less than a fighter. So I fought back. And I am all good right now. A lot of people don't understand. And it's okay. You can understand depression, only if you've been through it. No matter how hard you try, you can't make them believe that you have any problem in the first place. Admittance and Acceptance are key factors. Admitting that I have a problem, and accepting that my existence in flawed are the two things we resist the most. In his book, Ego is the Enemy, Ryan Holiday describes 0ur ego as the greatest opponent of mankind. I consult my therapist from time to time - to get perspectives about life, psychology, etc. And she has stressed it over and over, that because I had admitted that I was in trouble, and because I had accepted the fact that I am flawed, it became easier for her to pull me out of that black hole. I thought I was depressed. Spoiler alert - I wasn't. Nonetheless, I would have had depression, if it weren't for the right people to stand by my side at the right time. But eventually, it's a long and lonely journey to battle with such a situation. And I am glad I did. Nothing else is going to help. You can't treat a heart-attack with paracetamol. Likewise, no matter how many inspirational books you read, you can't get better without opening up in a lot of cases. I was seeking medication for my anxiety attacks. All I need was someone wise enough to talk to. Like a professional therapist. That's it. Oh, and a lot of patience and courage to open up. All these were the secret ingredients that pulled me out of THE bad phase of my life. If you need someone to talk to, my inbox is always open for you. I'd try my best to respond asap. And if you're looking for professional therapy, you can try TickTalkTo (Private, Confidential and Anonymous Therapy anytime, anywhere) app available on google playstore. I have tried it myself, and it has helped me a lot.

            "answer_text": "With a stick. A really big one.  In all seriousness, it can be a really tough battle. Oftentimes ongoing. The thing is though, it's all about you - the one with depression. You have to want to get better. You have to want to change and then try to make it happen. And it takes more than just one try. It's a process. All the familial support and therapists can't just beat it for you. They can certainly help, and I recommend talking to an adult you trust and seeking professional help, but they just cant beat it for you - not anymore than you can beat their problems for them. There's nothing bad or scary about therapists. They just help guide you in the right direct to a healthier, happier you. You'll just talk to them about what's been going on in your life, how you\u2019ve been feeling, how certain things make you feel, and hopefully they'll help you learn about yourself so you can get that much closer to getting better. Personally, I actually learned a lot about myself by talking to my school social worker, counselors, and my therapist. They made me realize things about myself that I didn't necessarily like, but now that I know about them, I can handle them appropriately. They were important things for me to know about myself. Aside from directly trying to treat your mental health, it's also important to try and be physically, spiritually and emotionally healthy as well. Here are some ways you can do that: Eat well - at least one fruit or vegetable with each meal. Also aim for balanced meals. You'll feel good if you eat good food, and if your body feels good, it will help you to feel good mentally again. Exercise - take the stairs when you can, walk to places if they're close. Just don't seclude yourself to your room with the lights off and blinds shut like I did for a year. Or if you're currently doing this, try to at least open the blinds and go to the other rooms in your house a bit more until you eventually break that literal security-blanket type habit. If you exercise, your body will produce serotonin, which is a chemical that makes you feel happy. Vent - let out your emotions. If you're sad, cry if you feel like it. If you're mad, scream if you want to. I didn't get better until I finally just let myself cry out all my frustrations and tell them to someone (which took hours). I was a disgusting, sub-human mess that day, but afterwards I felt better than i had in years. I felt refreshed and lighter. Do the stuff you enjoy - personally I lost interest in essentially all the things I used to enjoy, so I had to rediscover what I liked, but it's not a big deal. Find what you enjoy, and do it. You deserve it. Try to enjoy things again if you happened to lose pleasure in them after getting weighed down by depression. Go to the Doctor / your regular Healthcare provider - your depression could be genetic or just a chemical imbalance in your brain that needs to be treated. It\u2019s usually pretty simple to treat, so don't be afraid to get it checked out.  All-in-all, I wish fighting depression was as easy at beating it off with a stick. It's tough, but not impossible. I believe you can do it and you should believe in yourself too. tl;dr: take care of yourself, talk to a trusted adult, and get guidance from qualified professionals who are trained to help you. Don\u2019t ever give up either. You have to actively want to get better to actually get better. ",

Whatever you do try not to self-medicate with illicit drugs and alcohol, which will only serve to prolong and compound the problem. There are natural ayurvedic supplements that you can take that will help with anxiety. Try holy basil, ashwaghanda, shilajit or rhodiola rosea. L-theanine with a cup of coffee in the morning helps me out a lot. I also take it with shilajit. I am a 12-year sober recovering alcoholic and needed to find a way to curb my depression/anxiety when my recovery began. I take the above mentioned supplements along with regular cardiovascular exercise and weight training. I perform Wim Hof breathing every day and always start my morning with some kind of positive/motivational video on YouTube. I eat healthy, think healthy and treat everyone I encounter with kindness and respect. I also try my best to get sufficient sleep, but sometimes fall short. All of these things have worked well for me and I almost never get depression or anxiety. I've also been on a niacin regime for the past 8 years. Look up Andrew Saul and niacin on YouTube or buy the book titled, \u201cNiacin: The Real Story.\u201d You can experiment with certain nootropic and racetam supplements as well. Do some research!! If your depression/anxiety is related to some sort of traumatic experience or if you tried what I recommended and it's not working, then you may want to seek professional help. Just know that making efforts to alleviate your problem in a healthy manner will make a positive difference right out of the gate. Stay positive, do the research, put in the work and you'll be well on your way to feeling better. If a former diagnosed severe chronic end-stage alcoholic can do it then so can you. Don't forget to have a sense of humor about life!!! Helping others and encouraging them through these very strange times can also help YOU greatly! I wish you the best of luck and hope I was able to help. Peace be with you in your travels. \u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "I will share my experience, strength, and hope around my own experience with depression. Depression can NOT be taken away quickly or easily. Sadness is possible to get past quickly, but not depression. Depression is a dark pit of nothingness, filled with aches and pains and regret and guilt. Recovery from depression has to be done across many fronts at once. These are some tools that you can choose to use. I\u2019ve done all these things, but not all in one day. Some of these have been more helpful than others. A chemical imbalance in the brain may warrant prescription medicine. Talk to a psychiatrist or medical doctor.Participate in talk therapy either individually or in a group, or both. I\u2019ve had success with CBT and DBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Dialectal Behavior Therapy respectively) to help me find better strategies of coping.Getting active, at least walking for 3 miles a day.Saying affirmations. Affirmations should be stated in the positive present tense towards the thing you want. \u201cI am pleasant in all my interactions today\u201d is better than \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a jerk today\u201d. Make the statement a stretch, but a believable stretch. If you hate your body your affirmation may start out as \u201cI have a body\u201d which is towards your goal of loving your body, but it\u2019s a stretch from \u201cI hate my body\u201d.Writing in a journal especially around gratitude. \u201cThoughts disentangle themselves as they pass through our fingertips.\u201d ~ Dawson TrotmanGetting outside in the sun or if not possible a vitamin D supplement.Hugging and saying I love you to those closest to you.Having a sleep regimen: same time to bed, same time to wake up, min 7 hours max 9.Doing productive things. This could be as simple as washing the dishes in the kitchen sink to as complex as a major house project. I would suggest starting out small.Reading uplifting literature or scripture.Meditation, especially mindfulness meditation.Prayer.Take supplements: fish oil, flaxseed oil, magnesium, b complex, vitamin d, multivitamin.Light therapyDrink enough water. How much to drink? Take your body weight in pounds, divide that number in half, the resulting number is how many fluid ounces of water you should be drinking.Going to a support group meeting, whether it is therapy, 12 step, or other.Power poses. See TED talk with Amy Cuddy.Talking to another depressed person for mutual support.Binaural beats meditation music listened to with stereo headphones.Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.Tapping / EFT.Once you've done all that then watching up to an hour of comedy of your choice, more than that and I'm avoiding life.I personally do not take other alternative supplements such as St John\u2019s Wort (one of many examples), because I\u2019m currently on several antidepressants and I could get myself into a worse situation.Depression is REAL. There is no simple fix. Accept that fact. Depression can be managed however. I have had significant relief from depression but I wouldn't say it's gone. It's in the same room as me, but not in my face. I don't listen to it anymore. The monkey is off my back, but the circus is still in town. There is hope, there is healing. Sadly, there is no quick fix. Good luck. Edit 1/19/2019 - Thanks so much for all of the upvotes. I\u2019ve written a post on my blog that lists over 100 options available to treat depression. Many are evidence based proven techniques and some of them fall under the umbrella of quackery, but I strived to be thorough in putting together the list. I\u2019m not recommending or suggesting you take any of the options as the post is meant to be informational. If you\u2019d like to read the list please go to: Over 100 different depression treatments. ",

            "answer_text": " To give you the best answer we must first differentiate between a clinical depression and what is thought of as depression. A clinical Depression is a depressive episode that lasts for at least 2 weeks and shows 7 of the following 9 signs (taken from the DSM-5): Fatigue or lack of energyGuild or feelings of worthlessnessLack of concentration/indecisevenessExcessive sleeping or insomniaAnhedonia \u2192 markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activitiesRestlessness or feeling slowHaving thoughts of suicide or death on a regular basisSignificant weight change (5% in either direction)If any of these signs appear every day, or almost every day, we are talking about a major depression in which case the first, and most important step is to SEEK HELP FROM A PROFESSIONAL! There is always someone willing to listen and help. You must find someone that knows how to deal with this and that can help you. A major Depression is very serious and you need to find some kind of help. 20% of all pople suffering from major depression develop real psychotic disorders. So please, seek help.  That being said, a lot of us struggle with depressions and anxieties constantly throughout our lives. Currently speaking 5% of all people suffer from this depression and it is estimated that nearly 100% of all people go through at least one major depressive episode in the course of their life, most before they are even 30 years of age. (Source: Psychology Professors). Anxiety disorders as a whole affect a whole 40 million adults in the U.S. (18%) according to the National Institute of Mental health. This shows just how serious depressions have become, and, as with all important things, if you run into this SEEK HELP! Luckily, most of the \u201cdepression\u201d talk nowadays just involves feeling down for a longer period of time and experiencing at most a few of the above symptoms for a longer time, which shows a minor depressive episode that can be more easily tackled. Knowing the difference can be life-saving so it is important you assess how bad your situation is first! After that, here are some of the best tips I have learned in college, from psychotherapists, life-coaches and psychological experts:  Looking at the problems objectively. A Depression in any form starts with problems showing up in great abundance. These problems are not the real problem, but the fact that we maximize or minimize the problems to something far greater/smaller than they are. A break-up becomes the worst thing in existence and loosing your house doesn\u2019t matter. Looking at the problems objectively creates a real chance to solve them accurately. Make sure you only focus on the facts, not the feelings, and talk it through with a friend, removing emotions from the problems entirely at first.Meditation. As guru-like as this may sound, meditation is receiving a much higher role in psychotherapy and is used in a lot of different approaches to many psychological disorders, but has shown to be especially helpful in combating depression. The reason for this is the fact that meditation helps calm the thoughts, which are extraordinarily negative during depressions. Limiting those thoughts limits the negativity and you can focus more on what is actually happening rather than what you believe is happening. (The specific therapy that uses this a lot is called ACT \u2192 Acceptance and commitment Therapy)Exercising. The most common symptom in people suffering from Depression is apathy towards life. They are not motivated to do anything and simply sit around, trying to waste time. If you are experiencing this then force yourself to do something! Anything is better than nothing, although exercise is one of the best things to do. Workout, do some physical activities, or be productive in some way. When you accomplish something you always feel better because you see that life can keep moving on!Accepting your situation. Most people try to deny the fact that they are depressed, hide from the negative events in the world and, simply put, run away from the truth. This denial causes them to misinterpret other events and the depression is left room to grow. Accept that there is a problem, but also accept the fact that you can change. Nothing is forever and you can do something about it. But you must believe in this first otherwise all the help in the world is not going to do anything for you.Realize it is only a season. Most depressive episodes are just that: episodes. Meaning that they show up\u2026 and then they go away. Sometimes, we just have a bad day. Period. There is no dwiddle-daddling around it and nothing we can really do about it. Accept the fact that this will happen to you but think of it like the changing of a season. We all have to go through a winter too, but eventually spring and summer will appear!Focus on what you can do. There are millions and millions of things that you cannot change. There are so many things that you wish you could do but can\u2019t that focusing on it all the time is bound to make you depressed. Instead, focus on the actual things you can affect and change. You can do so much but you must focus on what you can do. The 3 most powerful words I have learned to do this are: \u201cOkay\u2026 what now?\u201d Given the situation, given everything that is going on, what are you going to do about it now?Get help. I know I have said this 3 times already but it is just that important. You are strong\u2026 stronger than you think you are, but that does not mean you have to do this alone. We are all allowed to be weak at times. No one has to carry the entire world on just their own shoulders and no one should. Getting help, even from a therapist, is nothing to be ashamed of. Everyone suffers from depression at some point so everyone needs the help. Knowing where you are weak is a sign of strength and you should get all the help you can. I mean\u2026 are you really so proud you would bet your own life on it?  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written about this several times. This is the way I was able to get rid of depression after being deeply depressed with daily suicidal thoughts from adolescence until I was 50 years old. I had no recourse to therapy of any kind. I came upon this through reading books on Buddhism, especially one by Jack Kornfield called \u201cA Path With Heart\u201d. First, you have to understand that you are not your mind. Your mind is a process that runs on autopilot, unless you specifically pay attention. Explore this process, and you will come to realize that you are the witness that watches thoughts arise in your mind. Second, when you pay attention you can influence your thought process. This is a \u201csuperpower\u201d we all possess. Third, this attention and observation of your thoughts will show you that thoughts are just thoughts, not facts. Therefore, you don\u2019t have to believe your thoughts. Fourth, \u201cbad\u201d things happen, yes, but we make those situations worse by adding mental commentary to them. You will notice that thoughts arise, stay awhile, and then they go away when another more interesting thought arises or you are distracted by something outside of your mind. Fifth, if you are depressive and anxious, it means these are the thoughts you hold on to most of the time. You believe these thoughts to be true, to be really the way things are. You must notice this. You must accept that these thoughts are negative thoughts, and resolve to do something about it. Some people have a habit of always focusing on the bad, negative, depressing things that happen, and never notice the good, positive, happy things. The more time you spend thinking about positive things, the less time there will be for negative things. Sixth, you must commit to paying attention to your thoughts very closely, all the time, so that, each time a negative thought arises, you can say \u201chello darkness, my old friend\u201d, and make a conscious decision to thing a positive thought. Seventh, make a list of all the good things that have happened to you in the past, to counteract the memories of bad things that happened. Then make a list of all the good things that you now enjoy. My list includes, a roof over my head, clothes to wear, enough to eat,water to drink, a few good friends, running water inside the house, a washing machine and a dryer, being able to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel, being able to walk and having use of my arms and hands, having most of my teeth yet, not having a terminal or chronic illness, the ability to enjoy the beauty of nature\u2026 Eighth, get out of your head. Look to help others, and that will keep you from spending time nursing negative thoughts. Don\u2019t take my words as gospel truth. Undertake the adventure of verifying the above in your own experience. I hope this helps anyone who reads it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey dear! Firstly, I would ask you not to worry because everyone of us at some point or the other have been depressed for some or the other reason. Some people even get depressed for absolutely little things, so it depends on who you are, what your upbringing is like and how easily you get affected by the circumstances, okay? Now, each one of us have a different way to cope up with being sad or being depressed. I will tell you about myself, you definitely can get ideas and ideate on what exactly would make you feel better. Things I do when I am sad: CLEAN: I think cleaning is one of the basic things that can make someone lit up. Maybe it\u2019s even logical if you think about it! We all kinda like it when our room, our table, our clothes, ourselves and importantly our mind is clean, right? There are two parts in this, one, cleaning your surroundings and your body(external surroundings) and second, cleaning your inside, that is your mind(internal surrounding). Let me explain this to you. For the first part, you can just start by making your bed, clean and organise your study table or your wardrobe, clean your room, do some dusting, sweep or mop. You can go get a nice bath with some shampoo on your hair, body wash and then perfume yourself. You would see how nice it feels when your body and your hair smells nice. As you must know, good smell releases feel-good hormones in your body and makes you happier. Plus, you would fo the time being be distracted from your bad and depressing thoughts. For the second part, I would now ask yourself to talk to yourself and think about the situation logically. Well some people, including my friends, would choose to avoid the situation and not think about it at all and distract themselves from the cause of pain( in simple words, try to be nonchalant!), which is okay for the very instance of the dawning pain(as I asked you to distract yourself from the situation and clean-up) but after sometime you need to listen to yourself and understand why exactly the situation is hurting you, what is wrong and what can be done about it so that it eventually stops. And the best way to do it, as I hope you would have guessed, is, through meditation. Don\u2019t think about it as a big word. It simply means sitting down comfortably, all relaxed, with eyes closed, trying to calm yourself down for the first few minutes, coming to terms with your new calm and peaceful self, which you can do by focussing on your breath or/and on the different parts of your body and try to feel your body parts, once you are calm, you let your mind wander, do not try to control it, let it go and think about whatever it decides to and you will observe that soon after a little wandering your mind would go and sit on that very thing that has been affecting you. Try to analyse it, try to observe what is it that is hurting you, how bad is it, how badly is it affecting you and most importantly, what you want to do or it, what would be the best possible way to cure it, solve it, right honey? Remember always, that even though a hundred different people can help you, none of them can give you the 100% correct solution, cause only you can do that, dear. It\u2019s because you know your genes, you know your weaknesses, your strengths, your mind, your thoughts and your past better than anyone else, right? So, try to start with this cleaning up process!Oxytocin(the Love hormone): I love this particular hormone cause guess what, it is the love hormone and has amazing effects on your body when you are stressed. And the best part is, you can regulate the release of this hormone yourself! You just need to go to someone, reach out to people who you know, your close people. Talk to them, give a hug, get a hug, go out or have fun, socialise and talk to people you like talking. This support and love that you would be getting from people would automatically release the hormone in your body and make you feel better.A walk alone amidst nature, listening to music that you like is used by many people to fight depression. I like to listen to classical music( Chopin, Canon by Pachelbel, Yiruma are some of my favorites). They make you more calm and help you understand how beautiful nature is and you feel thankful for everything around you, for all the complex systems even inside your body and inside your little cells. Think about it, if they can go on working so intricately each and every day, can\u2019t you? being so huge and having such a great system inside you, with facilities many people crave to have!?Spread love and reach out to people who are in worse situation than you. Go to an orphanage, a mental hospital, an old age home? Spend time with them, you will automatically feel so much better and will be spreading happiness among people who really need it! Plus, isn\u2019t bringing smile on someone\u2019s face the best thing in the world? You wont realise but you would be smiling yourself!!Listen dear, I know you can find a way to cope up with your problems, you are smart enough to do that, we all are. So, have faith in yourself cause this definitely has not been the first time, circumstances are not aligned to what you thought, right? All the best. Keep taking care of yourself and others. ",

            "answer_text": "There is Russian doc that treat severe depressions with a whip. He put the patient on a bed tied to some posts. Then, he whips the patience not sure for how many minutes. After a number of sessions, the patients become normal, with not a hint of depression. This can be explained by the effects of whipping over of the adrenal glands. As you probably already know, the adrenal glands are in charge of producing adrenaline like you really needed to flee the whipping. But you cannot flee because you are tied. Then, the adrenal glands produce some amount, no much, of adrenaline because of the pain. Several sessions of whipping can make your adrenal glands strong again. Depending on the severity of the depression, five or ten seasons would cure you. What is the problem with depression? Well, you are having a life little natural. In nature, the body suffer frequents periods of hunger. You can pass several days with no food. Also. when you are hungry, you must walk and walk tirelessly in search of food. Almost nobody lives in these conditions nowadays. The result of this situation is depression. Most people work in some place sat in an office or in other place barely moving their ass about from here to there. When people get out of a job or an office, they seat on a couch to watch TV. Thus he does not make any damn exercise. But you are asking\u2026 how can I overcome depression? You must fast at least for a week and also start a program of physical exercises. You must punish your muscles with some intensity, bordering on cruelty. This would be a shock for your adrenal glands that are forced to deliver adrenaline to your blood. After a week or two exercising your depression would disappear. You can try the therapy. Nobody had ever died for fasting five or seven days, or for doing some physical exercises . ",

            "answer_text": "I attempted suicide at the age of 15 and was diagnosed with major depression. It took me 20 years to get to the point where I was truly and profoundly well. I think I have perhaps tried as much as it\u2019s possible for one person to try, reading books and studies, working with doctors and therapists and on my own. In that period I tried 80 or so things! I ran experiment after experiment, keeping records. I made a lot of progress, but truly and completely beating it so it didn\u2019t keep coming back was super hard. I finally cracked it and the last 6 years of my life have been the best I\u2019ve ever known. My mum said she had never seen me go around with a smile on my face so consistently since I was 10 years old. I\u2019m sharing this list in the hope it can help speed your journey to recovery. When you\u2019re in the dark throes of it, depression leaves you feeling hopeless, like everything is wrong. I used to get stuck and ruminate on thoughts. I had social anxiety. It also causes you to think that it is going to go on forever. It is simply not true. Indeed most of what you\u2019re thinking is probably not particularly true when it is happening. You absolutely can completely beat it and lead a fabulous life. I think it is really important not to be dogmatic in your approach. Depression can have biological or psychological root causes, and there are so many ways to treat both. In the end I needed multiple interventions from both categories to crack mine. Start out with something that is fast acting to get some relief, the go on to dig into and try to address the underlying causes. I\u2019ve tried to share as much of what I\u2019ve learned as I can, and I\u2019ve had a great deal of success helping people around me to overcome their condition. I\u2019m in process of building a YouTube channel and blog to share my experiences, approach, successes and pitfalls in more depth, in the hope they may be helpful. Of the 80 things I tried, I\u2019ve listed below my absolute Top 14 effective interventions for depression. A lot of these interventions are equally effective for anxiety too. These are the solutions that I arrived at after some 20 years of trial and error, trying, adding and removing dozens of things to ultimately arrive at this stack. Four of them I do intermittently, and the top ten I do every day to this day. Every single thing on this list has been added and removed at some stage so I\u2019m fairly confident it works. I\u2019ve done my best to list them in order, however the fact is that I do need this entire stack together to stay well. It is a significant list, however I had severe, treatment resistant depression that absolutely crippled me and had proved resistant to a number of attempts to properly treat it. If you are suffering from milder depression hopefully only a few things on this list (or different interventions covering a few of these areas) will be needed. Obviously we are all individuals and depression and anxiety have many possible causes. My purpose in sharing this is not to say that these are the \u201cright\u201d interventions for you, but rather to give you some ideas on things to try. I also want to illustrate the principal that (in my experience) you just keep trying things until you get there. Do not start more than one thing at once, or you won\u2019t know what works! My Top 10 List to Beat Depression - Things I do Every day Low Carb SCD-Like Diet, microbiome friendly and intolerant foods removed, added soluble fibreResearch is starting to point to the idea that many mood disorders can begin in the gut. This was a very important factor for me. I had blood testing for intolerances and stool testing for bacterial balance, then made changes to my diet. I\u2019ve tried several diets but the SCD (Specific Carbohydrate Diet) with some specific additional (intolerant) foods removed was the best for me. I start breakfast with chicken and eggs and generally dial back the carbs. I can strongly recommend experiments on diet to anyone suffering from depression and anxiety.Evidence: Compelling Anecdotal (compelling personal experience, research and case studies emerging, but not yet fully proven\u2026I make a case covering the evidence in depth for this on my YouTube channel)My Experience: Mood++, Energy++, Comfort++, Digestion++Cognitive Therapy (or other talking therapy)I found this incredibly effective. It has completely changed the way I view the life. I doubt I would have the confidence to write this post if I hadn\u2019t done it. I say that I do it every day, however it has become so ingrained that it is automatic, I do not have to consciously think about it. Depending on the cause of your depression other forms of therapy or coaching may be useful too.Evidence: Good Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood++, Anxiety--Warm Room at Night (or light box for SAD Seasonal Affective Disorder)Most people are aware that some people are sensitive to lack of light in the winter. If so, a light box will really help. For me light had absolutely no effect. However it turns out that I am sensitive to heat! Temperature controlling my room to 18C (65F) at night has made a massive difference to my mood. This is really hit or miss, it may or may not work for you however it is easy to try out.Evidence: Compelling AnecdotalMy Experience: Mood++, Anxiety--Alpha Stim Cranial Electrical Stimulator (buy UK, prescription in USA)This little device was a game changer, an early success that I had. It started working within days and could be combined with everything else I was doing easily. No side effects, drug-free. I put it on for 20 minutes every morning while having breakfast. It\u2019s been around since the 80s and while it costs a bit to buy it does not cost much to run once you have it.Evidence: Good Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood++, Anxiety--, Focus+Mirtazapine (prescription needed)This is the only prescription medication on the list. I tried several others which helped a little but had bad side effects. The only side effect of this one is that it puts me to sleep. Sleep was always a problem for me, so I continue to take it for this very side effect.Evidence: Good Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood+, Sleep++Prioritize a Full Night\u2019s SleepTrying to go with reduced sleep is a great way to induce depression even in some people who are otherwise not that prone to it. Experiment to find out how much you need then go to bed at the same time - we are all different. I need 8 hours 20 mins as an average. I\u2019ve organized my life so I don\u2019t need an alarm clock, I wake up naturally (apart from for the very occasional early meeting).Evidence: Good Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood++, Energy++, Anxiety--, Sleep++SAMe (s-adenosylmethionine)This is a supplement that boosts mood and energy levels. It has a much lower chance of causing side effects compared to prescription medication and has been compared directly against some of them in studies. For those reasons it is a prescription medication in some EU countries. It is also one of those things that is probably very healthy to take, and there are reasons even healthy individuals might want to consider taking it for its benefits.It it easy to get online, I recommend Life Extension Foundation. It gives me a consistent energy and mood boost every day.Evidence: Good Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood++, Energy++Magnesium ChelateThis is a tricky one because on its own it did nothing for me at all. However in combination with the other elements of this list, it turned out to be essential. It seems that it helps to maintain the efficacy of everything else. It probably only has that effect if you are deficient so your milage may vary. I tried various other things to treat possible deficiencies including B-Vitamins, Fish Oil and Vitamin-D. None of those had any effect on my mood, though I do still take the latter two for general health. They could all be worth trying though to make sure you don\u2019t have a deficiency.Evidence: Some Scientific Evidence (good evidence if you are deficient)My Experience: Mood++, Energy++, Anxiety-, Focus+5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan)This is a great little supplement that helps to boost mood. It is particularly useful in reducing rumination. This is a good starting point if you\u2019re really suffering.Evidence: Some Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood+Testrogain (DHEA + others)This particular supplement is designed for men, however some of the components in it can be taken separately (e.g. DHEA). I had hormone testing that showed low hormones. This had only a mild mood lift however it was enough that I continue to take it.Evidence: Some Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood+, Energy+, Anxiety-Also a word of warning, do not combine together 5-HTP, Mirtazapine and SAM-e without working with a doctor, as to do so could potentially cause serotonin syndrome. You can combine one of them with the rest of this list, but more than one of those together must be done with a doctor\u2019s support. 4 More Effective Things to Keep Depression At Bay - I do these Periodically Walking ExerciseGentle to moderate exercise can really lift mood. I had an atypical response to exercise, if I do too much it would lift my mood then I would crash. Moderate brisk walking a few times a week seems to be about right for me in providing the lift without the negatives.Evidence: Good Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood+, Energy+MeditationThis is great, with one huge caveat if you are severely depressed: you won\u2019t be able to do it. The annoying thing about meditation is that you already have to be in fairly good shape to be able to concentrate on it to do it. However once you are there it is great at helping you to get to the next stage, and when you\u2019re well it really helps to keep you there. I do this periodically for maintenance, particularly if I\u2019m stressed about something.Evidence: Good Scientific EvidenceMy Experience: Mood+, Anxiety --Probiotics (enema)Following on from suggestion number 1 on my Top 10 above, I\u2019ve found that probiotics can work for depression. Taking them orally never did anything for my mood, however taking 3 sachets of VSL.3 as an enema gave me the most rapid mood boost and calming effect of just about anything I\u2019ve ever done. I do this periodically for 7 days in a row as a booster, and it is an amazing reset if I get stressed out or exhausted. It is the only thing I\u2019ve found that acts so quickly - within the first 3 days. It seems like a hassle to do the first time, after that it\u2019s super easy.Evidence: Compelling AnecdotalMy Experience: Mood+++, Anxiety --, Energy+Practice GratefulnessLast but by no means least, practicing gratefulness on a regular basis is a great way to rewire your brain to appreciate the small (and big) things in life. I have a sticky note above my bed to remind me to think of three things I\u2019m grateful for today just before I go to bed. This won\u2019t treat severe depression but once you\u2019re starting to feel a bit better it is a great way to continue the momentum, go more gently, and experience a sense of joy and wonder in the world every day. The more you do it the more it becomes natural. Eventually you start looking at things around you and spontaneously thinking \u201coh I\u2019m grateful for that\u201d.Evidence: Compelling AnecdotalMy Experience: Sense of joy and flow++I hope something on these lists are helpful for you. I\u2019ll continue to share as many of my experiences as I can here and on my blog and YouTube channel over time. Finally, it is worth repeating, depression will pass. Anxiety can be beaten. No matter how bad you feel don\u2019t believe it. You can get there. Stick at it, don\u2019t give up and good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Overcome the depression is sometimes very challenging. Especially when you are about launching new business idea. Whether you call it startup depression or even founder's blues, depression is a real risk for people drawn to starting their businesses. If you've just set up your own business, you are probably familiar with the annoyance of some days just feeling like things are going nowhere no matter how hard you try. Depression is a huge problem among entrepreneurs during this lonely journey. 1. Acceptance is the answerLife as an entrepreneur is often more unpredictable than a 9 to 5 job. This should go without saying, but when you are experiencing a downtime, it is easy to forget that another up is probably right around the corner. Maybe a business deal is closing or you can debug your program. Anyway, just remember that the reward is around the corner. Once you accept this reality, it gets easier. You will be surprised by how \"immense' your struggles were when you reflect on the years, and even months later. 2. Ask yourself if you are doing the right thingThe only thing worse than doing nothing is doing the wrong thing. Sekk counsel and guidance from those you trust who already have their ducks in a row, buy them a drink and spill your guts. 3. Create a Business Social LifeThrough it may seem like you are isolated as a founder, especially as a solopreneur, the truth is that there are peers, mentors, and other entrepreneurs out there who share the same challenges, frustrations, and problems that you do. Create a business social life to meet others and talk about issues you share to reduce the stress of dealing with them alone. Come cowork at Treehouse Society so you can connect with other entrepreneurs and business owners. 4. Seek Professional Help If the stress of being a founder seem overwhelming, get professional help from your family doctor, counselor, psychologist, or other mental health experts. Many entrepreneurs might not tell you, but a lot of them go. After all, you have an accountant, a lawyer, and other professionals for things you can't tackle on your own. Think of it as a personal investment. Practicing self-care as an entrepreneur and founders only make good business sense, and it might be the most important non-business thing you do. 5. Stay focusedIt may not feel like it, but setbacks can distract us from our goals and take our focus off what is important. Even if you have to force yourself, remain focused on your goals in the fact of challenge. It will help you power through the rough patches. If you must, meditate on and repeat your goals out loud. Doing so can reinforce a powerful sense of focus on these aims. Hope these tips help with the startup blues! Remember, there might be others out there experiencing what you are feeling!

            "answer_text": "For some reason, Quora has merged two questions together, which means my answer below doesn\u2019t make sense I answered the question; \u201cCan you overcome depression completely?\u201d Cheers, Allan I am in my mid-50s now and in the past, I suffered with depression since I was 16 or 17 years old It\u2019s only been in the last five or six years that I can confidently say; \u201cYes, it is possible you can overcome your depression completely\u201d But that does not mean there is a quick and easy fix for you, because that is rarely the case This is what I have learnt from my more than 20 years of battling with the black dog of depression and finally overcoming it Overcoming your depression could be an up-and-down journey over some time, where you will fluctuate from feeling hopeful and optimistic to falling into despair like there is no hope You may have periods of relief, even for several years, but then your depression could come back to haunt you and you need medical treatment once again A fully qualified mental health nurse told me once, that she sees many people seek treatment, get better to some degree, get on with their lives and return every few years for more treatment There is no shame in needing medical help for your depression, I did many times and I\u2019m glad I spoke up when I did (even though the medications did very little for me) If you want to heal completely, you have to be prepared to try everything! You also have to be determined to never give up, no matter how hopeless your treatment seems to be going at any point in your journey to recovery Here is the one most important thing that was taught to me about all human life, even the bible talks about this \u201cMy people perish for lack of a vision\u201d You have to be determined to never give up and have a vision of what you want your life to look like, once you have healed Think about that for a minute! If a genie came out of the lamp and granted you complete health and happiness, what would you want to do with your life from now on? What would you do, beyond anything else, that would inspire you, uplift you, energise you and leave you feeling fulfilled and satisfied? These are the positive life enhancing and healing energies you will need to completely heal from your depression The positive energies of; optimism, feeling uplifted and inspired, feeling satisfied and fulfilled, and being able to freely express yourself in many ways From my experience, there was one glaring problem with the medical and therapeutic treatment of depression And it\u2019s a problem that permeates the whole of any civilised society! You are taught to focus on your faults! You end up constantly focusing on what you do wrong in life and your past mistakes Then, that negative voice in your head poisons you from the inside, with nasty self-critical thoughts, that you end up believing to be true This leads you to compare yourself to other people, which can only make the problem worse, because that little negative voice in your head can then tell you; \u201cYou are worthless and no good to anyone\u201d This can amplify your faults and shortcomings even more in your own mind and lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair, because you believe that is who you are and nothing is ever going to change The one secret to overcoming my depression completely, was to begin to focus on my natural talents and abilities and therefore what I was good at! This was the only way I began to feel the positive energies of optimism, fulfilment and satisfaction Only then did I begin to truly believe in myself and have a whole new vision of living a happy and contented life, where I would use my natural talents and abilities to help my fellow man Up until then, I was stuck in a boring, uninteresting and unfulfilling job that society and my family taught me was what I was supposed to do \u201cYou made your bed, now you have to lye in it\u201d I firmly believe that depression is at least in part, depression of your natural energy and your natural self-expression Without discovering what your natural talents and abilities are and expressing them and living through them in your everyday life, so you can enjoy energetic feelings of satisfaction and fulfilment, it would be difficult to get rid of your depression completely I spent 30 years working in the electrical trade and it took me 25 of those years to admit to myself; I absolutely hated it with a passion No wonder I couldn\u2019t overcome my depression! Hating who I was and what I was doing for a living, was like an anchor around my neck dragging me down into constant despair But that was what society and my family had taught me; \u201cwhatever you choose when you leave school, that is who you are\u201d No wonder I was always miserable, irritable, angry and bored being stuck as a round peg in a square hole I was never going to be happy doing something that didn\u2019t resonate with my natural talents and abilities You see, as a child, I was squashed, and not listened to, I felt unloved and utterly rejected, over and over again Growing up in a cold and loveless environment, meant I was never allowed to express myself and grow into a happy person, who became naturally more alive, self confident and full of energy I never discovered who I really was and what I truly wanted to do with my life I was stuck in survival mode, hoping I could just get through one more day and wake up to the next one Once I started to focus on my strengths and talents, I began to open up to much more energy and clarity of thought I began to have more hope and optimism for a brighter future and I became much more motivated to achieve what I really wanted in life I began to believe in myself more! I had a brand-new vision for a brand-new future and I got rid of that stupid old saying that you hear so often; \u201cOnce you hit 40, it\u2019s all downhill from there\u201d What a load of rubbish! Anybody can reinvent themselves at any time in their life and I am living proof of that Don\u2019t let negative people tell you things like; \u201cYou will be stuck where you are forever, you\u2019ll never achieve anything\u201d It\u2019s simply not true! Of course, you must listen to your qualified health professional and treat your depression in a sensible way You need a correct diagnosis from your doctor and possibly, medical and therapeutic help along your journey Exercising and eating a healthy diet are also vital, as is being tested for any possible underlying health conditions that may be causing your depression symptoms You also want to avoid drugs and alcohol as much as you can, if you truly want to heal and live your best life possible Once you seek the right medical help though, my advice to you is this; don\u2019t stop there! Discover what type of work and lifestyle would deeply resonate with you and work on putting the steps in place to achieve that goal Don\u2019t live in a miserable way like I did, literally for decades Don\u2019t be a round peg in a square hole for the rest of your life From my research and understanding; the happiest and most fulfilled people in the world are living from a purpose that gives them great satisfaction and meaning in their life This is what I now believe; you must heal your depression at a medical level, a psychological level, a biological level and a spiritual level And it\u2019s not as hard as you might think The medical level may take care of any chemical imbalances in your brain, to give you relief from pain and suffering The psychological level may take care of your faulty and negative thinking, limiting beliefs and lack of resilience in dealing with your life problems The biological level is healing and taking care of your physical body, so you can release more energy to help you feel full of beans, more positive and optimistic and therefore to help you heal The spiritual level, is discovering how to live in sync with your natural self and all of the hidden talents and abilities you have deep inside yourself You were born with these! Who you truly are has never been nurtured into your adult life because of an unhappy and less than ideal childhood But you must be determined, dedicated and develop an inner strength to keep going and be guided through the dark times to uncover who you really are at your very core You have so much untapped inner strength, resilience and potential, it would amaze and shock you, in a positive way, what you are truly capable of in this life Do not listen to or believe anyone who puts you down in any way and find positive people who will up lift you and encourage you to become all you can be ",

            "answer_text": "Today, I run a very successful 7-figure coaching company, am in incredible health, in the relationship of my dreams, and surrounded by people that I love. \u2026 But it wasn\u2019t always this way. Only a few short years ago, I was severely depressed. Even after achieving all of my big goals, building a profitable business, and becoming a social powerhouse\u2026 I still felt empty inside. \u2026 I remember years ago I would drive to work and consider driving myself off the Coronado bridge into the ocean. It seemed like an easier decision than living another day feeling the way that I did. \u2026 Thankfully I didn\u2019t. I decided to make a change. I decided that I was going to overcome depression once and for all WITHOUT drugs or decades of therapy. And boy am I glad that I did. While I\u2019ve written a comprehensive guide to depression where I detail my battle and the tactics that I used to overcome my demons, I\u2019m going to give you the cliff notes version in this response. By taking action on the tactics and mindsets I\u2019m about to share with you, you\u2019ll be able to beat depression permanently and naturally\u2026 Let\u2019s dive in  First\u2026 Accept that Depression and Happiness are a Choice \u201cWhat?\u201d, I can already hear you saying, \u201cWho the hell do you think you are? I don\u2019t WANT to be depressed!\u201d But before you go getting too angry\u2026 Let me explain. I agree, that depression, by and large, is not always a choice. Sure, there are some people who simply enjoy the attention and the pandering they get from being \u201cdepressed\u201d but I\u2019m going to assume you aren\u2019t one of them. But based on your question, I\u2019m going to assume that you, like me, have genuine clinical depression and want to know how to get out of it. So how in the world is it a choice? Think about it this way\u2026 When you were born, you weren\u2019t born depressed. Hell, you didn\u2019t even know what depression was! But as you got older and started to learn and adopt the behaviors from people around you something changed. \u2026 You learned how to envy other\u2019s posessions, how to mistreat yourself, and how to throw one person pity party\u2019s anytime that something didn\u2019t go your way. And somewhere along the way\u2026 You forgot how to be happy. There are two main types of depression Physical depression caused by a neurological imbalance (which is rarer than you might imagine)Conditioned depression caused by lack of perspective, an unhealthy lifestyle, and negative childhood conditioningBoth are beatable\u2026 \u2026 And in fact, both require the same strategies to overcome. But this strategy starts with a decision. You must decide RIGHT NOW whether you will let depression beat you and define you or whether you will overcome it once and for all. I\u2019m not saying that you can just flip a switch in your brain and all of the sudden break out of your depression and experience happiness. But I AM saying that you have to choose whether or not you will stay depressed. When I was at my lowest point in life on the verge of suicide, I had a decision to make. I could either cave into the mental pressure or I could rise up and beat it. I chose option #2. \u2026 Nothing changed overnight. It took me nearly two years of hard work and constant reconditioning before I completely eradicated my depression. But it was still a choice. I could have chosen to accept depression as a part of life. But I didn\u2019t. And right now, you have the same decision to make. Depression might be a part of your life but it\u2019s not who you are. So what will you decide. Will you let this disease beat you, cripple you, and devastate your quality of life. Or will you wrestle it to the ground and beat this son of a b****h once and for all? The choice is yours. 7 Quick and Dirty Tactics I Used to Beat My Depression and Find Happiness in an Unhappy World Now that you understand why and how depression is a choice, it\u2019s time to dive into the nitty gritty tactics that will help you beat it. The following tactics are backed by mountains of clinical research and if you\u2019re interested in reading about the studies or learning more about why they work then I recommend checking out my guide to depression. Now enough small talk! \u2026 Let\u2019s dive in! Tactic #1: Get Plenty of Good Quality Sleep One of the leading causes of depression is sleep deprivation. Sleeplessness has been linked to a plethora of medical conditions and it costs the US more billions of dollars in lost productivity and healthcare each year.  If you want to beat your depression, then start by fixing your sleep. Set a scheduled bedtime and wake up timeGo to bed before midnight if possibleSleep in a cold pitch black roomDrink chamomile tea with 1 Tbsp of Honey and 1 Tbsp of Apple Cider vinegar an hour before bedSupplement with magnesium (1,000 mg), L-theanine (100 mg), and 5-HTP (200 mg - 500 mg)Don\u2019t eat after 9 p.m.Turn off all electronics 60 minutes before bed and instead read, journal, play an instrument, and relaxIf you will take action on these simple steps I promise you can start feeling a difference in your mental state as soon as tomorrow. Sleep plays a huge role in regulating our moods and disposition for depression. Fix your sleep and you will begin to fix your life. Tactic #2: Sweat for 30 Minutes a Day Exercise is one of nature\u2019s miracle drugs  Here are just a few of the benefits you can derive from a regular exercise program Benefits including: Elevated mood, reduced stress, and less anxietyImproved blood flow to the brainThe production of new brain cellsImproves memoryImproved discipline, impulse control, and decision makingAnd, most importantly, decreased depression.You don\u2019t have to kill yourself at the gym to reap these benefits either. \u2026 Only 20\u201330 minutes of exercise a day has been shown to increase mood, decrease depression, and help ensure that your body is firing on all cylinders. I found that the more frequently I exercised the harder it was to feel depressed and now\u2026 It\u2019s a habit that you couldn\u2019t take away from me at gunpoint. Pick a fun activity that will get you off your butt and break a sweat. Do it for 30 minutes a day and I promise you will feel a difference. Tactic #3: Let Food Be Thine Medicine Studies have shown that altering your diet can be more effective at treating clinical depression than traditional SSRIs. Most of us don\u2019t realize this but the majority of the foods we consume as a part of the Standard American Diet are completely devoid of any nutritional value.  \u2026 This means that we are all walking around with severe nutrient imbalances we aren\u2019t even aware of! In order to fix these imbalances it\u2019s important that you eat a varied diet filled with all sorts of different vegetables, fruits, and meats. Here are a few general recommendations to get you started Encouraged foods: whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, low-fat/ unsweetened dairy, raw unsalted nuts, lean red meat, chicken, fish, eggs, and olive oilDiscouraged foods: sweets, refined cereals, fried food, fast food, processed meat, soft drinks.Beverages: maximum two sugar-sweetened beverages per week and maximum two alcoholic drinks per day, preferably red wine with the occasional screw-upI found that when I threw out the processed foods, cut out sugar, and started eating 10X more fresh fruits and vegetables my mood improved considerably. In conjunction with sleep and exercise this is one of the best ways I\u2019ve found to cure depression and lead an amazing life. Tactic #4: Double Down on Your Social Life Living in a state of isolation can be as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day! This might sound crazy\u2026 But it\u2019s true. We humans evolved to be social creatures.  Our hunter gatherer ancestors lived, worked, played, and did life as a tribe. It wasn\u2019t just a matter of having a good time for them. \u2026 It was a matter of survival. Your brain is hardwired to crave social interaction. As such, one of the BEST things you can do to cure your depression is to tap the brakes on all the overtime and instead double down on spending time with friends and family. Tactic #5: Practice Gratitude Daily One of the common causes of depression is simply lack of perspective. We live in an increasingly narcissistic society that almost forces you to focus on yourself and all of your problems. At every turn you\u2019re told you are not good enough.  Advertisements and social media tell you that you need: The latest carBetter clothesA nicer smelling cologneThe hot girl or guyBigger muscles or a better buttAnd a whole slew of other things. But the truth is\u2026 You are enough right now You have everything you need to beat depression and feel happy You just have to realize it. This starts by expressing gratitude daily by writing down and focusing on everything that is going well in your life. If you can\u2019t think of anything going well, then express gratitude that you made it through another day. You have a lot to be grateful for\u2026 A roof over your head, clothes on your back, breath in your lungs. That\u2019s all you need to be happy. But you must first accept this then express it. Tactic #6: Meditate Like a Monk Extensive research has been conducted that have shown some pretty amazing and surprising findings regarding the effects of meditation. Increases the production of neurotransmitters like serotoninShrinks the brain\u2019s fear centerDeactivates the anxiety and depression centers of the brainRebuilds the hippocampus of the brainStimulates the same Alpha and Theta brain waves Doctors use to combat depressionAnd that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.  Meditation is proven to help: (source) Lower blood pressureAlleviate symptoms of insomniaReduce depression and anxietyReduce painReduce symptoms of IBSAid in smoking cessationTaking up a meditation practice for even 10 minutes a day can have profound and far reaching affects on your life. It helped me cure my depression and I can guarantee it will help you too. Tactic #7: Laugh Like Your Life Depends on It When you are depressed, it can feel hard to laugh. \u2026 Which is exactly why you need to laugh MORE  According to HealthCentral there are a number of scientifically validated reasons to laugh more\u2026 Strengthen the immune system by activating cells that attack viruses.Lower blood pressure for some by inducing relaxation and preventing the release of stress hormones such as cortisol.Trigger the release of endorphins which give you a sense of well being. These endorphins are also natural painkillers.Reduce stress and anxiety because it naturally relaxes you. Laughter induces your heart rate to slow down and your blood pressure to decrease.Increases our creativity as it encourages a new perspective to look at things.Improves our mood through social connection and an increased feeling of belonging. Laughing with friends can decrease feelings of alienation and lowers our risk for depression.Act like laughter is your new job. Binge watch funny shows on Netflix, go to comedy clubs, watch standups during your down time, and spend time around funny people. Life is short. \u2026 So laugh dammit! Conclusion Depression is not easy to beat. It will require effort and commitment. \u2026But it is possible. By taking action on the above tactics and CHOOSING to live in a beautiful state, you can beat depression once and for all. If I can do it\u2026 So can you. We\u2019re all rooting for you Stay Grounded, Andrew ",

            "answer_text": "You overcome by realizing that nobody is going to rescue you. In the very depths of my episodes I used to sit and wait for someone, anyone, that stranger, this friend, that bus driver, this girl, that professor, this dog, anyone, anything\u2014-to reach their arms down into my psychological pit and pull me out as I slept in peace. While that may be a very religiously affirming idea, the bare truth lies in the fact that this \u2018X-factor\u2019, this unquantifiable energy we call God, is the very figment of OUR being. Only YOU can save YOU. Therefore God saves you. Understand? In my experience, the best way to overcome depression and anxiety is a mental and emotional exercise. Every time I had a negative thought or emotion, I immediately replaced it with a good one. Replaced rejection with the image of a puppy. Replaced homesickness with the thought of chocolate cake. Completely disproportionate right? Correct. It felt like crap because the good emotion does not adequately superimpose the boundaries of the negativity. But, what it DOES do, is BREED. Let\u2019s get into some mathematics of emotion here: 1 happy thought amplifies in 10x intensity in 2 hours. Then, 1 negative thought amplifies in 100x intensity in 1 hour. Can you see why this is an uphill battle now? Happiness is an underdog. Now, if I add an excess of happiness, enough to render the rate of negative thought propagation null and void, I would have washed out the sadness. It is chemistry of feeling. These are ways to amplify happiness: Meditation opens up free space in the mind to make room for happiness to rush in. Like a vacuum.Appreciation lists\u2014 you will be absolutely amazed at how abundant you are.Ass-lickers. This may sound haughty but it works. Go find some friends or even people you found to be latchy or annoying and spend time with them. Bask in their compliments. Get pampered. We are beings that depend on conditional happiness, so when your external world shows some appreciation, it can boost your mood.Sunlight and nature are great sources of high vibration. They are fundamental to creation so take a hike and let some of that energy rub off on you.",

            "answer_text": "Here are some of the best things you can do to reduce (and even completely eliminate) chronic depression and anxiety from your life. These are not quick fixes; they may take a few weeks to fully take effect. But they worked for me and they are backed by research\u2014I\u2019ve been free of chronic depression and anxiety since 2010 based on these strategies, which I call the sudist method: Significantly reduce your use of commonplace and recreational drugs, including marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine (both cigarettes and vapes), whichever apply. Even if these help you cope in the short term, they virtually always make depression and anxiety much worse in the long run.Gradually increase the amount of natural physical activity you do \teach day. Walking, jogging, dancing, biking, sports and swimming all fit the bill. Start small if you have low energy, like a short walk every day. If you are too anxious to leave the house, you can do burpees or jumping jacks, which require no equipment and almost no space and will get you feeling the burn in no time. Do a little \tevery day, and gradually increase the amount each day. Even if you don\u2019t feel like it, kick yourself in the butt and do it. Find \tsomeone who can be active with you and help you stay motivated.Accept your physical and emotional aches and pains instead of \ttrying to suppress them or self-medicate them. Avoid painkillers. Wean off of mood stabilizer drugs (like antidepressants), but ONLY under the guidance of a qualified physician. Meditate and be mindful. Embrace suffering and listen to its message, for pain is an integral part of life and is ultimately unavoidable. We may succeed briefly in numbing it or pushing it away but then it always returns with a vengeance.Cut back on fast-paced, mindless stimulation, including video games, TV, movies, mindless social media, music, etc. Do calm activities instead such as chatting with friends, going for nature walks, playing with children and pets, meditating, school work, arts/crafts, chores, etc.Significantly reduce your consumption of sweetened or savourized \tfoods and beverages. Instead, eat whole unprocessed foods with no added savourizers (i.e. salt/sodium or MSG) and no added sweeteners (i.e. real sugar or any of the alternatives like aspartame, splenda or even stevia). Drink water or milk instead of juice, pop, or shakes. Most people do not realize how huge of an impact food has on mood, including chronic anxiety and depression. The best way to avoid these is to read the ingredients lists of everything you consume. Yes, food will taste bland at first (that\u2019s how food is supposed to taste!), but you will get used to it in time, like I did.You don\u2019t have to do all of these at once, but you have to start somewhere. Once you apply some of these principles, it may take a few weeks to see your depression and anxiety start to lift and the transition period may be challenging (fatigue, weakness, flu-like symptoms, etc, all entirely normal), but if you push through it, these symptoms eventually go away and you will find that your depression or anxiety have gone down significantly, or have even been completely eliminated. I\u2019ve just published a free book with lots more advice on this topic called The Sudist Way, which you can download here (or at no cost on Google Play or Apple Books if you prefer). My goal is simply to help people like you, who are suffering like I used to. Good luck and I hope you kick your depression in the butt! I\u2019d love to hear from you if you give the above a shot or have questions. Take care! :-) ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is both very simple and difficult at the same time. On the pretext, don\u2019t think that you are the only one. According to WHO there are more than 350 million suffering from depression. If you think you want to overcome depression you really can. Waiting for somebody to come and do it for you will be a long wait and probably your situation will worsen. Realize this that YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE who can bring yourself out of it. Here is what you should do 1) Identify the reason: Accepting and identifying the reason will help you get real. Think of alternatives that could have been done. Nobody gets everything. Everyone has one or other thing lagging. Learn from the incident and move on promising yourself to not commit such mistakes.  2) A small vacation: Plan a small trip, which you have been ignoring for a long time. It need not to be a costly one, but something which could take out of this place and please don\u2019t carry your metal baggage. Give time to yourself. Talk to strangers and you yourself will witness that the earth is such a nice place to be.   3) Talk about it: The biggest mistake which people suffering from depression do is that they distance themselves from others. Talk to your friends and family about it and let them know how you feel. You are not doing this to have their sympathy rather you are doing it because they care for you and deserve to know your state. The remembrance of happy moments which you shared with them will help you in coming out of it.   4) Pick up a hobby: As rightly said that an ideal brain is a devil\u2019s workshop. Continue your hobbies or pick a new one. The possibilities are endless and who knows where it will take you. A personal note here I happen to know a person who started landscaping just because she wanted to come out of her depression. Today she is a proud owner of a terrace garden and is one of the cheerful members of my gang.  5) Seek professional help: If the problem is severe there is no harm in taking professional help. After all, they are the people who have seen many like you are back to normal.     In the end it all depend on YOU. You are driving force of your life. A popular hindi song says \u201cduniya mai kitna gam hai, mera gam kitna kam hai \u201c(there is so much sorrow I this world compared to which my miseries are so less). Experience the joy of giving and sharing. Afterall life is all about how we interact with each other. Credits: GOOGLE IMAGES PEACE ",
