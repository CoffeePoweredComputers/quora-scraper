Because he is dead, right now I\u2019m infinitely more smart than him because dead people are zero smart. I could out-smart him in every way today. Also Wittgenstein was a particular kind of smart. Very good at reasoning, but very poor at emotional intelligence. So it would not take much to be more emotionally smart than him - probably the average dog could have out-smarted him emotionally. ",

            "answer_text": "When he was alive, I suspect that Ludwig Wittgenstein was more intelligent than about 90% of the people he shared the planet with. Philosophical issues aside, he was also quite musical and helped design a house for his sister in Vienna (he designed everything from the heating system to the device for raising and lowering the window blinds to the door handles\u2014he personally oversaw the manufacture and installation of all this). The brilliant philosopher Bertrand Russell clearly considered him a genius and, frankly, was a saint in the degree of his tolerance for Wittgenstein\u2019s volatile temperament and assorted mishegas. I\u2019m not even as smart as Bertrand Russell\u2019s lamest student. ",
