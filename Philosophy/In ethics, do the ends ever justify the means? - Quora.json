            "answer_text": "Means are after all everything. As the means so the end.There is no wall of separation between means and end.Indeed the creator has given us control over means,none over the end. Realisation of goal is in exact proposition to that of the means.This is a proposition that admits of no exception.According to him the means may be likened to a seed,the end to a tree,and there is the same inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree. One of the basic beliefs in Hinduism is the theory of karma .This theory says that every act reproduces the results .So one has to be very careful in their thought,word and deed.The present is the result of the past and future is decided by the present. The only way out of karma is selfless action. In his solution to the problem of means and ends Gandhiji follows this ancient Hindu philosophy. Gita says that man must do his duty,he must not expect the results.He experimented and experienced that the means are important than the end. Gandhiji's ideal seems to be the only right view of the relation between the end and the means.Good means alone can lead us to everlasting peace and progress.Past history teaches us that violence engenders the violence,revenge leads to counter-revenge and a war sows the seeds of further wars. In Hind Swaraj Gandhiji gave an illustration which illustrate how the means is related with end.\u2019If I want to deprive you of your watch ,I shall certainly have to fight for it;If I want to buy your watch ,I shall have to pay for it ;and if I want a gift,I shall have to plead for it;and, according to the means I employ,the watch is stolen property,my own property,or a donation.Thus we see three different means\u2019.In Gandhian philosophy the means and ends are like the two sides of the same coin.They are inseparable from each other. Man can always aim towards the goals.He cannot command it.He can command the means.Means is within the control of the man.
