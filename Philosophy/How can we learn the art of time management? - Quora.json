            "answer_text": " Time Management implies that you have to manage the time that is given to you as though you are reacting to the world. Instead of creating time by controlling how you use it, you are merely trying to adjust to how your schedule fills up throughout the day. By doing this you are avoiding control entirely. So, in the end: Do not try to manage your time. Instead, learn to take control of your day and make the most out of your time. Here\u2019s how: Schedule everything - From the minute you wake up to the minute you go to bed, everything should have a place in your schedule. This includes the productive things as well as the fun things. Control how you use your time, add more fun things when you need to, and learn to schedule the best life possible for yourself!Get busy - The schedule should be filled to the brim. White space in your calendar only invites you to react more to whatever is happening on the outside, which is something you do not want to have happen.Take efficient breaks - Breaks should be no more than 5 minutes, should happen at least once an hour, and involve no distractions. When you take a break, take a break. Get away from everything and allow your mind to rest completely.Do what matters most - Whether you do it now or later, the things that need to get done need to get done. Do yourself a favor and do them first so you don\u2019t have to think about them the rest of the day.Be Present - Be wherever you are. When you are at work, be at work and work. But when you are at home, be at home, not at work! There is a time and place for everything. Leave your work behind when you go home and leave your home behind when you go to work or you will half-ass both things.Plan your boundaries - Plan a minimum and a maximum amount of work in every day. You should always meet the minimum but also be done before you reach your maximum, or else you will get lost in the easier tasks and avoid the more difficult ones.Make it a Science! - Run your own experiments, record the data, analyze it, adapt, and then run a new experiment. This way you will have the actual facts to support your productivity. Record how long certain tasks take you and the changes you make, how much those changes actually help and when you are most productive. Do not leave it up to faith and be objective about it!Plan something Fun in every day - Never wait for the weekend to justify your week. Every day should be amazing and you can plan it to be amazing. Intentionally have things on your calendar that are fun, exciting and that raise your spirits.Do not be run by your schedule - Lastly, the biggest thing you have to know that controlling your time is merely a tool for you to use! It should never use you. Things will go wrong, your schedule will get messed up, and stuff will get in the way. When things go haywire do not feel bound to the schedule you planned, and instead adapt and overcome! You run your schedule, you run your time, and you run your life!",

            "answer_text": " What are the best ways to practice time management? There are many different ways to practice time management. At times the best way to practice may depend on the type of person you are. Time management requires you to become organized, hard working and disciplined. Here are some of the best ways to practice time management. Create a Schedule: Laying out what you have to do can help you better manage your time. By doing so you can make a to-do list and prioritize the tasks you have to get done. Knowing exactly what you have to get done and how to go about accomplishing this is a great way to keep you on track. By getting into a daily routine you will become more efficient and learn how to better practice time management in no time. Get Rid of Distractions: We often go on our phones for what we claim is just a minute but in reality, we lose track of time. When working it is important to hide all distractions. The best thing to do is put your phone on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d so you don't hear it. Also place it away from the space you are working. Your phone will be out of sight and out of mind, leaving you ready to work and better manage your time. Stop Procrastinating: Procrastination is the main reason you are currently struggling to gain a grasp on time management. As humans, we tend to push tasks off until the last minute which then makes us stressed out. In order to make the most of the time you have, you need to stay focused. Learning to stop procrastinating is essential and may take some time. Start working on tasks earlier rather than later to avoid doing them at the last minute and rushing, resulting in stress. This will better your time management skills as you have allocated more time by starting and completing them earlier. Time management is something that will take hard work and time. You should slowly begin starting a routine incorporating all these ideas. By doing so you will better manage your time and hopefully even free up some time for yourself! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to learn time management\u2026. I learned time management by having four jobs and being a full time student. I learned something very important about time management. Use your time wisely. It will help you in the long run. For example, I had four jobs scheduled different times throughout the week. The only day I had off was Sunday. People would ask me why do I carry my school books when I go to work. I reply to them when I am on break or lunch I pull out my notes and books and start studying. I am not going to fall behind in my classes or studies. All of my assignments or projects were due on different days of the week. Sometimes I would slack off on doing homework, but I found my flow and start getting things done. Break down your school assignments throughout the week. If the assignment is assigned a week before and is not due until sometime next week, then read the chapter first, the homework probably has 3 attempts, unlimited attempts, or a time limit. Then read or skim over the notes on what you do not understand. Then attempt the homework again. If this does not work then try the 15 minute or 30 minute rule on what you do not like to do. It's supposed to be the other way around. Why not try something you are not good at and practice that skill to perfection? Time management will help with that. ",

            "answer_text": "I too asked the same question to motivational speakers , read blogs and articles to learn about time management a few years ago. Some said to frame a time table, some said to learn the art of effective usage of time and so on. But somewhere i read that time is a function of mind. Mind is time. It is of paramount importance to learn mind management and not time management. What is time without the mind giving it meaning and value. It is our mind which makes sense of time. Time is just a neutral entity, let's say time doesn't exist at all. It's just our way of knowing the sequence of events or just a clock ticking to go through the future as it unfolds every moment. Successful people manage their mind and in turn their time. We can only manage what's in our control ! Is time in your control ??\u263a No. Time is neither your friend nor your enemy.Time is neutral.Time isn't biased.Time is equal for all.Have you ever asked yourself why time flies when you do something you love and time seems to limp when you are forced to do something you hate ? Its a mind game. Our Mind has this enormous ability to transcend the border of time. Mind has the ability to shorten and lengthen the \u201cduration\u201d . We often fret about not getting enough time ain't it ? It's mind game again. Time is the best reason of mind !! Whenever something isn't accomplished mind blames time. Blame game you know! Mind finds it very easy to ditch time ! Poor time \\U0001f602. Next time you feel you dont have enough time then blame your mind !! Learn a lesson and try mind management. How do successful people get so much time ?? Time , scientifically is a relative concept. It's true in social sense as well. Successful people don't get extra time. Time is obviously equal for all , but time is different for each person.Its the relative quality of time which separates you from people who manage time effectively. Let mind decide what can be done and what cannot. Train it. Discipline is the fundamental of everything.Be proactive.Failing to plan is planning to fail.Don't listen to someone else's definition of time and time management. You are your best manager\u263a. Believe in yourself. Belief gives you wings and wings let you fly high. ",

            "answer_text": "Time is the most precious thing , waste it wisely . Here is a small story which tell you how to manage your time effectively . A philosophy professor stood before his class with some items on the table in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, about 2 inches in diameter. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else.He then asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d said the professor, \u201cI want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things \u2013 your family, your partner, your health, your children \u2013 things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter \u2013 like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else. The small stuff.\u201d \u201cIf you put the sand into the jar first,\u201d he continued \u201cthere is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal. Take care of the rocks first \u2013 the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand. *Thanks for reading *Hope this helped you .

If you plan your things accordingly \u201cjust like Joker did in Dark Knight\u201d, it will be very easy to execute them efficiently. I suggest you some steps that you can follow - Write down every important activity you need to do in a day. Use a paper sheet or mobile note pad is sufficient.Now arrange them according to their priority ( if we talking about office work) or you can arrange them with priority, importance, and your interest ( if we talking about daily work ).If we have things with same priority then finish harder one first so that you feel relief for easier task.Now execution of task. Always do hard thing first. And don't waste too much time on one thing. Take help if you are stuck because taking help is not much embarrassing than not able to do things on given time.Now the time is for feedback. You know it really well that you can't do everything perfectly so list down your mistakes wherever you lacked. List down the acts where you take more than required time so you can eliminate those bugs in furhter installs.Now you are a good product!!! ",

Please notice carefully.  Quadrant I - Urgent and Important. This section comprises of daily urgent & important lifestyle which cannot be skipped at any cost as it's important as well as urgent too. Tasks can include - Scriptural Reading, Meditation [mandatory to make mind quiescent ], Gym[if you're a bodybuilder], Meeting official work deadline, accomplishing instant job that came, answering an urgent call, any unexpected work may come too like emergencies and etc. Quadrant II - Important but Not-Urgent. This section includes your future goals and new skill development plans and learning. These things are accomplished at leisure time to make it full productive it actually secures your future endeavours success. Tasks could include : Course learning, learn new technologies, learn that which is not yet started but you wish to master it can be anything [ coding, meditation, linguistics, vocabulary, reading great book that cannot be missed, sacred scripture to be read and imbibed.] Quadrant III - Not Important but Urgent. This section comprises of some tasks that may come in between suddenly but is not important. Generally this section has to be minimising depending upon the nature of task. Accomplish the right one and discard the spam. Examples : an email, a phone call, or anything, any renewal of insurance, passport application, Fruitful talks, birthday celebration etc ( These tasks may not be goal oriented important but has to be filtered and if urgent and cannot be avoidable this has to be accomplished urgent basis like card payment, passport application, grocery shopping, bill pay or anything. ) Quadrant IV - Not-Important and Not-Urgent. This is a crap and nonsense box, this box tasks has to be nullified and emptyed as soon as possible. learn to say NO to useless things, saying NO is an art[for useless & futile], learn it and practice it. Examples : Avoid party invites from friends for any animalistic enjoyments, surfing useless content on internet which is not at all good for mind neither good for worth time investing, futile argument [ which is biggest time wasting.]  Now after categorising it, I would like conclude this with - our life should revolve in 95% on both Quadrant I and Quadrant II, and 5% in Quadrant III and 0% in Quadrant IV. The quintessence of entire answer was to convey that once you quit from futile argument, useless people, useless contents of social media(unwanted wasted hours), once everything is given up, then will have a lot time for your hobbies, knowledge gain or whatever you privatisated for giving a bogus excuse. Anything and everything can be done can be possible once you reject the nonsense\u2026Example : Einstein was a scientist also he could study Bhagavat Gita and was prominent violinist. How do you think he had done that? Obviously cutting off the useless things, Swami Vivekananda being a monk could master the scriptures as well as the encyclopedia and other books from library.. ",

I\u2019ll let you decide. If you take the high level view, we\u2019re all trying to do more and accomplish more in less time. We believe that the problem is with us, that we\u2019re just not efficient enough. We don\u2019t know the latest and best hacks, perhaps even backed up by a Harvard study or functional MRI scans. Maybe the real problem is we\u2019re simply trying to do too much. We\u2019re trying to be X-Men of productivity. Maybe we need to re-evaluate and consider a more holistic existence and balance our work and family life. In the meantime (since nobody is going to do that) here is a tip.

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t have to study a whole course on time management. Just follow the next 3 simple and easy tips. 1. Do one thing at a time. It\u2019s easy to assume that multitasking can lead to getting more done. But, as studies suggest, it\u2019s exactly the opposite. It damages your brain, lowers IQ, causes memory problems, makes it difficult to learn new things, and can lead to a nervous breakdown. In a nutshell, it works against you. Luckily, this one of the time management tips is easy to follow as you need to stop doing something. 2. Check off completed tasks. Time management 101: Do your to-do-list. Then work on it, every single day. This technique won\u2019t be effective unless you check items off the moment you complete them. That might take some time as it\u2019s easy to get distracted and simply move onto other things. But over time, you\u2019ll learn how to look at your to-do list more often and have an idea of what\u2019s left for the day. So you will be able to manage your time even better depending on what else needs to get done.  3. Learn to say \u2018no\u2019. One of the most powerful time management skills is saying NO. There\u2019s this tendency of being too polite to reject someone\u2019s offer or request, and accepting anything that might seem like an opportunity as we don\u2019t want to miss out on it. So we end up having more than we can handle. Our mind is cluttered and our schedule full. There\u2019s no time to relax, do other activities we enjoy, or even evaluate our progress and optimize our time management. Saying \u2018no\u2019 is important. Even in business. You won\u2019t be able to have many visions for a company at the same time, and working on 5 strategies at once doesn\u2019t give results. In fact, these lead to even more reasons to start procrastinating. ",

            "answer_text": "There definitely is no single answers like a one-size fits all. There are, however, many different ways to help you increase your productivity and get better at managing your time. Having the motivation to do so is certainly the first step. I would suggest starting to use a time management method or tool to get you started. Using a framework helps eliminate some pressure and eases you into a habit. Mostly it isn\u2019t about finding more time to get things done but fixing improper time management. Prioritization is the key. Being able to discern what tasks and activities are urgent and which are important plays a key role. Having test out various time management tools and methods to foster productivity, I would recommend trying the Eisenhower Matrix. The matrix is a simple, yet powerful tool (in my opinion) that aids decision-making through a framework separating urgent from important tasks. It helps us discern which tasks are more profitable in the long-run rather than focusing on short-term tasks that may not produce the best results. By changing my perspective of how I viewed and gave importance to my tasks and activities, I realized that I became more productive (according to my terms). If your goal is to complete as many tasks in a day as possible, then the Eisenhower Matrix might not be the best tool for you. If you are interested in completing tasks that will ultimately benefit your personal or work life by affecting your lifestyle, then give it a try. Using such tools has also helped me be more self-aware and improved my decision making skills. This priority matrix is a great starting point. You can use it as a stepping stone to find a more personalized, better-suited technique. I hope you find the right tool or method that best suits your needs. If you\u2019d like to learn more about the Eisenhower Matrix, feel free to read this blog article on the topic written by my colleague Jessica: https://zenkit.com/en/blog/eisenhower-matrix-increasing-efficiency-via-task-prioritization/ ",

            "answer_text": "Here are ten proven time management skills you should learn today. 1. Set Goals  Goals give you a vision, focus and destination to work towards. They help you have a clear mind on where you want to go and how best to manage your time and resources to get there. By setting goals, you are able to identify what\u2019s worth spending your time on and what\u2019s a distraction to avoid. Start by asking yourself where you want to be in six months time. You can go further and look at where you want to be in the next year or even decade from now. Set personal and professional goals that are realistic and achievable. This is a crucial step toward ensure you manage your time better. 2. Prioritize  Prioritizing cannot be overemphasized when it comes to effective time management. It can be difficult to know what tasks to tackle first, especially when a flood of tasks all seem urgent. It is, however, relatively easy to prioritize activities if you have clear goals already set. Ask yourself three basic questions to know what tasks should take first priority: Why am I doing this task or activity?How does this task help me achieve my goals?To what extent does this task I\u2019m doing help me achieve my goals?Do the most important things first. 3. Keep a Task List  A task list is a reminder system that tells you when you need to do what. Keeping a to-do list helps you remain organized and on top of things. It helps break things down into small, manageable tasks or steps so that you never forget to do the important stuff. Don\u2019t try to remember everything you need to do in your head. In most cases, trying to remember everything won\u2019t work. Instead, keep a to-do list. A simple daily, weekly or monthly planner on a note pad or diary can do. 4. Schedule Tasks  \u201cA schedule defends from chaos and whim,\u201d says author Annie Dillard. If you are a morning person and find you are at your most creative and productive early in the morning, schedule high-value tasks in the morning at your peak creative/productive time. If your creativity and energy picks up when the sun is setting, schedule high priority tasks then. Your \u201cdown\u201d time can be scheduled for less important tasks like checking e-mail or returning phone calls. 5. Focus on One Task at a Time  You get more done in the least time possible when you toggle between talking on your cell phone, browsing the internet and jotting down notes, right? Wrong! According to a study published by the American Psychological Association, you actually spend between 20 and 40 percent more time when you multitask. Besides costing you time and efficiency, multitasking can also reduce the quality of your work. 6. Minimize Distractions  Whether it\u2019s client e-mail alerts, phone calls from friends or IM chats with prospects while working, distractions are a hindrance to effective use of time. Distractions break your concentration, lower your productivity and often prevent you from completing important tasks on time. They can also cause stress. Identify what is distracting you from doing core tasks and put a stop to it. Kill that television and turn off your Internet connection and IM chat. Put up a \u201cDo not disturb\u201d or similar sign at the entrance of your dedicated work space to prevent interruptions. Just do whatever it takes to minimize distractions. This ensures you take control of your days and maximizes your productivity. 7. Overcome Procrastination  Edward Young, the English poet best remembered for Night Thoughts, once said procrastination is the thief of time. Don\u2019t put off tasks that you should be focusing on right now and let procrastination steal your time. Remind yourself that the best time to do somethings is usually NOW. Push yourself a little harder to beat procrastination and get what needs to be done DONE. An effective strategy to beat procrastination is to tell yourself you are only going to embark on a project for a few minutes, say ten minutes. Once you start the project, your creative juices will start flowing. You will then find you want to continue with the task and quite possibly take it to the end. The trick to beat procrastination can be as simple as devoting a small amount of time to start. Just that! 8. Take Breaks  Unless you are Superman, you can\u2019t sustain working long hours on end without burning out and sacrificing on quality. However tempting it may be to work to a deadline for 8-10 hours straight, take breaks in between work. This way you give your brain valuable time to rest and recharge. Taking breaks from work is not time wasting. It is smart time management. You produce top quality work when you are well rested. 9. Say \u201cNo\u201d  One skill that many high achievers like President Obama, Bill Gates and Richard Branson have mastered is the gentle art of saying \u201cno\u201d to things that are not a priority. Saying \u201cno\u201d to things that are not a priority allows you to focus on those things that are really important. You only have exactly 24 hours in a day to do the things that matter. If you don\u2019t learn to say \u201cno\u201d to things that are not important, other peoples\u2019 priorities will precede your own and you will be swamped with far too many projects and commitments. Say \u201cno\u201d amicably to everything that doesn\u2019t support your values or help you achieve your goals. You have the right to say \u201cno\u201d no matter who you are talking to. When you get better at saying \u201cno,\u201d you put you time to good use and defend yourself from rushed work, poor performance and work overload. 10. Delegate Tasks  The old adage by 17th century author John Donne that no one is an island still holds true today. You can\u2019t manage everything on your own. Sometimes it is prudent to let other people help you with tasks, especially when you are swamped. You save time, reduce stress and accomplish a lot more when you assign tasks to the right people. Relinquish your grip on the wheel and grant authority with responsibility to qualified people. Delegating is not dumping. Give tasks with consequences. This way you promote accountability and ensure goals and deadlines are met. ",

            "answer_text": "I would also wholeheartedly recommend the Pomodoro Technique. Like Shannice, I\u2019ve been able to successfully use the Pomodoro Technique to increase my personal productivity by an amazing amount. (Here are some answers about why I love it so much). I\u2019d just like to expand a little bit on why it can help you develop effective time management skills: 1. As a Pomodoro user, you become very good at estimating how long tasks will take to complete. You become proficient at recognizing which tasks should take priority, and scheduling them into your day. You practice these skills each day when you write out your list of tasks for your Pomodoro sessions. 2. It also makes you better at time management because you are working with time, you\u2019re not working against it. If that makes any sense. You\u2019re not racing against the clock to complete a never ending to-do list. You\u2019re taking control of your schedule. 3. Additionally, because of the way it allows you to quantify your work, the longer you use the Pomodoro technique, the better you become at noticing how different things affect your productivity. You start to notice that your energy slumps after lunch and you just don\u2019t have the mental stamina to complete a Pomodoro. You recognize that you can get more pomodoro sessions done if you work out in the mornings. Maybe Sunday night is actually your most productive time! 4. Learning to use Pomodoro also teaches you that you shouldn\u2019t feel constrained by the 9\u20135 schedule your job might set for you. Lastly, Pomodoro shouldn\u2019t be used for everything - it requires a lot of focus and can be quite energy intensive. Answering emails and attending meetings are not the sort of activities you need to Pomodoro. But any task that requires creative thinking or problem solving is perfect for it. Here\u2019s how to use the Pomodoro technique (from here): Write out your tasks in time blocks.Start a timer for 25 minutes.Focus on your first task for those 25 minutes (don\u2019t check email, don\u2019t respond to Facebook messages - remove all distractions).Take a 5 minute break. (Now you can check Facebook ;)Repeat!Simple as that! ",

Where do you spend time? How much time do you spend on social media? On which app? Doing what? Connecting with home? And then decide if it is actually helping you and to what extent? Bringing clarity and awareness to your actions with the best method to harness the little amount of time that you have been provided. What I have started lately Ive started documenting where I am Spending My Time. I noted down on a piece of paper and review it every few days. It slowly helps me focus my actions and efforts in the right direction without being too hard on myself which is usually the case when we are following The Other route of managing time. ",

The Pomodoro Method is a time management philosophy that aims to give the user maximum focus and encourage creativity, which (ideally) will allow them to complete projects faster. You basically work in short sprints, which helps to make sure you're consistently productive. For example, you work for 25 minutes, then take a five minute break. If you have a lot on your to-do list, using the Pomodoro Method can help you crank through projects faster by forcing you to adhere to a strict timing schedule. There\u2019s quite a few apps built based on the technique. The one I use is web based, but there are plenty of mobile friendly options. I\u2019ve been able to greatly increase my personal productivity by following this method. ",

I will just explain it with an example that I give to IIT JEE Aspirants: Time Management: Never look at what the clock is ticking.. You should study in a target based manner. A good candidate should do atleast 120-150 questions per day (PCB Combined) (and whatever time it takes. If it takes 2 hours, well enough. Enjoy after that. But if it requires whole day, be ready to give it. After all, its about your dream and your whole life!) . And every week, one should revise all his/her self made notes. If that happens whole year, marks my words: Result is guaranteed.. J Also, don\u2019t be so harsh on yourself. Life is a combination of being rigid and being flexible. You can take a day off every week in this process. That\u2019s not a problem at all. Mind should be happy too.. Otherwise if you just overuse it without giving it enjoyment and rest, then one day your mind will ditch you! It won\u2019t listen to you ! So keeping the mind happy is also very imp. Also from every chapter atleast 150-200 questions are a must to gain confidence.. Best Wishes :) ",

Be Organized. With a better organization, you will be on top of things from day one and won\u2019t have to cram to the deadline. I know it sounds too easy, but it really is the secret to success. A timetable that is too demanding will cause you stress and tasks will pile up before you know it. So keep it simple and plan according to the time you have available. Create a daily checklist that you can also integrate with your time tracking app. Prepare it the shift before or a week ahead. Plan the time and day for those meetings or client calls. It is also a good idea to build rewards into your timetable to act as a motivator. It is best to keep learning on how you can learn and improve your own time management skills. This will greatly benefit you in the future. ",

He wrote down everything I did and how much time it took; then sat down with me for two hours discussing my work habits and my priorities (at work and in life in general). I had read many books on this, and the one that was most helpful to me specifically was Personal Efficiency Program, by Kerry Gleeson. Look it up and see if it would suit you or not. ",
