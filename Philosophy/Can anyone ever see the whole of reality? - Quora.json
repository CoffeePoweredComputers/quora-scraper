            "answer_text": "If we believe that the \u201cUnified Theory Of Everything\" physicists are actively researching is a possibility, then the \u201cwhole of reality\" should be able to be \u201cseen\" as a quantifiable algorithmic equation describing a \u201cbase/fundamental/foundational process\u201d. I believe it is possible. The next question should be, is it probable? I agree that it is. There is ample documented evidence that describes similar processes between disparate mechanism/devices/items all the way to the largest cosmological object, and down to the smallest. There should be a guiding simplicity to all of it, and I believe it can be found in 1 and 0. ",

            "answer_text": "No, from my view the whole reality can't be seen or felt. Because every action has so many sides of it. For example : Something had done by someone and seen by another one. That \u201csomething\u201d is different for both of them. To discuss about real life, whenever I get some coins immediately I give the coin to some beggar or someone in need of that. I usually don't keep coins. Maybe for someone who noticed it thinks I am a very kind hearted person who likes to help the poor. But for me its just that I dont like to keep coins with me! Even if someday anyone will ask me about this, maybe I will not open up the real fact! So one cant find the whole reality from what he has seen or felt! ",

As it is, we only see the light reflected off the surface of objects, and we also see light directly from sources like the Sun or a lamp (lightbulb). But we can feel reality. Our bodies are real and when we feel them, we are feeling reality. The more we can feel our bodies, the more we feel the whole of reality, as our bodies are integral parts of that whole. There is no border between what is \u201cinside\u201d and what is \u201coutside\u201d; it is one contiguous reality, and we can feel that. Not easily, though. It takes special training and years of practice. ",
