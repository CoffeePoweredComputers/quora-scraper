            "answer_text": "Nooooo. What is wrong with people nowadays?! You can definitely try, but so will many others. Do you really think that most children who try to play football will become Lionel Messi?! I was born with two left feet. If I were to spend all awake time practicing football I would still not even be worthy of a slot in an EFL Championship team. I mean, I enjoyed playing football and wasn\u2019t horrible at it, but it was mainly because of having strong legs, being tall, being fairly agile while running, having very good explosion/acceleration and so on. But when it comes to actually attempting a long pass \u2026 it\u2019s sheer luck if it meets the destination. It might reach the guy, it might not \u2026 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t ponder, I\u2019m just kicking it and hoping for the best. Point being, you need to be realistic and to know your talents and your shortcomings. Trying to do something you don\u2019t have a good foundation for is just a waste of time. Not to mention we also need to evaluate what others want to be. If we all want to be actors \u2026 who will pay us to see the movies?! The world needs plumbers, roofers, carpenters, software engineers, medics, architects and so on. We need to split work and specialise to conquer it. As technology and software engineering evolves, more and more work can be covered by machines and automated, which leaves people in need to respecialise to expand their skillset. You need to look at society realistically, through the eyes of what we want to achieve and how we split and coordinate the efforts to achieve it. This cliche of \u201cYou can be anything you want to be\u201d needs to stop. Sure, you should try it, you should have a very disciplined and passionate go at it. But you shouldn\u2019t invest time in some pipe dream. It\u2019s much more important to understand the FUNDAMENTALS of life, society, economy and human/social evolution. That way you will understand that all these dreams that are being nicely packed and sold to you are just a means for some rich bastards to make even more money off you spending time in wishful thinking and buying their dreams. Have a thirst to understand, nurture your curiosity \u2026 do what you love. But don\u2019t think you necessarily can be anything you want to be. You can definitely get pretty far with a disciplined and passionate approach, but so will others ",

You will often come across such \u201cmotivation\u201d and \u201cinspiration\u201d. Not all are true. So how do you know? You can look at others\u2019 experiences, apart from acquiring your own, as sometimes it is too costly, or impractical to test everything you hear yourself. So in this instance, you can google what people say about trying to be anything. Do they succeed or not, and what are the reasons, etc. Then, of course, I am sure you know you have limitations, be it physical, intellectual or financial, or personality, etc. There are some who think these are not limitations, and to be anything including being someone who you are not also. What do you think for yourself? Finally apart from abilities, the other consideration is wisdom. Sure even if you can be anything, how do you choose or select one over another? You just do not have the resources, time and effort, etc, to keep trying be anything. You probably need to focus also in order to be the thing you want to be. But where and what do you focus? How do you get the knowledge and wisdom to know which has the greatest chance of success? Or again all these don\u2019t matter? Whatever you put your heart, mind and muscle to it, you will achieve it? Again this is something you have to think about for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean that literally, of course not. You can't just decide that you will be a horse. If you are white you can't make yourself black or vice versa. If you're a man you can't turn yourself into a woman or vice versa. Etc, etc. More realistically, if you mean, Can I achieve any goal in life that I want?, the answer is that there are many things that you can achieve, but some are more realistic than others. If you want to be a very good basketball player, you can probably achieve that by training and practice. But if you want to be the star player of a professional team ... no one can promise that you can achieve that. If you were born with all the right attributes AND you work harder than anyone else, maybe so. Theoretically, any American can grow up to be president. But realistically, if you're not a good public speaker, good at making friends, good at making deals, and rich, your chances of becoming president are just about zero. Not to be a downer. I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from pursuing realistic goals. But what's realistic depends on how hard you are willing to work and what resources you have available. I think a classic challenge in life is choosing the right goals. If you set goals that are too low, than even if you achieve them, so what? I recall a friend of a friend saying that her goal was to become the manager of a McDonalds. Not just any employee, mind you, but the MANAGER. On the other hand if you set goals that are too difficult, you could spend years of your life chasing a hopeless dream. The trick is to set goals that are high enough to be worth pursuing but low enough to be possible. That said, there's an old saying, \"Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're probably right.\" ",

You cannot become a wizard or a witch no matter how many times you wave your wand. These are things that are unattainable through the wall we call reality. At the same time, our society will dictate where we go in life. As you grow up, you will constantly be told what you should do, where you should go to college. While you believe the decision is fully yours, it is usually the manifestation of a dream someone else has for you. You're place in society is determined by your grades and behavior. Bad grades and bad attitude? I guess you'll just drop out of school and become a bum. We are told by our limitations and our limiters what we can do. It is unfair, but that is life. However\u2026 There is always light in the darkness. Sure, we are told again and again that we cannot do that but we can do this, but just because that is what we are told, doesn't mean that is what we do. If you really, truly, want to do something, I believe that you can achieve it. Your achievement may not be what you were expecting, but whatever it is you were meant to do, you will do it. I believe in fate, but not entirely. I believe that there are things you are fated to do. There are people you are fated to meet. However, I also believe that your journey is not fated. The path you take is entirely your decision. While you will end up wherever you are meant to be, how you got there is completely up to you. To answer your question, Can you truly be whatever you want to be? I think so\u2026 Yes. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is simply no. I believe this is a dangerous paradigm especially prevalent in the West in the last several decades of parenting. Not only does it ignore questions such as what should we strive to be, it also tends to destroy a sense of direction, which I feel is one of the most important psychological tasks for any parent in helping their children to develop. That\u2019s not to say a parent should dictate, but I do believe it is the job of a good parent to be close enough to - and observant enough of - their child as they develop to insert their wisdom/common sense to help guide that child in making smart choices about their future. Wanting your child to feel good is one thing, but when encouragement comes at the expense of reality, it can actually hurt children in the long run. All you need to do is take a look around at the societal problems we have today, and then look to the millions of children who started growing up 20 years ago in \u201ceveryone gets gold stars\u201d and \u201ceveryone wins\u201d classrooms.

            "answer_text": "I believe we can if we don\u00b4t need others to validate or acknowledge our choice. I mean, being something is acting as if you were that thing already. Just start being whomever it is you want to be and all of a sudden, you are! If you want to be a gardener, start gardening, if you want to be a writer, start writing. Now, if you need a certificate of some kind, then it may not be an overnight change but you can always move in that direction so someday you\u00b4ll eventually become what you have chosen to be, like a doctor or an astronaut. The key here is to believe because life happens at least 70% inside of us first. Everything that is real once only existed inside somebody\u00b4s mind. So if there\u00b4s a WANT inside you, that\u00b4s probably you already are. We must be careful though, if you\u00b4re not very connected with yourself you may misinterpret you WANT, like, there are people that want to become millionaires but when they finally do, they\u00b4re miserable. I believe that happens because they misinterpret what they wanted, they didn\u00b4t really want to accumulate lots and lots of pieces of paper. They were probably after respect, appreciation, maybe even freedom. Also, being what you want may not mean that you\u00b4ll become a billionaire just because you\u00b4re doing it, but I promise you\u00b4ll be rich nonetheless. ",

Step 1>  Set your goal and type of goal. It is long term or short term what kind of goal this is. Why did you choose this ask to your self about it. Why do you want it? Be sure completely before taking next step, if you need some time then give some time to your self. And then be sure, this is your final goal. Step 2>  Prepare a list of challenges which you will face when you will work for chasing your goals. Think about both aspect positive possibilities and negative possibilities of your goal and prepare upcoming challenges list. This list will help you to be confident for challenging phase. Step 3 >  Remember your goal and more than a goal, remember today's task which are mandatory, make a priority list of today's tasks these tasks should be finished within set time limit. If, you don't remember your daily goals, then you will not able to give priority to mandatory tasks because daily task will help you to reach on next level day by day. Step 4 >  There must be a requirement of many skills to chase your goal. So, analyze your goal and prepare that skill set which is mandatory. Because to do anything in life we need many skills, so become better in some necessary skills on priority like, below skills. How to set goals Analysis skills Management skills Required soft skills Required hard skills Problem solving skills Creative thinking Stress handling skills People skills These are just an example of skill set. So, prepare your own skill set as per your goals. And make a tracker which can help you to track your progress easily on regular basis. And you can get your own feedback of weakness and strength. Note: You can find similar lines easily on internet but, reading things and implementing them both are different things. So, try to be consistent. I hope it must help you! ",

Eventually, I quit trying to be mythic things, and I concentrated on doing what I liked at the moment \u2014 and that led me in some amazing directions, about which I had never thought.

Few days went by when staff members had run to prevent patrons, who were probably high on LSD, from trying to fly off the second floor balcony! If they did, they would injure or kill themselves! So in that sense you cannot do whatever you want! However, if you DESIRE some particular field of enterprise, and if you are willing to work for it, it\u2019s surprising what we\u2019re capable of! However, there are still certain limitations. If someone can\u2019t carry a tune, they don\u2019t go into opera. If someone suffers from any form of mental retardation, they shouldn\u2019t do games based on quick mental abilities, and the like! ",

            "answer_text": "I believe God has a plan for me from the beginning of time. Of course, it can be altered along the way since sometimes I feel like there's some life events that happened probably for a good reason which I never saw coming. Now I treat it as a good thing- a continous learning process (surely, God is preparing me for something that lies ahead) because if my life glided so smoothly without the sudden dips, I wouldn't have undergone those intense impactful life experiences that changed me the person I am today. So in a way, yes. But I feel like it starts with believing in yourself and then finding that confidence within me. I'm sure on the first, it won't be perfect but I feel like that's expected. That is what it allows me to approach things differently the next time I'm caught in the same situation. Having a close relation with God I found to be equally important because God is beautiful and amazing. He works in mysterious ways. I learned that \u2018Timings everything\u2019, (it can apply to my love life or just about anything) God knows what the extent of what I can handle, so I believe it's okay to take some risks and be daring, but most importantly allowing God into my life is the best thing I can do.

But I just think that in certain circumstances other things/issues come in to play that to be perfectly honest prevent a person from being who they truly want to be. Like for example, what about a person in Africa who dreams of coming to America to start her own business, but in truth she has to deal with how to get food and water every day and constantly worrying about getting some disease and taking care of her children as well. I mean its not like a green card and plane ticket for her and her whole family is just gonna fall into her lap not to mention the language barrier and the education barrier too!! I mean I feel for these people but if I have to be honest they just don't have the means to be whoever they want to be and its terrible but true!! And it doesn't just happen in 3 world countries either, some kids are just dealt a bad hand when it comes to parents. I mean what do you expect a child to do do when either the mother or the father is completely out of the picture and the other parent is a complete drug addict who can't take care of themselves let alone a child. The only choice the kid has unfortunately is to presuse illegal ventures just to be able to eat at night!! And your trying to tell me that they have the choice to be whoever they want to be? Ha I doubt it. They're lucky to even come out with a GED. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It\u2019s a foolish statement that has brought many people heart ache. This does not mean that there are a great many things you can do and there are many things you could do if only you made the effort to do them. However that said if you are not gifted at math you will likely never be a physicist. I once watched a comedian who let\u2019s just say was calorically challenged. He made one joke where he said he was a body builder and pulled back his sport jacket so his stomach that was hanging over his paints/belt could be seen, then he said \u2018I didn\u2019t say I was a very good one\u2019 everyone laughed because as a joke this is funny. But as a life choice, that is to pursue a goal/profession you are wholly unsuited for is a tragic waste of time, effort, energy, and heart. We all really need to be circumspect about our own limitations and abilities. As inspector Callaghan/aka Dirty Harry played by Clint Eastwood said \u2018a man has got to know his limitations\u2019. Doing so does not mean you are giving up rather it means you are in touch with the skills you do and don\u2019t possess and the skills you are likely to be able ton develop and those that are beyond your grasp. For instance as a man of average height (I am 5\u20198\u201d) and below average athletic skills I accepted long ago I was never going to be neither a jokey or the starting center for an NBA team. I am not a failure because of this acceptance and many other obvious limitations I am rather self aware. I am all for people pursuing difficult goals as doing so adds energy to life. But tilting at wind mills in an effort to do something you clearly do not have the capacity to do is another matter. ",

Also, continue to be flexible as you move along your path and one thing more. Ask the Universe, Higher Power, however you may characterize the Infinite Intelligence, that your entire process be for the highest good of all concerned. As you go along your path, what you want may change (new information, learning). That\u2019s where flexibility is important. Invoking the highest good is like an insurance policy that what comes forward will be the best from that higher perspective. Also, as things manifest along the way, make sure to express your gratitude as you accomplish the steps on the way to your goal. People often forget this because things may not appear exactly as they wanted. Being grateful aligns you with the energies and results you want more of. ",

My parents never believed I was capable of anything and I have a constant battle to cancel that stuff. Honestly!! Maybe I didn't achieve high academic grades, but I have written over 2000 poems and won first prizes for my hand embroidery..and I surprised myself the other day by achieving a 90percent aggregate in the course i did at Bible School. It's not about what others say about me, but what God knows I'm capable of\u2026in HIM I can do all things! (By faith!!!),.
