            "answer_text": "About karma, I think it is very complex than \"what you do, it comes back to you\". I will explain my understanding with a scenario. Consider you are in a location where a Tiger is chasing a deer to hunt. You can do 2 things. 1) Help the deer to run away from the hands of Tiger 2) Help Tiger to hunt it down. Answer is if we help deer then it is good karma else bad. Is it really???I don't think there is something like good or bad karma. It works like this If you help deer, as you understood the value of life. Karma will not give an experience of someone playing with your life. But at the same place we r pulling the food of Tiger from its mouth and even it dies if it won't eat any. So, you don't know the value of lack of food then karma will make sure you experience it due to the decision taken. If second is taken, that is help tiger. Now, karma see the value of food in you. But also finds the lack of importance to life. Karma see to it that you taste that pain definitely. Then why do we call good karma or bad. Now it is totally a different perception. We(humans) like to see someone gain something directly if we help. (Like deer is alive, its the result of my decision. Yes I'm happy. So ai did good karma). There are indirect helps, like helping Tiger would seem cruel directly but becos of it, now Tiger's family has food without which they would have died. But this thought is indirect , So it became bad karma And other became good karma for us. ",

            "answer_text": "following dharma is good karma and following adharma is bad karma. The concept of Dharma \u2026 (Excerpt from message of Shri Datta Swami) Word Dharma means characteristic property which stands for identification of an item. Dharma of fire is burning by which it is identified as fire. It is expected natural behavior of an item in creation. If fire is cool, such coolness is Adharma which means that it is not the expected property of specific entity. Human being in this creation is a specified entity & is expected to show certain characteristic properties (Dharmas) by which he is identified as human being. If human being shows characteristic properties of other specified items, it loses its identification. When God created various items in this world, He has assigned certain characteristic properties to be associated with corresponding items. So, possession of Dharma is will of God. Balance of creation is maintained when specified items exhibit their specified properties assigned by God. All inert items like fire, water etc. are strictly following will of God. God created this universe for entertainment. Entertainment is disturbed if natural balance is upset. God has given freedom to human beings, which is inherent desire of souls. God has full freedom to change any characteristic property of any specified item. When He wished, fire could not burn, air could not move & water could not quench even a dry grass blade. Since He is omnipotent, He has unlimited freedom. But souls have very little potentiality. Their freedom is naturally conditional & limited. Living being has little freedom within its specified boundary of its potentiality. If freedom is not given, it is not a living being. Among living beings, human being has full potentiality due to analytical faculty (Buddhi) & thus relatively more freedom is granted to it. Human being should understand limits of its capability & should freely behave within that specified boundary. Such behavior is Dharma which is expected by God. If limits are violated & behavior of some other category like animals is shown, soul is pushed into life cycle of animals. posted by: surya (disciple of Swamiji) Universal Spirituality for World Peace ",
