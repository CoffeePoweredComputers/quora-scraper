            "answer_text": "No. Math is the language of proportions physical and dynamic. It could be thought of as a philosophy in the sense that the agreed construction and syntax have become critical to our investigation, understanding and manipulation of this physical universe. At this point, there are six major algorithms: ArithmeticAlgebraTrigonometryGeometryCalculusQuantum MechanicsGoogle Image Result for https://d2jmvrsizmvf4x.cloudfront.net/8c9ZSb2gTVyOySRFWt08_8978fdd9b6b0ec277851c26f4d921f35.jpg As we, humans discover more complex patterns in nature, we amend the language to describe those patterns. Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. It is effective in describing \u201ccontinuous\" patterns of \u201cexponential\u201d behavior. Generally, there are five patterns tha present shapes on a Cartesian coordinate system: LineCircleEllipseParabolaHyperbolaThe mathematical display of each pattern is dependent on \u201ccontinuity\" of the underlying mechaism. A point in the domain (input) of the mathematical statement (equations) must correspond to every infinitesimal point in the range (output). That works theoretically, but patterns in nature involve entities of fixed constant value. Therefore, infinity is not going to be present in the range of any physical phenomena. That's the case with the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by matter in the ultraviolet range. In fact, the calculus algorithm predicted an astronomically high heat output, which was not what was observed in the laboratory. Without an accurate mathematical tool to predict the amount of heat output for radiation input, engineering of microwave ovens (or anything else) was impossible. Ultraviolet catastrophe - Wikipedia Max Planck deduced that the underlying mechanism was not continuous, but based on the absorption of a base wavelength of radiation or its whole number multiple. To describe this behavior accurately, he had to develop an alternate branch of calculus called differential calculus. Because it is so useful in describing the interaction between matter and energy at the subatomic level, physicists like to call it Quantum Mechanics. Without it, engineering anything electronic would be impossible. Max Planck - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "I would differ from the other answerers by stating that that the answer to your question is an unqualified maybe. When a scientist or engineer uses math, they\u2019re using a logical language as a means of tackling a physical problem (in, say, quantum physics) or of calculating numerical details for an artifact (say, a new airfoil). Where philosophy enters the picture is in the question of what we can know with mathematical certainty\u2014even what \u201cmathematical certainty\u201d really means. I maintain that the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of language are closely related. This is a big subject, so I\u2019ll stop here and refer you to Uncle Wiki.
