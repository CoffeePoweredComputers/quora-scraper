            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question. Consciousness is defined as:\u201dthe state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings.\u201d Of coarse all life on earth is conscious by definition. Human beings have become self conscious over 50,000 years ago. [Australian aboriginal people were]. It is ironic that many educated people are not as self aware as the indigenous people were before the white man got involved. We can all easily become self aware of our stage of consciousness development by letting go of limiting beliefs and expanding our mind to consider what is real. It seems real to me that the universe is multidimensional and thus light is also. Light is the substance of all matter in our three dimensional reality so it seems logical that it would be in a multidimensional reality. I associate light with mind and consciousness. If I am in a pitch black room with no source of light I can easily light up my mind with anything I want to imagine.I can do it in color and sound if I desire. Mind is a luminous,reflective all pervasive force so that could be where the light comes from and consciousness allows me to become aware of my imagination. It seems a reasonable probability that a multidimensional universe of light is also one of consciousness. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems that the change from matter to living matter happens in a virus it spits life out as it evolves driven by energy seeking the most efficient use of itself, consciousness awareness of energy efficiency is emergent from life and cognition comes with a CNS. There is a 100% chance that there is other life in the universe at any give time, it may only last a a few seconds or longer, the chance of a species like us evolving is much slimmer it takes an incredible amount of luck. Once a species develops an IQ like a human then this mixes with its lower animal fear brain structures generating anxiety, most other mental illness, sin, evil and all human made suffering, the chance of a species overcoming this and self-evolving is before it uses up all its luck is slim. EGMi maximises use of the left logical/positive brain with a feeling of oneness/inner-happiness, we could be the first species to overcome anxiety and be the best species in the universe the \u201c left brain movement \u201c is here.
