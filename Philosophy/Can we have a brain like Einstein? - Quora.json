            "answer_text": "Brains are like fingerprints, they are unique. General intelligence is measured by IQ, but that's oversimplification. According to this Research, Einstein's IQ was 160. If that's about correct, there are hundreds of thousands of people with the same or higher IQ as Einstein's. I think Howard Gardner (Theory of Multiple Intelligences) is right, our intelligence can't be defined by a single number. It's a constellation of abilities. Each ability has grown differently depending on nature (genetic makeup) and nurture (environmental exposure). Like many seeds, each having a growth potential, and each fertilized and watered differently depending on one's particular experiences, interests and training. The end result, your current brain, can still be shaped by how you nurture it (with knowledge I mean), and how you use it. If we knew exactly how was Eintein's brain's configuration of abilities, we could try to nurture (or atrophy) the ones in us that are dissimilar to Einstein's. But it would be very hard to do it if your seeds tend to grow differently. I'd rather embrace my uniqueness, and do the best I can with what I have been given. ",

            "answer_text": "We actually do have an IQ matching Einstein's. It is called as the Flynn effect. The Flynn Effect deals with the issue of how the general IQ scores of a population change over time. The result was a growth in the average IQ. This means we have a higher IQ compared to our grandparents and, for some of us, even more than Albert Einstein. ",
