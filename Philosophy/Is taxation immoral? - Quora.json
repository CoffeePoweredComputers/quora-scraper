            "answer_text": "It depends, there are several variables in taxes, like, where does it go to? How much does it affect your life? How much is enough? Is the government\u2019s spending really influenced by the People or special interests such as bankers and big corporations? It is technically immoral to take money away with the threat of force and redistribute it to what the government sees fit, the biggest arguments is that it goes into \u201cgood\u201d things such as roads, parks, and nature maintaining, schools, police, military etc. However what if it\u2019s used for immoral actions. What if people want to decide they can defend themselves against both domestic and foreign threats and rather not be forcefully secure by police and military(which is worse than the police when on public grounds in terms of your rights) or if the military is used for immoral actions What if the education system is not good What if you\u2019re not for abortion(taxes pay some of this) What if government spending is out of hand or being used for silly things You can\u2019t just opt out without being fined, being arrested for not paying that fine, resisting that arrest and get injured or even killed by government agents(police or other enforcers) It is immoral unless you have the power to change how taxes work like if the People which are critical thinkers and moral individuals truly have utmost power in government, rather than corruption and government should be small to keep the people free or you can leave the nation in peace without paying a dime in any fees. Also it is harder to build a business with government(the taxes) on your neck. Are they charging too much, is the money going into good, unfortunately the answer is a hybrid yes/no One thing to learn is that you should ALWAYS question things, it is an essential part of critical thinking and freedom, without questions or resistance, the people will be slaves whether in physical form or in debt form ",

            "answer_text": "I say no, it\u2019s not. Taxation is a necessary attribute of having governmental services, and some of those services are rather vital to having health, prosperity, freedom, and safety. There certainly can be arguments about the best form of a taxation system. But I\u2019d find life somewhat inconvenient without roads, bridges, public transit, safe food and drugs, labor laws, police, firemen, sewer systems, public health departments, public education, traffic signals, weather warnings, military defense, a court system, currency, product safety laws, and much more that is funded by taxation. And I think we\u2019d find that without these, immorality would increase rather than decrease. ",
