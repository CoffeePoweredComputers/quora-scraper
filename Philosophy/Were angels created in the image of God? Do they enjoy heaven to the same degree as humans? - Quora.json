            "answer_text": "No there are huge differences between angels and humans. They are created perfect for a very specific task. They will do that for an enormous length of time. They do progress but it's incredibly slow compared with our potential to progress. We on the other hand are created with the minimum of faculties but with unlimited poterntial. We get there only by virtue of our own efforts. Angels do not live in the spirit heavens, they would be in the Kingdom of God. Only those of us that follow a path of rebirth by spirit reach that heaven. While I can't know what levels of happiness each experiences I understand the more you advance the greater it is. It is likely that most humans will not reach the Kingdom of God and thus will not experience the same degree of happiness as angels. ",

            "answer_text": "Angel is not their nature, it is their vocation. Angels are like God in that they are pure spirit. 1/3 of the angels fell before they ever saw God and are in hell. The rest of the angels behold the Face of God. It would seem that God has raised men up above angels. He saw fit to come and die for us, and He put His mother as Queen of heaven, thus raising a human being above the angels. The angels, are servants meant to serve man, that is why we are all given a Guardian Angel who will be with us for all eternity, unless we have the misfortune to cast ourselves into hell. ",
