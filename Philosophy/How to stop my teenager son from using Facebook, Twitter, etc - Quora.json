            "answer_text": "Hi thanks for asking. Ummm\u2026. Why do you want him to?? Its totally fine to use those until he isn't in trouble.(hacking,cyber buylling and all) If you want him to stay away from it and study or maybe use it a little less often then I have an answer to that because telling to just NOT USE IT AT ALL\u2026 it won't work right now like not in a day or two. So,if he is studying,you can tell him to study and do all of his homework after coming home from school,then tell him to go and play OUTSIDE and then tell him to use the phine at night for maybe 2 hours. At first, he would not like it or even shout at you or fight with you asking why but then tell him that studies are important. He will understand eventually. Plzzz don't confiscate his phone or don't tell to stay away with his phone during all the weekdays because thats what I have to do and I HATE IT. A person can't study EVERY MINUTE OF HIS LIFE. We need a break. We need to take to our friends. Or else,he would feel verrrrryyyyyy lonely and sad. Then maybe he wouldn't tell you a lot of things he wants to becayse he might think that you don't want hm to share anything or talk to anyone. Studies are veryyyy important but his happiness and well being comes first.BTW BY SCHOOL I MEAN, IF YOUR SON IS IN 9 OR 10 GRADE BECAUSE THATS WHEN THEY START USING ALL THESE. If he is a little older then you can't really take his phone because\u2026 its his phone. You can distract him by talking to him about anything.. Maybe asking him about his friends,how his day went. Or maybe GET A PET. If he likes pets then get one. He will then care for the pet rather than being on his phone.(I also want one). Don't get a fush or something because they are just too easy to keep. Get a pet of his choice. Or you can tell him to go to some sport's classes.If he likes reading then get books. Trust me,nowadays at this age a phone is a MUST and social media too(I don't have any except Quora because I wasn't allowed from the very beginning like when I first got the phone). It is gonna be very difficult and maybe your son won't like it at first but we all kniw that there are things which are important other than phones. Thats all. Thanks again. Byeee -Lara ",
