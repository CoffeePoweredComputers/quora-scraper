            "answer_text": "The perfection that can be achieved is good. (By definition the best!) However, there is a saying that the perfect is the enemy of the good. By which is meant that measures that would improve things now and can be put into practice are frustrated by people who want to hold out for the best possible result. I believe there is an example in the history of healthcare reform in the US when a deal similar to the ACA was refused because more radical reformers persuaded Senator Ted Kennedy to hold out for a single payer system..

            "answer_text": "Perfection is a concept that can be strive for but never achieved. There's nothing wrong with trying to be perfect. But if someone becomes obsessed with the idea, I would see a problem in that because it's a hopeless goal.  I would instead suggest working hard towards being more perfect in everything you do. We all should strive to be better. But knowing your limits will help you keep your sanity in tact. ",
