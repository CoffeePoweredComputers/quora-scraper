            "answer_text": "The most important topic in philosophy is ethics, how we ought to live. There are three primary frameworks for ethics: consequentialist, non-consequentialist, and agent-based theories. This topic serves as the foundation for everything else that follows in philosophy and in life. The first framework is best exemplified by the Utilitarian approach, which basically means that one should act to maximize the greatest good for the greatest number of people. \u201cThe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one\u201d is a quote which reflects this way of thinking. This is a very popular framework that many people follow without really thinking about it. This however goes against individual rights, because let\u2019s say the majority decides that slavery is moral. The 80% of some race (whites) decide that the 20% of blacks should be enslaved to improve the lives of all whites. In this ethical framework, slavery is tolerated and justified. Or perhaps 51% of women decide that 49% of men should be enslaved. The same logic holds that this is moral. Of course we know it\u2019s not, but according to the Utilitarian approach, it fits. The non-consequentialist framework is best exemplified by Kant\u2019s deontological approach. His categorical imperative states that one should \u201cAct only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law\u201d. This means that you never lie, cheat, of steal under any circumstances or for any reason. Even if your life or your family\u2019s lives depend on it, Kant says it\u2019s never acceptable. Otherwise the entire framework breaks down, and we are all the subject to the whims and passions of the moment. The agent-based framework, my favorite, is best exemplified by Aristotle\u2019s Virtue Ethics approach. This framework states that one should according to the virtues of a man who lives a good and decent life. Life is not defined by any one decision, but rather by the entirety of a man\u2019s life. For example, if a known murderer escapes from prison and comes to your home looking for your family, and says he is going to kill them, then it\u2019s acceptable to lie, because the murderer is not acting ethically and you are justified in lying to save their lives. Aristotle discusses the Golden Mean, which is the sweet spot for any virtue, between an excess and an absence of that virtue. Courage is a virtue, but an excess of that leads to being foolhardy, whereas an absence leads to cowardice. The extremes are to be avoided. Living a good and decent life requires you to constantly search for that golden mean in your life. Ayn Rand further developed this framework with her Objectivist philosophy, as exemplified in her works of fiction, Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, as well as her non-fiction, Philosophy: Who Need It, and others. Aristotle developed his three Laws of Thought, which still hold as the gold standard for logic and truth-seeking. Here are two good starting points: A Framework for Making Ethical Decisions Virtue Ethics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) There are of course minor theories and frameworks, but these are the big ones. This series on the Crash Course YouTube channel does a good job of introducing the topics: Philosophy (Metaethics, the study of ethics) Philosophy (Kant\u2019s categorical imperative) Philosophy (Utilitarianism) Philosophy (Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics) This is my favorite topic in philosophy and from my decades of studying meta ethics and the various philosophers and frameworks, I boil it down to the two giants in the field, Plato and Aristotle. Plato believed in the Forms, which was his idea that the world as we see it is simply a shadow or representation of reality, and the true objects in existence are held in another plane of existence. His Allegory of the Cave is the best explanation of this idea. The Matrix, The Village, The Giver, The Truman Show, and other films are somewhat based on this allegory. This opens the door to things like mysticism, religion (heaven and hell), and astrology. Aristotle on the other hand, believed the opposite. He thought that reality exists only on our plane and that we can study and know it. We use our senses to perceive reality and our mind to make sense of the world. Our purpose in life is to understand this world and live according to eudaimonia, or the good life, a life of flourishing and wellbeing. Rand took this a step further and tried to answer Hume\u2019s Fork, or The Is-Ought Question, by saying that there actually is a connection between reality and ethics. Most philosophers said there was no connection between what IS and what OUGHT to be. Aristotle summarized this idea in his maxim \u201cexistence exists\u201d. As you investigate this important question for yourself, you\u2019ll have to decide who\u2019s right. Most philosophers follow one of the giants in terms of general beliefs and ethics. I much prefer Aristotle. When you read Plato\u2019s Republic and understand what he\u2019s advocating, it sounds horrible. Aristotle didn\u2019t get all of it right, but the things he did get right are nearly perfect. Good luck!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy assignments generally ask you to consider some thesis or argument, often a thesis or argument that has been presented by another philosopher (a thesis is a claim that may be true or false). Given this thesis or argument, you may be asked to do one or more of the following: explain it, offer an argument in support of it, offer an objection to it, defend against an objection to it, evaluate the arguments for and against it, discuss what consequences it might have, determine whether some other thesis or argument commits one to it or determine whether some other view can be held consistently with it. No matter which of these tasks you are asked to complete, your paper should normally meet the following structural requirements.This writing service providing best guidelines for completing philosophy paper. An ideal philosophical argument should lead the reader in undeniable logical steps from obviously true premises to an unobvious conclusion. A negative argument is an objectionthat tries to show that a claim, theory, or argument is mistaken; if it does so successfully, we say that it refutesit. A positive argument tries to support a claim or theory, for example, the view that there is genuine free will, or the view that we should never eat animals. Positive philosophical arguments about the Big Questions that are ideal are extremely hard to construct, and philosophers interested in formulating or criticizing such arguments usually end up discussing other questions that may at first seem pedantic or contrived. These questions motivate philosophers because they seem, after investigation, to be logically related to the Big Questions and to shed light on them. So, for example, while trying to answer Big Questions like those above, philosophers might find themselves discussing questions like . ",
