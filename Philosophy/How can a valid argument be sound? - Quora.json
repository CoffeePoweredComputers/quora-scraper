            "answer_text": "Logical argumentation can be both valid and sound, or true. The most perfect logical argument is the SYLLOGISM, which is composed of two premises and the conclusion. The two premises are called the Major and Minor. \u201cThe major premise is a statement of a general or universal nature. The minor premise is a statement regarding a particular case, related to the subject of the major premise. The conclusion is the inevitable result of accepting the major and minor premise.\u201d If this form is achieved, then we may call the argument VALID. If the MAJOR and MINOR are also true, and the argumentation form is preserved, then the argument must be true, meaning that the CONCLUSION, signalled by THEREFORE, is also TRUE. Other logical forms of argumentation are: \u201cAn ENTHYMEME is an argument similar to a syllogism, but may be missing one or more parts OR arrive at an uncertain conclusion, OR both. The three types of arguments are categorical, disjunctive, and conditional. CATEGORICAL arguments have major premises that place items into categories. (All A's are B.) DISJUNCTIVE arguments have major premises that identify two or more alternatives. (Either A or B) CONDITIONAL arguments have major premises that establish what will happen if certain conditions exist. Conditional arguments are also known as hypothetical arguments. (If A, then B.) The \"If\" phrase is called the ANTECEDENT. The \"then\" phrase is called the CONSEQUENT.\u201d EXAMPLES ARE: \u201cCATEGORICAL, DISJUNCTIVE, CONDITIONAL Major Premise: All A's are B's, Either A or B, If A, then B Minor Premise: C is an A, Accept A, Affirm A Conclusion: C is a B, Reject B, Affirm B CATEGORICAL, DISJUNCTIVE, CONDITIONAL Major Premise: No A's are B's, Either A or B, If A, then B Minor Premise: C is an A, Reject A, Deny B Conclusion: C is not a B, Accept B, Deny A Argumentation and Critical Thinking Tutorial Main Page ",

            "answer_text": "There are very simple guidelines for making a sound argument. You must base your argument on objective facts supported by evidence. The criteria of the scientific method are that the facts of your hypothesis must be testable, falsifiable, and repeatable demonstrations that the hypothesis is true. Anything that cannot meet these criteria is disproven. Objective evidence is not confined to the realm of science. If I assert that there is a zebra in my living room this can be tested by looking in my living room to confirm or refute the presence of a zebra. If I am unwilling to show you my living room, I have made a baseless assertion. The burden of proof lies with the person making the assertion. To fall to meet the standard of objectivity means that I should probably not have made the assertion in the first place because I do not have evidence to make such a claim. If the subject is a matter of opinion which cannot be objectivity verified, ( because opinions are not nesseciarly based in fact) then you must rely on your ability to persuade. Persuasion falls far below any reasonable standard of objectivity. ",

            "answer_text": "An argument is sound if it is valid and the premises are actually true. Arguments based on definition are sound simply by virtue of the literal meanings of the terms, however regarding actual facts of reality distinct from that it is difficult to make a sound argument because somebody could almost always come up with a theoretical explanation that counters it. For instance, P1: Earth exists. P2:Earth contains water. C:Therefore water exists. If Earth exists, and a property of Earth is \u201ccontaining water\u201d, then water must exist, however how do you know that Earth exists? Maybe it is just an illusion and you are trapped in the matrix? ",

            "answer_text": "A deduction argument is valid when we assume the premises to be true and the conclusion must follow. So, if I say 1. all boats are made of wood and 2. this is a boat, and the conclusion is this boat is made of wood, we have a valid argument. If the premises are true, we can legitimately draw this conclusion. Validity is like having a legitimate ticket to a concert. If you wish to determine whether a deductive argument is sound, first answer the validity question. If the argument is valid, go back and ask if the premises actually are true. In the example above (about the boar), the argument is valid, but when we look to see if the premises are true, we realize that the first premise is false. All boats are NOT made of wood. If there is at least one false premise, the argument is unsound. Thus, an argument is sound when it is valid and has all true premises. It is like having a legitimate ticket and the ticket being for the show on the night it\u2019s presented for entry. ",
