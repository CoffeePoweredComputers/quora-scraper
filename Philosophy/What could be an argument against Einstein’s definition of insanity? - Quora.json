            "answer_text": "A2A. Thanks. You should share Einstein\u2019s definition of insanity with all of us who may not know it. I think I remember it as \u201cDoing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.\u201d 12. \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\" \u2014 not Albert Einstein Different versions of this quote appear everywhere (doing the same thing twice, expecting the same result, etc.), and we owe none of them to Einstein. After Michael Becker, an editor at the Bozeman Daily Chronicle (a local paper in Montana), let the wrong version slide into an editorial, he did some research on his personal blog. Becker traced the original back to Rita Mae Brown, the mystery novelist. In her 1983 book \"Sudden Death,\" she attributes the quote to a fictional \"Jane Fulton,\" writing, \"Unfortunately, Susan didn\u2019t remember what Jane Fulton once said. 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.'\" Now, go throw away half your coffee mugs and inspirational posters. This is what I found when I looked it up online. Business Insider did an article on Famous Quotes attributed to people who didn\u2019t say them. They sighted 12 examples. This Einstein Quote was the twelfth. Who knows if Michael Becker even got this right? It is an interesting article though. I was pretty sure I knew what you meant, because I collect quotes. I also learned this in Group Therapy on one of my many hospitalizations. I remember reading sometime later that it was attributed to Einstein even though he isn\u2019t the person who said it. It was pretty impressive when I heard it in the hospital. I took it to heart, no matter who said it. Here is a true quote from Mr. Einstein: \u201c No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it. We must learn to see the World anew.\u201d One of my all time favorite Quotes: \u201cBlessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape.\u201d A quote by Betsy Shirley, the Foster Mother of 23 boys. Thank you for the question; I love Quotes. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: What could be an argument against Einstein\u2019s definition of insanity? Well, one argument that springs immediately to mind is the fact that there is absolutely no indication that Einstein actually defined insanity as \u201cdoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\u201d A favorite of politicians (and pretty much everybody else), this quote has been wrongly attributed to Benjamin Franklin as well as\u2014but there\u2019s no evidence either of them said it. \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein,\u201d an authoritative complication of his most memorable utterances, identified the quote as a misattribution, and mentioned its use in the 1983 novel \u201cSudden Death\u201d by Rita Mae Brown. On his website, Quote Investigator, O\u2019Toole traced, the link between insanity and repetition back to at least the 19th century, but noted its use in a Narcotics Anonymous pamphlet as well as novels (including Brown\u2019s), TV shows and various other sources. \u2014 https://www.history.com/news/here-are-6-things-albert-einstein-never-said ",
