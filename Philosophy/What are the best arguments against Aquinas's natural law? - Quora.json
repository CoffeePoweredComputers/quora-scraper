            "answer_text": "The best argument against natural law is that it\u2019s based on an assumption and operates on a case by case basis. In the opening lines he says: \u201cLaw is a dictate of reason from the ruler for the community he rules. This dictate of reason is first and foremost within the reason or intellect of the ruler. It is the idea of what should be done to insure the well ordered functioning of whatever community the ruler has care for.\u201d Since we\u2019re talking about a Catholic saint here, it\u2019s obvious (and he states it elsewhere) that God is the (source of the) intellect that he\u2019s talking about. That\u2019s the assumption. He further elaborates that the goodness that comes from the ruler leaves a mark on the ruled, and its from that which the latter derives their thoughts and actions aka morality. It is up to each person to distinguish what God has ordained human nature should move toward, and the doing of those acts will lead to fulfillment and happiness. This is the general basis of the Teleological School of Jurisprudence. Latter philosophers of law however, have a problem with this. If whatever a person does is good or bad is based on what they think God has ordained as human nature, then conflict is inevitable. What one person may deem good and just may be oppressive and unfair to another. An excellent example of this potential conflict is euthanasia. General human morality would say that the preservation of human life is paramount, but mercy would implore euthanasia as an answer to prolonged pain and suffering. It\u2019s an inconsistent rule that basically leaves itself to the judgement of the individual and offers little guidance beyond \u201cGo with what you think is right\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "The best argument against Aquinas\u2019s theory of natural law is that it\u2019s been around in public, open to perusal, for nearly 800 years, and only a tiny minority of the human race think it\u2019s correct. We can therefore conclude that it must almost certainly be wrong. But since his claim is based on a prior claim that there is an all-powerful rational benevolent god who rules the world, and that claim is clearly false, there\u2019s no need to go any further for a rebuttal. http://www.aquinasonline.com/Topics/natlaw.html ",
