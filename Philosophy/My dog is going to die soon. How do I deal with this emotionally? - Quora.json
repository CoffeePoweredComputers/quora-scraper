            "answer_text": "Cherish all the moments with your dog that you have left all the more. They are more precious now than ever before. Make them special. It is disrespectful to the dog you obviously love to waste yours and theirs last moments together being sad. This feeling that you have is understandable, but in reality it is utterly useless to your dog and the precious time you both have left with each other. There will be plenty of time to mourn afterwards, and you can spend all the time you want with that feeling if you want when it doesn\u2019t come at a cost to the pet you love. As animals are more intuitive than you think\u2026 they feel these things from you instinctively. But beforehand, it is a waste of your last opportunities to give your dog happiness and to create more happy memories of moments together for yourself. Find the strength to do this for your dog\u2026 for them it is obviously worth the effort. The end is as important\u2026 if not more important, in all things. *(Side Note) - I remember seeing some videos on youtube of people taking their dogs out for a \u201clast day\u201d before they have to get put to sleep (terminal illness that will cause them great pain in the long run). Morning at the beach with all her favorite \u201cdoggy\u201d friends, all her favorite snacks, treats and food, dog spa and pro massage\u2026 100% focus of all the attention for the entire day from her family etc etc. They are truly beautiful and touch on exactly what I am talking about. The owners attitudes are perfect, no sadness during their special day at all because it is about the dog\u2026 not them. They refuse to taint such an important day because they understand just how important it is to not do so. The perfect way to say goodbye, but also the dogs are obviously having their \u201cperfect day\u201d which they probably felt were all behind them. The dogs are obviously so happy. There is even one where after their dog had passed on, the owners go down to a popular dog beach in the morning once once a year with a large bucket overflowing with balls and leave it on the sand with a picture of their dog and a note saying something like \u201cin honour of our beloved *insert dog\u2019s name here* please feel free to take a ball and continue to spread the joy that she gave us\u201d (or something similar). Things like this are not just simply kind of cool\u2026 they are actually kind of awesome. You really should watch these videos. Fortunately, you still have more time than just a day\u2026 but these videos may still provide you with some clarity. ",
