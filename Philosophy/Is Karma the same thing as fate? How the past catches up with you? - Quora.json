Each person's destiny was thought of as a thread spun, measured, and cut by the three Fates, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.Also called Moirai and Parcae. synonyms:the weird sisters \u00b7 the Parcae \u00b7 the Moirai \u00b7 the Norns VERB (be fated) be destined to happen, turn out, or act in a particular way.\" the regime was fated to end badly\" synonyms:be predestined \u00b7 be preordained \u00b7 be foreordained \u00b7 be destined \u00b7 be meant \u00b7 be doomed \u00b7 be foredoomed \u00b7 be cursed \u00b7 be damned \u00b7 be sure \u00b7 be certain \u00b7 be bound \u00b7 be guaranteed \u00b7 be inevitable \u00b7 be inescapable \u00b7 be ineluctable FATE is a \u201cdestiny\u201d of events that someone/something else has determined, for what ever reason, for the person to experience, whether deserved or not. KARMA, is the \u201creturning\u201d of an experience to the person who created it, so that this person can experience the same action, word, or thought being DONE TO THEM! What YOU create by action, word, or thought, shall be done to you, so the soul can learn by experiencing whether that action, word, or thought is \u201cgood\u201d to receive or \u201cnot good\u201d to receive. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FATE AND KARMA IS THAT WITH FATE, IS FULLY DETERMINED BY ANOTHER ETITY THAT HAS THAT POWER BUT MAY NOT HAVE A LOGICAL REASON FOR DOING SO. WITH KARMA, YOU CREATE WHAT IS DONE TO YOU, \u201cALWAYS\u201d AND YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW\u2026\u2026..KARMICALLY, IN \u201cEXACTLY\u201d THE SAME MEASURE. KARMA DOES NOT JUDGE, KARMA DOES NOT PUNISH, KARMA MERELY TRASPORTS THE ENERGY OF YOUR ACTION BACK TO YOU AT A FUTURE DATE, SO THAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THE EXACT SAME ACTION \u201cDONE TO YOU.\u201d YOU CANNOT BLAME GOD FOR YOUR \u201cSUFFERING.\u201d GOD DID \u201cNOT\u201d CREATE THE ENERGY THAT MAKES YOU \u201cSUFFER\u201d, YOU DID. KARMA is what catches up with you from your past. Fate is a destiny you have no control over. Karma is something you \u201cDO HAVE CONTROL OVER,\u201d because you create it, NOT SOMEONE/SOMETHING ELSE. Just saying\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Fate is a belief that the events of your life are written even before it begins. Karma is a belief that your ignorant choices pave the road to your future suffering. Unlike fate, the idea of karma does not claim to know upfront what exactly will happen to you in the future. It only claims to know what will happen to your future feelings when you predisposition yourself towards them by forming attachments that are guaranteed to be broken at some point. Karma catches up with you because by making a karmic choice you bind yourself to an expectation. You carry that expectation until the time inevitably comes when it betrays you. At that moment you suffer. It does not matter what exactly will happen. What matters is that something will definitely happen - something that you have already decided not to like by attaching yourself to a more favorable ideal scenario. If you did not, that something could still happen, but you would not suffer. TLDR: fate says your choices do not matter. Karma says your choices are all that matters. In your life, anyway. ",
