            "answer_text": "I grew up in what would be considered a pretty comfortable middle class life. As such, I never really wanted for anything - I was a fairly low maintenance kid, and if I had enough food and water and books, I was set (a trend that continues to this day). Because of this, I was a remarkably incurious child and teenager. I read the newspaper, I read plenty of books, I watched the news so I knew what was going on in the world, but I had barely any thought as to what was happening in my life or what was going to happen in my future. I went to school and did my chores and played sport, but it was in service of an abstract goal of a \u2018life\u2019. People would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up or tell me what they thought I should be - I was interested in politics, so someone suggested I should become a politician, which sounded incredibly unappealing. A couple of people suggested law, which I considered for longer than I should have. But I never had an answer that came from me. I had no deep desire for any particular job or career - even as I graduated high school and started university, I did the most basic of degrees and just concentrated on my studies. I never gave much thought to what I should do after university, which is completely ridiculous in hindsight because what the hell was I even doing there then? Separate from school and work, I also showed almost no interest in my own family history. I never asked about my grandparents lives or how my parents met or any number of questions about what happened to the people around me. I don\u2019t think it was a matter of not caring about the answers, it just never occurred to me to ask the questions. That is until my third and final year of university, when I met my wife. Besides all of the other things she is (such as beautiful, funny and smart) she was, and is, insightful and curious. She wanted to know about me, and she wanted to know what I thought. She would ask the simplest of questions about my life, and I struggled to come up with any answers at all. I would even push back, say that I didn\u2019t need to know that, it is none of my business, it wasn\u2019t important. This kind of shocked her, as she wasn\u2019t asking about a random stranger - these were questions about my life, my history, my family. How do you know who you are if you don\u2019t know where you came from? She didn\u2019t just ask the questions - she pushed and prodded me to find out myself. What was my childhood like? What was my family like before me? What did I like, what interested me? What kind of life did I want to lead? I realised I needed to ask the people around me, and it surprised me that I found the answers pretty easily. People wanted to share but thought I didn\u2019t want to know. Once I opened up, asking for their advice and experience, it opened the floodgates. It is still a lesson I need to try and remember - if you want to know something, ask. People want to tell you (most of the time). They want to share their experiences, their history, their thoughts and dreams. They want to connect. They want to know they are not alone. And because of one amazing woman, I know I am not. ",

            "answer_text": "Paradigm shift A very low people knows about it. Paradigm shift is a effective method to control your mind as well as your body. It's the technique to control your mind. For understanding paradigm shift you have to think differently and well rationally. You know our brain is conscious and subconscious too. For instance: when you sleep in a single cot bed you may fell down as you rolled over. And when you about to fell down, at that sudden moment, suddenly you would wake up. Have you ever noticed that aspect of human being? Another example : You can actually sense if someone is standing behind you. Yes, everyone felt this, we don't saw them but we turned up to see them staring at us. Creepy, right? If something bad gonna happen to us our body, our human body will alarm us. Imagine this, if you were asked to eat with blindfolded and you can't see your food, I bet you will deny your food as you aren't seeing the food. So your subconscious mind is warning you that the food might be bad or even poison. All these examples emphasise one thing that is our subconscious mind. If you could able to manipulate your subconscious mind you can control yourself as well as people surrounds you. Yep, when someone had a sad convo with you, you will autonomously talk sadly with them. If someone had a jovial talk with you, then you will talk happily. It's because of subconscious mind. Do you know how we are learning and living our life? Remember, a boy who is 7 years old had been moved to 5 different countries across the globe due to his father's job and the consequence is, the boy can speak 5 different languages now as a 7 yo kiddo. Astounding, right? But this the fact that you are learning things from your surroundings and those stuff got stored in your subconscious mind and later you will act or live your life according to it. It will hard to comprehend to you so think about it for a minute, it would bring a huge change in your life. That boy is happened to hear all the 5 languages in 5 countries that folks speak to communicate and the boy's subconscious mind stored that stuff and later he spoke write those 5 languages articulately. Our subconscious mind is a fascinating thing which is highly optimistic and sensitive. A single small matter that happened when you're kiddo and you remember that thing even now. But you can't remember yesterday's meal now. Why? That's the power of subconsciousness. Human beings are superior animals, they live as group and civilized as socio community. Hence we think if the other one did a thing and we tend to do that same thing. If a group of people in a large auditorium stood up for no reason at frequent intervals, you will be enticed to do that same thing. Because subconsciously you are depending on other humans, this is how world runs. A slight change in your subconscious mind can bring unimaginable change in your life. That change might be good or bad, it depends on your decision. This is called paradigm shift. Real life experiences of subconscious mind: If everyone stands up seeing a president, you too stand up.If you see a 3 foot spider hanging in your doorstep, you will be scampering and shrieking for help. Because in your mind it is stored that spider means danger.You hate your daily routine job and want to quit to start a business but you won't do that, because your subconscious mind will warn you about the problems that you have to toil if you quit your job and pursuing a businessExamples are infinity but the concept is single \u201cParadigm shift\u201d So other Non-English speaking people all over the world, if you want your child to speak English fluently, first of all you speak English to others and let others to speak with him/her in English, then the kid will speak English fluently when grown up. It's very better than knowing English knowledge after being grown up. And if you want your child to be creative and intelligent then you should be intelligent in every aspect of your life which corresponds with your child's life.
