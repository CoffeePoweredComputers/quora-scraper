            "answer_text": "(1) Try this thought experiment\u2026 (2) Imagine you\u2019re the coach of a school tennis team. You\u2019re tasked with filling the final spot on the team. On the day of the selection trial, two boys show up. \u2018A\u2019, clearly looks the part. Multiple rackets. Proper tennis gear. The works!\u2018B\u2019 doesn't even have a racket. He has to borrow one.(3) They play a match. The winner takes the cherished spot on the team. Sounds fair! Now, it turns out that A, surprise, surprise, has had tennis lessons from a young age. Quite the veteran on the circuit.B has never played. Shown up simply out of curiosity.(4) Outcome Scenarios Analysis Here\u2019re 3 hypothetical scenarios facing you as the coach. A beats B. An expected result. No disputing that A must be selected for the team. Cool!Supposing against all odds, B beats A, regardless whether convincingly or not. B should get the spot. You now also have the happy problem of having uncovered a hidden natural talent. A raw diamond. Now, go polish that rough diamond.Here's where it gets inconveniently peskily tricky. Imagine if A only narrowly defeats B. Say, dramatically by a point. What would you do? A strict meritocracy, going by actual performance (in this case, the match just played), requires that you select A, at the expense of a possibly great-but-undeveloped talent.(5) Meritocracy precludes discretion (not necessarily a bad thing systemically) on the part of the coach. But if you selected B because you believe in his greater potential, you\u2019re essentially taking a gamble. The raw diamond may not be polishable.More importantly, A would be outraged, to say nothing of his parents who had invested bigtime in his tennis lessons over many years.There is no possibility of reformatting the selection to best-of-3 matches. Can\u2019t tinker with the regime. A will scream bloody murder, and it\u2019s unfair to A.(6) To be sure, this little thought experiment is an over-simplification of reality. However, it does bring to focus the implications of a meritocracy based on the strict adherence to past results. But exercising discretion to bet on potential is inherently risky, and creates another form of unfairness in outcomes. (7) Societies need a system for allocating, often scarce resources. There\u2019s procedural fairness. There\u2019s fairness of outcomes. Meritocracy typically does well in procedural fairness.All meritocracy systems invariably create unfairness and inequality of outcomes.The problem for meritocracy is that it often runs only one sort of contest as in the above example. It typically selects the tried-and-tested A, and seldom if ever takes a chance on the promise of B. (8) Inconvenient Questions Some pertinent questions\u2026 A meritocracy of what qualities?Elite education institution?Academic results?Performance track record?Promise of future potential?Lived experience?Having determined a meritocracy of whatever desirable qualities, will it result ingroupthink,lack of diversity,a kind of meritocracy self-interested \u2018mafia\u2019,privileged self-perpetuating ol\u2019 boyz network.Colorful human frailties (self-interest, greed, entitlement, elitism, disconnectedness, tribalism, etc) creep up.Who gets to define the meritocracy qualities? Who gets to define meritocracy effectively defines power.When mostly everyone is at a low baseline, the system may be level-playing fair. Will it still be fair when society is significantly differentiated over time where there\u2019re established elites (who are the products of meritocracy)? As in tennis player A above.Are the best decisions necessarily made by meritocrats? Would a mix of meritocrats and average people make more grounded decisions that better reflect reality? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes ! Definitely a meritocracy is better than democracy. In democracy we elect many idiots to govern us who might or might not have skills to govern. They might be given ministries with no prior experience whatsoever.  However, when I think about meritocracy some questions come to my mind -  Who gets to judge the merit & the skills of a candidate. Merit & Skills are not same. A person can have merit but no skills. Only rare people have both. Even if the people elect a meritorious leader, will he continue the meritocracy  in electing subordinates/Other appointments etc. What if a meritorious leader become corrupt, just like in a democratic one.
