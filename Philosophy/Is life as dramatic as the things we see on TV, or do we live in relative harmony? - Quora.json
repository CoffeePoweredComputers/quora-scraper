            "answer_text": "TV is like compressing a lifetime into a twenty minute program so more happens over a shorter amount of time and thus looks more dramatic and exciting but between breakfast and meeting the girl and getting her number at the cafe there was a lot of just staring at a computer screen. Harmony doesn\u2019t sell a television show it\u2019s the family quarrel or the quirky neighbor whom sells the show. The television we see caters to sadly our outlook on life and our perception. With that being said it directly reflects humanities inner state and it is the same with news. Nature, scandal or explosions. Truth is\u2026 We live in a harmonious system of nurturing care which governs all of nature. A force that envelops all of reality and coats it with a blanket of warmth and bestowal. Humanity is apart of this system but we are not living according to it\u2019s laws so we do have issues that arise which get depicted in television shows and is compacted into a time slot. I would say look at the world as your movie and what role does your character have in it. Who are all these characters before you in your life and what is it you are supposed to accomplish with them? Harmony is something we have to strive for together to bring this film to it\u2019s ultimate conclusion\u2026 the grand finale. What part of the movie are you in, maybe it needs your harmony glue.

            "answer_text": "On the personal level, yes, it can be. TV only seems more dramatic because they\u2019re doing it in front of millions of people so we unconsciously assume it is more important. Don\u2019t be fooled by the \u2018grand\u2019 scenarios, all experience is purely personal, and the issues are the same. It is as traumatic for you to lose something valuable as it is for a multi millionaire. Other people\u2019s feelings, hopes and fears are no more valid, important or interesting than yours, and off screen they\u2019re usually bags of insecurity. It\u2019s made to seem interesting to keep you watching. But in reality it isn\u2019t more interesting than your life would be if told by a competent writer.. ",
