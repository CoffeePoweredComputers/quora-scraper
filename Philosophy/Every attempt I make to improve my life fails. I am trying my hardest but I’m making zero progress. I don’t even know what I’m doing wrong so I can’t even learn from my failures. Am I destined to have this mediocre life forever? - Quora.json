            "answer_text": "\u201cEvery attempt I make to improve my life fails.\u201d Then stop attempting. The excessive energy you\u2019re putting in this attempts are stopping you from seeing what you really need to do, to improve your life. Also, it isn\u2019t failing. You just have a specific view of what improvement is, and how to achieve it. Thus, you feel like a failure because it isn\u2019t unfolding as you expect. Just stop all you\u2019re doing, and live moment to moment. Reduce your life to the basics. Once you do that, you\u2019ll begin to see the results of your attempts. \u201cI am trying my hardest but I\u2019m making zero progress.\u201d What\u2019s your definition of progress? If it too is as specific as your view of improvements, then you definitely won\u2019t notice the progress you\u2019re making. You\u2019re holding on too tight to your idea of what should be, and you aren\u2019t able to see what already is. Release that grip a bit, and take stock of where you\u2019re coming from and where you\u2019re headed. You\u2019ll be amazed at what you\u2019ll discover. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing wrong so I can\u2019t even learn from my failures.\u201d The only thing you\u2019re doing wrong is holding yourself to the unrealistic standards, that are causing you this deep pain and anxiety. Relax. The only point you have to prove is to yourself, and you have your whole life ahead of you to do that. To be honest, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re failing. I believe you have achieved what you\u2019ve been attempting to based on the intensity of your question. You just need to take that step back and really see, how much you\u2019ve accomplished. \u201cAm I destined to have this mediocre life forever?\u201d To me, mediocrity is the absolute absence of a will and vision to live your best life. This means that anything goes. Again, your question doesn\u2019t sound like someone without will or vision. You simply need to get out of your own way, and appreciate how far you\u2019ve come. ",

This is not even true. Your mind is telling you all these lies and you are being deceived. [zero], [every] and [forever] are all overgeneralization, which is a distorted thought. Failure is a MUST on your way to success. You can learn from your failures. You actually are making progress if you are persistent. What is a mediocre life, anyway? What is \u2014 then \u2014 a not mediocre life? I hear comparison, which is a direct path to misery. I hear pessimism, which adds up to your misery. I hear low self-esteem, which reflects your past trauma. My answer is that you need work on yourself, not on reality. I invite you to my shelter. The name of the space is Kenny\u2019s shelter on Quora. Please find shelter at my space and heal. You need to ventilate all those bottled up frustrations first.

            "answer_text": "There are so many of us have felt the way you feel right now! All of us have failures and setbacks- it\u2019s the response to those failures and setbacks that determine the future course. My recommendation is to first make a list of the areas you are trying to improve. Then, under each header, detail micro steps that you can take to move in the direction you want to go. For instance, if you want to lose weight, then give yourself the very defined goal of waking up 15 mins earlier every day and exercising for 5 minutes per day. Aim to meet that goal for one week, and tell yourself everyday how proud your will be of yourself if you meet that goal. If you miss a day - don\u2019t beat yourself up. Just commit to doing it tomorrow. Initially only tackle one area at a time until you\u2019ve made some progress in that area. Once you have developed confidence and belief in yourself then move on to other areas you want to improve. Taking little steps and forgiving yourself for slip ups is key. Once you establish a new pattern, your mind is going to shift. I promise you! ",

            "answer_text": "You make zero mention of what you want to improve or change. You don\u2019t mention here anything quantifiable that you want. To me, that\u2019s the first step. Put down on paper or in conversation with someone who will hold you accountable what it is you want. List the things in your way. Plan out concrete steps to address each of the obstacles. Plan WHEN you will work on them or have them done by. Perhaps even make it a game with some sort of personal reward for each measure of progress or a few of them. Keep in contact with the person to hold you accountable or reference your goal/to-do list on a regular basis. Hold in your mind how you will feel when you reach your goal. By focusing on that positive, you create a positive mental space for what you\u2019re doing rather than getting bogged down in the difficulty of working your way there. Also, track your failures. Note what happened. Plan steps to address the failure to avoid it in the future. For example, if you have to call and schedule something to make it happen and when you call you find out that they require you to schedule something farther out, track that so next time you know how much lead time they need and you can plan to call them earlier in the process. If you fail to make the call, note that and make a plan to create an environment where you feel as comfortable as possible to make the call. ",

Not everyone can be a millionaire or a rocket scientist. Good luck. ",
