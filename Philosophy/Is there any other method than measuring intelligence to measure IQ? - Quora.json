            "answer_text": "You can use an IQ score through a test like the WAIS-IV, WISC-V, or SB5. Part of an IQ test\u2019s goal is to assess the g factor, the general cognitive ability that psychologists associate with intelligence. There are other methods to measure g, such as the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices and the Penn Matrix Reasoning Test. The SAT and ACT are also proxy tests that measure g. Outside of these classes of tests, you measure confounds like industrious and knowledge to a large degree. You could argue that the g factor isn\u2019t all there is to intelligence, but the other characteristics of intelligence remain elusive and we have been unable to conceptualize them and then test them in a scientifically valid way. Check out this link to learn more about g and what we call \u201cfluid intelligence\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Is your question backwards maybe? IQ is the academic measure of intelligence, and/or the measure of academic intelligence. In any case IQ tests attempt to measure intelligence. IQ is the measuring device, not the thing being measured. IQ is the tape measure, not the floor being measured. But there are methods other than IQ to measure intelligence. For instance: Competition in mental activities. Being able to out think one\u2019s competition. Success in accomplishing goals, etc. These just aren\u2019t as well quantified as IQ scores. People love quantification. ",
