            "answer_text": "Aristotle tended to be the empiricist, and is often credited as an ancestor of modern science. The work of Aristotle that I still see frequently used in the literature is his division of different forms of human knowledge, in the Nichomachean Ethics: episteme, which today we would translate as theoretical knowledgetechn\u00e9, which is the knowledge involved in making things: technical knowhowand phronesis, sometimes translated as \u201cpractical wisdom\u201d, which is the form of judgement gained through experience, that tells one what to do in a particular situation.If you imagine talking to a friend about some deep personal problem, episteme would allow you to theorise about his or her situation, techn\u00e9 might provide you with a suite of exercises they might do to clarify their position, but its phronesis that would tell you when to speak, and when to listen, and which theory or which exercise might be most useful, how to present it, how to adapt it so they can hear it. One critique of modern society is that it overvalues episteme and techn\u00e9, but undervalues, and is largely silent on phronesis. I find this trichotomy useful: especially the reminder that no technical knowhow, no theory, is going to allow you to make good decisions. These always depend, in the end, on judgement and experience. Plato based his world system on Ideas or Forms: invisible entities that cast their influence on the world, but could never be seen directly. He espoused this through his parable of the cave, in which humans are chained in a cave, able to see shadows cast by the light outside, but never able to the light itself. In modern philosophy, this kind of world picture is known as the hermeneutics of suspicion. A hermeneutic is a way of interpreting things, and the suspicion comes in because you don\u2019t believe the reality of what you are seeing: you assume it\u2019s the projection of something else. In the last century, Paul Ricoeur wrote on the hermeneutics of suspicion, and singled out three modern philosophers as exemplars: Marx, Freud and Nietzsche. Marx, in interpreting society as the projecting superstructure of deeper and unseen class struggles based on the historical mode of production; Freud in interpreting human behaviour in terms of the hidden unconscious forces of the id, and suppressed sexuality, and Nietzsche, who denounced bourgeois values as projections of a Christian slave morality. The hermeneutics of suspicion also pervades modern science, whenever we talk about phenomenon being the product of underlying laws, which have to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d (i.e. uncovered, as though they are usually covered over) by special techniques.

            "answer_text": "This is a very large question, one which could take up numerous books and dissertations, a sizable chunk of the history of philosophy. One big difference is ontology - what, finally, is. Plato\u2019s answer is forms or ideas - abstractions of number, man, virtue, different sense qualities such as color - of anything we can turn our thoughts to - existing apart from and prior to the instances of them that we can perceive. For Aristotle the answer would be particular entities. The widest classes of being are the categories. Entity is the primary, with quality, number, relation, state and some others following; because there are entities and we can know them, there are the other categories, and we can know them, too. A similarity between them is that, in ethics, they both took an interest in character and in virtue, human flourishing, rather than in duty as later moral philosophers have. ",
