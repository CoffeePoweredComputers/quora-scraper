            "answer_text": "It\u2019s interesting to look at how Buddhism explains it. Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors Firstly for perception to occur there was to be a sense faculty. The sense faculty could your basic sense faculties. Buddhism adds mind to the list of 5 that the west acknowledges, so there are six faculties: Visual, auditory, gustative, tactile, olfactory and mental. Next there a total of 51 mental factors that affect the signals that reach our sense faculty. Of them 5 are absolutely essential for the mind to to cognise it. Not all signals that are intercepted by our sense organs are converted into perceptions. The five are: Spar\u015ba - contact, contacting awareness, sense impression, touch.Vedan\u0101 - feeling, sensation.Sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101 - perception.Cetan\u0101 - volition, intention.Manasikara - attention.Without these five acting there is no perception. For example there are so many objects that come into the sphere of our senses but without attention they will not be part of our perception. This can be seen in this experiment:  Finally this is clouded by a combination of the other 46 mental factors (not all 46) and transmitted back to actual sense consciousness. Note that according to this the sense faculty and the sense consciousness are separate. And that is how perception or a reality is formed. But this reality is relative and not absolute. See this talk for more details:  No matter how much we advance, in our current state we cannot experience reality as it is. We can however train our mind to enter deep meditative states where we can perceive reality as it truly exists. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition the world can only be observed via senses. You can have an extra sense, like fish do, where they sense electromagnetic fields, but that still is a sense. Perception is the ability to know sensations. Sensations are the objects of the senses. There is no beyond the senses. What does that even mean? Without senses you cannot percieve anything. ",
