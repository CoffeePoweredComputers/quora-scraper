Or do you mean the gods of the Norse, Egyptian, Asian, or other native people's gods from those who are all powerful to the local gods that protect and guide a special river or grove. Being a spiritual person is by it's nature a personal thing it means different things to different people.

Meaning no errors in the teachings of God or the bible, but words and grammar may have errors due to human imput in translations. ",
