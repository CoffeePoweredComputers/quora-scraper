            "answer_text": "1. White Tiger Arvind Adiga\u2019s debut novel White Tiger was widely acclaimed for its refreshing take on contradictions and social disparities in contemporary India based on class. The book is a thrilling narrative told from the perspective of Balram Halwai, a young man from a poverty-stricken remote village who moves to the capital to work as a chauffeur for the rich. Adiga won The Man Booker prize for this work and that too on his debut novel. 2. The Great Indian Novel This satirical novel by Shashi Tharoor recreates the Hindu epic Mahabharata within the context of the Indian Independence Movement and its following decades to become one of the most exciting reads in contemporary Indian literature. Recasting figures from India\u2019s freedom struggle and politics as mythological characters from a 2,000-year-old epic, his work is a powerful read regardless of how familiar you are with the country. 3. Train to Pakistan This historical Indian book by Khushwant Singh was widely revered during its release in 1956 for bringing a human perspective to the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. While most accounts of the partition at the time primarily focused on political aspects, Singh recounted the event in terms of human loss and horror. It is the summer of 1947. But Partition does not mean much to the Sikhs and Muslims of Mano Majra, a village on the border of India and Pakistan. Then, a local money-lender is murdered, and suspicion falls upon Juggut Singh, the village gangster who is in love with a Muslim girl. When a train arrives, carrying the bodies of dead Sikhs, the village is transformed into a battlefield, and neither the magistrate nor the police are able to stem the rising tide of violence. Amidst conflicting loyalties, it is left to Juggut Singh to redeem himself and reclaim peace for his village. First published in 1956, Train to Pakistan is a classic of modern Indian fiction. 4.The Guide R.K. Narayan is among the most read and celebrated authors in Indian books and literature. Based in the famous fictional town of Malgudi in South India, it follows the story of a Railway Raju, a corrupt tour guide, and the odd sequence of events which go on to make him a spiritual guide and eventually a revered holy man in the country. 5. God of small things Arundhati Roy\u2019s debut novel is a modern classic that has been read and loved worldwide. Equal parts powerful family saga, forbidden love story, and piercing political drama, it is the story of an affluent Indian family forever changed by one fateful day in 1969. The seven-year-old twins Estha and Rahel see their world shaken irrevokably by the arrival of their beautiful young cousin, Sophie. It is an event that will lead to an illicit liaison and tragedies accidental and intentional, exposing \u201cbig things [that] lurk unsaid\u201d in a country drifting dangerously toward unrest. 6.A Suitable Boy Vikram Seth\u2019s acclaimed work follows the story of four families in newly independent and post-partition India. Primarily revolving around the journey of Mrs. Rupa Mehra to find \u2018a suitable boy\u2019 to marry her daughter, the book meditates on a range of issues from post-partition politics, Hindu-Muslim strife, caste and class tensions, and changing family relationships. At 1,349 pages, Seth\u2019s work is among the longest English language Indian books ever published in a single volume. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of my personal favorite books authored by Indian authors: 1. A Fine Balance: this is one of the most heart wrenching stories ever and extremely well written by Rohinton Mistry. 2. Shalimar the Clown: written by Salman Rushdie, paints a poignant picture of the Paradise that was Kashmir and its subsequent fall from grace, as it parallels the lives of Shalimar and Boonyi's idyllic love and their descent into madness and revenge. 3. The God of Small Things: Arundhati Roy is a master of prose and her beautiful descriptions and the images she conjures are brilliant. 4. Family Matters: Another masterpiece from Rohinton Mistry as he walks us through the everyday travails of a Parsi family as it struggles to live while caring for the family patriarch. 5. The Great Indian Novel: A masterpiece by Shashi Tharoor that casts the Indian freedom struggle leaders and the post-independence politicians in the landscape of the Mahabharata. The re-telling is incisive and humorous and there is never a dull moment. 6. Midnight's Children: Salman Rushdie broke into the big league with his novel that told of story of India's journey as a free nation in parallel to one of its citizens born at the stroke of midnight as India was born. 7. Palace of Illusions: a re-telling of the Mahabharata from the perspective of Draupadi, the Pandava Queen. 8. The Chronicles of a Corpse Bearer: A heart-rending tale of the corpse bearers of Parsis in Bombay 9. The Guide: R.K. Narayan's masterpiece is a work for all ages and is unparalleled in its simplicity of prose and complexity of emotions. 10. Unaccustomed Earth: Jhumpa Lahiri is one of the best writers with her sense of nostalgia and melancholy that is reflected through her works. Unaccustomed Earth is a story that stays with you long after you've finished reading it. ",
