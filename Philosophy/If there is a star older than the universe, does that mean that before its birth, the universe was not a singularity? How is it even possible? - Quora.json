            "answer_text": "the term you are looking for is \u201cerror bar\u201d if you are a *true* scientist, the first thing you learn is what the meaning of an error bar is. you only perceive the world through measurements (even simple looking, hearing, smelling etc. are deep down just measurements). every measurement has a kind of tolerance: it doesn\u2019t measure some precise single values but always ranges of values. sometimes that ranges are quite small so you can safely ignore them and call them \u201csingle values\u201d. sometimes that ranges are quite big and ignoring them gives you completly wrong results. so if you ask a *real* scientist for the value of some measurement, he/she will *always* tell you something like X +/- Y (where hopefully Y is much smaller then X). example: you ask the scientist what the mass of that stone is and he/she will tell you \u201c0.5 kg +/- 0.00005\u201d means: the mass can be everywhere between 0.49995 and 0.500005 kg. of course he/she could use a more precise scale to produce a smaller error bar but this would be more expensive and most often more precise measurements simply are not necessary. ok - the age of the universe is a quite important value in all of cosmology. measureing it to a very high precision is top priority. there are expensive satellites which where only launched specifically for that measurement. then some folks found by sheer chance a star which looks by the first rough measurement quite old. and then you have some reporters which don\u2019t understand what an error bar is and tell you that scientists found a star which is older then the universe. ok - let\u2019s look at the actual data: age of the universe: 13.798 mrd years +/- 0.037 age of the oldest known star \u201cHD 140283\u201d: 14.5 mrd years +/- 0.8 and of course: the first one is a quite exact measurement, the second one is a rough estimate based on some assumptions.. if you only look at the \u201cbig\u201d value (like some reporters) you think that this star is much older than the universe. if you know what an error bar is, this star is clearly a very old star (most likely one of the first of the second generation of stars) but perfectly consistent with current cosmology.

If someone CLAIMS to have discovered a star older than age generally agreed age of the universe then either; Their data is wrong or mis-interpreted, orThe generally agreed age of the universe is wrong, orSome combination of the two.A data set like the generally agreed age of the universe does move a littles as new pieces of information gradually get accepted and incorporated. How is it even possible? It\u2019s possible because people make claims about all sorts of things. And an unusual or controversial claims make the news and get publicity for everyone. So it happens quite a lot. Generally, these claims are quietly retracted some time later but occasionally they become accepted as part of reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I guess you can't be older than your father.Stars are formed by clouds of gases like of hydrogen which is in turn are made up of elementary particles. Elementary particles formed after cooling of big bang when there energy got cooled and they collided with each other forming different matter particles or other things so stars didn't just came after big bang it took time. Second thing there is no proof that universe came from singularity most people don't accept it like even Stephen Hawking who promoted this idea but latter abandoned it. ",

Even if it had, the fact no matter existed, and the energy of the early universe would have destroyed it. In reality it shows either the calculated age of the universe is wrong, or the calculated age of the star is. ",
