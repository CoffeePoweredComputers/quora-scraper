            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026but more broadly. One\u2019s consciousness is a small part of The One Consciousness, consisting of Everything and the Nothingness or Emptiness that contains the Everything\u2026not just the other human consciousnesses. Consciousness is just Pure Being, Pure Is-ness. There\u2019s nothing \u201cthere\u201d yet. That\u2019s why the Absolute is always characterized as being Unmanifest. Consciousness then projects the illusion of everything: universes, planets, beings, and the false sense of \u201cindividuality\u201d and the sense that we are \u201cseparate\u201d from It. So feeling like we\u2019re just one small, separate life, \u201cbroken off\u201d from Consciousness and subject to \u201cdying\u201d or ceasing to exist, is part of Consciousness\u2019 Divine Play. It couldn\u2019t explore & discover Itself the way It must unless it temporarily created this false sense that these parts of It called \u201cpeople\u201d were actually separate entities who feel disconnected from It. It \u201cneeds\u201d that to play out It\u2019s Play. So it\u2019s totally OK if \u201cwe\u201d feel separated for awhile. Note: There\u2019s considerable \u201cpoetic license\u201d in all I just said, because the mind cannot grasp this and words are totally inadequate to convey this vast & perfect Reality. At the level of Pure Consciousness, there is no \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cspace,\u201d so there\u2019s no \u201cthere\u201d and no \u201cthen\u201d when Consciousness projects this illusion out of Itself. It all exists Now, simultaneously. And Pure Consciousness is just pure functioning. It does not have any \u201cneeds\u201d or \u201creasons\u201d why it projects, or seems to project, this Play. You can\u2019t grasp this with your mind, but you can be This, abide in This, and then you see that it\u2019s all true. You also lose your sense of being one small part of a bigger consciousness and become, or return to being, the Bigger Consciousness you always were. ",

            "answer_text": "The way I see it, consciousness is not a \u2018thing\u2019 or a substance. A thing can be one or many. A substance occupies a space. Consciousness is neither these things. In fact, the very word \u2018consciousness\u2019 is a noun but I don\u2019t think of consciousness as a noun at all. It is a verb: to be conscious. When I say \u201cmy consciousness\u201d I am using wrong language. Consciousness is not a thing nor is it mine. But I say \u2018my consciousness\u2019 because that is how we say it in language. When I look at my consciousness, I don\u2019t see it having any quantity, and shape, any size, any location, any duration, etc\u2026 In fact, since consciousness is not a thing I cannot look at it. Just like I cannot look at the wetness of water, I can only look at water. All the consciousness of all beings together is simply the universe. The universe has no existence apart from the observation or consciousness of it. In fact, it is like a dream. Each person has their own Universe which they exist in the center of, appearing to their senses. There is no one objective Universe which exists bigger than us. Each person is their own Universe. You appear in my Universe or dream but not at the center where I am. I appear in your Universe or dream but not at the center where you are. Just like a dream, the dream is not a part of a bigger dream realm consisting of all beings\u2019 dreams together. No, a dream is an ephemeral experience that appears nowhere. Same with each person\u2019s experience. ",
