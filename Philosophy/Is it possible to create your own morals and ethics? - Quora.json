WHERE that Cosmos may be located that would allow such a thing, however, has yet to be published to the general Public, as none of the Familiar Dimensions of Earth, Heaven, Hell, Time, Displacement or Occupation have ever allowed such a thing to happen. Morality is the Intellectual REASONING that \u201cOnly Me and Mine Are Worthy Matters\u201d and Ethics are the Terms of the Employment Contract between \u201cMe and Mine\u201d. FORMs by which those two Imperatives are described and pursued are CONSTANTLY Subject to Variation as groups of \u201cMe and Mine\u201d are destroyed and created, so the pants you wear and the handshake you engage in and the way you wear your hair and cast your respective spellz of colo(u)r(e), \u201cevolve\u201d constantly as \u201cneed\u201d arises to GUARANTEE each \u201cMe and Mine\u201d their \u201cDistinct Identity\u201d and \u201cJustifications\u201d for predatory efforts at survival. But in order for YOU TO Survive you MUST Destroy the things that you survive FROM, be you a comet gathering the remains of things you fly through or a Poet in need of your Muse, your Morals AND your Ethics remain the same.

            "answer_text": "We can create whatever beliefs we want to\u2026.just like many any tool. How well the tool works, that\u2019s another story. Many people are doing this type of thing all the time\u2026adjusting and fine tuning as they stumble and fall, etc.. Nothing difficult about doing that, it can even be fun\u2026.like experimenting on your own life! Of course more academic leaning folks might prefer l(and have taught their children) to learn from the successes and mistakes of others in the past. That\u2019s the basis of all schools: schools of thought/philosophy/art/trades/science/etc.. I\u2019m a 72 year old engineer at Apple and for sure, almost everything I do at work (Apple pays me to do) is based on only two things: Understand and use what has been historically learned (theory and practice, successes and failures)Use the above plus add my imagination to propose new options (solutions to problems and new untried opportunities).So there is no chance I would be doing what I do today if I did not do #1 above. I understand nearly all the what was proposed and tried in the past and the reasons why they succeeded or failed: the detailed technical reasons. With that, I can adventure out into #2. Without #1, I\u2019d might just be another hopeful dreamer\u2026.maybe more a goofball than a genius. Ni Mao rightly said: \u201cThere is a fine line between a genius and an idiot and that line is possibility.\u201d So it is with what some might label as \u201cmorals and ethics\u201d (or really any fundamental theory in a belief system). The proof is in the putting (doing): will it work+succeed over the long haul, or lead to disaster. 2,300 years ago Aristotle reasoned how Virtue would lead to the highest form of personal happiness (and betterment for society). 300 yeas later Jesus demonstrated and emphasized this in his monotheistic faith (Judaism). So Yes, we can (and do) experiment with our beliefs as we mature. But after 2,300 years, I defy anyone to identify something more satisfying and successful than having virtue as your guide+belief system. But of course, you\u2019re free to determine if that is true for you, or not bother to investigate it. We all get to choose for ourselves. Hope this helps. ",
