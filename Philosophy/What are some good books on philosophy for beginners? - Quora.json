            "answer_text": "Plato. There were obviously philosophers before him (the pre-socratics) and I don\u2019t want to undermine their contributions but Alfred North Whitehead wasn\u2019t wrong, Plato is the granddaddy of Western thought. On a more personal note, I didn\u2019t start reading philosophy until someone gave me a copy of Plato\u2019s entire works when I was in rehab at age 23. It literally changed my life. I suddenly understood that my real education, and not the one I had in public school and college, was just beginning. I realized that the only thing I ever really knew was nothing at all, and I sought out to know thyself. I also credit Plato\u2019s teachings with giving me the wisdom to stay sober because it allowed me to see why I should be \u201cgood\u201d. Start with his early dialogues, because even 2,500+ years after they were written they are accessible to nearly anybody with a basic education. They are literally just conversations about basic human concepts like love, justice, beauty, etc., etc. He analyzes moral dilemmas and real world situations, through dialectic, trying to figure out the best way in which to approach situations, particularly trying to figure out why it should be the best way to go about it. He asks you to inquire about what is truly moral/immoral or good/bad or beautiful/ugly. (You\u2019ll find he doesn\u2019t really tell you the best way to approach issues, instead showing you why certain approaches considered to be \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d don\u2019t actually make sense.) The language is simple and unadorned unlike the language used by most modern philosophers, which is difficult to understand without a formal education in philosophy. This makes sense as he believed wisdom and knowledge to be something that should be freely shared with all (he detested rhetoricians or what we might consider \u201cself-help\u201d lecturers today, that made people pay them for their \u201cwisdom\u201d). He tries to get at fundamental truths and ideas about how we should act as humans. The logic might be a little difficult at first and passages will probably need to be read over a couple of times but the man will introduce you into an entirely new way of thinking if you earnestly wish to seek philosophical progress and aren\u2019t just looking to sound more intelligent than others. If you want to read a fascinating history of philosophy book, my favorite is one called, \u201cThe Cave and the Light: Plato Versus Aristotle, and the Struggle for the Soul of Western Civilization\u201d by Arthur Herman. This being my favorite history of philosophy (that I\u2019ve read so far) is a bit ironic because I am obviously a huge fan of Plato, and the contents of the book tend to place Aristotle, Aristotelian thought, and analytic philosophy above Plato, Platonic thought, and continental philosophy, however; I generally ignored that and was mesmerized by the chain linkage of philosophical legacy through the ages. It also served as a jumping off point for which philosophers I wanted to look at next, which was basically all the philosophers that Herman dubbed part of the \u201cPlatonic line\u201d. It doesn\u2019t go in-depth into anything and may be a bit generalist in its views but it\u2019s an excellent introduction and a good way to find out what philosophers you might be interested in. Hope this helped! ",

            "answer_text": " If I was teaching an Introduction to Philosophy class today, I would ask students to start with this book: Confessions of a Philosopher by Bryan Magee. I\u2019ve read this book three times. Love it. It\u2019s been a while though, so I think I\u2019ll read it again after I finish the two books I\u2019m reading now. Thanks for reminding me. Bryan Magee was very active in British social and political life in the second half of the 20th century. Among other things, he was a politician, writer and producer. He produced multiple series about philosophy on the BBC in the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s. He\u2019s 87 today. I haven\u2019t followed his most recent activities. Confessions of a Philosopher begins with Magee describing his predilection for philosophical questions as a young boy. He brilliantly captures the sense of wonder and inquisitiveness that is often the beginning of philosophical inquiry for many people who pursue it. He follows this with a comprehensive autobiography of his professional association with philosophy. The meat of the book, however, is the lucid and articulate account he gives of Western Philosophy from the pre-Socratics to the 20th century. His account of the Analytic/Continental split in philosophy during the 20th century is the best synopsis of that episode that I\u2019ve read. And, his chapter on Kant is a coherent and clear account of the huge contribution that philosopher made to metaphysics, among other things. You can find any number of lists for the top 10 introductory books in philosophy or the top 10 most important books in philosophy. Most people should not start with that list, however. Confessions of a Philosopher is an enjoyable way for the thinking person to decide if they want to delve deeper into the field. It provides a great survey of the field and the bibliography is useful for guiding you to the next book, or area, that you want to explore. I\u2019ll even go so far as to say that many people who\u2019ve read a number of philosophic texts will find great value in the book. A few experienced philosophers might think the book is beneath them. Strictly speaking, Magee isn\u2019t doing philosophy; he\u2019s providing a historical, and maybe even journalistic, account of philosophy. In my view, though, so what. Magee is making the discipline accessible to a wider audience, which it sorely needs. Too many professional philosophers derive a sense of satisfaction by making their discussions opaque to the general audience. Sorry I have no recommendations to offer in Eastern Philosophy. While I\u2019ve done some reading in the area, I do not feel I have sufficient grasp of the tradition to make a worthwhile recommendation. Enjoy your exploration! ",
