            "answer_text": "I have some criticisms of the Baha\u2019is, as well as things I like about them. I like that they are more universal than the other monotheistic religions dogmatically, and could be a great force for unifying humans across belief lines. That being said- the Baha\u2019is still don\u2019t have evidence for their religion. They still claim the Bab and Bahaullah were messengers of God without proving there is a God. Plus they pretend to be all progressive and open to new information as society goes forward, but they have one of the most unrelenting opinions when it comes to homosexuality. Shoghi Effendi their guardian clearly stated that homosexuality is a handicap that can be overcome. Many Baha\u2019i communities actively excommunicate and shun gay members, and in countries with penalties for homosexual behavior- Baha\u2019i believers in those countries often support. Just like with most religions, the Baha\u2019i Faith has things that seem okay or reasonable at first glance, but you don\u2019t have to delve deep to find some problems. I didn\u2019t even touch on the disputes about Bahaullah\u2019s successor in the community, and how the Haifa Baha\u2019i group is rigidly uncompromising on their idea that you can\u2019t be a Baha\u2019i outside of their organization. That kind of stuff is the same uncompromising attitude you find in religious organizations like the Catholic Church. Baha\u2019i adherents also knowingly spread misinformation about Krishna and Buddha as historically viewed and their teachings- because they try to pound these two figures into their theology as messengers of God. Even though it is a well-known fact to anyone that Krishna and the Buddha were not monotheists. Their culture had no conception of monotheism. They could not have been monotheist. On that score- that is just blatant disregard for facts. ",

            "answer_text": "From the atheist point of view, religion is a religion. It's all humbug and should be abolished. Now, we aren't completely oblivious to the shades of gray, so here is what makes a religion \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d in my eyes: Procedure for leaving it.Tendency for cutting body parts, especially of children.Prohibitions related to food, drinks, clothing, sex.Equal treatment of men and women.More generally, compatibility with the EU convention on human rights[1].Tendency to annoy others by prozelitism. Or worse, e.g. killing people who don't realize how great their religion is.Now, I don't claim to know much about Bah\u00e1'i, but from what I can read online, they don't sound very different from Muslim. Praising chastity, not particularly fond of homosexuality, alcohol prohibition, prayers upon prayers\u2026 What else? Please don't tell me that men can marry several women or that girls are given away in arranged marriages? Frankly, it doesn't sound very encouraging to me. Update: on a positive side, they seem to have a saner attitude towards people who decided to leave their religion than most[2]oother religions : People who have withdrawn from the Cause because they no longer feel that they can support its Teachings and Institutions sincerely, are not Covenant-breakers -- they are non-Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and should just be treated as such. Only those who ally themselves actively with known enemies of the Faith who are Covenant-breakers, and who attack the Faith in the same spirit as these people, can be considered, themselves, to be Covenant-breakers Assuming that \u201ctreating someone as non Bah\u00e1'\u00ed\u201d is not detrimental to their well-being, that's fine with me. And yes, I'm not only pointing a finger to Islam here. Good Christians used to kill people for heresy and apostasy too, they only calmed down when forced to by the secular society. Enlightenment, remember? Footnotes[1] What is the European Convention on Human Rights?[2] Covenant-breaker - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "Better is a subjective term. Better as in more likely to be accurate? Not at all. Better as in better to people around you, and more ethical? Very much so. Baha\u2019i is a very modern religion which has taken beliefs from other religions and coalesced them with modern humanist values. While it is objectively a much more ethical religion, it\u2019s impossible to argue that it wasn\u2019t formed as an amalgamation of traditional abrahamic beliefs, and secular ethical/moral values. To me, it is \u201cabrahamic religion lite.\u201d Still ignorant for thinking anything about abrahamic religions are real, but at least ethical and moral. So if you believe in the god of Abraham, but don\u2019t like the arbitrary rules, and monstrous acts and mandates of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, then Baha\u2019i is probably a good fit for you. Personally I think it takes a special kind of ignorance to believe in the supernatural claims of abrahamic religions, but to ignore the monstrous things ordered by those gods. ",

Everything that has value, was stolen from preexisting society, was wrapped in arbitrary, mandatory deviant behaviours and attitudes and branded with the name of their god. If Homo sapiens did not already have Human Decency, then there would be no cooperative community, and the species would have become extinct long before we ever developed the language to communicate with. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed? There are thousands of religions, this is but one of them. My contact with the faith has shown it to be crippled by the same theistic nonsense as any other religion. ",
