            "answer_text": "When my school started mentioning a \u201cdigital plan.\u201d  [1] When I first heard about the virus, I thought it was fake. Who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s literally called the corona virus, it has the same name as a common beer brand, how real can this thing be? About a month ago, I had this exact conversation with a friend of mine. I think it was in the food court sometime after school, and we both were just in awe that some people would believe such a ridiculous internet meme. With impeccable timing, that was when we received an email from the school mentioning the possible transfer of offline to online school, using a \u201cdigital learning plan\u201d. It was all up in the air of course, considering we didn\u2019t know a ton about this virus and it could be dying down but the email essentially said that the faculty and staff were prepared for whatever was to head our way. That\u2019s when it became real for me. It was terrifying to think that this new, mysterious virus was spreading worldwide without a vaccine, meanwhile this whole time I was just laughing at the memes people were making about it. Looking back I feel a little bad for doing so, but I was unaware of the seriousness of the situation, so I don\u2019t beat myself up for that too much. Today is actually my school\u2019s two week Quarantiniversary, although it feels like it\u2019s been way longer. I miss going out to eat and seeing my friends, especially since my school\u2019s planning on finishing out the school year like this (oof). I am definitely not looking forward to that.

I also knew we were not prepared for it since Trump had been dismantling many of the pandemic teams and recalling them from around the world. China's team was one of those recalled. So it's going to be bad. ",
