            "answer_text": "He tells him to go through Desdemona. Iago is trying to convince Othello that Desdemona is having an affair with Cassio, and so having Cassio talk to Desdemona, while seeming like good advice, plays into this plan. If Desdemona then goes to Othello and asks for favours for Cassio, Othello, with the seed of her adultery planted in his mind, is more likely to see this as Desdemona asking favours for her lover, not for a friend.
