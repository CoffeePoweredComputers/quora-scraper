            "answer_text": "In the 1930\u2019s the most decorated US marine in history - Maj. Gen. Smedley D. Butler wrote a book called \u201cWar is a Racket\u201d. He said in it that the only possible justification for War is to defend your society against attack or against anyone taking away your constitutional rights. Other than that War is a Racket through which money is made by pathologically cynical barbarians. In the book\u2019s penultimate chapter, Butler recommended three steps to disrupt the war racket: For everyone to read and learn them is my advice, because it is rule that is influenced by the ethics of these barbarians that is behind all social evils pretty much. What does such a privately barbarian type \u2013 they would never commit political suicide by leaking their innermost nature - really care about the suffering of the weak whose votes they are trying to win by trumpeting about the good of the people when in his heart death is ok to be meted out if it is good for profits? Here are the three Making war unprofitable. Butler suggests that the means for war should be \"conscripted\" before those who would fight the war: It can be smashed effectively only by taking the profit out of war. The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labour before the nation's manhood can be conscripted. Let the officers and the directors and the high-powered executives of our armament factories and our steel companies and our munitions makers and our ship-builders and our airplane builders and the manufacturers of all other things that provide profit in war time as well as the bankers and the speculators, be conscripted \u2014 to get $30 a month, the same wage as the lads in the trenches get.Acts of war to be decided by those who fight it. He also suggests a limited referendum to determine if the war is to be fought. Eligible to vote would be those who risk death on the front lines.Limitation of militaries to self-defense. For the United States, Butler recommends that the Navy be limited, by law, to operating within 200 miles of the coastline, and the Army restricted to the territorial limits of the country, ensuring that war, if fought, can never be one of aggression.We can see that Butler was right when we go forward 25 years or so to when in 1960 President Eisenhower warned the nation that now for the first time it had a war industry in private hands and that if the public allowed the leaders of that Military Industrial Complex - as he called it - to get their hands on power then a very serious situation would obtain since the CEO\u2019s were obliged to maximise returns to their private shareholders which means that there must be as much war as possible. Just look around you. Dick Cheney - who ran US military operations as Vice President to George W Bush was a senior executive of Halliburton, one of the biggest war industries. Wake up and put a stop to this most evil impulse controlling our nation\u2019s vile and murderous policies is my earnest advice to all who are capable of hearing. ",
