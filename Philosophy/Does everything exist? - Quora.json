            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.  Oddly, I was just pondering this question, yesterday and I am somewhat conflicted. At first, it seems obvious that, in an infinite world, everything will eventually exist. I wish I could recall the correct citation, on the math and probability but I will use my poor memory in this example, perhaps someone can suggest correction: for instance if you carry pi to 10,000 decimal places, there is a 70% chance that your 7 digit telephone number will appear consecutively at least once, and if it is carried to 10 to the 30th decimal places, there is 100% chance (and for 50% of us it will appear 100 times). I imagine that if you concatenated your nine digit social security number and your telephone into a 16 digit number, it will appear as consecutive portion of pi if carried out to, 10 to the 30000th decimal places. That is not even very far given the world of infinity. Can a random word generator produce Gone With The Wind? Yes, with right parameters. The point is, it appears that anything, even the seemingly improbable, will eventually appear given sufficient opportunity. But, is it true?  I recall someone describing infinite odds in terms of placing all several million pieces of a Boeing 747 in a field, and having a tornado come through and if given infinite number of tornados, that one of them would assemble a fully functioning flyable aircraft. Either my brain is too weak to see the possibility or I havent the words or knowledge to describe the improbability or I don't want to accept the truth, because it strains my sense of what is true. Perhaps it is the irrelevance to me that makes the example meaningless...if each tornado took 60 seconds, would it take ten trillion years, and the Milky Way have become cosmic dust in another universe? Likewise, you could ponder the possibility of other Earths with fish that build spaceships, or a sun that burns 400 billion years instead of 20 billion, but you start to get into limits due to physical laws that we believe cannot be breached, such as the mini up and maximum temperatures that this hypothetical star can burn, gravitational considerations, etc. So, the answer to the question, for me, is that you begin with the potential for anything to exist (possibility) at one point, and then the probabilities of its happening are narrowed by physical laws. That does beg the question, are there universes where xxx could occur? And, I believe that was the ontological question, here, and to that I would have to say, yes, eventually, but infinity is a very long time. ",

            "answer_text": "The word 'exist' can be used in different senses. Imaginary numbers 'exist' in the sense of there being a concept within mathematics, but they do not exist in the sense that Mount Rushmore exists. I've got another answer on Quora about degrees of existence: Craig Weinberg's answer to Are there degrees of existence? The word 'thing' can similarly be used to refer to real objects, or it can be a way to refer to 'that which is being referred to'. The square root of negative one can be a thing which exists, or it can be neither a thing nor not a thing. If we are talking whether probability + eternity = inevitability of all things, as in a Many-worlds interpretation or Boltzmann brain, then I would say that in my opinion the answer is no. While the idea of monkeys producing Shakespeare on typwriters by accident is a good way of conceptualizing probability, my understanding is that the universe is not actually large enough to support something things like that happening.  It would literally take 'forever' for random fluctuations to cohere into the kind of world that we experience. The universe is more meaningfully defined in terms of things that do not exist and cannot exist. It is not a universe of infinite possibility but one in which possibilities are infinitely finite. ",

Dick said that reality is whatever doesn\u2019t go away once you\u2019ve stopped believing in it. That would mean squares certainly exist in the conceptual realm as do triangles but not square triangles & also who or what you think you are does too but not what you actually are beyond that, whatever that might be (don\u2019t ask me because fortunately I don\u2019t know who or what I am!)

May be its inspired from your surrounding or may be you have never thought of it before. Let it be a place an object or even any inconceivable thing.  Now this thing exists in your mind. I believe some of them manifest in our universe and some of them don't but the fact remains that they are imaginable. Asgard might be an imagination as of now. But no one can say for sure that it hasn't already manifested somewhere or will not in future.  There might be a Loki lurking somewhere, you never know :)  Existence in my opinion is a matter of perception and a concept in the mind. All the things we see around us are perceived by our senses and understood or imagined by our mind. ",

Secondly, the question doesn\u2019t provide word definitions and standards of what will be acceptable evidence for answers. What\u2019s included in everything? The past or future? The unbroken glass you dropped that shattered last week? Do memories and dreams count as existing? Therefore, unicorns and dragons? There are also the logically impossible like being and not being in the same place at the same time in the same way. Even what we take as the \u201claws of nature \u201c, may not exist everywhere and everywhen. Like, where parallel lines meet. My belief is that, as I use the terms, not everything exists. ",

For instance, I can invent morgators. These are dead alligators that continue to grow as zombie alligators after death, and often reach lengths of 200 feet or more, weighing as much as a blue whale. Do morgators poof into existence just because I imagine them? I imagine they do not. ",

Thus, if something doesn\u2019t exist, then it doesn\u2019t matter to us. The only way we can tell if any object exists is if we react to it in measurable physical reactions (whether consciously or unconsciously doesn\u2019t matter). One might try to differentiate between tangible objects (e.g. furniture, animals, food) and intangible objects (e.g. ideas and fantasies) but in truth we don\u2019t react to anything unless we have first paid attention to it\u2014we might say that without our attention, a thing doesn\u2019t exist. However, we can\u2019t react to tangible objects unless we have first processed them in our minds. We would thus be reacting to the intangible forms of these tangible objects; or, we would be reacting to our subjective judgement of these objects and not to the objects as they are. Therefore, things exist only insofar as you allow them to affect you. ",
