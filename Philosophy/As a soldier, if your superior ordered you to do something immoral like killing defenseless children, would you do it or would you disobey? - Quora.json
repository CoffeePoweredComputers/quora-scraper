            "answer_text": "As a soldier, if your superior ordered you something immoral like killing defenseless children, would you do it or would you disobey? The Uniform Code of Military Justice [1](UCMJ) is very clear on the issue. As a soldier, sailor, Marine, or airmen, it\u2019s not up to you to determine the \u201cmorality\u201d of orders. Only the legality. The UCMJ is also very clear on what is and is not a lawful order. Murdering children is very clearly a war crime, and it is illegal to order a US servicemember to commit a war crime. As such, the order is unlawful and will not be obeyed. Now\u2026let\u2019s tackle some of the worst ways this could happen.  My platoon is evacuating refugees ahead of the expected occupation by a hostile force. During the evacuation, mortar fire starts landing amongst the fleeing refugees. My LT notices a child with a cellphone on the second story of a building, watching us. The child arrived just before the mortars started landing. Terrorists have used children for military purposes in the past, counting on the reluctance of US forces to fire on children. LT orders me to get the kid to leave. My likely reaction? Fire at the wall just behind the kid\u2019s head. If he doesn\u2019t run away, most likely he is spotting for the mortar teams. In order to preserve the lives of the refugees whom we are evacuating, my second shot would be for effect. The child is defenceless. He has no weapon. However, given the totality of circumstance, an order to shoot the child, acting as a recognized combatant under the rules of war, is itself a lawful order, if an extremely distasteful one.  My platoon is protecting a refugee camp full of the people we just evacuated. Our terrorist friends are again trying to murder them. This time, they are advancing to assault, using women and children as human shields. There are thousands of terrorists, thousands of refugees, and a few hundred human shields. If we do not stop this advance, thousands of refugees will be murdered as we fight tent to tent. The major makes the call. There is simply not enough time or marksmen to pick off enough terrorist assholes before they breach our lines to murder the refugees. He orders us to open fire, knowing full well that most or all of the human shields, women and children, are going to die. My response? Considering the totality of circumstance, I would open fire. The order is lawful, if again extremely distasteful.  My platoon is on patrol, dismounted. LT sees a child watching us intently. He believe the child may be scouting for the enemy, and orders me to shoot. We are in a village. There are dozens of people also watching us. We are not in imminent danger. There is no particular reason to think that that child is a scout. \u201cSir, the child does not appear to be any sort of threat. Shooting an unarmed child in this situation constitutes a warcrime.\u201d The kid is not wearing a uniform, not armed, and not in any way behaving in a military manner. Simply watching soldiers patrol is not a military act. \u201cAre you refusing the order to shoot?\u201d \u201cYes Sir, I am.\u201d If the matter is pressed, I hope the Court Martial rules in my favor.  My platoon has just secured a village from the enemy. There are likely sympathizers still in the village. Everyone is rounded up and separated. It turns out that pretty much all the adults are enemy sympathizers. LT says \u201cFuck it, they\u2019re all enemy. Jones, you go shoot them, Baker, you shoot that group, Barrett, put down the brats.\u201d \u201cSir, that is a warcrime and an illegal order.\u201d \u201cAre you questioning me, Barrett? I gave you a fucking order, now carry it out!\u201d \u201cSir, you have just ordered us to commit a warcrime. That is blatantly illegal. Rescind that order now.\u201d \u201cWhat the fuck is your malfunction, Barrett! Carry out your orders!\u201d \u201cSir, I am placing you under arrest for deliberately issuing unlawful orders to commit war crimes. Place your weapon on the ground and your hands behind your back.\u201d At this point, I\u2019m hoping Sergeant and the rest of the platoon are saner than LT, otherwise I might be the one getting shot here.  The bottom line is, US servicemembers are required to disobey unlawful orders. Now note, this isn\u2019t disobeying orders you don\u2019t like, disagree with, or that will lead to your death. You can absolutely be ordered to carry out actions that will surely lead to your demise. In these cases, \u201cI\u201d am refusing to obey orders to commit warcrimes. Which is not without its own risk. If the Court Martial determines that the order was lawful, the best I can hope for is a Bad Conduct Discharge. At worst, I might be executed. And of course, this assumes I survive long enough to make it to a Court Martial. The Nuremberg Trials established definitively that \u201cI was just following orders\u201d is not a viable defense to committing warcrimes. It is a defense to any offense that the accused was acting pursuant to orders unless the accused knew the orders to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawful.-Manual for Courts-Martial United States Here's What to Know About Obeying an Unlawful Military Order When Can a Soldier Disobey an Order?

            "answer_text": "As a soldier, if your superior ordered you something immoral like killing defenseless children, would you do it or would you disobey? If I were a soldier who was ordered to do something illegal I would refuse. US military personnel are not required to obey unlawful orders and are obligated to refuse blatantly unlawful orders. Unfortunately, there is some gray area in there. The determination of whether or not an order is lawful is likely to be made in court. If you are not 100% sure that you are right, you could find yourself in hot water for refusing. If you obey and the order is unlawful, you could be accountable for that. It\u2019s an unrealistic expectation. That said, murdering defenseless children for no reason seems pretty straightforward. Of course even then, there are exceptions. An unarmed child could be acting as a spotter for enemy forces and calling for fire on your position. That child would be defenseless. He would also be a valid military target. In that case, the child would get shot. Obviously, that\u2019s quite a bit different from being ordered to just massacre a village for shits and giggles but I mention it because it fits within the context of the question. Note my use of \u201cillegal\u201d instead of \u201cimmoral\u201d, though. Morals are subjective. The law tends to be pretty straightforward. There is no exception for disobeying orders you believe to be immoral. ",

If you killed a child, you would be viewed as a hero (no one would know in fact the inverse) in the public eye it never happened and you would be honored. Only you would know. If you didn't kill him then once again just the opposite would happen. You would be viewed as a child killer in the public eye. Only you would know the truth. What do you do? As a former Infantry 1SG, I know personally what I would do and tell them hell no that would never happen. Killing defenseless children on purpose would never ever okay. Anyone saying anything different is not a soldier following orders, but someone no different than say, the Nazis, Japanese, (performing experiments and putting people in concentration camps or making sex slaves) Russians sending people to Siberia, or American soldiers killing the \u201csavages\u201d in South Dakota because gold was discovered on their land. I was only following orders, is not and never should be an acceptable defense. That being said as someone that was mortars (23 years) indirect fire and bombs do not always go where they are supposed too. Intel is not always \u201crock solid\u201d. Anytime you have War you always have unintentional casualties. This is a reality we live in and we had to do the best we can and try not to let this happen. But it will and does. But to follow an order to kill non-combatants, or defenseless children is not and should not ever be followed. ",

            "answer_text": "Warfare is viewed by the international community to best serve humanity when it is conducted with restraint. That\u2019s not to say countries don\u2019t break the rules but when they do their actions might come with penalties from other countries that trade with them. Napalm, cluster bombs, flichettes and gas have all been deemed, weapons that cause undue suffering and therefore make the list of weapons that should be prohibited on the battlefield. On a personal level civilians or non-combatants are off limits for a civilized army to engage (which is the reason why guerrilla or insurgent operations have grown in popularity.) While civilians are protected by status, a civilian with a firearm can and typically are viewed as a combatants but because the distinction doesn\u2019t include a uniform it rests in a gray area. Under the laws of war, unnecessary damages to structures is prohibited, the mentality rests in the idea that whether an invasion is successful or repulsed the victor will require industry to reignite labor to feed the population. Most people can point to events that have occurred in the last 100 years that would violate the Hague restrictions and the Laws of wWar. Gas used in WW1, the firebombing of Dresden and Toyko, napalm used in WW2, Korea and Vietnam (not to mention other countries who used it) and are in place in many ways to leave the innocent out of it. The more egregious acts of any military is to exterminate the most helpless. Some action is indirect, that is; in the effort to eliminate the cottage industries of a large ship yard for example, civilians employed by and living in the area of this industry will inevitably take the lives of civilians with it. (As weapons get smarter, less collateral damage is expected) Nanking, My Lei and Nazi Germany are some of the more well known unlawful murders that have occurred during war and again, most modern countries make serious efforts to avoid it therefore, anyone who is ordered to execute an unarmed civilian or soldier alike is being given an illegal order and who will not find sanctuary from the law with the words; \u201cI was ordered to do it.\u201d It is an illegal act and anyone giving that order will at very least be removed from service. I have never met anyone from the US Armed forces who has expressed the thought of murdering an unarmed civilian. There is simply no honor in it. ",

I've never gone through days, weeks with little or no sleep, with people trying to kill me for hours on end, with children who appear unarmed being used with bombs attached to them to run to me and try to kill me, then have another child run at me that it turns out was unarmed,\u2026I have not been in that position. I have been in the military and know what was required of me under the rules of engagement (which are ever-changing and become more stringent), I know the difference between right and wrong, moral and immoral, legal and illegal. I practice living my life within those boundaries so that I will act almost instinctively when hard and impossible situations arise. So I SHOULD disobey without thinking about it. I HOPE I would disobey without thinking about it. I BELIEVE I would disobey without thinking about it. I'm CERTAIN I would disobey. But in that moment, in that time, in that situation, I don't KNOW. I haven't been there. Thank God, I haven't been there. That, as disgusting as it might make me, is my hard honest answer. Pray we never have to put it to the test. I don't want to know, to risk being disillusioned about myself. (Ed.) Here's a reality about the military. You are trained to obey orders. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep, you are drilled to obey orders. You practice obeying orders. Periodically, you are informed there are situations under which you may or are required to disobey orders, told the protocol you must follow to correctly disobey an order, then immediately go out and drill obeying orders. At no point do you ever practice NOT obeying orders. You are drilled to obey orders and obey orders and obey orders until obeying orders becomes instinct. If you have time to think about it when given an unlawful or immoral order, you find it in yourself to disobey (following the protocol, of course. \u201cSir, I must respectfully decline to obey that order because\u2026\u201d ), I've done it. But in the immediacy of the moment? I suspect people will act with their strongest training. The military will t ell you you can disobey and how, but will train you to obey. To do otherwise, you MUST train yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "As a soldier I was given an order from a superior that I believed to be illegal so I countermanded it right on the spot. I verbally stated very quickly that his order was illegal for the fact that it placed the safety of MY men in jeopardy if they followed the order. I then asked my senior NCO and a young E5 to witness MY refusal to pass along what I considered to be an illegal order. Note that I continued to mention illegal as I had already determined that the order was moral (shooting artillery rounds downrange) but still illegal. Moral and immoral acts are not so clearly defined even in the military and most depend upon much more than appearances, such as the example you used. One person\u2019s defenseless could be simply an uninformed opinion when you discover that those same \u201cwomen and children\u201d are carrying explosive devices directly toward your and your fellow soldiers\u2019 position and they refuse to halt or raise their hands. Under some circumstances you might not be able to determine if what appears to be \u201cwomen and children\u201d really are that. So no example so vague as the one you used can be considered to be immoral much less illegal. Clear refusal to accept and obey both illegal and immoral orders do not have the benefit of 20/20 hindsight and can be a slippery slope if everyone in life or death situations (that is what a great many military situations are, and most assuredly ALL the ones in combat) are allowed, much less encouraged, to morally assess each and every order. A huge amount of what combat soldiers do is muscle memory, love of one's brothers-in-arms, and faith and trust in the leadership to do the right thing (meaning give the right orders that are both legal and moral). I was blessed to serve with a huge number of voluntary and involuntary service members of all ranks that spanned a broad spectrum between would follow them through the gates of Hell all the way to never turn my back on or took an eye off of thankfully only a very few. BTW. The illegal order that I first mentioned was to insert single edge razor blades under the fuses on howitzer shells before firing. The idea of that officer was that they would \u201cscream like a banshee\u201d going down range and scare the enemy. I could not accept the responsibility of an in-chamber or immediately in front of the tube explosion that would endanger MY unit. He refused to stand near the first rounds fired so as CO of the firing battery I reported his illegal order and surprise, he rotated out of the field to the rear and the episode was never mentioned again anywhere other than my exit OER, where I was commended. Small reward for safety over a clearly illegal, and not so obviously, immoral order given by a superior officer. ",

            "answer_text": "You as a soldier have the moral obligation to think and question the leader. Let's give two examples, Example No#1 if your squad leader tells you to go into a hospital nursery and kill every baby in there. Common sense, should prevail in your own mind telling you that babies are non-combatants and you should NEVER EVER for any reason kill a baby. There is another really bad idea, because once the foreign force, people, and the media discover this, it will be posted all over the world and the US will lose the hearts and minds of those it's trying to win. Example No# 2 if you squad leader tells you to kill what you think are defenseless children and you don't, you could risk the life the everyone in your team, squad, platoon, or company. This was a bad problem in Vietnam when young kids were carrying grenades into groups of soldiers. This has happened in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it's not as common. So you must pay close attention to the R.O.E. (Rules Of Engagement). This is why you must use common sense. A baby or 1 year old, a quadriplegic and hundreds of other examples are non-combatants. Just because someone says to kill them, doesn't mean you should. if they give you a lawful order and you do kill a defenseless person, then you and the person who gave the order will be punished under the UCMJ.

            "answer_text": "Good question. At the Hungarian People\u2019s Army we had four major rules about the giving and taking an order \u201cAn order is unappealable, criticising it is forbidden.\u201d An order should be in accordance with the law (including international conventions), the internal instructions and the orders of our superiors. When giving an order we should consider all available data and make our decision according to the momentary circumstances. A subordinate soldier have to refuse an order if that\u2019s \u201cimmediately and clearly\u201d perceivably against the oath, against the interest of the state, or it involves committing a crime. Then the subordinate soldier have to report the non-compliance with orders to his superiors ASAP. Actually both the wording and the spirit of the rules were rather loose and gave a lot of space for the assumptions and even for the personal feelings of the commander. So, as a commanding officer according to the \u201cavailable data\u201d and the \u201ccircumstances\u201d I could have ordered killing anyone (except POWs) or \u201cconfiscating\u201d anything from the civilians if I could find out some tactical or strategic reason. \u2026and my soldiers would have been bound to do whatever I ordered. Of course I also would have been bound to get immoral things done if the order properly reasoned and not clearly against the law. I could have asked for confirmation and could have asked questions about my concerns, but I couldn\u2019t criticise or refuse the order if it was carefully worded unless I would have wanted a short court martial for non-compliance with orders during wartime and then most likely getting a bullet in the back of the neck. Better them than me. ",

            "answer_text": "As a soldier, if your superior ordered you to do something immoral like killing defenseless children, would you do it or would you disobey? This has actually happened during the Vietnam war, although I\u2019m sure it has happened in pretty much every major war, and testimony of the event was a centerpiece of the anti-war movement. It was called the My Lai Massacre - Wikipedia. The documentary The Vietnam War: A film by Ken Burns & Lynn Novick talks about this event briefly. The program in its entirety can be viewed on Netflix and elsewhere. As shown by history, soldiers follow orders. As described by one of the participants in the documentary, as a soldier you don\u2019t know if they are the good guys or the bad guys, your superiors have more information than you do, and ultimately you\u2019re thousands of miles from home, these people don\u2019t really matter to you. Disobeying an order usually means a court-martial and during wartime that could mean being assigned the worst and most dangerous posts, which is worse than any jail. The Uniform Code of Military Justice is clear that unlawful orders do not have to be followed, but it\u2019s your word against your commanding officer. Even if the UCMJ is on your side you might end up reassigned for other \u201cmisdeeds\u201d by your commanding officer. On the books the system is setup one way, in the real world, the UCMJ isn\u2019t all-powerful. ",

I was a corpsman attached to a marine rifle company. My platoon bivouacked in a small stand of trees in an otherwise open field near Con Thien. It was late afternoon as we set up camp for the night, including setting claymore mines all around our perimeter. Soon, a group of young children from the nearby village approached, selling cans of coca-cola and bottles of locally made rice wine. All the kids came inside our perimeter and were busy making friends and and selling drinks. However, our platoon sergeant noticed that there was one kid who stayed outside the perimeter and all of a sudden the sergeant pulled his .45, chambered a round and took aim at the kid, telling him in Vietnamese to scram. The kid just stood there for a moment. When he didn't move the sergeant took a step towards him and repeated his command. All the other kids started to leave and finally the loner joined them. No one could understand the sergeant's behavior until he showed us what had happened. While everyone else was preoccupied with the kids inside the perimeter, the loner was turning around all our claymores. Needless to say, no one, especially kids, made it inside our perimeter unless they belonged there. EDIT: in the second to the last line, insert after \u201ckids,\u201d the words \u201cever again\u201d. ",

Then I\u2019d kill anybody who resisted, and not worry one tiny bit about anybody else who happened to be near them at the time. There is no such thing as a \u201cwar crime\u201d. War is the ultimate expression of extra-legal activity. \u201cWar crimes\u201d are what you accuse the losers of so you can feel better about shooting or hanging them after the war ends.The purpose of war is to kill enemy civilians until they are too terrified to resist any more. Fighting the enemy\u2019s military forces is just step one.Orders to kill the enemy are never illegal. Except for certain circumstances when they enemy combatants have surrendered, and their surrender has been accepted.The moral imperative in war is victory. Your own personal survival is not a moral imperative. Why should I care at all about the enemy?It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to bomb villages and cities into oblivion, wholesale. Therefore it\u2019s just as lawful to do the same thing on a retail, one person at a time scale. If it\u2019s OK for the bomber pilot to push a button, it\u2019s OK for a rifleman to pull a trigger.It\u2019s perfectly legal and moral to take hostages to ensure the good behavior of the enemy. And it\u2019s perfectly lawful and morally necessary to execute the hostages if the enemy misbehaves.You would not believe how often our barbaric enemies use children as combatants, walking bombs, distractions, or meat shields. Not to mention their regular abuse of children in other, even more despicable ways.All this being said, there are some things you should\u2019t do, as they will just make the overall situation worse. And there are some things that civilized, Western soldiers, unlike our enemies, just won\u2019t do.",

While serving in this capacity, this issue was not discussed, but each of us knew that in the unlikely event of doing our duty and \u201cfollowing orders\u201d innocents near targets (and downwind from the nuclear explosions) were going to die in droves. However, it seems that there was a tacit understanding among us all that should we do this we would be forever labeled as \u201cwar criminals.\u201d Years afterward, I was talking to a counselor who asked me if I would have followed launch orders and why. My response of \u201cfollowing orders\u201d resulted in an immediate awakening and terrible feelings of guilt. Glad I never had to go to trial in Nuremberg. War was and is a terrible thing where innocents die. Good thing we never had the chance. ",

If I simply disagree, that is a more difficult matter. Refusal to obey orders is treated as violation of the law, where you face a legal battle to justify why you did what you did. Perhaps if it is immoral enough and I decide not to follow orders, I can take the chance that the court will recognise this and not punish me for refusal to obey. War is meant to be limited. That is why we have internationally agreed upon definitions of what is unacceptable in war. That said, war is often a situation where angrier heads are put into a powerful position, which sometimes is good and sometimes is very bad, and often serves no one. If you have a commanding officer that is such a person you have a dilemma: follow orders in the spirit of the corps, or follow your ethics and moral sensibilities. It is a hard choice. Many choices on the battlefield are. Best regards, Jean. ",
