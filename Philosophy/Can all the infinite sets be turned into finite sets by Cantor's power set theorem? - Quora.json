            "answer_text": "Maybe I am missing something, but Cantor\u2019s power set theorem allows you to use a set to create a set with larger cardinality. So the power set of {1,2,3} (which has cardinality 3) has cardinality of 8. The power set of the Natural numbers (which has cardinality Aleph 0) have the cardinality as the Reals (known as c). But it doesn\u2019t provide a mechanism for making a set of smaller cardinality. And any finite set has less cardinality than any infinite set. So I can\u2019t see how Cantor\u2019s power set theorem helps with anything like this. ",
