            "answer_text": "Mathematical systems of the ancient world could become remarkably complex even without a rigorous set of axioms. What happened was that they had a pool of knowledge they considered as true, say: The area of a rectangle is the product of the length of the sides.Out of that they could deduce some new bit of knowledge: If you cut a rectangle across the diagonal, you get two identical right-angled triangles.Since each triangle has the same area, each has half of the area of the rectangle.Since we know what the area of a rectangle is, that means the area of a triangle with a right-angle is half of the product of the lengths of the sides next to the right angle.Now that you found out the area of a right angle triangle, you can build some more on top of this: Any triangle can be cut across its height, and you get two right-angled triangles. You might need a picture here to clarify.Since you know the area of each right-angled triangle, when you add them up you get that the area of the original triangle if half the product of the base of the triangle and the height of the triangle.This is how you found out the area of any triangle just by knowing the area of a rectangle. By splitting any polygon in triangles - also known as triangulation - , you can find calculate the area of any track of land that\u2019s enclosed by a set of straight lines only using a marked piece of string for measurements. Pretty remarkable by ancient standards. Does it matter that the original bit of information that you started from, the rectangle area formula, is an axiom or not? It\u2019s pretty obvious it\u2019s true for you, everything else seems to work in practice, that\u2019s all you need as an ancient mathematician/engineer. You\u2019re not writing academic papers, you\u2019re building temples and pyramids, get over yourself. Egyptians knew and used the Pythagorean theorem well before Pythagoras, they just didn\u2019t have a formal proof for it. The focus on having all theorems derived from a set of absolutely minimal axioms is something that we get from the Greeks. The idea of axioms was never an \u201cAha!\u201d moment, it was a gradual buildup of rigor over the previous way of doing things. The way an activity is performed (be it mathematics, medicine or even painting and carpentry) always moves in the direct of what society values. The Greeks prized rhetoric and arguments highly, therefore they incentivised their mathematicians to have ever more rigor than their predecessors. Pythagoras and Euclid contributed to this buildup, but they were not as important to it as people think, it\u2019s just that their names pop up often. The ball towards axioms probably started rolling because of Thales of Miletus, the first person known to engage in what we\u2019d now call scientific reasoning. Socrates probably also contributed to this trend towards formalization. Even though he was not a mathematician, his way of reasoning deeply influenced all western scientific thought. The second big leap after Thales probably was that made by Eudoxus of Cnidus. He found the formulas for the volumes of cones and spheres, which without calculus are incredibly hardcore. To avoid working with irrational numbers, he was forced to work exclusively with geometric primitive notions, and by this he probably laid down the foundation to the first proper axiomatic system. It\u2019s probably unfortunate that by achieving so many results in geometry he seem to have had a millennia-long stiffing effect on the development of arithmetic and algebra. Euclid worked on top of Eudoxus\u2019s work, mostly by doing a compilation work know as Elements, that would become the basis of teaching math for the new 2000 years. That is, until the mathematicians of the 19th century started showing everyone what true rigor is! ",

            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t. The logical process is self-contained, but on its own, it\u2019s like a flag tumbling in the breeze. The axioms list the basic facts on which the proof builds, providing the pole from which the flag flies. Take any proof you like and remove the axioms. Then rework the proof without relying on the information given by the axioms. At best this just means you have to prove the (former) axioms before you start on the theorem you actually want to prove. And then you may notice you have created a whole new set of axioms to eliminate. There was a computer, Deep Thought, in the Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, which when it was initially turned on, had started with the basic truth, I think, therefore I am, and deduced the existence of income tax and chewing gum before anyone has a chance to turn it off again. Even Deep Thought had an axiom to start with. Today we incorporate this process into the scientific principle. All new work builds on previous work. No one expects a researcher to prove the existence of DNA before \u2026 oh I don\u2019t know\u2026 trying to clone a dodo from a museum specimen. What has already been proven is assumed in new work - at least, until it is disproved. And I am confident that, even before the word axiom (or the Greek equivalent) had been invented, ancient mathematicians started by marshaling what they already knew before branching off into the great unknown. Your next task is to find ways to make the word POSIT redundant. ",

However, the basic idea of axioms is ancient\u2014Euclid wrote down a list of basic postulates in the Elements around 300 BCE. The essential ingredients of proof are older still: the Pythagoreans were able to give a fairly reasonable proof for the eponymous theorem. The way to understand this is as follows: a proof is essentially just an argument, starting from some basic assumptions, to show that something is true. Logic took some time to develop, and a truly rigorous logic that could (at least in theory) be checked by a computer is certainly a modern invention, but the basics of argumentation almost certainly predate the written word.

For instance, in pure Predicate logic, a constructive cut free proof alwaysends with an introduction rule, hence a constructive cut free existential proofalways ends with an introduction rule of the existential quantifier. But this resultdoes not extend to axiomatic theories, as a constructive cut free proof in a theorymay also end, for instance, with the axiom rule.In the same way, in automated theorem proving in pure Predicate logic,the search space of the proposition ? is always finite. But this result does notextend to axiomatic theories, that can generate an infinite search space for theproposition .
