            "answer_text": "What is a tree? A tree is an incredibly complex organism that: reproduces and establishes itself over an enormous range of territory from 70\u02da South Latitude to 70\u02da North Latitude and from sea level to about 20,000 feet (6500 m) elevation and from wet jungles to dry savannas;transforms CO\u2082 from the atmosphere into Oxygen (released back into the atmosphere) and Carbon which through metabolic processes becomes part of the cellulose, lignin, and other components of the solid tissues making up the tree (wood, bark, leaves, etc.);uptakes water from the soil to support its metabolic processes and releases this as highly purified vapour into the atmosphere (contributing greatly to the amount of moisture in the air - which become clouds and rain, necessary for all life on the planet);with its roots, retains soil in areas by resisting very effectively the erosive factors of wind, rain, and melting snow even on very steep areas;with its stems, branches and particularly foliage, provides shade for the soil from direct continuous sunlight, keeping the soil and sub-canopy environment cooler in summer and warmer in winter;with its shading, in cooler climates, delays the melt of accumulated winter snowfall, thereby reducing the severity and duration of spring floods;serves as a windbreak, reducing the force and severity of winds considerably where it occurs, either naturally or as planted for that purpose;provides a safe habitat for a myriad of life terrestrial forms - fungi, mosses, ferns, bryophytes, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals and even many species of fish, to name a pew; and,incidentally, provides wood and a host of wood products with which we can build houses and furniture, airplanes, boats, to name a few of a multitude of items, provides paper, without which our communications and information storage would be severely curtailed (notwithstanding electronic media), and provides a fuel for heating and cooking for much of the world.To put it bluntly, we, as a species, along with almost all of the other terrestrial as well as a large number of marine plant and animal species would be unable to survive without trees as individuals or as forests. So I return the question to you, how can a tree not have value ? ",

The song name was \u201cdekh tamasha lakdi ka\u201d and song language is hindi. It was one of my favourite song. The theme and highlighted line was \u201cwoods are needed from birth to the death\u201d The song is very old but i came to know the value of trees through this song first time in my life. In books and lectures, our teachers teach is that how trees are important for us, but for me, this song taught how trees are really a part of our life. ",
