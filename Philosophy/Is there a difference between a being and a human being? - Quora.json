            "answer_text": "Personally I would say that a being is the person, that is separate from their body and mind, the soul or spirit that moves from one life to the next. A Human Being is being that is being a human. If you consider the possibility of other life out there in the universe, then there are other types of bodies that are not human, so a being could be a different being, then human. ",

We could get into a more philosophical debate about the meaning of \u201cbeing\u201d for extra Earth purposes but I assume you meant not including aliens? ",
