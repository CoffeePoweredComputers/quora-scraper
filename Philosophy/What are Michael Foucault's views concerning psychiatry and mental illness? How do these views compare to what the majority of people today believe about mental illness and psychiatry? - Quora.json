            "answer_text": "Foucault's first major research work was dedicated to elaborating a history of madness. This work was published in 1961, with the title \"Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason\". In this work, Foucault studies the change in conceptions of madness with the advent of the modern age. Foucault studied the different conceptions of madness as they are manifested in various areas of culture, such as in literature or in the first treaties of psychiatry. Foucault presented the argument that the first psychiatric hospitals emerged as spaces for exclusion and internment of certain individuals to fill the void left by the disappearance of leprosy. It is difficult to summarize such a complex and rich work here, so it is recommended to read it. In any case, the main thesis of the book is related to the idea that the age of Enlightenment, in the formation of the modern age, implied the constitution of a duality of opposition between reason and unreason (between the domain of the rational as opposed to a domain irrational). With the age of the Enlightenment, the Enlightenment and the formation of a new political order of modernity, there was the beginning of the construction of spaces of exclusion for the insane, of an internment and the formation of psychiatric knowledge. Foucault underlines that in ancient times madness was recognized as a form of divine inspiration. In the modern age, the representation and cultural status of the madman has changed. Madness constitutes itself as a category that applies a great diversity of singular individuals, who have been repressed or excluded from the constitution of the new rational order of modern emerging society. With modernity, madness was constituted as a limit to reason, as a space of the irrational (everything that cannot be represented). Foucault evokes Goya's work: \"The sleep of reason produces monsters\". Foucault defines madness as the absence of work, that is, we can interpret it as meaning that mad people are those who have been exiled and made unable to manifest or express their creativity and uniqueness. In addition to the existence, in fact, of mental illnesses, those who have been prevented from expressing themselves differently, for reasons of conformity with the established social order, are also diagnosed as crazy. Many are excluded from society because they present different ways of feeling and suffering. At the same time that Foucault published this work, the anti-psychiatry movement became very important in the 1960s. In Foucault we can find arguments to affirm that madness is largely a social construction that is related to institutions of power. I would say that at present, many problems that are recognized as psychiatric problems in certain individuals, are seen as mental problems when they originate in an oppressive political order for those same individuals.
