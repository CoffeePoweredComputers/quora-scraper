            "answer_text": "It depends on which subject you are enrolling like M.Sc in Chemistry is one of the top levels you can look after. Otherwise French, English, Biochem etc. are also popular there. I did M.Sc in Computer Science there. I\u2019d like to say don\u2019t choose Pondicherry University for doing M.Sc in Computer Science there unless you\u2019d like to spend time yourself in your study. Don\u2019t expect much there in the Computer Science department regarding classroom studies. So many classes skipped in our time. But for self-study, it\u2019s best. No one will care about your coursework so that you can do your own work peacefully. ",
