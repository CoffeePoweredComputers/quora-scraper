            "answer_text": "In the post-war years here in former Yugoslavia, values were shifted\u2026 very much. Poverty was incredible. Due to monstrous inflation, teachers\u2019 monthly wages were enough to purchase, I kid you not, two loafs of bread. Almost everyone who could be corrupted, was corrupted. It was no secret that many teachers gave grades in return for not money but food! Any foreign currency was worth the difference between feeding your kids\u2026 or not. Both my parents were high school teachers. We were getting by, barely, because we had relatives who grew food, and because some kids would pay for private lessons in foreign currency. It was not really enough, but we weren\u2019t hungry, even though my parents had to work miracles at times to feed us with flour and eggs only. So, my father was correcting some tests, a man came to our place and talked to him, my brother and I were playing a game, and we heard my father saying \u201cYour son is a good boy, I can see he was trying and studying hard, and that he is very shy. Don\u2019t tell him I said it, but if he even tries to answer a question, I will give him a passing grade, if we boost his confidence, I am certain his studying will show more.\u201d The man thanked my father. They said goodbye. The man went out. And then, for the first time in our lives, my brother and I heard our always polite and always calm and reasonable father say a swear word. No, not say it, he screamed it from the top of his lungs at the man, and moved as if he was going to shove the man downstairs. I think he might have done it if it wasn\u2019t for my mother, grabbing his shoulder and whispering \u201cPlease, baby, calm down!\u201d in his ear. We were petrified. The next thing that we saw was the man running downstairs and my father throwing an envelope at him, screaming \u201cAND DON\u2019T YOU F*CKIN* DARE TO LEAVE THIS HERE!!!\u201d. Money spilled out, foreign currency, I think more than both my father\u2019s and my mother\u2019s yearly income at the time. We kept eating eggs and jam sent from our relatives who lived in a village and had chickens and plum treas, and not much more, for a couple of years until the times got better. So, for me, that is integrity. And a lesson for life. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a story that I think is the perfect answer to this question. In ancient China, the emperor was growing old but did not have a successor. He wanted to choose one of the many children in his kingdom so that he could start training them to take the throne when he passed away. So, he sent out an announcement to all the families to send their most capable child to the palace. On the morning he specified on the invitation, the palace walls contained over a thousand children and their parents, eager to earn the favor of the emperor. He came in front of them and spoke loudly and clearly: \u201cI will now give each of you a single seed. It is your job to take care of the seed as though your life depends upon it. Come back to the palace precisely 8 months from now, and the one with the best and most beautiful plant, as judged by myself, will become the successor to the throne.\u201d  The children eagerly lined up and received a single seed from the emperor, all of varying sizes, shapes and even colors. The last in line was one little boy, who clutched the precious seed in his fist and ran all the way home to bury it deep in a pot with soft soil. As the months went on, each child carefully watered their seeds and watched them grow. Saplings sprouted leaves, flowers, and even branches. Some grew even taller than the child it belonged to- but the little boy, try as he might, could not get his seed to sprout. He changed the soil, added all kinds of fertilizers, even tried watering it with milk instead. But all to no avail. When the 8 month mark came, he was the only one in line with a barren pot, and no plant at all. When the emperor finally came to him, he looked down in shame. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sprout the seed,\u201d he whispered. But the emperor only smiled thinly and moved on. When all the plants had been inspected, the emperor stood in front of the crowd and spread his arms. \u201cI have a confession to make,\u201d he said. \u201cThe seeds I gave all of you were actually burnt, and covered up to make them look healthy. They were not meant to grow at all.\u201d While all the other children gasped in shock, the emperor smiled at the little boy. \u201cBecause you were the only one who did not buy a plant instead of following my instructions exactly,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are the only one with enough integrity to succeed my throne.\u201d ",
