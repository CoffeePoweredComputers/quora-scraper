            "answer_text": "Plato is a crazy bastard who believe that there is such a thing as absolute beauty because he fooled himself into believing that his definition of beauty is somehow better than other people\u2019s definition. That\u2019s why he parade what he find to be \u201cbeautiful\u201d as the \u201ctrue reality\u201d rather than reality itself. Fact, beauty is a subjective thing. What you find beautiful isn\u2019t the same as what other people find to be beautiful. It is all a matter of tastes. But when people disagree with Plato\u2019s version of beauty, he down right tell them that they\u2019re wrong. Reality is define as the world or the state of things as they actually exist as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them. Meaning that reality is about facts. Not about notions of beauty or bias distorted view of what something is. A tree falls down from the forest. Just because no one saw it falls doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t. That is reality. That is facts. The Mona Lisa is made out of paint and paper. The value it has are things that people gave it. In reality, it is simply a piece of paper with paint on it. That is reality. That is facts. Plato notion of reality is so far removed from what reality actually is that I\u2019m surprise people are still learning about it today. ",
