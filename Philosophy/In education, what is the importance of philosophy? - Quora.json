            "answer_text": "A philosophy of education is a system of thinking about what education is for and how it should be done. In order to know how best to do something, you need to be very clear about what it is that you are trying to accomplish. At first glance, the idea of a philosophy of education seems a little like \u201cwell, DUH - it\u2019s teaching the students!\u201d But - what do we teach them? How to do a job? To be good citizens? To think for themselves? To cooperate with leaders? To focus on science? To focus on civics? Art? Philosophy? To balance their lives or throw themselves entirely into what is most important? Important to whom - the student? parents? leaders? experts? Which leaders? Experts in what? And here is the problem: The answer to almost every question of that type is YES. But there are a limited number of hours in a day, and for some of those, YES implies NO to another. For example, in teaching math, we can either give students the exact method to do something, or we can guide them to discover the method for themselves. The first is much faster, and leaves more time for practice. But students forget what they have been told, and remember what they have discovered for themselves. And the process of discovering procedures for themselves trains them to be ready for new challenges. Another philosophical question in math education: do we let students use technology, or do we require them to calculate by hand? Calculating by hand develops speed and efficiency in basic calculations, but takes time that could be used learning more advanced math. And using technology is how they will do math outside of school. Questions like these come up often in teaching and in discussing education. By thinking carefully about these questions ahead of time, we are able to act on, and explain, our best ideas and most important values in the moment. When a student is struggling and a parent is asking why you aren\u2019t doing things the classical way or why you aren\u2019t using the latest fad, you need to have already thought about it. You need to know why you are doing what you are doing, and neither \u201cbecause that\u2019s how we always have always done it\u201d nor \u201cthat\u2019s what this book says we should do\u201d is good enough.

            "answer_text": "Philosophy helps to sort out how best to think about and reflect on experiences in order to make better choices in life. Broad categories of philosophy include metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics, politics, and aesthetics. Simply defined from the Greek words \"philo\" and \"sophia,\" meaning \"love of wisdom\" is the word \"philosophy.\" Parsing the word offers an opportunity to consider more deeply what it means. All should know what \"love\" means even if it does not lend itself to a very precise definition or sometimes expression. The words \"want, need, and care\" are rolled up with a passion for defining love. The more interesting word in this context is \"wisdom.\" What does it mean to be wise? Almost any definition of wisdom tells us it is about making good, right or true choices, decisions, or judgments. For this argument, the word \"choices\" is used in the sense of choosing between good and bad, right and wrong, beautiful and ugly, true and false, natural and supernatural, scientific and pseudoscientific, etc. Thus, philosophy \"loves\" to study how we make \"choices\" in life. Consistent with this position, the Oxford English Dictionary defines \"philosophy\" in an etymological context as \"the love, study, or pursuit of wisdom, truth, or knowledge.\" philosophy, n. [Def. 1]. OED Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved August 27, 2019, from www.oed.com/view/Entry/142505. Making intentional choices is quintessentially human. Our daily lives are nothing if not about making choices. Many of them are mundane to be sure, but now and then a choice arises that requires thinking in a certain way. In this view, anyone that reflects on making a choice is a philosopher, if they reflect on the choice they have to make or have made. By thinking about how choices are made in life shows that thinking is not a monolithic undertaking as if there were but one way of thinking, but there are ways (plural) of knowing and thinking. For example, one might make a choice solely based on passion, upon which later reflection might suggest another and more rational choice may have been better.
