            "answer_text": "Paradoxes are not theories. They are intellectually challenging, logically confusing and often comprised of inherently contrasting observations or situations put together in an \u201capparent\u201d cohesive story... There can be theories to solve paradoxes. Some paradoxes are innately designed with fallacies which can\u2019t be exposed unless you solve them. They are called FALSIDICAL Paradoxes. These often look like they are \u201cdesigned correctly\u201d until you realize the flaws in the design that make them the paradoxes. Some paradoxes are simply problems that can be solved, but are too difficult to begin with. They are \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cvalid\u201d situations that lead to an actual \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cvalid\u201d result. They are called VERIDICAL Paradoxes. And the other remaining category is emotive drive. They are inherently \u201cinsolvable\u201d because of the stark incompatible premises. They are almost like \u201cFOREVER PARADOXES\u201d. They are usually not solved unless, there are theories made to extend the meaning of their premises or make further amends to their interpretations. Here\u2019s a nice video if you are further interested.  ",
