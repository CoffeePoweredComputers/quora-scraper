            "answer_text": "I think there is an important element that Freud left out of this equation: safety. The other side of safety is risk. People want freedom but they are maximizing both freedom and safety, and this causes them to be willing to give up some measure of freedom in exchange for safety, which some people, including, apparently, Freud, interpret as being frightened of responsibility \u2014 or the risks associated with responsibility. One of the greatest survival tools humans have developed is the ability to cooperate. When we act together, we are much stronger in both overcoming opposition and in creating benefits that can be shared among the group of cooperators. We have evolved, in my opinion, to make instant decisions about who is a good candidate for cooperation and who isn\u2019t. We use signifiers for cooperation based on things we can instantly ascertain about a person, such as how they look, sound, smell and behave. This leads to prejudice and discrimination because people are biased towards people who look, sound, smell and behave more like them, and to be more mistrusting of those who are more different. Since we want cooperators because that creates safety, we try to appear as cooperatable as possible. That usually means trying to look, sound, smell and behave as much like the majority of those around us as we can. We call this look \u201cnormality.\u201d People want to look normal so they can be considered eligible for cooperation, which ensures safety. In fact, I think that for many people, being normal is more important than the truth of reality. We say many things and say we believe many things in order to be like others \u2014 to be normal \u2014 so we can stay in the protection of the group, even though those things may not matter or may not be true. Belonging is a more important survival skill than expressing the truth. In seeking out belonging, we sacrifice truth. We often claim things are true that are not true because that keeps us safe. I think that people make a calculation that giving up freedom in the service of safety is more valuable that sticking with truth if it puts you at odds with others. It is far riskier to be on your own, but on your own is where there is often more freedom. I don\u2019t really think personal responsibility is much of a concern for people. When we cooperate, we create a kind of collective responsibility. I think people like the odds of collective responsibility better than the odds of personal responsibility. I don\u2019t think this is people eschewing responsibility. It\u2019s more an issue of what strategy can they take to maximize their personal survival, and generally, people think being normal is the safest course of action \u2014 and that being normal is a way of taking responsibility for themselves.

            "answer_text": "These are my thoughts, of course, and not \u2018facts\u2019. People join churches and other ideological organizations and subscribe to the doctrines. This simplifies their lives, in that they subscribe to an ideology and the ideology prescribes some of the decisions in their lives. Having been a person who lived in both a controlling relationship and something most people would call a \u2018cult\u2019, I can say that there is an element of \u201cI don\u2019t have to give that area of my life any thought, because the decision has been made in that area\u201d. In the same way that wearing a black turtleneck every day gave Steve Jobs less to think about in clothing and more freedom to spend his time elsewhere, people make tradeoffs by subscribing to ideologies or group memberships. What they gain is a sense of belonging and less things to make decisions about, and what they lose is a degree of autonomy. When in a cult I knew who my friends were and what I would wear, what I would eat, etc. When I left, there were a host of decisions I didn\u2019t realize I WASN\u2019T making on a daily basis because those things went without saying. Another example is politics. It is easier to say \u201cI am a democrat\u201d or \u201cI am a republican\u201d than to enumerate and formulate opinions on every issue. What is easier? To adopt an identity and act according to the prevailing opinion of that group is easier than doing the work of deciding on every single issue. So, I agree, most people don\u2019t want that degree of freedom. But some of us do. ",
