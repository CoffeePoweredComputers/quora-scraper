            "answer_text": "No, no physical part of your body is permanent. You are a person labouring under the misapprehension that your body is you, or you are your body! This is not intended to be a facetious reply, but I hope it leads you towards a different question - one which will lead you to contemplate more deeply and more profoundly and seek the answer everywhere possible both around you and inside you. It is a question philosophers and sages have pondered throughout the ages:\"If I am not my body, then who and what am I?\" \"Am I my brain, or my mind, my soul?\" \"When the body dies what is left?\" You may also want to ask yourself \"What is it that makes me conscious of being me?\" \"What is this I?\" Then you may start to question \"Where did I come from, how did I come into existence and to what purpose?\"These are some of the most important questions we can ask as human beings looking for a meaning to life, and a purpose to our existence. An understanding of our identity and our point of origin. This is why our religions and philosophies exist, why we create gods and belief systems. These are all a means to come to terms with the questions we find ourselves incapable of answering. We put the responsibility upon those who claim to have all the answers and the authority to provide them. But do they, can they be expected to assume such a responsibility on behalf of the entire human race? Well, that is what the self appointed religious leaders and gurus are doing throughout the world.Are you any less capable of contemplating these questions for yourself than anyone else?If you have the courage to do that, and are willing to put in the work, then eventually you will arrive at your own truth, your own answers. Then you will have assumed the responsibility for yourself to seek an answer to your own questions, and you will have no need for any sort of artificial belief structure (I am not implying that you should not acknowledge the existence of a Creator, I am referring to the institution of religions and cults). It may surprise you to find that not only have you asked many of the same questions as the greatest minds in history, but your answers may also be very similar to those they arrived at. That is probably because there are no definitive answers to such questions when using only pure intellect. Reason has its limits, whereas the imagination has none. Try thinking outside the box, beyond the limits of the intellect. There are limitless dimensions of experience within each of us. It is for us to discover and tap into their secrets. Your inner journey will be unique to you - there are no limits other than those you yourself impose upon that experience. Learn to trust your heart and your intuition and allow them to guide you. Then use your intellect to evaluate your experience so you can then write it down and contemplate it further. Perhaps, eventually you will want to share it with others. ",

            "answer_text": "You are a living soul. Living soul= spirit+soul. (assuming soul to have a spiritual mind already). Soul= spiritual body; takes form and can be thought of as material, just not with ordinary matter. Spirit= The immanent and inexpressible awareness of one's universe, that by itself cannot interact with it (actual consciousness). The Flesh- Physical body- made of normal matter. The Mind- The apparent and expressible awareness of ones universe, that can interact with it (percievable consciousness); Has a physical and spiritual counterpart (maybe conscious thought is physical and subconscious has connections with spiritual? Do not confuse consciousness with conscious thought). A mortal living soul- The Flesh+Soul+Spirit+Mind Who are \u201cyou\u201d? You are the spirit housed by the soul you have. Now, if you are nonreligious and do not believe in the concept of souls, let me answer your question differently. \u201cYou\u201d is just a subjective word and it is meaningless. \u201cYou\u201d are a everchanging state of atomic mass with a \u201cbefore you exist\u201d and an \u201cafter you are done existing\u201d. After you die, you are not. Or rather, you do not exist. Now if you believe in reincarnation, we can go back to the spirit idea. Otherwise just take your pick. Because the difference between people is never the same difference in different moments in time, and \u201cyou\u201d five seconds from now is not \u201cyou\u201d now, unless you believe in the concept of spirits, which have always existed, cannot be created or destroyed, and cannot be altered internally in any way (not talking about souls, which God did create according to my beliefs). If you are not your spirit, then you are your body (your is just a subjective word used to point a finger across the Internet; I could also have said \u201cif not a spirit, then a body is you\u201d). If you are your spirit, you have always been you and will forever be you, as the exact same you. If you are your body, you started being you x years ago, you will stop being you y years from now, and you have never been the exact same you. Hope this helped. :) ",
