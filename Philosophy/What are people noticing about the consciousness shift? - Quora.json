The initial reactions, in both categories, start out between the opposite poles of attraction (love or like) and repulsion (hate or dislike) or in between (provocative, a mix of love & hate), or neither (mindless, habitual)\u2026\u201d More at Section 6: Quickening Evolution (TCE 25 - 29)    From my book \u201cUnderstanding Creation\u2019s Design: Theory of Consciousness Evolution\u201d\u2026 More at my blog: www.mccrf.org (Mind Corruption Cure Research Fellowship) or Check out at Amazon.com ",

            "answer_text": "The increase in popularity of right wing politics and thinking would suggest a consciousness shift to more right brain use, as anxiety increases globally due to the stress of inequality and terrorism there appears to be generally more right brain use. The consciousness and energy regulator should be balanced with the whole body and focused on logical/positive brain areas this leads to equality and a more liberal but never extreme life and is reflected in politics, there are pockets of people shifting to more left brain use but we are losing the battle at the moment. Science is giving us the knowledge and tools to reduce right brain use with practices like EGMi but higher anxiety levels make practice harder, humans must overcome their evolutional brain fault and self evolve into left brain thinkers I eagerly await this shift be part of the solution not part of the problem.
