            "answer_text": "Let me write a conversation I had with one of the cleaning staff recently in my office. I had just entered the restroom and realized I was walking on the recently mopped floor Me: Apologies brother, I walked all over the wet floor! Him: It\u2019s okay Sir, I will mop it again ( he started humming with a beaming smile on his face) There was something about him which made me strike a conversation with him Me: How is your work going? Him: It\u2019s fantastic! (I wasn\u2019t sure if it was sarcasm) Me: I believe it must be hard for you to repeatedly clean the floor while every other person just keep walking on it ? Him: Yes, It is. He stopped, stood for a moment, kept his mop aside and looked me in the eye and said such simple yet empowering words which made me rethink my perspectives and choices I\u2019ve made so far He said \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it! I get the satisfaction of keeping it clean, over and over again\u201d Isn\u2019t it something we are all supposed to notice, yet we fail to do so? I learnt from him that being happy is an art and sometimes we just try too hard to be happy and satisfied that we forget that happiness is not an outcome but a process. We get caught up in the labrynth process of comparing ourselves with others and thinking about things we don\u2019t have, eventually loosing the whole purpose of doing something. We forget that whatever we do, we do it ultimately to remain happy. Always remember Happiness is not an act of pursuit. It is a process of manifestation! Namaste! ",
