            "answer_text": "Consciousness doesn\u2019t emerge \u201cfrom a brain\u201d. It emerges from the way the brain interacts with the world, with other people, with itself, with the subjective sides of all of these events, and with their entire history through evolutionary forces. If this sounds more complex than you expected, well, it is. Human beings have managed to get through most of their history in relatively complete ignorance of this complexity, but certain features of the current complexification, like enhanced communication and partly automated analysis, have accelerated knowledge change and broadened its scope. Regarding the above question, consciousness is already emerging from a combined system that is, for all practical purposes, nearly infinitely complex. The properties of the forms it may take are not limited by the complexity of the system. They are limited by things such as interconnection and signaling bandwidth, and the depth, resilience, stability, and diversity of \u201chigher level\u201d systems in which human activities are embedded. Each of those properties \u2014 depth, resilience, stability, diversity \u2014 gives clues about the \u201cproperties\u201d that form a dynamic foundation \u2014 which is itself emergent \u2014 for further complexification. Complexity is not an end in itself, not an intrinsically good or bad thing, not a function or goal of \u201cevolution\u201d. At this particular moment in history (March, 2020), the \u201cworld system\u201d is processing a new emergent phenomenon, triggered by and entangled with the Corona Virus. It travels along the fault lines in our increasingly complex global system, affecting different parts unequally and with no concern for human social values or social justice. The main system strategy for dealing with a pandemic is to reduce complexity\u2014 by quarantining, closing borders, reducing travel and assembly. On another level, it\u2019s important to reduce the complexity of information media content by suppressing fake and inaccurate news, and by focusing content on a lower number of issues. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cConsciousness emerges from a brain.\u201d That is nonsense. First you have to understand that Consciousness, which allow you to be active (normally during the day when you are not unconscious and sleeping), is the same as being active as a bacteria. A bacteria is conscious (aware) of its environment. So, nothing emerged from a larger Brain. Evolution defined the means how that state of consciousness evolved. It evolved with the repurposing of sensors, light sensors became eyes, chemotactic sensors evolved into smell, etc. So, Consciousness is not something that came into existence only within a full-size Brain. It existed since the simplest unicellular animal or vegetal\u2026etc. Natural Selection perfected the interface (sensors) and Natural Selection applied to Social Skills selected for Brain size. So, just drop the \u201cEmergent\u201d catch phrase and understand that Consciousness is the same as being awaken and aware of surroundings. Bacteria has Consciousness by that definition. The distinction between our consciousness and a bacteria consciousness is that we process the surroundings, we simulate social interactions and we predict (simulate) the future. Hence, our interface is broader. Consciousness (being awaken) is not the Soul and will die faster than the rest of you\u2026:) ",

            "answer_text": "Your arm is an emergent structure that comes from the bones, muscles, veins, nerves, etc., that comprises that part of you. The motion you exhibit with that arm is an emergent behavior that is comprised from muscular contractions/relaxations, nerve signals, etc. Does consciousness emerge from the brain? Well, consciousness isn\u2019t comprised of brain matter, it\u2019s not even comprised of any matter, so it\u2019s immaterial. It\u2019s not an emergent behavior of the brain either because it\u2019s not comprised of any intricate motions of brain matter nor is it comprised of the motions of any other matter, because again, it\u2019s immaterial. If you were to study how a brain behaves, you would understand action potentials, neurotransmitter releases, etc, but nowhere are you going to find consciousness. You can not have consciousness without unconsciousness and the fluctuations between them. The circadian rhythm is neither more than, less than, nor even as complex as the brain because you can\u2019t compare the material with the immaterial. What would be more complex than the brain would be the entire body, because that includes the brain plus every other organ. There\u2019s a whole lot more going on, including (but not limited to) blood circulation, air flow, and digestion. Consciousness is more akin to crests, unconsciousness is more akin to troughs, the whole circadian rhythm is more akin to wave signals and the brain is more akin to a radio which picks up said wave signals. Certain factors can change which signals are received whether it be physical fitness, diet, etc. Since the origin of circadian rhythm is not internal, but from somewhere external, then the source would be somewhere that transcends our bodies: The Spirit Realms. \u201cBad vibes\u201d come from Hell and \u201cgood vibes\u201d come from Heaven.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s apply some context. Within a given complexity rather than from a given complexity. The human being is the most complex structure in the known universe. Complexity is an inward journey. You can see Emergence in a video of early fetal formation.   This video is particularly helpful in its exploration of embryonic formation.  There many semantic ways of organizing your investigation. Consciousness is a difficult encapsulation. You may get further if first you think in terms of experience.  The RMCM DefinesExperience : any change to a given aggregate that becomes an Attribute* of that aggregate.  The definition is brittle in its precision. It reads exactly as it appears. No interpretation is necessary or valid; interpretation breaks the definition. Consciousness is also a medical term. Medicine has been very busy aggregating its surgical experience. Anesthesiologists are very clear about when. Neuroscience is closing in on where.  The brain is fully wired up, regardless of what Dr. Samuel Norman says. Skin is our largest organ, however within that skin the Central Nervous System is ubiquitous.  Notwithstanding the above, the most likely candidate for even further emergence is language in and of itself. Sound formation is the most emergent behavior in all of evolution, the exception being the immune metabolism. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are endogenous viral elements in the genome that closely resemble and can be derived from retroviruses. They are abundant in the genomes of jawed vertebrates, and they comprise up to 5\u20138% of the human genome (lower estimates of ~1%)   It is eminently reasonable to hypothesise about further emergence through language and or its complement hearing.   Attribute* Is further defined in the disclaimer ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can say that consciousness is an emerging property of the brain. It comes from the great depth of information processing that takes place there. Which somehow determines a thickness and a flavor to consciousness. The thickness is related to the depth of conceptual processing, and the flavor to the nature of the information processed. The two can be very different from one individual to another. That is to say that there is not \"one\" consciousness phenomenon but a multitude, one per individual in fact. It is the resemblance between all these phenomena that makes them call to the identical, and also the fact that we tend to place our own feelings in the heads of others. So an even more complex system than the human brain would experience its own consciousness, different from ours by a greater depth of information without being a different emergent property. Its thickness would be increased. The levels of consciousness forming this thickness are already successive emergences. This entity would view us in the same way that we see more raw animal consciousnesses. She might have completely given up on the commiseration we willingly show in such circumstances\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The very idea of a system is the formation of emergent properties. Such a system can be very complex but can also be formed by including at least 2 parts, e.g. a simple gearbox. My answer to What is consciousness? suggests that a Petri-net is essential for a proper description of the nature of self-consciousness. The purpose of such self-consciousness is to alleviate an entity from becoming overloaded by events that all compete for attention, being more or less important. Note that to gain experience of the effect of emerging self-consciousness qualia you probably need a substantially complex system that also may need AI-ability. ",
