            "answer_text": "Not really. The solution to the problem is not a compromise, but it sometimes seems to incorporate elements of subjectivity. Objectivist morality starts with a number of universal absolutes, namely the value of life, causality (actions have consequences), free will, and individuals as the primary agents of moral action. But many of the consequences of these absolute principles, when applied to the reality of different people\u2019s lives, may have very different applications and implementations. The central issue is the value trichotomy, or the Intrinsic, Subjective, Objective trichotomy. The three theories of value each differ in where the property of value is located, in the thing that is valued itself, in the person that values it, or as a relationship between the two. Subjective ethics, at its best, sees the value of a thing as being in the mind of person that values it. This clearly understand the expression \u201cOne man\u2019s garbage is another man\u2019s gold.\u201d What one person values, another may not. It explains the water/diamond paradox, where water is more essential for human survival, but diamonds have a higher market value. It also explains the fact that when there is a voluntary exchange, both parties of the exchange think they are better off. But it leaves out a large number of facts, which it cannot explain. The Objective theory of value agrees that the mind is important. If the person who values a thing does not exist, then a material object is just so much dead matter. But the thing itself is also important. For value to exist, there has to be both a conscious being that values it, and the thing itself must exist, and actually serve some purpose for the conscious being. This service that the object provides to such a purpose depends on properties inherent in the object. For instance, if you are hungry, you will likely value a ham sandwich. Or a salad if you are a vegetarian. You cannot stand on subjective value theory and claim that you want to eat a bowl of sand because you have decided you value sand as food. You could hypnotize yourself into believing sand is food, but you will choke yourself trying to eat it. This is because sand is inherently poor in nutrients like carbohydrates and protein, but high in silica which is rather hard to digest. Philosopher David Kelley has compared this to a collision between two automobiles, a Ford and a Chevy. The collision requires both cars in order to happen. If you take away either car, there is no collision. Both are needed. If there is no conscious being, any object is just inanimate matter, without meaning. But the object itself has to exist, and it actually has to serve the purposes of a conscious being that values it, otherwise this value is just a fantasy or delusion. The Intrinsic, the Subjective, and the Objective (Part 1) ",

            "answer_text": "Instead of a middle ground, let\u2019s take a closer look at the question: what is meant by \u201crelative\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d here? I sit across from you at a table. My fork is to my right; my fork is to your left. Is this some kind of paradox because the fork is in a different direction relative to each of us? No \u2014 we can\u2019t change the position of the fork by changing how we feel about it. The fork is where it is, but relative to each of us, it is in a different direction (left or right). A moral example: I point a gun at the ground, in the middle of the desert, where nobody will be hurt if I pull the trigger. Is it wrong for me to pull the trigger? No. Now I point it at someone innocent, for no reason. Now is it wrong for me to pull the trigger? Yes. Is this some kind of relativistic subjective situational ethics, because whether or not it\u2019s wrong for me to pull the trigger depends on where the gun is pointing? No. The \u201cmiddle ground\u201d you are seeking is out there - the road there begins with the realization that it\u2019s more complicated than \u201cabsolute unbreakable moral law under any circumstance\u201d and \u201cdo whatever you want.\u201d The dichotomy is\u2026 Well, not \u201cfalse,\u201d but very misleading. There are entire treatises on this sort of thing, entire libraries of books. Once you realize that, it gets more interesting. Instead of grasping for the essential nature of right and wrong right off the bat, try thinking about it in more fine terms. Is it okay to punch someone in the face, in a culture where punching people in the face is acceptable under certain circumstances? Perhaps it is - because punching someone in the face is a different act in that context! The context doesn\u2019t just make an act OK or not OK \u2014 there is a sense in which the same physical event can be a different moral act in two different contexts (remember the gun example!). I can\u2019t summarize this entire subject in such a short text. But good luck on your contemplative journey. ",
