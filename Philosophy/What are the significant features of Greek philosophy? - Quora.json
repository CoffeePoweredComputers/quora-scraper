Aristotle was also teacher to Alexander the Great. Four presuppositions constitute the significant features of Greek Philosophy.One:A particular attitude towards reality.Two:The aim is not to change the world but to know reality.Three:The Greeks highly esteemed an inquiring mind.Four:Knowledge is man's reflection of nature and knowledge is an end for its own sake. As seekers and lovers of wisdom Greek philosophers studied and analyzed the world around them using logic and reason.Greek philosophers were also scientists and many studied mathematics and physics as well even though we often think of philosophy as religion or the meaning of life.

            "answer_text": "Although I share the view of one of the prior answers that you shouldn\u2019t be asking us to do your homework, I can\u2019t resist taking the bait. Also, I concur with others that there is a tremendously diverse range of \u201cGreek philosophy\u201d. Nevertheless, what I consider to be significant at its inception, and was carried on thereafter, was the idea of seeking truth and understanding through rational thought and discourse, rather than by inspiration from the gods (or muses). It seems to me there is no general ideas, in their content, that are unique to \u201cGreek philosophy\u201c. What was significantly distinctive was not the content but the methodology - rational dialectic. ",
