            "answer_text": "No. That\u2019s a \u201cpundit\u201d or \u201chobbyist\u201d or \u201cactivist\u201d depending on their level of engagement and media platform. A politician is someone who either seeks elected office or serves at the top level of appointed office. The elected office thing is obvious. For appointed office, the Junior Vice Associate Undersecretary for Corn Subsidies may be technically \u201cappointed\u201d because the 1836 Absurdly Generous Corn Subsidies Act requires it, but they\u2019re probably a career bureaucrat and not a politician in any meaningful sense. This stands in contrast to their boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss, the Secretary of Agriculture, who likely is either (A) a wealthy-but-at-least-tangentially-knowledgeable campaign contributor (this is before the Trump era), (B) a former state-level officeholder who\u2019s won several elections and is looking for an interrim gig until the current Governor\u2019s or Senator\u2019s term is up, or (C) a career bureaucrat who rose so high they finally had to start actually playing politics in order to get any higher. In any case, the Sec-Ag is now a full-on politician, because while they may be appointed and have no formal electoral accountability, their boss the President does, and will happily subject them to all the usual political games and public opinion.

            "answer_text": "Can a person be called a politician for just having strong political opinions and not seeking office? The answer is \u201cno\u201d. One becomes a \u201cpolitician\u201d upon holding, or at least running for, a political office. Even those who work closely with office holders and/or candidates are not themselves \u201cpoliticians\u201d - they are staffers, handlers, etc. I, for one, have held \u201cstrong political opinions\u201d along the way, but \u201cpolitician\u201d is not an adjective that is/was used to describe me. Just like having a strong interest in genetics doesn\u2019t make one a geneticist, having \u201cstrong political opinions\u201d does not make one a politician. A layperson with \u201cstrong political opinions\u201d might qualify to be considered an \u201cactivist\u201d or perhaps a \u201cpartisan\u201d, but not a \u201cpolitician\u201d. ",
