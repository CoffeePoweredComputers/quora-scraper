            "answer_text": "The good are at minimum trustworthy, fair and just. They are trustworthy because they hold principles of restraint and have a sense of proportion as their core or guiding principles. Hence, in theory, they cannot be shafters and backstabbers and murderers and rapists, and liars, cheaters, thiefs and bullies. They are fair and just because they don\u2019t want to create hell wherever they go, because balance in relationships is what they knowingly or unknowingly seek. Furthermore, beyond trustworthiness, fairness and justice, they also try to benefit others. Benefiting others is a key component of being good, but not at the expense of trustworthiness. Get that reversed and you are not good at all. Lastly, the good are sane, they know when to limit things so that it doesn\u2019t get too extreme and produce insanity. This built in sense of proportion is the very core of their sanity, their rationality. Without limits, things get insane and irrational, I see this happening in a lot of people who have no idea how to be good, and arguably never will get an idea. Even trustworthiness and reducing harm needs to be tempered. Letting a wicked man keep bleeding to death by the side of the road is a good thing, saving his life is not. Because once he\u2019s healthy he will go around and harm more new people. Sanity demands that we do not help evil and make it stronger. Bad is the inverse of good. Just invert all that and you get bad. The bad are untrustworthy to a fault. They are unfair and unjust to a fault. This is because they get off on doing harm. So they try to harm people as much as possible, usually secretly and passive aggressively, sometimes actively, no difference. They naturally gravitate to the deeds and professions that harm others because they get off on it. For example, if a wicked person becomes a policewoman, she will try to fine as many people as possible, draw her gun as much as possible, and shoot as many victims as possible. Many policemen/women are sadists. That profession naturally attracts a lot of wicked people. They practice the principle of non-restraint followed by wilful ignorance and blame shifting. Some jobs naturally let its members hide their lack of a sense of proportion, their inbuilt insanity, their inherent irrationality. Some professions contain a concentrated dose of our naturally insane and irrational population. The bad are naturally insane. Their minds are made of lies. They are riddled with perversions. All their intentions are negative. They hide all the time, faking everything. Whenever they meet anyone, their first impulse is to hide, pretend, lie, and fake. This is because they are deformed and ugly inside, and they can sense it, that\u2019s why they hide, to hide their ugly deformed, unloveable insides from everyone they encounter. They naturally function as if consequences do not exist, because consequences inject sanity, justice, rationality, proportion on anything. They pursue absolute, pathological, disordered freedom. Their sense of freedom follows their disordered and perverse impulses. They aren\u2019t interested in sane freedom, they are interested in only the insane kind, the kind where their freedom hurts everyone else\u2019s freedom. They naturally bring along the insanity of hell with them wherever they go. ",

            "answer_text": "You're asking about morality. Morality is subjective. It is what we say it is. It's a human construct: by, for and about humans. As somebody once noted, humans are the only animals that blush . . . or need to. However, we collectively define behavioral and social norms for ourselves. These often vary from culture to culture but there's certain morals that are common (if not absolute) almost everywhere. I don't know of ANY moral that everybody believes in. In the U.S. we're pretty unanimous about pedophilia, rape, theft and murder but very divided about abortion, euthanasia, and stem cell research/technology. Terrorists don't seem to mind about indiscriminate killing. Some Muslim countries allow child brides and/or punish the victims of rape. Abortion is not so controversial in some countries. So when it comes to your question, the operative term is \"really know\". Most of us have our moral convictions and feel certain about what is and isn't acceptable. But the fact is, in actual practice, we condone or even endorse killing (war, capital punishment), theft (colonialism), and lying (politics). And this includes religions (religious wars, doctrines against condom use in AIDS-stricken areas, opulent lifestyles of religious leaders, covering up sexual misconduct and ignoring the victims, etc.).

            "answer_text": "Good and Bad are relative terms. It is indeed different for each individual. Strictly speaking from a philosophical aspect, everyone has a perspective of good or bad applied to their actions (Right or Wrong). This is the conscience. Conscience is an ability or judgement that helps in distinguishing what is right or wrong. In psychological terms, conscience leads to guilt when the moral judgments are failed and integrity when they are adhered to.  Catholic theology sees conscience as the last practical \"judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [a person] to do good and to avoid evil\".Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but \"the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful\". In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. (Source:Wikipedia) All religions manifest the idea of conscience in one way or the other. It is just a matter of difference in presentation. Secular views and research on the idea do exist. Many psychologists regard conscience as an important part of the mind. The development of conscience is considered as one of the stages of normal human personality development. The use of the word normal is to be noted since exceptions do exist. Freud regarded conscience as originating psychologically from the growth of civilizations. He considered that it suppressed the expression of aggression and direct the aggressive energy to better, healthy proper channels. So everybody really does know consciously or sub-consciously what is good or bad, depending on his/her moral principles and the general rules of society.But the actions are driven by the self or \"the ego\", which defines the good and bad for them.  To conclude:\"No man's conscience can tell him the right of another man.\" - Samuel Johnson and\"The moral law within us has true infinity.\"-Immanuel Kant ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Does anyone really know what is Good or Bad? - Objective morality is the idea that at least some moral judgments are not just true according to a person's subjective opinion, but factually true.From https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mo... - -According to Theravada Buddhism, there are good and bad actions. - \u2026. Ten unwholesome courses of action. Taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, lying speech, slander, rude speech, idle chatter, greed, malevolence, wrong view. \u2026\u2026.Ten wholesome courses of action. Avoidance of taking life, avoidance of taking what is not given, avoidance of sexual misconduct, avoidance of lying speech, avoidance of slander, avoidance of rude speech, avoidance of idle chatter, avoidance of greed, avoidance of malevolence, and avoidance of wrong view.From Dasuttara Sutta - \u2026.. The Lord Buddha said: \"There are three ways in which one is made impure by bodily action, four ways in which one is made impure by verbal action, and three ways in which one is made impure by mental action.-Unskillful Bodily Action \"And how is one made impure in three ways by bodily action? There is the case where a certain person takes life, is a hunter, bloody-handed, devoted to killing & slaying, showing no mercy to living beings. He takes what is not given. He takes, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them. He engages in sensual misconduct. He gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned with flowers by another man. This is how one is made impure in three ways by bodily action.-Unskillful Verbal Action \"And how is one made impure in four ways by verbal action? There is the case where a certain person engages in false speech. When he has been called to a town meeting, a group meeting, a gathering of his relatives, his guild, or of the royalty (i.e., a royal court proceeding), if he is asked as a witness, 'Come & tell, good man, what you know': If he doesn't know, he says, 'I know.' If he does know, he says, 'I don't know.' If he hasn't seen, he says, 'I have seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I haven't seen.' Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake, for the sake of another, or for the sake of a certain reward. He engages in divisive speech. What he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart, he loves factionalism, delights in factionalism, enjoys factionalism, speaks things that create factionalism. He engages in abusive speech. He speaks words that are harsh, cutting, bitter to others, abusive of others, provoking anger and destroying concentration/focus. He engages in idle chatter. He speaks out of season, speaks what isn't factual, what isn't in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, & the Vinaya, words that are not worth treasuring. This is how one is made impure in four ways by verbal action.-Unskillful Mental Action \"And how is one made impure in three ways by mental action? There is the case where a certain person is covetous. He covets the belongings of others, thinking, 'O, that what belongs to others would be mine!' He bears ill will, corrupt in the resolves of his heart: 'May these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed, or may they not exist at all!' He has wrong view, is warped in the way he sees things: 'There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no brahmans or contemplatives(ascetics/hermits) who, faring rightly & practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next after having directly known & realized it for themselves.' This is how one is made impure in three ways by mental action.\"These, Cunda, are the ten courses of unskillful action. When a person is endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action, then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth, he is still impure. If he doesn't touch the earth, he is still impure. If he touches wet cow dung, he is still impure. If he doesn't touch wet cow dung, he is still impure. If he touches green grass... If he doesn't touch green grass... If he worships a fire... If he doesn't worship a fire... If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands... If he doesn't pay homage to the sun with clasped hands... If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall... If he doesn't go down into the water three times by nightfall, he is still impure. Why is that? Because these ten courses of unskillful action are impure and cause impurity. Furthermore, as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action, (rebirth in) hell is declared, (rebirth in) an animal womb is declared, (rebirth in) the realm of hungry shades is declared \u2014 that or any other bad destination.\"Now, Cunda, there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action, four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action, and three ways in which one is made pure by mental action.-Skillful Bodily Action \"And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning the taking of life, abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them. Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct. He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned with flowers by another man. This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action.-Skillful Verbal Action \"And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action? There is the case where a certain person, abandoning false speech, abstains from false speech.

If he does know, he says, 'I know.' If he hasn't seen, he says, 'I haven't seen.' If he has seen, he says, 'I have seen.' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake, for the sake of another, or for the sake of any reward. Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world. Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord. Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing & pleasing to people at large. Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, & the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal. This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action.-Skillful Mental Action \"And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action? There is the case where a certain person is not covetous. He does not covet the belongings of others, thinking, 'O, that what belongs to others would be mine!' He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart. (He thinks,) 'May these beings be free from animosity, free from oppression, free from trouble, and may they look after themselves with ease!' He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things: 'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits & results of good & bad actions. There is this world & the next world. There is mother & father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are brahmans & contemplatives(ascetics/hermits) who, faring rightly & practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next after having directly known & realized it for themselves.' This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action.\"These, Cunda, are the ten courses of skillful action.

If he doesn't touch the earth, he is still pure. If he touches wet cow dung, he is still pure. If he doesn't touch wet cow dung, he is still pure. If he touches green grass...

Why is that? Because these ten courses of skillful action are pure and cause purity. Furthermore, as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of skillful action, (rebirth among) the devas(angels) is declared, (rebirth among) human beings is declared \u2014 that or any other good destination.\"From AN 10.176 Cunda kammaraputta Sutta - - -Human beings are not blank slate. -f all human beings are inherently good, there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently good since young. -If all human beings are inherently bad, there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently bad since young. -So some human beings are inherently good and some human beings are inherently bad because people observe as such. -So what's the cause of inherently good or bad? -It is not genetic because if it is genetic, science will have discovered by now. -It is not genetic because one can observe that both inherently good parents can have inherently bad children. Likewise, both inherently bad parents can have inherently good children. -It is not environment because even the extremely poor parents with extremely bad environment can have inherently good children. Likewise, even the extremely rich family with extremely good environment can have inherently bad children. -But during the individual growth process (after birth), inherently good children are easier to become bad if they meet bad environment and bad influence. Inherently bad children are not easy to become good even if they meet good environment and good influence. -It is easier to become bad during the growth of children because it does not need much effort to do bad things and it needs much effort to do good. -It is harder to become good during the growth of children because it needs much effort to restrain from doing bad. -According to this philosophy, more and more bad people should appear in the world. Nature favors to appear the bad behaviors. If inherently good and inherently bad behaviors appear randomly, people would see inherently good and bad children in one to one ratio (half and half in population) in their childhood before the influence of environment. Or one should see more inherently bad children than good children in their childhood because nature appears to favor bad behaviors. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism (If one accepts Buddhism as truth, not as a religion), human life is hard to get. Those with good behaviors in past life can return to human life if they are not released from cycles of life because human life is one of good destination and one can work hard to release from cycle of life in human life. Those with bad behaviors in past life rarely come back to human life because human life is one of good destination. So if one who has previous life with good behaviors and the other who has previous life with bad behaviors competes for one human life, one who has previous life with good behaviors has more chance to come back to human life again. If he comes back to human life again, he will be inherently good because of previous habits. So according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, people will see more inherently good children than inherently bad ones because human life is one of the good destinations. - \u2026\u2026. \"Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering & congregating, would pray, praise, & circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart (saying,) 'Rise up, O boulder!

An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts. A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that Tasmania had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation. - (From Companion to Tasmanian history Between 1803 and 1853 approximately 75,000 convicts served time in Van Diemen's Land. Of these 67,000 were shipped from British and Irish ports and the remainder were either locally convicted, or transported from other British colonies. This represents about 45 percent of all convicts landed in Australia and 15\u201320 percent of all those transported within the British Empire in the period 1615\u20131920.From http://www.utas.edu.au/library/c... ) - (From The story of Australia\u2019s last convicts January 9, 2018The Hougoumont, the last ship to take convicts from the UK to Australia, docked in Fremantle, Western Australia, on January 9, 1868 \u2013 150 years ago. It brought an end to a process which deposited about 168,000 convicted prisoners in Australia after it began in 1788.Convicts had ceased to be sent to New South Wales and Van Diemen\u2019s Land (Tasmania) decades earlier, but Western Australia still wanted convict labour to help with building projects. By the time the Hougoumont landed its shipment of 281 convicts, the Swan River penal colony in Western Australia had been reliant on convict labour for 18 years, and received almost 10,000 male prisoners from Britain.From http://theconversation.com/the-s... ) - (From Stain or badge of honour? Convict heritage inspires mixed feelings June 8, 2015A recent report in Molecular Psychiatry identified a \u201cwarrior gene\u201d connected to criminal behaviour. This inspired renewed speculation that a convict ancestry might make Australians more predisposed to violent crime.This fear of genetic contamination from convict ancestors has existed in Australia since early settlement. Between 1788 and the end of transportation in 1868, around 162,000 convicts were sent to the colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen\u2019s Land and Western Australia.An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts.In 1856, Van Diemen\u2019s Land was renamed Tasmania in an attempt to purge its convict past.And the fear that we might be cursed with a genetic predisposition towards criminal behaviour? A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that, adjusted for population, Tasmania \u2013 with the highest proportion of convict descendants \u2013 had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation.From https://theconversation.com/stai... ) - - Reference from Theravada Buddhism The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta too taking a low seat sat on a side, and said to the Blessed One.\u2018Venerable sir, I have heard this said: The recluse Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges remainderless knowledge and vision in this manner, \u2018while walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and continually knowledge and vision is established, to me\u2019.Venerable sir, those who say, these words, \u2018The recluse Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges remainderless knowledge and vision:while walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and continually.\u2019 Are they saying the words of good Gotama and are they not blaming the Blessed One falsely?Vaccha, those who say, the recluse Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges remainderless knowledge and vision, while walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and continually. They, do not say my words, they blame me falsely.Venerable sir, saying how would it be said, correctly not blaming the Blessed One falsely?\u2018The recluse Gotama knows the three knowledges. Saying it thus they would be saying the right thing, and not blaming me falsely. Vaccha, whenever I desire, I recollect the manifold previous births, such as one birth, two births, with all modes and all details, thus I recall the manifold previous births. Vaccha, when I desire, with the purified heavenly eye beyond human, see beings disappearing and appearing, in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly, in good and bad states,-- I see beings, according their actions. Vaccha, destroying desires, my mind released and released through wisdom, here and now by myself realising I abide.

If a thief steals money, we may perceive him to be bad. But in his head, he has justified himself in some way or the other. Even a murderer will justify why he killed his victim, because in his mind, he has convinced himself that it was the right thing to do at that particular moment. He may regret it later on, but in the moment, he was right (in his mind). Nobody wakes up one fine day and decides to do things considered immoral. So, to answer your question, I would say no. It's all based on an individual's perception, which he develops due to his upbringing, culture, and his exposure to the world.

            "answer_text": "Personally, I think when people say what is good and what is bad, there are always three perspectives, law perspective, religius perspective and the human nature perspective. Say for example, Oskar Schindler bribed many Nazi soldiers to protect the 1200 Jews, do people think it is right? From the law perspective, bribery is not right, asit is illegal, but from the religious and human nature perspective, it is right, as it saved 1200 lives. Is Euthaneasia correct, legally and religiously it is not correct, as it would technically be murder and suicide, but from the human nature perspective it can be right since it is allowing the patient to be released from pain. I hope this answer can answer your question. ",

When we were microorganisms we would move toward the areas with the right temperature or pH. \"It's too cold here, bad!\" or \"It's warm and cozy here, good!\". But to a different microbe the pH is too caustic or acidic. We seek the good and avoid the bad in our environment or situation. Avoiding the bad can help us stay alive to reproduce so our descendants can adapt and evolve. ",
