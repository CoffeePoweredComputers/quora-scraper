            "answer_text": "This question comes up time & again:If there\u2019s only One Thing (non-duality) how do you explain all the apparent \u2018many things\u2019 we see manifested? Our bodies? The hard solid ground? The water we can see, feel and drink? The atoms, quarks and other particles of apparently \u2018real\u2019 matter that make up water, earth and bodies? (Apparently, indeed. Science has already confirmed all atoms are 99% space, less than 1% \u201cmatter.\u201d) Unfortunately, the questioner is asking for a mind-based, mind-understandable answer, and insisting ([\u201cnon-objective] answers won\u2019t help\u201d) on limiting the answer to something the dual, subject/object-based mind can comprehend. \u201cIf there\u2019s only One Thing, which means all body-minds are illusions or projections, could you pease explain what that illusory body-mind is\u2026to my illusory body mind:-) See the problem? It\u2019s like a person\u2019s shadow. Can a shadow explain what\u2019s casting it, or jump up and become the person casting it? Your right eye is a non-duality. You only have one right eye. It cannot see itself as a non-duality. That would take a second eye sitting outside the first eye, looking back at it\u2026and then you\u2019d be back to duality. Within your nighttime dream, you always think you are your body and your body is real. When a dream car swerves towards you, your dream body jumps out of the way to avoid getting hurt. Your dream is created by just One Thing, your mind. No one else\u2019s. So it\u2019s just One Thing, creating all these many things. Real things, or at least, you\u2019re quite certain their real\u201d while you\u2019re dreaming. But then you wake up, and you see they were just projections from your One Thing. Your waking dream is no different. \u201cIt just seems to be more continuous and last longer,\u201d as Ramana Maharshi said, \u201cbut a dream projection, nonetheless.\u201d At the Absolute level, it\u2019s obvious there is only One Thing, or more accurately, NoThing. The Unmanifest. The Void. In enlightenment, or what you call \u2018transcendence,\u2019 we can get a fragrance of that. But we can never be The Absolute, because The Absolute can not know Itself. That would take two, right - The Absolute and a separate \u201cknower.\u201d Then it wouldn\u2019t be The Absolute anymore, it would be a duality. So what can we do? We can know that the One Non-Dual Thing is \u2018in the background\u2019 behind all duality, projecting itself through The Everything, including our bodies. We can then enjoy our bodies and our One Life, avoid trying to figure out anything with our mind, or \u2018attain\u2019 anything, and know that, when we\u2019re finished enjoying this projection for the OneThing\u2019s delight & \u2018purpose,\u2019 we\u2019ll dissolve back into that. BTW. Edg Duveyoung has some real mastery in the area of Advaita (Non-Dulaity.) I\u2019d suggest browsing through his past answers on this very subject, in his profile, and if you still don\u2019t see the answer you\u2019re looking for, send him a direct \u2018answer request\u2019 for this question ",
