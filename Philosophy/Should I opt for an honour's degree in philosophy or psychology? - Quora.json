            "answer_text": "Hi, if you study both, both are somewhat related to Spirituality , so rest assured in that way. I can suggest you the major difference, after that you can decide yourself Philosophy is the study of existence and Psychology is the study of Human Behavior so in Philosophy you will come across many points that are not tested on lab or not proven but in Psychology as its a science , you will get the tested answers. As per me both are interested subjects rest depends on the choice of learner Career wise Psychology has more scope All d best:) ",
