            "answer_text": "I dont know why people link between the concept of god and a scientific entity. If you ask me to prove mathematically, i can\u2019t because we doesnt know the equation which leads to god, nor we will be able to know. There is no experiment to track god nor we have any theory to track. I am speaking in a literal sense. Yes if you ask me will you able to find him? I dont know. Whether he exists? I don\u2019t know. But as of now i can say that its hard to say god exists based on scientific grounds. What ever physics has achieved till now there is a clear theory behind it to explain the observed events. So then i believe in mathematics. If we can prove how big bang theory happened then i bet everyone will then know that it happened for some physical real backed by theory. People say that god created universe or big bang, it works the way it should be according to laws of physics. Atleast this should tell that theres no god. When it comes to me, i definitely with 200% clarity i would say there\u2019s no god. I dont need science to argue this. However, what we should rather see is that god is a philosophical construction of human brain for better society and to creste oneness during those times. Existence of parallel universes has nothing to do with the concept of god. As of now it\u2019s a claim that space could be multiuniversal or multiversal. It says that how our universe was formed and how it was before and how it is going to be in future. We always deal with things about understanding the nature. Things that we observe are put into theory. Science works with facts or truth based on observation backed by theory. It doesnt care whether there could be god or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Hare Krishna! The multiverse concept is borrowed from Vedic texts like Srimad Bhagwatam wherein it is stated that from one breath of Maha Vishnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead multiple universes come into being and disappear. Yes our whole universal time is just one breath for God. The multiverse is nothing new - It has always been part of Vedic theology.  After separating the different universes, the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u], which came out of the Causal Ocean, the place of appearance for the first puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ra, entered into each of the separate universes, desiring to lie on the created transcendental water [Garbhodaka]. SB 2.10.10[1] Every universe is covered by seven layers \u2014 earth, water, fire, air, sky, the total energy and false ego \u2014 each ten times greater than the previous one. There are innumerable universes besides this one, and although they are unlimitedly large, they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited [ananta].

            "answer_text": "No. Proof of the existence of a multiverse expands the size of the physical space but doesn\u2019t add to our understanding of how our physical space was created. To disprove God as we use that concept we would have to be able to find ways to create spacetime where none had previously existed. Even this may not be enough to kill God. The current attempt at disproving God involves creating mathematical structures that point to natural causes for everything but none of these structures can be disproved experimentally. We are at the dawn of a new golden age of science fiction but not at the sunset of belief in divinity. ",

            "answer_text": "Multiverse theory tells that, Even if there is a god, he has a competition to conquer. Because Multiverse is not the other part of this universe, it is completely another universe and that is why your god might have to face the competition. Hugh Everett\u2019s Many world interpretation concluded that, There is an interpretation in between two universes. So, if your god is almighty, then he must have to prove his almighty conquest in Multiverse. Because of Multiverse theory you can say that, Your god is almighty for this universe and not for the other\u2026 And certainly this mean that the God is finite\u2026 ",
