            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t quite say that. Rather, it says that for any effective set of axioms for your numbers, there will be a statement true for your numbers that can\u2019t be proved from those axioms. But there will be a larger set of axioms which can prove your true statement. In that larger set, there will be some other true statement that can\u2019t be proved, but, again, there\u2019s a still larger set of axioms in which it can be proved. So long as the axioms are effective, that is, they are recursively enumerable, there will be some statement that can\u2019t be proved. Recursively enumerable is a pretty weak requirement. It only requires that there is an algorithm to list all the axioms. There can even be infinitely many axioms. (For first-order number theory, you expect infinitely many axioms since the axiom of induction is actually an axiom schema. For each predicate, and there are infinitely many predicates, there is an axiom of induction.) Every true statement in number theory can be proved given the right set of axioms. ",

            "answer_text": "Does G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem mean that there are true statements that will never be proved? No, it doesn\u2019t. Although it is true that some, i.e. almost all, true arithmetic statements can never be proven by any axiomatic system. This is because axiomatic systems are very inefficient at capturing mathematical (arithmetical) truths. Thus once an axiomatic system is given, its demonstrative power is fixed once and for all. It can only prove statements of a given (Kolmogorov) complexity (length) that is characteristic of the system. From a probabilistic point of view, when the length of a statement tends towards infinity, the probability that the statement is independent tends towards 1. Adding recursively axioms that affirm the consistency of the chosen axiomatic system(s) will not change this. From a topological point of view, the set of arithmetical provable statements is just a big hole! Hence, I have to disagree with my distinguish colleague\u2019s (Dr. David Joyce) statement that: \"Every true statement in number theory can be proved given the right set of axioms.\" Because there is no such thing as the right set of axioms, if by right we mean a set of axioms that makes an axiomatic system complete for arithmetic. Addendum To put it in layman's terms, not only there are true statements that will never be proved, but since almost all statements in an axiomatic system that is rich enough to express elementary arithmetic (PA, ZFC, etc.) are independent statements, there are infinitely many true statements that will never be proved. If by \u201cnever\u201d we mean \u201ccannot\u201d. An by \u201ccannot\u201d we mean that there is no (known or conceivable) effective procedure to prove them. As previously mentioned, C. Calude has shown that there are infinitely many more independent statements than provable ones. Now, as L. Levin points out, in the abstract, if we consider all possible ways of adding axioms - in finite or infinite quantity - there are indeed some that give non-contradictory and complete \u201csystems\u201d. Thus, for any formula L of such systems, L can be either proved, or disproved, with these added axioms. The word \u201csystems\u201d in the previous sentence is enclosed in quotation marks because these complete axiom systems are not actual formal systems: it is certainly possible to add axioms in the abstract to the point of cramming the system with them so that we don't get any independent statements, but in this case the (effective or mechanical) verifiability of proofs of the resulting system is lost. If this was not the case, we'd have a system which would contradict G\u00f6del's theorem. Sources C. S. Calude et H.

What people have to agree on is that for any given formal system of Number Theory, there will be some propositions that can be neither proved nor disproved. However, through Godel numbering, such a proposition can be seen to have a logical equivalence to a proposition that says \u201cI am not provable.\u201d Now, here\u2019s the tricky part: the proposition doesn\u2019t *literally* say that; but Godel Numbering sets up a relationship such that proposition G is true if and only if it is not provable. Because it isn\u2019t provable, simple logic would suggest it is true. (The one additional assumption, by the way, is that the whole system is self-consistent.) That being the case, I personally do tend to accept Godel\u2019s own interpretation of his theorems. So, there is a proposition (an infinite number of them, actually) that are true but not provable.
