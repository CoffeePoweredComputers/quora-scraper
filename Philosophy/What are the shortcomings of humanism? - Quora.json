            "answer_text": "There are 2 things about the philosophy people have difficulty with. And these are things most Humanists consider essential. The first is that it is a secular philosophy. The second is that ours is a situational ethic. Lots of people believe in supernatural things. Humanists, reject supernaturalism as an ineffective unproven field of inquiry. If something happens, you can prove it happens. There is no need to appeal to supernaturalism. People who like thinking in supernatural terms, don\u2019t like this aspect of the philosophy. But for Humanists, the rejection of supernaturalism and our focus on all things secular, is critical to the practice of our philosophy. We are mostly concerned with solving our real problems here and now. Appeals to supernaturalism don\u2019t help us with that. In fact, in many cases, they make solving the problem impossible. Our focus on secular matters and rejection of supernatural - is pragmatic. The other area people have problems with is that we approach ethics situational-ly. Our value system is based on compassion. Our goal is to do the most good and the least harm - in any given situation. There are no hard and fast rules. Our ethics requires active thinking, critical thinking and a willingness to make difficult decisions. There are many people who prefer absolute ethics - where you have a rule that is always applied, but we humanists view that as an unrealistic ideal. In the real world, our values compete with each other. For instance, it\u2019s not ok to kill someone. But what if killing that person would save thousands of lives? There is a great quote in the Hindi movie Faana. I\u2019m going to paraphrase. Morality isn\u2019t about choosing between good or evil. It\u2019s about choosing between the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils. Every situation is different and we are called on to make difficult decisions where the \u201cright\u201d solution that will do the most good and least harm - isn\u2019t clear. Humanists view situation ethics as essential precisely because we understand we live in the real world - where what is \u201cgood\u201d isn\u2019t always clear and because - we are willing to do the hard work of thinking through those problems to come to a \u201cgood\u201d solution and because we accept the responsibility to do this - is ours.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure the of sense in which you mean \u201chumanism.\u201d If you mean the secular humanist philosophy, then the shortcomings are pretty much the same as for any other ethics philosophy. That is, it depends on the sincerity of human beings. Just as there are good, mediocre and bad religious people who follow their ethics well, poorly, or not at all, there are good, mediocre, and bad secular humanists. If you mean the secular humanist movement, a more strict definition of humanism, then the shortcomings depend on the society in which the movement is active. In Canada, where people tend to live and let live, the humanist movement is pretty soft even though there is serious discrimination against atheists in Canadian law. The shortcoming in this case is that the humanist movement depends on enough people being offended at the same time to take some action. ",
