            "answer_text": "Being a realist or being realistic is not easy. Neither can everyone cope with your amount of realism or the fact that you are a realist. The media and movies and stories all are based on fairy tales. On assumptions about how a situation should be rather than how a situation really is. A realist is one of the most misunderstood and maligned person that I have come across. I am speaking from experience. Living in the real world versus living in a fairy tale created by some writer or in some movie are two entirely different things. For example, romance is always stressed upon but no one ever realizes that the daily stress of making a living is enough to drive any normal person insane. To be forced to be romantic or to be held up against some assumed quality or lack thereof is very disheartening and discouraging. Being a realist I am rarely if ever romantic. This does not mean that I will not give my wife flowers or gifts. It means that I have little or no know-how about how to say those so-called romantic words which are shown in movies or written about in love stories. I love my wife and tell her often, but don\u2019t expect me to go out wanting to sit and stare at the full moon. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course there is and many people have had this problem. The Wright Brothers had it. Steve Jobs had it. Elon Musk had it. And yet, they all lived their truth anyways through cheer tenacity and hard work against all odds, bringing us Airplanes, Apple Computer, and Tesla electric cars. The real question is will you help these people by accepting their truth or will you just stand by the sidelines and live your lie? It\u2019s your choice. May God bless you. ",
