            "answer_text": "I added the first item in my list in a comment above, but I will put it here as well, and add some other things.  Buy well-made items the first time around (and do your homework to find the right thing the first time). This goes for appliances, clothing, electronics, etc. These things will cost you more at the outset, but will end up costing you less in the long run, both in terms of money and time. They will also contribute less to the overwhelming amount of stuff in landfills (which are especially clogged these days from castoffs of \"fast fashion\" clothing).  Decide what you really do need to buy. Try not to buy, for example, kitchen appliances and gear that only do one thing, and decide if you really do need yet another thing that plugs in. Heat up leftovers on the stove instead of buying and using a microwave. Chop things by hand instead of buying and using a food processor. Buy clothes that truly fit well, and that are in a classic style (i.e. not things that will look dated in a season). Buy only what you really need for all the occasions for which you need to dress, and only what you need to have in between washing cycles.  Get rid of physical media. Keep some of your favorite books (especially ones that really need to be touched and paged through, like art books and children's picture books), but get rid of most of them. Use the library and use ebooks. Get rid of CDs. With all the streaming music sources out there, you can even get rid of your mp3 collection and just stream anything you want to hear. Don't have a TV or a cable box. You don't have to live like a luddite, though, to live simply - have a nice, large monitor and a decent computer with a good, fast internet connection. Stream TV shows and movies you want to watch.  If you must own a car, own one used one. Keep it in good running shape. Take care of it physically. But if you have an older \"cockroach\" car (e.g. most Toyotas and Hondas), you can keep that sucker running forever without thinking about it much and without worrying about every scratch and ding. If you can get away without a car, do so. Get yourself a nice commuter bike that fits you well (by \"nice\" I mean one that is built well with decent parts so it works well and you enjoy using it, without having to worry about it getting banged up or stolen).  Rent an apartment, don't buy a house. Don't have a yard or building maintenance to deal with. Plumbing issue? It's not your problem to solve. The building needs painting? Who cares? Lawn needs mowing? Not by you. Your neighbors get too annoying or your neighborhood starts to go downhill? Move when your lease is up.  Purge, relentlessly purge things you just don't need and aren't sure you want anymore. An easy way to do this is to have a \"holding area\" for things you think you might want to get rid of but aren't sure you can commit to chucking. The holding area can be part of a closet, an unused stairway landing, etc. Make sure it's neat and self-contained. Put things there that you think you probably don't want anymore. If you're fine with them out of your life after a week or so, donate them.  Have fewer things sitting out on surfaces in your place of dwelling. And pick up after yourself and put things away when you're done with them. Reducing clutter really helps one feel calmer. And it's a great incentive to get rid of things you're just tired of cleaning or putting away all the time (especially if they just don't give you enough pleasure for the annoyance they cause).  Have one credit card. Let's be honest - in this day and age, you do need a credit card. But you don't need five. Pay off and close out the others as soon as possible. This will really help you know exactly what you've spent on what, and where your debt lies. Make sure that you have that one credit card set up with electronic statements only (and have email reminders sent if you need them). That reduces random crap that comes in the mail, and also helps you really to figure out the status of your spending (I find that paper statements are oftentimes difficult to read, and you can't just click around on them to get more information). The same goes for bank accounts and debit cards. Have a savings and a checking/debit account at one bank. Keep track of these accounts electronically. Collect all your mail, put it in a bin, and sort it once a week. There's no need to go through snail mail every day (if something is urgent, it's not going to be sent by snail mail). For a long-term project, go through your junk mail and call/email each place to unsubscribe from their mailing lists so you eventually have to deal with less paper crap in your life.  Keep your email inbox empty. Answer emails immediately, if possible. When that's not possible, immediately \"quarantine\" these emails into an \"action\" folder to be dealt with later. Label and archive everything else that you want to be able to find later. Make filters so certain \"bacon\" items (i.e. spam that you've signed up for, like mailing lists - things that you might want to look at, but are not top priority) go straight to folders to be gone through once or twice a week. Obviously, use gmail.  Don't get stuck staring at a screen more than you have to (she says, while typing up a long answer on Quora). Use social media if it makes you happy. But don't become a slave to it. No electronics after 10PM.  **Edit for a couple more things I thought of: One electronic thing that I've found that IS worth owning is a small document scanner. The Fujitsu ScanSnap is amazing. It's tiny and it works fantastically well. We use it to scan all the files that one needs to keep track of and that would otherwise have to exist in paper form in a filing cabinet. The first time around, scanning everything took a long time; then again, we DID get rid of an entire large filing cabinet's worth of papers and stuff (as well as the filing cabinet itself). And now we put important papers and such in a folder to be scanned about once every month or two, and we keep this digital filing cabinet in the cloud (Dropbox works well). Not only does that help you get rid of a lot of papers, but you can also find things so much more easily when you need to (e.g. for insurance purposes, taxes, etc). I've also used this to scan written mementos (e.g. holiday cards, postcards that I want to see again, written notes) that I don't want to get rid of completely, but that I also don't want to have in a big bin in my house. We have one small container (one of those 6-8\" deep file bin things) for papers one HAS to keep (e.g. car titles, birth certificates), and a couple of small shoeboxes of physical mementos. And that's it.  Get rid of as many annoying errands as you can. If you have a bit of room, stock up on annoying cleaning supplies and paper goods at Costco or the like. Order other annoying household type things from Amazon (yes, I know, there's a trade-off here in that local businesses don't get the revenue from things you've ordered from Amazon. At the same time, spending an hour to get to and from a store to get dish soap can really suck the life out of you). Rather spend that errand time enjoying shopping for good food, patronizing local businesses for high-quality items (e.g. things that are NOT, say, dish soap), spending time doing things you actually WANT to do.  Consider observing the sabbath, or a sabbath-like day to some extent. This doesn't have to involve religion. But enforcing some strict rules on yourself regarding what you are and are not allowed to do for 24 hours can really get you out of the constant complexities of modern life. A sabbath-like day should be a day of rest, a day devoid of work of all kinds. Obviously, you can choose to follow the judaic tradition or you can make up some rules yourself. But the general idea that you're not to use electronic devices, that you're not to do any work, that you're not to finish anything, that you're not to write anything, that you're not to clean or scrub anything completely changes the way you travel through your day.  All this being said, enjoy yourself. Live simply to allow yourself more time and energy to actually go out and do things, to read things, to learn things, to make things, to spend time with people, to exercise, to travel. I think too many people equate \"living simply\" with being a complete ascetic. I think that my family and I live quite simply (though we're always trying to get a bit better at it), yet we are not monks. We love having nice clothing that makes us feel spiffy (some of it used/vintage, some of it new), we love eating excellent food, we enjoy having certain electronics that work really well and that add to our lives, we love watching good TV and movies and listening to a variety of music, we love biking most places but taking the car when we have to (and we actually also love our 1988 Toyota Land Cruiser with more than 350000 miles on it), we really enjoy having nice, well-made athletic equipment that makes our athletic endeavors more enjoyable. Could we get on without much of that? Sure. But we are also not in a race to live in a yurt in the middle of nowhere (which is a completely lovely option for those who wish to do just that). ",

            "answer_text": " Here are 10 things I have done, either at work or at home to simplify my life: One car - My wife an I have consolidated to one car, and I started riding my bike to work.No TV - It\u2019s amazing how little TV we watch (including my 5 year old son). In fact, I think its been at least two weeks since the damn thing has been turned on.Simplified wardrobe - Our master closet is at 20% of total capacity, and we keep it that way. (my wife has 17 items on hangers - I just went upstairs to count).The purge - Every two months my wife and I go through the house and purge any items laying around that we no longer use (either on eBay or as donations).No phone on weekends - On the weekends I turn my cell phone off, and leave it at home, as in, I don\u2019t take it with me when we go places. When I want to take pictures, I bring my camera.No work apps on my cell phone - I have deleted work email and work chat from my cell phone. when I leave the office at the end of the day, I LEAVE THE DAMN OFFICE.Avoid committing to shit I don\u2019t want to do - Do you ever get sucked into doing crap you don\u2019t want to do, like helping someone move (with the little free time you have)? If I get asked to do something like this, I kindly decline.Sunday\u2019s prioritization ritual - Every Sunday I create a list of 5 tasks that I want to focus on for Monday in priority order. Additionally, I ensure my laptop is tidied up by closing any windows that were open from the previous week, (browsers, files, whatever). This way on Monday, I can ensure I get right to the most important work.Deep work calendar blocks \u2013 If you don\u2019t take charge of your calendar other people will. I block segments of my day to perform specific tasks, and will only check my work email during times that I have allocated within my day.Eliminate co-worker distractions \u2013 We all know that saying \u2013 \u201chey you got a second?\u201d This can get ugly in open work environments. If this is something that frequently happens to you, then it\u2019s worth setting boundaries. I like to wear headphones during times I need to be left alone. If that doesn\u2019t work, setup office hours each day. If neither of these things work, and people still tap you on the shoulder, help them, but kindly re-train them into coming to your daily office hours.",
