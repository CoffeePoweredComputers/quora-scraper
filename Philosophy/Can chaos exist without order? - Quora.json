            "answer_text": "Right! We are told that the chaos addressed in chaos theory is not really THAT meaning of chaos. Yet it does seem to relate to *chaos*, chaos at least at times. It\u2019s also not the same thing as disorder, yet chaos and disorder cross paths. One may wonder if order and disorder actually exist in an empirical sense, or are they merely a matter of perspective? One nifty concept in chaos theory is nonlinear order. There is a mountain range that lines the edge of my city. I look at each peak of the mountains and realize that they are recognizably similar yet obviously not identical. And that is an example of nonlinear order. You can compare blades of grass, clouds, people, fingerprints, and snow flakes. Same effect. Interestingly, \u201cidentical\u201d coffee cups or brand new cars are each unique if very similar. In the cars think serial numbers, keys, locks and ignitions. They cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Think, too, of the molecular structure of each. Wear and tear will make each vehicle more distinct and recognizable for a coffee stain on the interior, windshield crack, or crumpled fender. Disorder creeps in and enhances their individuality, maybe? And that disorder is not necessarily about entropy in any direct sense although there is not much that does not include processes of entropy. Smash the windshield, which demonstrates the arrow of time and entropy, and that clearly seems like disorder. The arrow of time being a directional arrow for the one-way street of time. The smashed windshield will not spontaneously reform, which it might if time ran in reverse. If you grind wheat, that, too, demonstrates time\u2019s arrow. Is THAT disorder? Or flour? It\u2019s not about grinding the wheat deliberately to give the act purpose. The windshield can be smashed deliberately as well, (perhaps to save someone trapped inside.) and someone could accidentally throw a switch for the wheat grinder. As far as I grasp it the disorder in entropy is about energy dispersal, dissipation, and heat loss. Sometimes the heat loss is on a molecular level and not perceivable. Or it can be something like the explosion of a star, a necessary step in the formation of earth and life. While pondering all this at one point I wondered if an out of order bathroom is actually in a state of nonlinear order. Sorry I do not have a definitive answer. ",

            "answer_text": "The universe is light. Light is the substance of all matter. The simplest being is light or what we call the photon. The universe is an intelligently designed system of uncountable Trillions of galaxies that formed from light coagulating into lenticular shapes that in turned formed their own unique physics and star systems. The Milky Way galaxy is our home. We use the same physics and there is some we do not know about mainly because of our stage of consciousness and our bellicose nature where we want to weaponize all new technologies and kill or eat anything that moves. Chaos is defined as :\u201dthe property of a complex system whose behaviour is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions\u201d. Chaos manifest as fear darkens the mind force. Mind is a luminous, reflective, all pervasive force that develops as light becomes denser. The primordial darkness of light in outer space is chaotic motion until the intensity of a galaxy begins to form patterns and Infinite Intelligence guides the patterns with the power of love. Chaos exists without order and is very vulnerable to either the darkness of fear or the light of intelligent love. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends upon what you mean by \u201cchaos\u201d. If you mean \u201cmore entropy\u201d, that is, more disorder, then no, more chaos comes from less chaos, and if you track it all the way back to BB, then the universe began in the highest state of order (the lowest entropic state) that it would ever be in, and the history of the universe is going from order to disorder, or to more chaos. If you mean \u201cChaos Theory\u201d, then that\u2019s a different question. Chaos is when tiny events have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of a series of events. That can result in a big mess (little c-chaos) or a higher form of order (Fractals, Complexity Theory). ",

            "answer_text": "In my mind, this is much the same question about darkness and light. I believe that darkness is the absence of light. However, I think that everything in the Universe has an elegant logic and order to it. Chaos is a kind of order we just don\u2019t quite understand or comprehend without a certain effort of study and consideration. Perhaps relative to the way we express dim-light, or light radiating within a spectrum we don\u2019t see. Perhaps my answer to this question is: In our Universe, there is no chaos, only varying types and levels of order. ",

A single planet orbit around a sun is not chaotic because small perturbations don\u2019t grow, it is stable, but three bodies orbiting each other *is* chaotic because small changes grow and change the shape of the orbit.

Prior to reorganizing nature on a massive level like we do in modern day, I'd imagine the chaos of the world before modern man was just right. No one knew any different to comment otherwise. Nature has its own natural order and patterns. We live to alter those patterns. ",
