            "answer_text": "He is described as a Moor, originally a term for a Muslim from what is now roughly Morocco, Spain, Sicily or Malta. By Shakespeare\u2019s time it was a term applied to all Arabs and even European Muslims. The descriptions of him in Shakespeare\u2019s text, such as they are, would lead one to conclude that he was certainly not a \u2018white\u2019 Caucasian man. It can make for some uncomfortable viewing. Olivier, blacked up like a minstrel playing the part, looks, to be polite, dated. ",

He didn\u2019t; the Moors were the North African invaders of Spain, Berber and Arab. Swarthiness yes; as with the population of London our \u201cblack\u201d people could exist amongst the Moors but the Moors were North Africa Muslim. If you think all non-Europeans are \u201cblack\u201d then Othello was \u201cblack\u201d; otherwise they were dark compared to the average Brit but not West Africans. ",
