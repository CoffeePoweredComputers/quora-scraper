            "answer_text": " That depends. For you, excellence can mean creating a product that is aesthetically beautiful, unparalleled, unique. An object that others admire and want to own. A work of art that\u2019s so well-crafted that you\u2019re willing to pay top dollar to obtain it. For me, excellence can mean working on a skill in small increments every single day. Repeating an action over and over until it becomes automatic. Practicing a foreign language until the sentences start flowing naturally and people start assuming I grew up speaking it. And for someone else, excellence can mean something different. Getting straight A\u2019s in school. Being the top athlete on the football team. Baking the perfect baguette that looks like it was made in a bakery in Paris. Is it important? It is if that\u2019s a personal or professional goal of yours \u2014 to achieve excellence. But it needs to be something close and personal to you, not to other people. Because if you\u2019re on the path to achieve it, you\u2019ll have to make sure you\u2019re not following someone else\u2019s path \u2014 your parents, your close friends, even your partner\u2019s path. It needs to be YOURS. And if that\u2019s what is important to you, then you\u2019ll need to think about the following. #1. You will need a specific goal. Going through life just day by day, without knowing where you\u2019re actually going, isn\u2019t the most constructive way to live. But when you have a goal you\u2019re working towards, you push yourself on the path towards achieving excellence. Any shortcuts to do this? Make your goal specific. For example, don\u2019t just say that you want to get a job, win a marathon, become rich. Instead, say you want to get a job offer for a specific job title that pays a certain annual salary so that you can develop specific skills, both current and future ones.Stay focused on your goal. Increase your focus by starting each day with the question: What is the ONE THING I am committed to completing today? It forces you to prioritize, helps your brain focus better, and streamlines the work you need to do on that particular day, so you don't feel overwhelmed with making too many choices.#2. You\u2019ll need to create a strategy. Goals are important, but developing your strategy is equally important. Having a strategy means having \u201cthe big picture\u201d in mind: not just focusing on what you want to do right now, but also keeping your eye on at least two steps ahead. Any shortcuts to do this? Think outside the box. Consider different approaches to get you closer to your goal. That means be flexible and don\u2019t always stick to the tried and true way of approaching a problem.Don\u2019t focus only on short-term success. Being strategic isn\u2019t only what you\u2019re doing right right this very moment; it\u2019s also about feeling the benefits of your present actions in the future.Think about your future self. For example, think of who you want to be in 10 years. By being strategic you will empower yourself to achieve long-term results that your future self can benefit from.#3. You\u2019ll need to develop certain skills. It\u2019s impossible to achieve excellence in any field without a required skill set that will set you apart from others doing the same thing. What are some examples of skills? Leadership. Decision-making. Communication. Strength training. Problem-solving. Mastering pivot tables in Excel. Any shortcuts to do this? Identify skills necessary to succeed in doing your job. List them. Hard skills, soft skills, creative skills. If you\u2019re not sure what are necessary skills, find people who are already successful in that area and identify the skills they possess.Work on developing the core skills. Create a plan to devote a certain amount of time each day to do this, even if you only set aside 15 minutes in the beginning.Practice each skill consistently. This is about persistence and creating time in your schedule to do \u201cdeep work\u201d: focusing without interruptions on a complex cognitive task such as problem-solving.#4. You\u2019ll focus on implementing those skills. What\u2019s the point of having a skill if you\u2019re not going to apply it? If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re isolating yourself from the world around you. It\u2019s a better idea to find out how to use the skills you\u2019ve acquired to solve a problem that you are facing or that others find challenging. Any shortcuts to do this? Identify one area where you can apply the skills you learned. Perhaps you\u2019re switching jobs and looking for a role where that particular skill is desirable to have. Go on LinkedIn and search for roles that have that skill listed as a keyword in the job title or description.Show and tell. You\u2019ll need to prove that you\u2019re good at the skills you practiced and promoted as your key strengths. If you\u2019re preparing for a job interview, write down several situations where you needed to apply a core skill to resolve a problem in a previous job.Emphasize the benefits. To convince others that you\u2019re great at what you do, explain how they will benefit. Tell them how your skill will help them solve a business problem, save them time and resources, or improve communication and collaboration between teams.#5. Last but not least, you\u2019ll need to stay in continuous improvement mode. Achieving excellence is not \u2014 and should never be \u2014 about achieving glory in one moment in time. Excellence is a work in progress. It\u2019s about what you do today to make something better. It\u2019s about repeating and practicing and doing it over and over again. Most of all, it\u2019s about staying on track so the goal you set for yourself is always in the back of your mind. Any shortcuts to do this? Keep your ego in check. If you\u2019ve done exceptionally well on a recent job or exam, don\u2019t get complacent or lazy. Don\u2019t let an excellent grade in a college course go to your head so you forget to study for the next course. Keep your eyes straight ahead to reach bigger goals.Maintain a regular schedule to practice your skills. Don\u2019t forget about your achievements just because you\u2019re done with a project or you\u2019re going on vacation in a few weeks. Create a plan to practice skills regularly so it\u2019s easier to maintain them over an extended period of time.Practice a growth mindset way of thinking. If you want to be excellent at what you do \u2014 and stay excellent at it \u2014 it pays off to apply critical-thinking skills by asking yourself questions on a regular basis. Which problem have I solved? Where can I improve some more? What\u2019s the next level I need to reach to excel at what I\u2019m doing?",
