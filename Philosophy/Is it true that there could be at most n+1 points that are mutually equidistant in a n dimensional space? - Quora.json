            "answer_text": "It is true, for geometries that are isotropic, but some modular geometries have more points. You place a sphere at a point, and the second sphere must touch it somewhere.  The third sphere has its centre on the plane tangential to, and separating, these two spheres.   Every new sphere added must reduce by one, the dimension that the new centre can occupy, eventually leaving just one of two points, which makes the last sphere of n+1 (counting from n to zero). And the equidistant points lie therefore in the centre of the sphere. For example, there is a modular two-dimensional space that admits seven equidistant points, but for ordinary geometry (including spherical and hyperbolic geometries, only N+1 work. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is true that there are at most [math]n+1[/math] mutually equidistant points in an [math]n[/math]-dimensional Euclidean space. It is trivially true for [math]n=1[/math]: two points on a line. And these two points define a one-dimensional \"plane\".  Suppose it is true for [math]n-1[/math] then the [math]n[/math] points define an [math]n-1[/math] dimensional hyper-plane and the [math]n+1\\text{st}[/math] point must lie on a perpendicular \"bisector\" to this plane. There are precisely two such points equidistant to the existing [math]n[/math] points, but only one can be chosen, therefore the proposition is true for [math]n[/math]. By induction the proposition is true for all [math]n\\in\\N[/math]. QED [math][\\alpha_\\beta][/math] ",
