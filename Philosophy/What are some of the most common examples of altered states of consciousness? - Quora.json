            "answer_text": "This question implies a standard state of consciousness that is \u201caltered.\u201d  The problem is that since the beginning of psychology as a science, nobody has been able to adequately describe \u201cconsciousness,\u201d let alone an \u201caltered state of consciousness.\u201d Here is my guess on what an \u201caltered state of consciousness\u201d is. When you are awake and moving around accomplishing common tasks and relating to others in a way they consider \u201cusual,\u201d that is your standard state of consciousness. An \u201caltered state of consciousness\u201d is when you seem insensitive to stimuli that other people easily sense, like a pin prick.  One test of the depth of hypnosis is \u201cgloved anesthesia\u201d (Glove Anaesthesia | Self Hypnosis Downloads) where you are hypnotized to not feel a pinprick in your hand.  Because in your normal state of consciousness, you would feel such a stimulus, you would be said to be in an \u201caltered state of consciousness .\u201d Sleepwalking is another such altered state.  In our house in college, we had a member, Bruce F, who would get up in the middle of the night still asleep and do all sorts of stuff that he wouldn\u2019t remember when he woke. Some of the guys found out about this and took turns waiting for poor Bruce to enter his altered state of consciousness (sleepwalking), following him as he roamed the house sound asleep, and then when they tired of this \u201csport,\u201d they let the next shift take over and go to bed, leaving Bruce to wake up in an unfamiliar setting wondering how the Hell  he got there.  Great fun!! (I am proud to say I never took part in that.) There was also a guy in the house who talked in his sleep in German! (another altered state of consciousness) He had broken up with his girl that afternoon and later that night, I could hear him in his sleep repeating over and over, \u201cSie is tot! Sie is tot!\u201d (\u201cShe is dead! She is dead!) Wanting to put what little German I remembered from my 2 German courses to work, I reassuringly whispered in his ear. \u201cSie is nicht tot!  Sie liebt!\u201d  (\u201cShe is not dead! She lives!\u201d) He responded, (still asleep) \u201cJa, aber in mein herz, Sie is tot! (\u201cYes, but in my heart she is dead!\u201d). Well, my German wasn\u2019t up to arguing the point with him, so I let him alone. The next morning he had no recollection of our conversation.  I think he later reconciled with his girl friend and ultimately married her. The only other time I got to put my 2 years of German to use was ironically in Spain when I had to exchange dollars for pesos.  The \u201cexchanger\u201d could speak both German and English.  She was proficient in German \u2014 English, not so much.  So I asked how much she got  for making the conversion. In my best German, I asked, \u201cWie viel fur Sie?\u201d (How much for you?)  She said in English \u201cNothing!\u201d  (I guess I was reassured.)  So glad I took two years of German! Later I resolved to learn German better.  What a complicated language! German inflects everything! \u2014 nouns, articles, adjective, cases, etc.  In English you can say, \u201cI hit the boy,\u201d the boy hit me,\u201d \u201cthe boy was hit by me,\u201d \u201cI will hit the boy tomorrow,\u201d and never change \u201cthe\u201d in front of \u201cboy.\u201d  It\u2019s \u201cthe\u201d all the way down. In German, you would have to use \u201cder,\u201d \u201cdas,\u201d \u201cden,\u201d \u201cdem,\u201d or \u201cdie,\u201d judiciously, all depending on whether boy (\u201cknabe\u201d) was masculine or feminine or neuter.  \u201cThe girl\u201d in German, oddly enough, is \u201cneuter\u201d - das Madchen.  Oh! And the article changes with the part of speech it used as - accusative, nominative, dative, possessive, and a few others I cannot recall! So you would say \u201cI gave dem Knabem (indirect object) den Buch\u201d(the book,) and \u201cDas Knabe  (nominative case) is a boy\u201d and \u201cDes Knabes (possessive case) is meines Freund.\u201d  (You know, I think anyone who knew German and read this would be laughing their ass off!) I had a similar experience in Spain:  I finally mastered a few key questions in Spanish like \u201cwhere are the restrooms?\u201d  \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d  and \u201cwhere is the nearest US consulate?\u201d?  And my favorite:  \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo te llamas? (informal) \u201d (What is your name?\u201d). The thing that I forgot is that even if I were able to could ask the question in understandable Spanish, they would still give me the answer in Spanish, so that was no help. My trip to Spain was much like a game of Charades \u2014 I had to communicate by acting out my meaning.  A female friend who accompanied me and my wife was invited by bullfighters  to enter the bull ring  just before the bull fight.  She declined in her best Spanish, saying: \u201cYo soy pollo\u201d -  which in Spanish means \u201c I am a chicken.\u201d and is of course English slang for \u201cI\u2019m afraid to.\u201d They looked at her like she was crazy \u2014 Pollo?? Pollo? You are a chicken???\u201d they asked \u2014 apparently that phrase doesn\u2019t mean that in Spanish. One more and I\u2019m done:  When the above friend made another glaring cross-cultural error, she said to the Spaniards apologetically, \u201cMuy embarazada!\u201d She thought she was saying, \u201cI\u2019m very embarrassed!\u201d Unfortunately, in Spanish \u201cmuy embarazada\u201d means \u201cvery pregnant!\u201d O, I love the simplicity of English! Things mean what you want them to! PS.  All the time I was composing this I was in an altered state of consciousness! ",

            "answer_text": "Visual ConsciousnessAuditory ConsciousnessTactile ConsciousnessTaste ConsciousnessOlfactory ConsciousnessMental ConsciousnessBut aren\u2019t these what we call senses, except for mental consciousness?Yes they are, but then what is consciousness? Being aware of a sensation. So you see, consciousness is conscious of a sensation. But don\u2019t all these sensations appear to one consciousness? I will answer this with another question: Assuming that you don\u2019t have synesthesia, can you see sounds? Can you hear smells? Can you taste colors? No you cannot. Each consciousness has its own field of perception. Visual objects appear in the field of perception of the visual consciousness. The auditory consciousness only takes sounds as its objects. The olfactory consciousness is only conscious of smells. That is how we know they are separate consciousnesses, not one field with all sensations appearing in it. The mental consciousness, is unique in that not only does it take mental phenomena (thoughts, ideas, concepts, emotions, symbols, etc) as its objects but it also can take the qualia or sensations of the other consciousnesses as its objects. What it does is replace them with a generic symbol and thinks about them. For example you see a rose. The mental consciousness replaces the visual object that you see with a genergic image or symbol of a rose and thinks about it. The field of perception of the mental consciousness is called \u201cthe space of phenomena.\u201d You see it is the mental consciousness which organizes all our sense consciousnesses to create a unified experience. All these consciousnesses are co-dependent on their objects. The olfactory consciousness arises when there is a smell. The auditory consciousness arises when there is a sound, and so on. The mental consciousness arises when there is a thought, and idea, an emotion, or when any other consciousness percieves a sensation. When we fall asleep we lose consciousness and don\u2019t percieve any sensual objects or mental objects. They again emerge in a dim way during dreams. Is this what you were asking about? ",
