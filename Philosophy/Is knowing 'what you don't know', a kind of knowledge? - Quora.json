            "answer_text": "Yes it is. And it require at least some knowledge. Indeed, let us consider the case in which somebody is very inexpert on a specific field. The Psychologists, During and Kruger, showed the scientific evidence that the people that are very unlearned on a specific area, often are affected by a kind of illusory superiority. They honestly believe to be expert on this fielding, overestimating their ability/skills . They don\u2019t even know to don\u2019t know: this is the so called Dunning\u2013Kruger effect , see here for further information. On the other hand, the people that are very expert on a specific field, they underrate their knowledge, because in their view, they suppose that also other people are able to success in their fielding. So, to know to don\u2019t know (and specifically, to know what you don\u2019t know), it\u2019s surely a good start.

            "answer_text": "the question makes no sense the way is posed- how can you know what you don\u2019t know?! If you meant to ask if knowing that you don\u2019t know is knowledge, that is a different matter. At the world level it can be viewed as an acknowledgment that you miss information; however, that can be fixed by finding the information you don\u2019t know, if there is such a need. This though is a limited understanding that confuses information [concepts that have some temporal \u2018practical use\u2019] with knowing the essence of the object of knowing, beyond concepts, i.e., in the absence of any concept that tries to describe or label the phenomenal object of observation. At a spiritual level this is called \u2018divine ignorance\u2019 where one realizes the impossibility of knowing what anything is. The only \u2018thing\u2019 that can be known in truth, without a doubt is that of one\u2019s own existence. This is the only true knowledge. Any other knowledge is transitory imagination based on the memory of concepts, on the vocabulary of a language one learned from others. ",
