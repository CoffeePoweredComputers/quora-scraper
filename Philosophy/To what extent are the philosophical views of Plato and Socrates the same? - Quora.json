            "answer_text": "It's a tricky question because our knowledge of both of these men has been brought to us in the same vessel, namely the platonic dialogues, or at least a great deal of our knowledge of them. Nonetheless there are some key differences, as well as similarities, which we can garner from our readings. First and foremost there can be little doubt they were firm proponents of virtue. Even if they may have differed in their idea of the qualities which constitute virtue they believed absolute properties of the soul exist, and these properties should be nurtured. And both men believed wisdom to be the utmost of the virtues, as exemplified by Socrates life as a man who sought only knowledge, and likewise in Plato's life and writings. For them knowledge was high and the pleasures of the body were low, the former was a movement toward contact with the divine while the latter was considered to be a regression into a beastly way of life. With their faith in knowledge Plato and Socrates had different techniques for acquiring it, and this is perhaps the greatest difference between them. Socrates spoke to people to find things out. Famously he found out nobody knew anything after extensively questioning the citizens of Athens for decades, but nonetheless his method toward getting to grips with knowledge was by conversation, or namely 'dialectic'. A particular form of argument which is the scaffold of every Platonic dialogue. This method shows us that Socrates was largely concerned with ethics, as his investigations were wholly directed toward man and his relation to divinity. In a way Socrates was a kind of mystic who was perhaps more alarmed by the ignorance of people than anything, seeing this as a great evil he set out to remedy it in others and himself. Only adding to his mysterious character Socrates never put pen to paper, scorning the practice as being bad for memory and not at all useful. He after all believed that the only way a person could learn was in dialectic, face to face, not from a page. And considering the type of knowledge he was interested in he may well have been right. Plato on the other hand was a brilliant writer. His dialogues are numerous and cover a vast range of topics, from mathematics to politics to anatomy. Unlike Socrates Plato did venture into the sciences, if only a little, and held mathematics in very high regard. With the Timeaus Plato made one of the earliest attempts at developing a comprehensive theory of nature, postulating the existence of minuscule elements which make up solid objects. Socrates had no interest in such topics, he was more concerned with a man becoming better than learning snippets about his environment. The man who knows poison berries from fruit berries is no closer to the 'good' than the man who doesn't according to Socratic thought. So Plato busied himself with some topics Socrates wouldn't, which to me tells us that Plato wished to expand on Socrates philosophy, while still holding the original thoughts in high regard. Then of course you have the theory of the forms, Plato's jab at the underlying nature of the universe. Do note that this approach is far more extroverted than Socrates, Plato has made an attempt to investigate the nature of reality while Socrates was completely obsessed with the soul of man, and thus introverted in his investigation. Overall I would say Plato needs Socrates, but he stepped up a notch. Including a slither of scientific thought in his work, thus paving the way for Aristotle who was more scientific again. But in doing so Plato lost something Socrates exemplified, the socratic method. The pursuit of self knowledge is what Socrates gave us, and with his life he showed us that self knowledge will never come from others. Self knowledge cannot be gained from reading the works of another man according to Socrates. Instead it is found by deep contemplation and being present with fellow human beings. Plato immortalizes Socrates so that we might observe this wonderful character and hopefully understand his message, that self knowledge is the greatest good. ",

            "answer_text": "They really have nothing in common. One might even say they're opposite from each other. Socrates is in effect telling you to question everything, including authority, and to only know things by understanding them yourself. He uses a method (the Socratic method) to try and arrive at some understanding of the issue at hand. Plato constructed an entire philosophy, which I won't describe in details, based on accepting as facts the things he writes about and which eventually serves as justification for totalitarianism. ",
