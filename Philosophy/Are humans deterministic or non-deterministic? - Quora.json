            "answer_text": "The logic behind Bell's theorem, and the following experienents, could help to answer this question. True randomness Bell's theorem shows that nature violates the most general assumptions behind classical pictures. No combination of local deterministic and local random variables can reproduce the phenomena predicted by quantum mechanics and repeatedly observed in experiments. The violation of Bell's inequality tend to prove that the nature of the universe is non deterministic and that pure randomness can occur. With Bell's therom pure randomness, without precious cause, can appear. Why do we chose the same menu, day after day? In physics, a cause-consequence couple can ony have two explanations: a local influence (I share the same menu in the restaurant, because I want to please you)a common influence (I share the same menu because there is only one available menu)But without locality, true randomness becomes possible, through the violation of this causality. Two events just can correlat, at distance, and there is no causality to explain the results.We leave for two different restaurants, day after day, we share the same menu more than 50% of the time (75% indeed) although we didn't know wich menu we are going to take, when leaving in the morning.  That's called \"conspiracy\", nature violates local causality, events can be correlated for NO REASON So non-determinism and non locality become a fundamental properties of nature.  Abscence of discours and explanation This is the tricky part for the science, and opens a gap in the essence of the scientific method, there is no understandable story behind the mathematics and the experiment. So what about human being? Quantics are offen seen as a way to reintroduce human free will within the field of science. But does randomness mean free will or decision? Not really! So what? There is no proper story to illustrate what human being experience, decision and free will feeling. There is no mathematical theorem to describe it and there is no way to build convincing experiments to falsify it (neurosciences can't tell how the previous causes determined or influenced a thought or an action) So human deterministic nature remains in present time a more obscure question than God existence or deep nature of the matter.

            "answer_text": "Can a person change the past?  Can a person change what is occurring this present moment right now... as it is occurring? The future is simply a series of 'present moments'. As such, the future is entirely dependent upon the present. If you cannot change the past or present, you cannot change the future. If you cannot change the future, your whole life is determined for you. ",
