            "answer_text": "I think it is the other way around\u2014society is a danger for individual freedom. Society rules, establishing norms, moral values, concepts and criteria which compel individuals to comply. One could theorize about political dominance and patterns of behavior, but we are brought up to fit social patterns from early stages in our lives. Those who escape the pattern and fall through the cracks of the social system might turn out geniuses, nonconformists or unsociable. The unforgettable movie \u201cModern Times\u201d with Charlie Chaplin portrays how each one of us becomes a bolt, a little cog in the grinding wheels of contemporary life and how difficult it is to escape all predetermined actions without going berserk. It is really worthwhile watching Charlie Chaplin movies\u2014that man was a real genius. Suffice it to say, freedom is a nice construct. Unfortunately none of us has ever experienced it. We are able to philosophize about it, formulate theories, study its principles based on logical reasoning, die for it\u2026But, not even inside our minds we are totally free. We all accumulate emotional and factual debris which will influence our thoughts and choices. Modern Times, Charlie Chaplin  ",

            "answer_text": "Individual freedom is a positive good, so long as it is constrained so as not to harm others. In a society of enlightened individuals, individual freedom would pose no threat to society as a whole; in a society of normal individuals \u2014 with the standard range of human failings \u2014 individuals can occasionally abuse or misuse their freedom in ways that harm others, and render themselves a threat to society. An over-controlling society can be as much of a threat to society as an excess of ignorant freedom. Some balance between the two is called for. ",
