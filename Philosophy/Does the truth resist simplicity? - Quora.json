            "answer_text": "To de Broglie, Einstein revealed an instinctive reason for his inability to accept the purely statistical interpretation of wave mechanics. It was a reason which linked him with Rutherford, who used to state that \"it should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid.\" Einstein, having a final discussion with de Broglie on the platform of the Gare du Nord in Paris, whence they had traveled from Brussels to attend the Fresnel centenary celebrations, said \"that all physical theories, their mathematical expressions apart ought to lend themselves to so simple a description 'that even a child could understand them.' \" Emphasis is mine and not from the original text. \u2014 Clark, Ronald W. \"Einstein: the life and times.\" American Journal of Physics 41.8 (1973): 1029-1032. Complexity and simpleness are not contradictory concepts. They are in fact reliant on each other. Truth resists both superfluous complexity and simplicity. If you say the truth, resists simpleness, then I strongly disagree with you. If you say the truth resists, simplicity, then I agree. Einstein\u2019s equations undercut a vast array of data and phenomenon. But yet, his equations are relatively simple and accurately describe phenomenon. Look at the sheer length or more accurately, lack thereof, of the equation: [math]E=MC\u00b2[/math] It contains literally five characters. Now consider the sheer vastness and implications Mass-Energy Equivalence holds! Given that Occam\u2019s razor holds status in logical, analytical, and scientific thought, we should reconsider the presupposition of the question. Solomonoff Prediction and Occam's Razor An example of a phenomenon where simpleness generates deep, vast, and complex phenomenon is that of a fractal. A simple equation can generate vast and infinite complexity. Occam's razor - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Truth and simplicity, both are very much related and intertwined with each other. Both supplement and add importance to each other. Truth is all about inner validity of whatever is presented before us, our soul doesn't respond in a diplomat way to whatever comes before us, such truth and simple forecasts of and about our understanding is what soul and life searches for. Considering such a fabric relationship that truth shares with simplicity, truth can never suppress simplicity. It's in fact the search for the most inevitable and final trueness of phenomenona and matters. ",
