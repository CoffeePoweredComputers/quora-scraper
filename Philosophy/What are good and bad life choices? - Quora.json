            "answer_text": "Bad life choices are those that ultimately bring more pain and negativity to you and others than pleasure and positivity, wheares good choices are the opposite. Say, for example, you decide to try cocaine. The immediate effects are a lot of pleasure. In the long run though, that one decision often leads people into crippling debt, into lying to those they love and into destroying their relationships; the overall pain and negativity that came from the original decison is much more than the pleasure. On the other hand, however, if you decide to work on that english paper for another 2 hours (or stay at work, or do a workout, etc.) instead of doing nothing, the long-term positivity & pleasure that will stem from that decision is greater than the short-term pain of working. This, in my opinion, consititutes a good life choice. ",

To who it may concern To a life it might affect To a choice it might react For the soul is dead that slumber And alive to does that breath For the room of glory isn\u2019t the easy path And to believe is to find the strength that lies within us Even when shadows reflect us Life shows us who we truly are Choices begets hope not fear Our choices Our lives That\u2019s who we are!
