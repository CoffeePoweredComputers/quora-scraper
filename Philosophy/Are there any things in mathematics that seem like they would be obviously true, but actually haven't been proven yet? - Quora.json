            "answer_text": "Are there any things in mathematics that seem like they would be obviously true, but actually haven't been proven yet? Yes. Every proof begins with acceptance of some things that will never be proved. They are called axioms. Originally, \u201cobviously true\u201d was part of the definition of the word axiom. An axiom had to be in controversial enough to be accepted unanimously. That is the only way that an argument based on axioms could be irrefutable. It has since been recognized that very few axioms are accepted by all without controversy. Even axioms of Euclidean geometry have been successfully challenged. Today, an axiom is only to be accepted tentatively; every truth derived from it conditional. This is probably the main reason that scientific predictions derived from a mathematical model should not be accepted until confirmed by experiment. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are five simple ones. Is there an infinite number of perfect numbers, i.e. the sum of the divisors sums to twice the number. For example, 12=1+2+3+6 = 2*6, 56=1+2+4+7+14+28=2*28. Thus 6 and 28 are perfect.Is there any odd perfect number? Warning: It has been proved it must be greater than 10^50. Big!Is there an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Primes of the form 2^n-1, where n is an integer. If so, there are an infinite number of perfect numbers by the Euclid-Euler theorem.Goldbach Conjecture. Every even number can be written as the sum of two primes. (So easy to state but really difficult.) Examples. 12=7+5, 24=11+13. This conjecture has been proved to the limits of current computers.Twin primes conjecture. Is there an infinite number of twin primes? This means for a given prime then adding two gives another prime. Examples. 11,13; 29,31\u2026 Difficult.Proving any of these would make you instantly world famous. All are believed to be true. ",
