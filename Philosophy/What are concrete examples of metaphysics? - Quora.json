            "answer_text": "We all have five physical senses \u2014 sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste. But we also have these same senses on a metaphysical or psychic/invisible level. In metaphyschics the five invisible senses are: Clairvoyance - clear vision. There are humans, who can see what will happen in the future. For instance, when I was 8 years old I dreamed my grandfathers death, the night before he died.Clairaudience - clear audience. There are those who hear voices. I once had voice tell me clearly that my fianc\u00e9e was cheating on me. It turned out to be true.Clairtangency - clear touch. It is also known as psychometry. This is the ability to discover facts about an event or person by touching inanimate objects associated with them.Clearscent- clear scent. For years, I would smell the scent of vanilla cookies when there were no cookies in sight. I later read that others have this experience, which suggests the presence of a highly developed spiritual being or an angel.Clairgustance- clear taste. This I have not yet experienced.I am a member of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC, a genuine mystery school, tracing its traditional roots back to the mystery schools of Egypt. I have studied these senses and endeavored to become more aware and develop these senses. It is a wonderful exploration into the potentials of the human faculties beyond the physical realm. I once took a boyfriend to an AMORC retreat, and there less an open session during which a psychometry exercise was conducted. People where people exchanged keys, or watches, pens etc. They held them in their hands for a minute or two and remained silent. My boyfriend, who was not a Rosicrucian, was shocked when he picked up an impression of a chef from the item he was holding. That happened to be the profession of the person whose object he was holding! You have probably heard the term \u201csixth sense\u201d \u2014 it is properly called Clair sentience . It refers to the ability to have a clear feeling about a person Place or thing. Intuition. This is our \u201csixth sense\u201d \u2014 because it is not physical in nature, but operates on the psychic plane. Some people can \u201csense\u201d or feel within them when something is not quite right. This is especially true if they are in a situation makes them feel uneasy. There are many cases of people feeling they should not get on a plane \u2014 which later crashes. Or that they should go somewhere else because they feel they may be in danger. I survived 9/11 in New York because I had a gut feeling I needed to do some things which made me late and kept me from being in the World Trade Center when it was hit. I give you these small examples from my own ordinary life to illustrate to you that we all have powers that go beyond our obvious physical senses. But like everything else study and practice are required. There are laws which govern our bodies just as they govern the Universe\u2014 and you can prove it for yourself!  Always be a walking question mark. Explore! Experiment! Experience! #InwardandOnward! #TogetherWeGrow A2A Francesca C. Simon hosts \"Charting Your Course\" sessions on Facebook Live! on Sunday nights at 10 p.m. to 12 midnight, exploring mysticism, creative visualization, metaphysics, numerology, astrology, qabalah and tarot. DISCLAIMER: Please forgive any obvious mispellings or nonsensical sentences. This is due to Mr. Auto Correct, who mistakenly believes he can read my mind. However, he is often unfamiliar with the esoteric terms that I may use, and attempts to rewrite my posts! Grrrrrr! ",

            "answer_text": "Anything physical that can be called a universe meets two criteria: It is tangible (physical), andIt is metaphysical, because it relates to a theory of everything.The distinction between physics and metaphysics is blurry when it comes to everything unless we get technical, and technicalism after all tends to come with some big assumptions. The distinct approach is not necessarily metaphysical in any enlightened sense, but at least it is related to metaphysics. If we add factors like intelligence and human purpose it starts to look more metaphysical to us, because those things concern us and our modality in the universe. What is metaphysical to an ant concerns an ant and the universe, what is metaphysical to a flower concerns a flower and the universe, etc. But two parts of it appear to be tangibility and universe, unless we adopt other criteria. It may even be that tangibility is too selfish, or that \u2018universe\u2019 is the wrong idea. However, I do think knowledge is possible, as you will discover if you search my profile for links related to the Linguistic Turn. ",
