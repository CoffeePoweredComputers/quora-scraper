            "answer_text": "The short answer is you can\u2019t. The long answer depends on which ontology of space and time you choose to adopt. The traditional idea of classical space-time of General Relativity of a four-dimensional block universe, is by definition, fixed and eternal. Even if wormholes existed between past and future times, they too would be part of the never changing structure. Since there is no \u201cexternal\u201d time, all events would be self-consistent, no grandfather paradoxes are possible. When quantum mechanics is included it still doesn't help, arguing for separate timelines, still means the branches are also static, the future can't \u201cchange\u201d, their is no fifth dimension of block-changing time. There is also nothing which labels a particular slice of space as the \u201cpresent\u201d, without further modification into a past-block with the present being a boundary where space-time is created. The block universe becomes more unwieldy with quantum mechanics, where the future is only describle as a quantum wave function, whereas we observe a classically fixed past. There is a different way to understand time, not as a dimension, but simply a label on different states of a 3D-space, where the matter, fields and gravity are moving continually in a state of flux. This picture is questioned by those who say, what about all the results of Special Relativity with different obsevers having different versions of the present and the flow of time? It turns out that such three-D field theories can include the condition of constant speed of light for all observers, which is the basis of relativity. No observer by changing their state of motion, can see your future before you have have experienced it. In fact no-one ever sees the present, due to the finite speed of light, but always events in the past light cone. In this sense, the present is only a construction, only past events can influence any observer, which is the basis of causality. In this view, the present is all that exists, the past is merely a different arrangement of the constituents of the universe, as is the future. To \u201creverse\u201d time in any region of space, it would require every particle, to be reversed back to a previous position, requiring an astronomically large amount of work to cause a large decrease in entropy locally, thereby generating far greater entropy in the rest of the universe. There are also some irreversible information/thermodynamic operations such as bit erasure, which destroys information in the present about of past states, making it impossible to reconstruct the past. Quantum mechanics makes this worse, through irreversible quantum processes, decoherence or \u201ccollapse of the wavefunction\u201d, which means that not only is there insufficient information to determine the future, it can be said that the past also is indeterminate, with the wave function describing the past as well as the future. The only reason we see the past as fixed, is that the classical path contains special configurations of matter, which Dr. Julian Barbour calls time capsules, containing records of the past. ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds like what you\u2019re trying to describe is a closed time-like curve, however, a CTC doesn\u2019t reverse time, it changes the direction that you move through it. Time reversal, using the usual understanding, means that events happen backwards. That has nothing to do with time travel and couldn\u2019t happen in any case. As far as scientists saying that space-time can act as a time machine, I\u2019m no longer tolerating that analogy as there\u2019s nothing machine-like about a closed time-like curve. Physicists, essentially don\u2019t want to deal with the issue of time travel, so they\u2019ll use things like CTCs as a euphemism, when in fact, CTCs have never been spotted and not all physicists even agree that they\u2019re possible. The true key to practical time travel has little or nothing at all to do with relativity theory, but instead with the manipulation of reality to stimulate a reaction from the Participatory Universe model of John Archibald Wheeler, which is based in part on the notion of \u2018it from bit\u2019, that at the foundation of reality is information. The proper manipulation of that will make time travel to anywhere in space and time, possible, and through actual technological means and not some mathematical contrivance like a CTC. Already, experiments have been conducted that establish that retrocausality, a quantum phenomena that has been cited as an example of the past being changed, is actually producing new, parallel universe copies - New, Similar Experiments Dramatically Achieve Rainer Plaga Suggestion To Prove Parallel Universes. This is the first step toward practical time travel. Another development, using teleparallelism theories on the coupling between electromagnetism and gravity that Einstein had speculated on, is the Verdrehung Fan, which opens micro wormholes that RF and IR waves can enter from either direction, much like the theoretical work of Luke Butcher of Cambridge suggested might be possible through micro wormholes with a Casimer effect - New Scientist Article Reveals Data That Supports Marshall Barnes Presentation at May's ISDC. The Verdrehung Fan is expected to be scalable and could possibly be able to open a large, stable wormhole - Marshall Barnes's answer to Is it possible to create a traversable wormhole? There are other developments still, but these are all in the advanced concept area. You\u2019ll will find nothing about them or the science they\u2019re based on, in text books because it\u2019s all too new and cutting edge. What is going to happen, more and more frequently, is the results of the use of these theories and technologies, making the news. That\u2019s how you find out that they\u2019re real. ",

            "answer_text": "Well sadly you just can't. Good news is we do have theories, but bad news is we can't use that as of now. Heard of wormhole? Well if you haven't , a wormhole is a sort of portal joining two points or events in space time continuum,so this is theory part. Now I read what you asked for, you want to go back in past.Well these wormholes are supposed to be made up of anti baryonic particles, call it exotic mass or negative mass in much broader sense and so any interaction of baryonic particles ( those made up of proton and neutron) with that makes them highly unstable and they collapse even before a quantum particle enters it. So you see, creation of a wormhole is a problem and then obviously stabilising it is much bigger problem as of now. Rest we humans will always develop and hope some day we ll have solutions for this. Enjoy! Tschuss. ",

            "answer_text": "Straightforwardly, one can simply rule out any possibility of moving back in time by second law of thermodynamics as it dictates time to move only in forward direction. while moving in forward direction in time, one can exploit space time continuum only to move with different rates in temporal coordinates.. like time dilation. but of the charts, we have mysterious world of possibilities with black holes which may be a passage to reach back in time or in a entirely alien world. But, clearly we don\u2019t know. For the time being it depends on your logical imagination. ",
