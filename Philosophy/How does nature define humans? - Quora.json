            "answer_text": "Nature cannot be personified, nature is an evolutionary process having no identity except metaphorically in language usage. Having said that, nature is the world we know, we are products of nature and the process of evolution. Each species, Homo sapiens included has had to establish a habitate in which they could survive and flourish. Those species who succeeded, that is, that found a sustainable \u2018fit\u2019 flourished, those who failed became extinct. Needless to say, other factors led to some evolving and growing in numbers, while others due to predators and natural catastrophes died out. Nature is not kind, it enables those species able and capable of finding and defending a suitable habitat, to thrive and go forward. For the world\u2019s simians, they found an ideal habitat on trees, due to the natural largesse of foodstuffs and a relatively safe habitat on which to procreate and survive, they have not evolved over millions of years. Humans, in the other hand, ventures out, took chances, evolved various living methods in various seemingly inhabitable locations, or found ideal living conditions on more pleasant environs. The result is the human species as we know it today; spread across the planets surface and amounting to billions of living souls. We humans are and were shaped by the environments we procured and found beneficial for social life. It was never easy, and never will be, we develop ways and means to survive despite earthquakes, fires, tsunamis changing weather conditions, disease and numerous other \u2018natural\u2019 occurrences. So nature has determined that we must find and establish modes of existence in a range of different geographical and climatic conditions conducive to human existence and safisfactory living conditions.

            "answer_text": "Nature is a system that makes us individually fight for our lives with everything we got. Those individuals that are better at this fight become \u201cchosen\u201d to spread their unique characteristics in their species\u2019 next generation, thus enhancing their species\u2019 survival rate. In my opinion, nature itself is a framework thats meant to bring up the perfect entity. If we aren\u2019t the perfect species we will die out sooner or later, then nature takes its circle and everything starts again as it did at our species\u2019 birth. This cycle repeats as long as a species\u2019 goes extinct or gives up its place for an artifical one they made thats closer to the perfect being (don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think these are facts, just my own stance on how and why this mostly unknown system operates).

            "answer_text": "Nature is defined to humans having relationships, and the rest is survival. We go to work, most times out of the need for food and shelters. Also clothes and shelter. And by which method is the most frequency, the buying through central purveyors, realtors, etc. The value of work then is a natural resource. Does NATURE then mean money, cash, legal tender? No but from the point of view of nature, only money. Money is minimal abstraction. ",
