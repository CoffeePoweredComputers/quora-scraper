            "answer_text": "For a very broad question I would like to offer a very broad answer. What do you think is the biggest issue that is happening to our society today? If I were to sum it up I would say it is: The outrage/attention industry and its affect on political and social movements. If you were in a room full of people and someone walked in with a briefcase full of money and said \u201cI will give this money to whomever can get my attention and keep it.\u201d what do you think would happen in that room? That room, in a nutshell, is our current society. We live in a world in which novelty is more valuable than truth. During the emergence of mass media someone came up with the ingenious idea of subsidizing its content creation with advertising. Eventually this model came to dominate. Once we entered the TV era we became accustomed to persistent advertisements in our lives. I grew up in a world of persistent TV presence. People born after about 1990 or so will live in a world of constant Internet presence. The big social media sites like Facebook and YouTube came to be around 2004\u20132005. These sites were based on the same advertising model but with user generated content. In internet era we are all potential content creators. Money is out there to be had if we can somehow create a compelling spectacle. People are now competing to win Followers, Subscribers, Views, and Retweets. Should we be surprised that in this marketplace for attention people have learned that it is easier to titillate than stimulate, that it is easier to outrage than to educate? It is far easier to appeal to your emotions than it is to appeal to your reason. The cash me outside girl is nothing more than the predictable product of this model where any kind of spectacle can be turned into fame and money. Furthermore, political and social discourse is dominated by outrage and sensationalism. The election of Donald Trump is an example of how this process is playing out. He is a brand image, a television celebrity who delivers his \u201cpresidential\u201d thoughts in late night tweets. His election was, in no small part, a result of the rise of propaganda websites pushing outrage for financial/political gain. Scrolling through the front page of Breitbart is like scrolling through a curated world of outrage. Each headline and article is carefully chosen to conform to a narrative about the world. Its not so much about what is real or true, but about what you see, how you see it and how it is presented. All these things are presented in a way to drive a narrative of outrage. With the right outlet and the right presentation small events can be magnified to create the appearance of larger significance. People respond to these events in mass numbers to create political and social pressure. This was evident during the Trump campaign when large masses of people were responding with real emotional energy to essentially fabricated stories of Mexican rapists and the takeover of Sweden by Muslims. Oklahoma, the most deep red conservative state felt the need to ban Sharia law. Trump himself, who descries \u201cfake news\u201d is himself an avid consumer and propagator of manufactured outrage. This was obvious when he put himself out in front of the birther story. In a democracy, where people base their votes and thus their representation on what they believe to be happening in the world, its especially dangerous that these narratives are creating a completely distorted picture of the world.

            "answer_text": "Well, I gave my car for a regular service. The mechanic called me and gave me a list of the spares I need to replace. I approved the same, thinking that the mechanic would not give me a wrong suggestion. I paid a costly bill. Later I came to know that, the service centres make a lot of money by just replacing parts, which otherwise would work well for a few thousand miles. Now, why does the mechanic, give me a false advice?, would he have replaced the same spares for his own car with the similar wear and tear. Absolutely not. Then why did he do it. Because it was a part of his job to earn profit for company. He was also inspired by a few hundred rupees incentive, which was directly based on the bill of the customer. Do the mechanic feel guilt that, just for a few hundred rupees incentive, he has made the other to spend thousands of rupees more. No, he doesn't feel guilt. because he thinks, he just did his work and did it well. Let\u2019s assume, if I am a doctor working in a hospital, and the same mechanic brings his son for a treatment, can I ask him to do all the blood tests and other scans, which were unnecessary. I could do it just to earn more for my organisation and a incentive for me. Would I recommend the same tests for my blood relatives, for the same treatment, probably not. If the mechanic comes to know of the reality, will he accept the doctor has done only his duty. Definitely not. This is root cause of all the problems of the society. Every individual justifies his action, which may be unethical, just to keep his job and earn some extra incentive. In this process, they mostly end up in cheating other, who in turn end up cheating others and so on. This is a vicious cycle. for example, A real estate broker sells you a land which is worth less and makes you spend a fortune just for his commission.A sales man, makes you buy a product which is worthless, just for his commission.A bank manager sanctions a bad loan to fulfil his target.A lawyer giving a wrong advice to a client just to keep his practise going.A bank employee sells a credit card to a customer, knowing very well that the customer does not need one.in all the cases, the real estate broker would not invest on the land which he sold to you,the sales man would not buy the product which he makes you buy,the bank manager would not lend his own money to the same customer,A lawyer would not file a case, which he has advised you to do,the bank employee would not use a credit card, which he sells you \u2026.this is the most important problem of the world. Everybody justifies their action based on the actions of others. In this process, we all end up cheating and misleading others. Unless, every individual decides to do his job consciously and ethically, there is not going to be any relief to this crisis. ",
