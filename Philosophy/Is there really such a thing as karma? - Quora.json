            "answer_text": "That word is a translation from sanskrit and it means literally \u201caction.\u201d In other words, any action you do, drink a glass of water, go to sleep, drive to work, it\u2019s all karma. But it\u2019s more than that too. All actions have two phases, action and reaction. You cannot have one without the other. Action also follows specific rules of cause and effect. You drop a ball from a roof and it falls. It doesn\u2019t go sideways or upwards. It goes down because of gravity. This too is karma. It follows specific physical laws outlined by Isaac Newton. If you don\u2019t pay your bills today, it\u2019s only a matter of time before banks and landlords and utility companies go after you tomorrow. \u201cFate\u201d is commonly associated with karma. Like you have bad or good karma and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. That\u2019s a bit misinterpreted. Action is just action. It has no value judgment attached to it. If you drop a ball from a roof and it hits someone on the head and they sue you, you will interpret that as bad. And now you have bad consquences. If you find $100 on the street you might say you have good karma. Again, the human mind associated a value with an action when there is none in the action itself. Some people like to say they don\u2019t believe in karma, that they can do whatever they want to do. If you jump off the roof, can you fly up? I doubt it. We cannot escape the consequences of our actions. The more mystical part of karma has to do with reincarnation which is a whole other complicated subject. In that view, whatever we do can have repercussions for us in future lives. So that even if a murder/suicider appears to escape the law, he would not escape the consequences of what he did because they have to \u201creturn home,\u201d so to speak. A famous spiritual teacher once said the human mind cannot understand that kind of karma and how it works. You would literally have to become enlightened to fully understand how it works but by then, who cares. You\u2019re enlightened. In the meantime, we should always be humble and do the right thing as best we can. ",

            "answer_text": "Karma and Reincarnation (Part 1) 1. Karma, the Shaper of Life, the Builder of Destiny To live a happy and fulfilled life, everyone must watch his thoughts, words and actions, for every action begets a reward. This is the play of karma. It can never fail! Karma And what is karma? Simply put, Karma is the reward for action. It follows that you have positive and negative karma. The positive is understandably the reward for positive action, and the negative karma, the reward for negative action. And the Law? The aforementioned principle is summed up in a law appropriately named the Law of Karma, which states that, whatever a man soweth, that also shall he reap. It cannot be otherwise. So, all are advised to watch the nature of their actions because they will determine in the end whether they will be happy or not. No one can save anyone from this law. Bible Accounts Several mentions were made of this great and exacting law in the Christian Bible. The most important was when Paul was writing to the Galatians long after Jesus had left mother-earth. It is important to state that he had left by the time of Paul\u2019s writing because many will say Jesus said something different from Paul\u2019s account on the matter. In chapter 6, verse 7 of the said Galatian text Paul wrote: \u201cBe not deceived. God is not mocked: for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap\u201d. Be not deceived, he had warned. Yet, what do pastors preach? That once you have the will to ask for forgiveness, whatever you do, no matter how heinous, will be forgiven. And to make matters more annoying, they say the person will be washed so clean that he will be as white as snow. This is the greatest deceit of all time. It has misled many, who, expecting forgiveness after heinous crimes and prayers for forgiveness, are rather held accountable for their evil deeds, and therefore experience bad karma. Preaching Forgiveness The preaching of forgiveness has caused problems for many who deliberately engage in the wrong deeds in the hope that they will be forgiven thereafter. And when eventually and contrary to their belief, they come face-to-face with payment for their past negative deeds, they recoil in anguish. Yet, instead of taking responsibility they blame others for their woes. Such people kill, maim, oppress and steal, rob the less-privileged, oppress widows and the lowly, and thereafter offer prayers and other offerings hoping to be forgiven while the objects of their wickedness still languish in sorrow and deprivation. How can this be? Where is justice? Which God will forgive this; the Almighty? But no; the law of justice will not permit that. The law of God protects both the high and the low, and will not permit any person to mistreat another without the appropriate consequncies. Why the Law? The play of karma helps to teach love. It also instills discipline. When one discovers that whatever he sows is rewarded in like manner, he begins to choose his actions very wisely, and with due consideration for others. How will a child in school learn, if any time he does wrong, someone else takes the resultant punishment for him? Will the person also come over to do his assignments, a basic ingredient of his study in school? And will he ever be useful in society if he graduates without the right experiences? So those who preach that someone has died for their transgressions may have to think again, for every man has to bear his burdens. And everyone does, no matter what is preached at the pulpit. Why the payment is not obvious is because, if one is not very spiritually aware, the reward takes longer to happen, making it difficult to link the action to its reward. But the more he gets aware spiritually, the quicker the result of his action. Then he will see more clearly the link between his actions and their due rewards. For example, any time I drive roughly in traffic, someone quickly does the same to me in less than five minutes. Initially I couldn\u2019t connect my action to the payback. I would rush after the offender and call him all kinds of names, complete with lessons on driving. Sometimes quarrels result. Till my wife who is also an ECKist, that is a member of Eckankar, the Path of Spiritual Freedom, opened my eyes, and I began to see the link. And as I observed more, I proved it to the point where, if someone wrongs me in traffic even when I didn\u2019t do any such thing in the present; I will take it as payment for some bad driving I had done in the past. This gives me peace. When you pay your debts you have peace. Migration to Europe One discourse causing a lot of excitement in the public domain these days is the suspected gradual take-over of the West by Islam. And who are suspected to be on course to achieve this? Refugees. Where did these refugees infiltrate the West from? Arab nations. And why did they become refugees and migrate in such huge numbers that they could cause such a cultural change? Some people claim it is because their hitherto peaceful home-governments were overthrown by groups supported with money and guns given by the same West. So having lost peace at home because of upheavals caused by revolts, one of which was baptised \u201c the Arab Spring\u201d, they migrated west in large numbers, to get back the peace and solace that were taken away by the actions of the countries that engineered the Spring, in the first place. And so if the suspected islamisation eventually happens, who will be blamed? Radicalism? I don\u2019t know. But every deed must be rewarded, and in like-coin! Peace-for-peace, war-for-war, though the war could come in a different form like islamisation! Only time will tell. Yet weapons must continually be manufactured and tested on live-targets, as wars are generated directly or indirectly. Why not? And while the vile actions that lead to wars are taken and businesses are booming at one end, people are suffering at the other. Meanwhile those involved in these high-wire businesses do not think of the long-term effects of their actions; only huge profits. But all actions have consequences which must be borne in the end. However, people hope to be forgiven for these atrocities especially if they belong to big congregations and find the time to ask for forgiveness. And so the wrong tale goes on. Shaping Your Life and Building Your Destiny with the Law of Karma If only people knew that there is nothing like forgiveness, but rather that whatever one sows, he reaps; things will not only be in the right perspective, but better. Since no one truly wants the bad life, and a person would suddenly realise that to get good, he must do good, he will consciously strive to do good, so that he will also reap good. The cumulative good effects of this singular change in consciousness cannot be over-emphasised! Communities will be at peace; families will have more happiness. Most of the law-courts will disappear, and life will generally be better because everyone will be working hard to do good, to love; and the overall reaction or dividend will be good things. Wouldn\u2019t this be the desired right thing to want? So a wise person can use the law of karma to shape his life daily, and eventually build his desired destiny for himself, by doing to others and in all situations, only those things he would want to happen in his life. When he begins anew under this law, he discovers that it is not the Almighty that gives us the experiences we have in our lives, but our actions. The laws are there, crafted by the Almighty, but are there to be obeyed to make our lives better, or worse as we choose; only as we choose. Comfortable with the Teachings of Eckankar The Law of Karma was one of the first things that made me comfortable with Eckankar. There must be responsibility, I had agreed. People cannot just pray or wish away their evil deeds. There must be equal and like payment for every evil deed, so that the injured will at least be appeased. There must be equity. That is only fair. Reward for Good Too Yet there is also reward for good deeds. When good deeds are rewarded, we take the rewards for granted because they have not taken from or created any pain in our lives. They are good. It is when evil or bad deeds are rewarded that we feel pain for lack of understanding. But good or bad, a reward is a reward, and a due consequence of action. Practical Experience After learning about the law of karma from Eckankar, I experienced it in a very practical and indisputable manner. This story will be recorded in a later post. The Master wanted me to know the law in a very fundamental and practical way because it would help to explain why I was having the pains I was having in my life at the time, and to warn against any future violation of this very basic, important, interesting and beneficial law of survival; of life. For of a truth, the law of karma is indeed beneficial if one knows how to use it to shape his destiny. Now I will tell a few real-life stories to prove that the law of karma is real. But before then let us look at how Karma is related to Reincarnation. Both principles normally play out together. Karma and Reincarnation (Part 2) 1. Reincarnation, another Chance to Get It Right Reincarnation naturally follows or operates hand-in-gloves with Karma. The journey of life is learning how to give and receive love in other to eventually be able to be of service to all life, and cannot be achieved in only one lifetime. So, Soul has to come back. The coming back also affords it the opportunity to make good the things it couldn\u2019t make good in previous incarnations. Definition Reincarnation is the return of Soul to earth in another human body, after the death of the previous body in which It had lived in a previous lifetime. We are talking here about someone who dies, in a manner of speaking, which in reality, is dropping the physical body; then stays in the heavenly or inner worlds for some time, and comes back in another body to continue his study of the ways of God and love. An incarnation is a lifetime, and reincarnation is therefore coming into another incarnation (lifetime) after an immediate past one. Like the Academic System It is like passing through the academic system. In a particular one like the primary school for example, one moves from one class to the other, much like incarnating from one lifetime to another. Eventually the student goes through the gamut of schools in the academic system and graduates. Upon graduating, he might decide to specialise in an aspect of his vocation and finally come out to be of service to society. The same way, Soul moves from one lifetime to another in different bodies learning love till It graduates and is ready to work for the Almighty God, in a chosen capacity. How Reincarnation Happens When Soul leaves a particular incarnation by discarding Its physical form, the body, in what the uninformed calls death, the lords of karma, those who preside over the judgment of every Soul after an incarnation, sit in judgment over It. This judgment comprises balancing Its karmic ledger which consists of Its positive and negative deeds in the just-concluded incarnation. If the result of the balancing is positive, the Soul had done well over all; if negative, there are questions to answer. Its balance-sheet will however constitute Its destiny in Its next lifetime. Most times Its positive karma is stored up or reserved as reserve karma, which could be used to aid the particular Soul in times of great need in any future lifetime. The negative karma is carried forward for resolution or payment. The Grace of God For example what people call grace is mainly reserve karma. It\u2019s like one saves up a part of his salary or earnings every month as reserve, to prepare for unforeseen circumstances or emergencies. If suddenly someone wins a big state lottery in the midst of extreme poverty and need, or a miraculous and ordinarily inexplicable healing happens, he is reaping from some grace coming from beyond. These are examples of reserve karma at work! Coming Again And so since this Soul has negative karma to resolve which now constitutes Its destiny, It comes back to earth in a new body. The nature of the karma will determine whether It will be born into a rich or poor family; whether It will use a male or female body; whether It will have children or not; in short, the nature of Its life in the ensuing incarnation. The sole purpose is to afford this Soul another lifetime to make amends and learn, much-like repeating a class; to learn what It couldn\u2019t in Its past incarnations, all these geared towards preparing It for a life of love and selfless service in the future. Sometimes the particular Soul requires great re-orientation and re-education aimed at driving it towards love especially if It had been too negative in the past. So, at the right time and conditions, Soul descends most times through the top of the head, into a new physical body as it comes out of a pregnant woman at birth. And the chronicles of a new incarnation begin. Many times, a particular Soul will alternate between the use of male and female bodies so as to learn the active and passive ways of life. The male body is considered active (positive) and the female passive (negative). After oscillating between these two poles of energy and learning from them over several lifetimes, then It qualifies to exhibit the neutral nature of Divine Spirit and then is ready to meet with the God-man of the times to break the cycle of reincarnation, the coming and going of Soul. Every Relationship being Karmic The resolution of past karma brings people together in businesses, marriages, quarrels, wars and so on. During these relationships, Soul pays those It owes and collects from those who owe It. Have you ever wondered why you meet some people and just dislike them even if you are meeting them for the first time in this lifetime, while in other cases you just love the people for no explainable reason? These are karma and reincarnation at play. And so every relationship in any incarnation is linked to past karma. The people involved are not just meeting for the first time. Past karma has brought them together; and once it is resolved they go their separate ways. So when someone doesn\u2019t like your face in the office, do not worry, for in due time, the matter will be resolved and be over, when you will have paid what you owe. But if you react negatively, you might just prolong your experience with this fellow, by creating fresh karma which will need to be settled in future. More on Karma and Reincarnation 1. Soul can control or positively rebuild Its destiny by doing acts of love. 2. All karma is administered by lords of karma, except for those who have balanced their karmic ledger to the extent that their good karma brings them to the God-man of the time, no matter what he is called in the particular lifetime. Thereafter, the administration of their karma is taken over by the God-man. In this age, the God-man is called the Mahanta, the Living ECK Master. 3. Karma is interchangeable at the point of resolution. For example, embezzlement can be resolved with ill-health where the thief spends the money he embezzled to heal himself; a slap could be resolved with hitting the leg against the door-jamb, etc., everything directed by the administrator. 4. Soul does not die. It is the physical body that dies when Soul withdraws from it. 5. The physical body in the womb of a woman is not yet a human being, till Soul descends into, and takes possession of it at birth. In the play of life, everybody gets what they deserve In the play of life, everybody gets what they deserve. This means too that no one gets what they don\u2019t deserve. While writing this piece, my attention was drawn to a movie on TV, in which a woman\u2019s child of less than two died in an accident. I watched as the woman obviously in great pain, asked how it was possible that God didn\u2019t protect her son. She further asked which kind of God would allow a child to die. In another scenario, I commented on something that was reported in Quora, a public platform for commenting on many topics. Someone had been jailed for an offence he didn\u2019t commit. Eventually the truth of the matter was discovered and he was released, but he had already served 28 years. To other commentators this was gross injustice, which it looks like, if the matter is judged from one lifetime. In my own contribution however, I volunteered that it was possible that there was a karmic reason for what happened, obviously carried from a past life into this, and that must have been the reason this seeming injustice happened. I advised the man to take heart and rather be happy because, since it was obvious that he owed his false accuser some measure of karma, which must have been resolved by this act. I also observed that all those involved in the debacle, including the judge and his assistants must have inadvertently been engaged to execute the karmic balancing. I had hardly finished posting my contribution, when I began receiving very insulting replies. One person particularly mentioned that I must be on some kind of hard drugs to have suggested what I had posted. A lot more vile comments came my way, but I was not moved. I was rather very understanding, and empathetic, because a few years earlier I could have held same views, if not for what I have learnt from the teachings of Eckankar, my beloved spiritual path. How could I possibly have been able to convince these purveyors of vile comments that nothing happens to a man except he deserves it? Or the poor woman who had lost a child, that that was not actually a child, but an old Soul, who must have come into this incarnation with some past karma that must have been determined through death by accident? And that the youthfulness of his body did not count in this judgment? And so everybody deserves what they get.
