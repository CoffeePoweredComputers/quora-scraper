            "answer_text": "Consider this couple. Everyone knows what she said. Everyone knows what he said. There are claims against him. There was brainwashing involved, perhaps. The myriad details grow and develop like tumors. Years pass. No one is closer to \"the truth.\" Fans put it behind them. They go back to the cinema and see his latest movie. About more liars. More moralistic dilemmas. Year after year. Everyone wants relief from the pain. After some time we look up to find, someone is still lying. Maybe both of them are making up stories in different ways. Children were involved in the entangled destruction of lost hope and love. They spend their precious lives taking sides as adults. Get famous in Vanity Fair. Nobody knows for certain what happened, many years ago, in an attic.   To be set free means to leave the story behind.  It just may be that the world's suffering happens because we choose to remain in a story that we do not want to get rid of, that we do not wish to leave. We are not like Woody Allen characters that can jump out of a movie screen and visit \"real life.\" We are stuck in our stories, in our heads, in our attics. We all have an ongoing schtick that we keep believing about ourselves, the world, and ourselves in relation to the world. Schtick. I love that word. Schtick! Who do you become when you drop the story? When you decide to quit believing in dishonest and twisted accounts of your version of reality?  Lighter. Truer. More yourself.  You are set free from illusion. Enlightenment is just right there. You learn how to see the world, shining and dazzling in its purity with new eyes, with fresh perspective. You become more available for life to breathe through you. You become unstuck. The air around you begins to blow, there is movement. Why is this good?  Because it lightens the load. Heavy people carry many stories, many schticks. You get to know them all because they repeat them over and over. Some carry them to their graves and energetically, force other people to deal with the heaviness at their very own funerals -and beyond.  Truth is light. Lightness is attractive and attracts more light. When you step out of your story, off the screen, you get in touch with the lightness of being. That is worth knowing.  The truth shall set you free. Free means free. Many never get there. ",
