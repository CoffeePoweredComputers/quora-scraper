            "answer_text": "Hi, a bit of a \u2018have to think about it\u2019 question, really. I think that when we are very young, we had a much easier time of chasing it as a \u2018blessing\u2019. We were born into a world, which had been polluted by a thing called \u2018the knowledge of good and evil . . . young mortals are a bit more separated from all the rules and laws that challenge their \u2018innocence\u2019. Adults more easily recognize it as the \u2018Curse of the Law\u2019. Those who know how to entertain that childlike wisdom of a purer heart, can hang on to the blessing part more easily. Those who have been exposed enough to the \u2018Law\u2019 part of it begin to learn how to respond in a multitude of \u2018more bitter ways\u2019 about it. It\u2019s a \u2018fickle\u2019 kind of thing because what many are truly are missing (without realizing it) is that \u2018passion\u2019 almost always is bich whipped by \u2018emotions\u2019. Emotions are a damn strong thing. Our brains needs to use them because the brain itself was never created for bringing \u2018answer\u2019 of wisdom to anyone. Our \u2018brain\u2019 is nothing more than a \u2018hard drive\u2019 to store facts, and cold heartedly computes them. Wisdom can only come from a \u2018pure\u2019 heart and even though \u2018religion\u2019 and psychology, try to \u2018picklock\u2019 it: for truth / the brain just doesn\u2019t have the ability to do it with much correctness. (It does however try to satisfy it), but most usually fails because of the \u2018fireworks\u2019 of emotions. I know . . . that answer also is sort of a \u2018have to think about it\u2019 too . . . answer. Hey, have a great day ",
