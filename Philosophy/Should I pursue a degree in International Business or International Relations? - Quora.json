            "answer_text": "As far as I understand, International Business and International Relations are two very different areas of study, with different outcomes for students. International Business students complete core Commerce units, some units on cross-cultural communication and some management units. Most students in this major end up working for big multinational corporations and aim for management positions. International Relations is something entirely different. Students learn about politics, history, anthropology through various frameworks of the field. Students hope to work for governments, social enterprises, not-for-profits and charities. International Business reinforces the current capitalist system by training students in neoliberal philosophy and setting them up for management or leadership positions. On the other hand, International Relations teaches students to question and even dismantle the current system. To choose between these majors you need to consider your career goals and personal values. I studied both Arts and Commerce, and after three years of being exploited by businesses I have decided I want to focus on working in the NFP and humanitarian sector. ",
