            "answer_text": "The Lies. If you are black, the odds of you being shot by a police officer are unbelievably small. You are significantly more likely to be killed by a black criminal. Yet when cops shoot said black criminals, the riots ensue. And if you present said rioters (who the left claim are protesters) with evidence that the criminal they\u2019re rioting over was a criminal, it goes from \u201cJustice for X\u201d to \u201cthis ain\u2019t about one man. It\u2019s a movement!\u201d. In other words, the members are convinced they can do no wrong, even if a specific protest is based on a false narrativeThey are violent. They just are. Not blacks. Not all BLM protesters. But after watching the protests here\u2019s how they tend to go. The start of the protest is multi ethnic and multi generational. From young white millennials to black pensioners, local congressmen, students, workers, etc. Then as the night goes on, the crowd transforms to almost exclusively under 30 year old blacks and only blacks. Then the crowd changes from \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter\u201d to \u201cburn that shit down!\u201d and \u201cyo they beating up all the white people!\u201d.The fact that the protests are blatantly anti police, yet because it comes in the wake of a shooting, you get shut down if you say so. A friend of mine (a black friend) used to be in BLM. Used to go on the protests after killings and call for body cameras and trials\u2026which she still does. But she got scared. Why? Because if you hung around long enough, you\u2019d see the crowd transformation I talked about in point 2. Black youths (usually unemployed) start to show up. They bring switchblades, pocket knives, the makings of a Molotov cocktail and the occasional gun. She didn\u2019t like that. She stuck around for one that saw riot police coming in during the riot to have bricks and such thrown at them, the occasional Molotov being thrown. Cars were being pushed on their side or vandalised, people were breaking into stores and stealing TVs, DVD players, Xboxes (no books obviously). How was this helping anything? This isn\u2019t about racial justice, it\u2019s about opportunism. \u201cWell, those people clearly aren\u2019t true black lives matter supporters\u201d you say. Yeah they are. Don\u2019t fool yourself, they absolutely are. They showed up for the protest but stuck around and looked to make a buck from the problems.Black Lives Matter attacking white people. Now, if I recall this particular \u201cprotest\u201d as liberals call it was started after a black police officer shot a black armed suspect as he pointed his gun at the officer. This is not a rarity for a BLM \u201cprotest\u201d. Chief Flynn after Nov. 6 police commission meeting This is a sane person providing a pretty good analysis of the whole \u201cblack injustice\u201d thing. I don\u2019t have the stats here but if I recall the breakdown of black killing victims are something like 90% blacks killed by blacks, 6% blacks killed by cops and 4% by whites, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m off there. That\u2019s a rough breakdown of it. What I want to know is how a group that calls itself Black Lives Matter has chosen to focus on the 6% of black shooting victims of police rather than the 90% of blacks shot by other blacks. It seems to me that if black lives mattered, surely 90 black lives are more important than 6. This is not to say you should ignore those 6, but at least include the other 90! When asked, BLM give some weak response like \u201coh we\u2019ve protested inner city crime before\u201d. Yet they protest the people whose job it is to stop inner city crime. It\u2019s a messed up organisation/movement and this is without touching on the whole socialist policies their leaders advocate for ",
