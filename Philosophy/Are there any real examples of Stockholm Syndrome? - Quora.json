            "answer_text": "On 2 March 1998, at the age of 10 a Austrian girl named Natascha Maria Kampusch was kidnapped and held in a secret cellar by her kidnapper Wolfgang P\u0159iklopil for more than eight years, until she escaped on 23 August 2006. This is the current picture of her as a grown up 31 year old woman taken in 2019.  During the eight years of her captivity, Kampusch was held in a small cellar underneath P\u0159iklopil's garage. The entrance was concealed behind a cupboard. The cellar had only 5 m^2(54 sq ft) of space. It had a door made of concrete and was reinforced with steel. The room had no windows and was soundproof. For the first six months of her captivity, Kampusch was not allowed to leave the chamber at any time, and for several years of her captivity, she was not allowed to leave the tiny space at night. Afterwards, she spent increasing amounts of time upstairs in the rest of the house, but each night was sent back to the chamber to sleep, as well as while P\u0159iklopil was at work. After her 18th birthday, she was allowed to leave the house with P\u0159iklopil, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise. Now the disturbing part about this whole kidnapping thing comes which indicates that she might have been suffering through \u201cStockholm Syndrome\". P\u0159iklopil gave her books, so she educated herself. She did not feel that she had missed anything during her imprisonment, but she noted, \"I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company\". She was sympathetic of her captor and this is what is generally called Stockholm Syndrome. Dietmar Ecker, Kampusch's media advisor, said that P\u0159iklopil \"would beat her so badly that she could hardly walk.\"P\u0159iklopil would starve her to make her physically weak and unable to escape. Her body mass index had reached as low as 14.8 during captivity (normal BMI:18.5 to 24.5).Kampusch was also raped by P\u0159iklopil. Now if someone did all that to you would you sympathize with that person? She at times did try to escape though but the attempts went in vain. But finally on 23 August 2006, the kidnapper walked away to take a call while she was cleaning and vacuuming. Kampusch left the vacuum cleaner running and ran away, unseen by P\u0159iklopil, who completed the phone call without any sign of being disturbed or distracted. Kampusch ran for some 200 m through gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on the window of a 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, \"I am Natascha Kampusch\". The neighbour called the police, They arrived pretty quicklu. Later, Kampusch was taken to the police station in the town of Deutsch-Wagram. Kampusch was identified by a scar on her body and by her passport(the police found it in the room where she was held captive). Whereas the kidnapper, P\u0159iklopil knew that the police were after him, so he killed himself by jumping in front of a train near the Wien Nord station in Vienna. Now another disturbing thing which indicates more to her suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, when she said \"I feel more and more sorry for him\u2014he's a poor soul\". And according to police, she \"cried inconsolably\" when she was told that he was dead, and she lit a candle for him at the morgue.  This Stockholm Syndrome isn't actually recognized as a mental illness. But it's a term used to describe what the victim might be going through. So first, a person might feel utter terror, but as a survival mechanism they might even start to emphasize with the person who had locked them up. This is totally weird but you won't believe 8% of the total people kidnapped show signs of Stockholm Syndrome as said by a research by FBI. ",

            "answer_text": "Stockholm Syndrome, a psychological condition wherein a captive begins to identify closely with his or her captors, is named so because of a real-life example. The bank robbery in Stockholm (1973)  In August 1973, four employees of Sveriges Kreditbank were held hostage in the bank\u2019s vault for six days. During this period they developed a special bond. The hostages didn\u2019t cooperate with the police who came to help them. One of the hostages, while talking with the country\u2019s Prime Minister, said that she fully trusted her captors but feared that she would die in a police assault on the building.  There are many other real examples of this syndrome, 1) Abduction of Mary McElroy (1933)  She was abducted from her father\u2019s house by four men. She was taken to an abandoned farmhouse and was chained there. The kidnappers demanded a hefty ransom for her release. After her release, Mary defended her kidnappers by saying that they were only businessmen. She visited them during their prison sentences and eventually committed suicide and left the following note: \u201cMy four kidnappers are probably the only people on Earth who don't consider me an utter fool. You have your death penalty now \u2013 so, please, give them a chance.\" 2) Abduction of Patty Hearst (1974)  She was taken hostage by the Symbionese Liberation Army, who were attempting to go to war with the USA. Later on, she joined the SLA herself and also helped them in a bank robbery. She was arrested two years later after taking part in a shootout against the LA police. Pleading Stockholm syndrome did not work as a proper defense in court. But eventually, she was presidentially pardoned by Bill Clinton, who was informed that she was not acting under her own free will. 3) The kidnapping of Mariano Querol (1996)  This 71-year-old psychiatrist from Peru was kidnapped and held captive for a few weeks. During that time, he read books with his captors, gave them free counseling sessions and watched TV with them. He admitted to having Stockholm Syndrome and published his experiences in the book \u201cMemory of Captivity\u201d.

            "answer_text": "25-year-old Mary McElroy was taking a bath when she was abducted by four men. The men broke into the house with a shotgun and waited for Mary to get dressed, before taking her to an old farmhouse and chaining her to a wall in the basement. Her father was a rich man \u2014 a goldmine for ransom money! The men settled for $30,000 for Mary\u2019s release. She left unharmed. Three of the men were captured a month later and sent to trial. However, Mary said that she was well cared for during the 29 hours in capitivity. One of the men apparently gave her flowers.  She was riddled with guilt, and publicly sympathized with the abductors, so much so that she asked for the sentence to be reversed! Mary remained friends with two of her captors, visited them in prison and brought them gifts. However, this didn't end well. At the time of the trial, Mary experienced many breakdowns. Her mental state collapsed. She committed suicide and left a note reading: \u201cMy four kidnappers are probably the four people on earth who don\u2019t consider me an utter fool.\u201d   The term 'Stockholm' describes a set of psychological traits that was initially observed in people who were taken hostage during a bank robbery in 1973, in Stockholm. What happens is that a person in captivity may develop a bond with their aggressors. The feelings can range from empathy, to the illusion of romantic interest and anger towards the law. Victims who have been rescued are described as being in a trance-like state. Their concept of right and wrong becomes muddled. If the captor doesn't harm the victim, the victim may feel gratitude for keeping them alive. One possible explanation for how the syndrome develops is that at first, the victim may be threatened; thus establishing fear. The victim learns that in order to survive, they need to understand the reactions of their captors and become compliant. This becomes their safety-net, their defence mechanism.[1] Despite being a fairly well-known psychological condition, the authenticity of Stockholm Syndrome has been questioned. What's your opinion?

But if you go deep and dig for the actual reasons the results may be surprising. Without going in much deep of defining and redefining the process and citing examples or what happened at Stockholm bank robbery, I would just like to clarify it in a simple way. I would like to start it with developing \u2018Irrationally Positive Emotional Bond with Captor by Captives) and this is how one can easily define \u2018Stockholm Syndrome\u2019. As we all know that our mind is a very powerful sensible receptor. It collects memories and interconnect them with existing belief or moral or ethical part of daily routine life. What happens if a person brutally beating a child who has stolen his purse??Perhaps, you may stop him from beating and will ask him to give the child a chance. You may say that this event is something different from \u2018Stockholm Syndrome\u2019. Yes, It is. But, the question is why in-spite of knowing that the child is offender you tried to save him? What prompted you to save him? Actually, its the emotions that kept in soft corner of your brain from your any past life event, that made you to do this. Likely, in \u2018Stockholm Syndrome\u2019 the captives start developing Emotional Bond with captors (and I think you will now agree that it is very likely possible to happen). But developing such a bond always has a connecting link. It does not develop without any cause. Such positive emotions are inspired by any life time past acts or events of captives. May be captives feel mercy or pity towards captors if they caught. May be they feel pity at the life or livings of captors on humanity ground. May be that captives have any family history where their close relatives once had been part of such life of captors & captives don\u2019t want to threat them or many such provoking events for developing positive emotional bonds with captors. But, a crime is a crime. \u2018Stockholm Syndrome\u2019 mostly happens if the captives are emotionally imbalanced or blindly follow humanitarian principles and it needs to be sorted out.

[EXCERTRPT]Stockholm syndrome, psychological response wherein a captive begins to identify closely with his or her captors, as well as with their agenda and demands. The name of the syndrome is derived from a botched bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden. In August 1973 four employees of Sveriges Kreditbank were held hostage in the bank\u2019s vault for six days. During the standoff, a seemingly incongruous bond developed between captive and captor. One hostage, during a telephone call with Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, stated that she fully trusted her captors but feared that she would die in a police assault on the building. The most infamous example of Stockholm syndrome may be that involving kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst. In 1974, some 10 weeks after being taken hostage by the Symbionese Liberation Army, Hearst helped her kidnappers rob a California bank. But it was during the hostage crisis in Iran (1979\u201381) that the Stockholm syndrome worked its way into the public imagination. The syndrome was also cited after the 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847. Although passengers underwent a hostage ordeal that lasted more than two weeks, upon their release some were openly sympathetic to the demands of their kidnappers. Another example involved Westerners kidnapped by Islamist militants in Lebanon. Hostages Terry Anderson (held 1985\u201391), Terry Waite (1987\u201391), and Thomas Sutherland (1985\u201391) all claimed that they had been treated well by their captors, despite the fact that they had often been held in solitary confinement and chained up in small, unclean cells. Similar responses were exhibited by the hostages held at the Japanese embassy in Peru in 1996\u201397. [EXCERTRPT] SP SEE: Stockholm syndrome | Definition, Examples, & Facts ",

The FBI soon learned that Hearst\u2019s abductors identified themselves as the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), and that they were attempting to wage war with the United States. The group had already left carnage in their wake, and by their own admission, abducted the heiress for financial and political leverage.  Then, in April 1974, the case took an unexpected twist: Patty Hearst had joined her captors and announced her intention to be a revolutionary. She even assisted in a bank robbery, and started traveling around the country after a shootout between the SLA and Los Angeles Police left SLA leader Donald DeFreeze dead. She was finally captured in San Francisco on September 18, 1975, charged with robbery, and sentenced to seven years in prison. In her defense, Hearst claimed to have been brainwashed. She served only two years before her sentence was commuted; she was later pardoned. Footnotes: How an American Heiress Became the Poster Child for Stockholm Syndrome ",

The driver, Michael John Devlin, jumped out, loaded Shawn into his car, and took off. Police, firefighters, and volunteers combed the area for the missing child without success. Four and a half years later, another missing child, 13-year-old William Benjamin Ownby was found in Devlin\u2019s apartment, along with a now-teenaged Shawn Hornbeck. Devlin was arrested and charged with abduction. After his rescue, Shawn told law enforcement that he freely went shopping in public, had a girlfriend, and browsed the internet, all while remaining under Devlin\u2019s watchful eye. Asked why he never attempted to escape, Shawn revealed that Devlin had instilled deep fear and threatened violence repeatedly, creating psychological barriers that kept him prisoner. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of good examples here, but one more thing to note: people with Stockholm syndrome don\u2019t always sympathize with their abusers. Sometimes they want them dead. It can be a vicious pendulum. The captives in Stockholm were in a fight-flight-freeze situation but only had two of those options. They couldn\u2019t fight back, but they could at least try to flee, or they could freeze (make friends and dissociate). A love-hate bond with the bad guys keeps both options open, at least in theory. The \u201clove\u201d allows survival until a chance presents itself, and then, ideally, the \u201chate\u201d gives the motivation to run. Granted, that\u2019s ideal, and people don\u2019t respond to trauma in ideal ways. Stockholm syndrome could easily interfere with survival, and it doesn\u2019t disappear just because you live. It also probably won\u2019t be the one thing that saves you, which is what makes it a problem and not a very good solution. ",

In my dads village there was a girl who was sent to a city to study further, she was a top student of the village. Anyways this girl fell in love with a dude, who ran away with her to only Lord knows where. About 15 years later With three kidsa drunkard husbanda husband who beats here everydayFinally she started working as a maidand yet is in absolute love with this dude.So much so that in 15 years she never contacted her own parents.Finally the news came to know that this dude burnt her alive, leaving three kids to fend for themselves as he was ready to even sell the kids for alcohol.The kids now live with maternal uncle who never got a chance to see his sister alive.I know traditionally you refer to somewhat kidnapping but if you look at it closely this is also kidnapping where guys target an innocent girl and this girl is so lame that she annihilates her own career for a doofus not to mention hurting their own parents to no avail.

I can only imagine what my actions would be in the position of the abductee. Regardless of my empathy for my abductors, I would NEVER\u2026EVER act upon my feelings. NOT EVER! Keep in mind the emotions of a person raised by a narcissist are never validated. Add the questionable attitudes toward Stockholm Syndrome under normal circumstances (a bit of an oxymoron), and you would be left with feelings that would be repressed, denied, ignored. I would never have the bravery to go against societal norms. Exhibiting sentiments of sympathy and empathy, offering overtures of kindness and generosity going against popular expectations would be impossible for me. I was taught to put the needs of others before my own, usually in place of mine. Others, reared by non-narcissists, have the freedom to follow theIr heart, even when to all others, these actions seem wrong. In the example, Mary committed suicide, so giving her kudos for following her heart and thumbing her nose at society would probably be inappropriate and inaccurate. Even in light of all the progress I have made ridding myself of the influences of my past, I still find myself unable to go against what I perceive as expectations of me. Clearly following her instincts did not offer her the peace of mind someone like I would assume it would have. Obviously she still suffered tremendously. Stockholm Syndrome appears on the surface to be a coping mechanism and maybe it still was to some extent. Mary\u2019s note revealed she still struggled with the opinions of those around her who thought her a \u201cfool\u201d. An experience such as that would have to have long lasting, negative effects on a person regardless of someone\u2019s outward behavior toward her captures. The article did not mention anything about it, yet I would bet she never thought of a bath as a relaxing experience after her kidnapping. We will never know what other maladies lurked under the surface. ",

The classic American case is Patty Hearst, in 1974, She was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, held captive, given \u201creeducation\u201d and raped. She joined the SLA, took part in a bank robbery, and fired a gun to help prevent an SLA member being detained by a shopkeeper for theft. She helped make what are now called IEDs. It was only due to bad timing that she did not die with 6 other SLA members during a shootout when the police raided their headquarters. ",

Let us say we live at a place in a village X. Now that village is good enough for us and we are happy unless some tragedy happens. Otherwise it is very very difficult to move from X to a city called Y. There would be better education, health, entertainment, transport etc available. But we are happy where we are. This similar logic can be used on some people living in woe torn areas or areas with very weird and difficult believes. But people still live there. The biggest argument they give is that it is their homeland. Second part Now imagine 50% or more of this world\u2019s population surrounded by television, internet, fastfood, concerts, fashion shows, some impossible to do task in relegion and what not, which, if not followed in control or properly leads to loss of time making one incapable of normal or critical thinking. But we like it. So can this world be a prison keeping us indulged in some or the other things maybe even reading things like some books or even this answer. Just a thought ",
