            "answer_text": "There comes a point in the lifetime of every society or culture, when the population has figured out the food problem, the borders are more or less secure and the society has a sizable number of rich patrons with extra cash. At this point, the society enables and supports a certain percentage of people to venture out and explore the finer things in life. This is the point when the society produces great painters, artists, poets, scientists, mathematicians and musicians among others. In India this happened during the reign of great and powerful Kings. In China - ditto. But, this is not the cause for the beginning of Renaissance in Europe. Today, most historians agree that It was actually something completely out of the whack.  The credit for bringing the Great Renaissance in Europe rests completely and entirely on the non existent shoulders of this organism:  Meet the infamous, Yersinia pestis, commonly found in the fleas carried by ground rodents. This microorganism caused the infamous Black Death Plague during 1346\u20131353, which took atleast 75 million lives in Europe and Asia.  A Plaque in Port Weymouth, England  The Renaissance (which literally means rebirth), came to Europe between 14th and 17th century, more thanks to the Black Plague of the 14th Century, which took away a sizable population forcing many to ponder towards deeper meanings of life and death, pushing a few with money to support religious arts and iconography - It was a windfall for those who survived the Plague with food and land prices dropping to the lowest levels in history, with many becoming owners of large tracts of land which they inherited due to deaths in family.   It all started in the trading town of Florence where the powerful Medici Family bankrolled some of the great artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. From Florence, it moved to northern Italian city-states such as Venice, Genoa, Milan, Bologna, and finally to Rome during the Renaissance Papacy, when the Pope himself became a connoisseur. Needless to say, most of the art of this time was dedicated to god almighty. But in the later years, artists started painting portraits of the rich, the famous and the mysterious. There were great advances during this period in not just Art, but even in Science, Mathematics, Music, Religion and Self Awareness. This renaissance virus soon spread from Italian peninsula to other European lands far and wide, giving birth to one Mr. William Shakespeare in England, Introducing Ballet to the French Court, while inspiring the design of a Printing Press in Germany. Important to note here: Ever wondered why the technologically advanced Arab world lost the race of knowledge to the west? This is because in 1515, the Ottoman Sultan Selim I, influenced by a few clerics - issued a decree (Fatwa), carrying a death penalty - on the use of Printing Press and the import of books - calling it Haram . This ban remained in force for the next 270 years, ensuring the total erosion of the lead that the Arabs had over the Europeans in the field of Science, Technology and Arts. Since then, the cradle of Astronomy, the land of Numbers and homeground of Medieval Alchemy has produced a total of \u201cZero\u201d scientific or technological innovations in these fields - winning a total of \u201cSifr\u201d Nobel Prizes or any other prizes in the same regard.  Thank you for reading, Cheers and Peace :) ",

            "answer_text": "The Gutenberg Bible. It is no accident that Gutenberg\u2019s press was created during the early portions of what we now call the Renaissance. While the Renaissance is often pitched as a period where classical learning was rediscovered and studied, in my view, this misses the most important point: the rediscovery of Euclid and Archimedes were important, but it would have been far less so had Gutenberg not give us the tools to disseminate that learning broadly and cheaply.  Replica of the Gutenberg press at the International Printing Museum in Carson, CaliforniaGutenberg Bible - Wikipedia It is also no accident that Gutenberg\u2019s seminal work that kicked of the information supernova that was the Enlightenment, was a printing of the Bible. Suddenly, knowledge that had been the province of the rich and the clergy was widely available. Within one hundred years, it became common place to question the received wisdom of the preceding millennia. This cumulative body of inquiry had profound consequences for the intelligencia, leadership and the common man. Consequentially, while we like to label \u201cThe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cThe Reformation\u201d and \u201cThe Enlightenment\u201d with distinct badges suggesting boundaries between, they are actually a mash-up of colliding ideas and movements that are hard to tease apart with precision. While the printing press may not have impacted the Renaissance in terms of cause and effect, it clearly impacted in the cascade of events that the Renaissance provoked. Because of Gutenberg, the Renaissance impacted society like a tidal wave rather than the slow progression that mankind had experienced up until that time. ",
