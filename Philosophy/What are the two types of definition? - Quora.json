So you operationally define hunger as being without food for 24 hours. Are the monkeys hungry? Maybe. A person who eats food regularly would be hungry (most likely). A person with anorexia, for example, who hasn\u2019t eaten for two days would probably not be hungry (as in 24 hours without their regular intake of food because there is not a regular intake of food).",
