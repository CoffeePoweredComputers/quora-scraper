            "answer_text": "I am not going to write 5 principles, but will mention one important element that matters much more than anything else: be the change you want to see in the world. How does a person who advocates a healthy lifestyle look like if they regularly eat junk food? What does one who tries to convince others to buy and eat locally produced food achieve if they shop only in major supermarkets and reaches for imported goods? It is of utmost importance for you to practice what you preach. If you don't, you'll look like a total hypocrite. I am not saying here that the one doing this needs to be perfect, though. For instance, I practice voluntary simplicity, but that doesn't mean that I have to own a maximum of one of everything that is a basic essential and purchase nothing else but food. I have a pair of running shoes and flip flops. I have four pairs of pants, not just two. I have two skirts. I have three hoodies. However, all the clothes I own fit in one dresser and on a couple of hooks (except my winter coats and my jean jacket). I rent just one small bedroom and all my possessions fit in there comfortably. Not many people can say the same thing. I've owned less while I was travelling. I can say that I practice what I preach. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if these are \u201cthe\u201d five principles of advocacy, but they work for me. 1. When you have won the argument, shut up. The only thing you can do if you continue to argue is to lose the argument. 2. Never insult someone you are trying to persuade. There are no exceptions to this rule. 3. Do not over argue a point. You lose credibility for your whole point if you press a point beyond what the evidence shows. Thus do not say \u201cA lied about X,\u201d if you can only show \u201cA misrepresented X or should have known not X.\u201d Do not say \u201cB was wantonly negligent\u201d when you can only show \u201cB was negligent and indifferent.\u201d Modest arguments are more persuasive arguments. 4. Recognize that showing a contradiction in your opponent\u2019s argument is only half an argument. A contradiction is as true for you as it is for them\u2014it\u2019s an objective fact\u2014and your opponent can easily reverse the contradiction on you. To persuade, you have to show how you would resolve the contradiction. 5. \u201cClearly,\u201d \u201cobviously,\u201d \u201cwithout a doubt,\u201d and adverbs and adjectives of the same type are red flags that you don\u2019t have an argument. You are better off without them. ",
