            "answer_text": "Destiny is all but fictional for there are thousands if not millions of possible micro choices available any given moment so I think we shape our lives by deciding what to do either subconsciously or by conscious selection of choices. This idea can clearly be proven when one's life is passing through a difficult moment where your choice and not destiny is piloting the outcome. If you refuse to decide then others will take your place and you'll turn into an spectator of your own life so being active can disolve the illusion of destiny or any other kind of fixed reality notions. I don't want to imply we have absolute freedom for we are subject to our limitations and the whim of nature so even choosing might not affect anything at all. But remaining silent inside is even worse. ",

            "answer_text": "Both mean more or less the same thing. We are destined to live a predecided life but it still has to happen in a way where we obviously choose most decisions for ourselves and those decisions thus become the destiny. Basically we are inclined, tuned, influenced and motivated by certain things and not by other things because our life has to take a specific path that nobody can predict. Take that! No matter how absurd that sounds if you think about the following things it might make sense. Our interests, inclinations, motivations are something that are not absolutely our own choices though it may seem so. Where we\u2019re born, background we inherited, people we ended up with and other aspects ultimately make us who we are and because those things aren\u2019t in our control entirely, consequently the person we become too isn\u2019t exactly a willful chosen decision. Now we do have people who become completely opposite of what was generally expected of them but that\u2019s too in order for them to meet their specific destiny. While all the above is true, nonetheless, one atleast has this one choice of being aware, present, conscientious and kind at any given moment and that should be tended to regardless. Nothing can be more ignorant than to think that the above means giving up on life or abstaining from wilful decision making just because everything is predefined. As I said, at every given moment we do have the certainty to choose being aware or absent, being kind or self consumed, being right or being ignorant. If we choose correctly it wont really matter what destiny we end up living, think about it ! Good day. ",

            "answer_text": "In accordance with our nature, we live our lives as though we have choices. Our lives involve the appearance of free will. We can conceive of circumstances that deny free will, but we cannot know that such is or is not true. Our ineluctable limited knowledge guarantees that we can never definitely know the ultimate nature of ourselves, of our destiny or of the true nature of absolute Reality. Mystery must always confound human awareness. We will likely know more in the transpersonal situation toward which we appear to be evolving. But some degree of mystery will always confront us \u2014 so long as we exist. Existence necessarily entails mystery. When we cease to exist, the mystery dissipates. When we exist once more, mystery again pervades our new state of existence. ",

Destiny, Is beyong what imperct minds can explain perfectly, still , it's not not good at all to silent on it. That we are given birth to and that we will die, is our destiny. That you are male and not female is you destine.phenomenon if days and nights, is destiny.ageing is a destiny.etc. Free-will is other side of the mirror. That you fail is because yiu don't prepare well not destiny. That you are poor is your responsibility. That you want to die right now Is your choice.you married a wrong person is your fault.  As we can see, destiny is simply something that is not or cannot be affected by our action, attitudes etc. Free-will is opposite or other side of the same entity. ",

That said, I noticed that to the degree that I entertain the idea of my life being destined, that is how much weaker my attention is to make sure I don\u2019t screw up too much, or that will be my destiny. Cultivating the feeling of fate not only affects our sense of being responsible for our actions and decisions, it affects our strength of attention. Not positively. ",
