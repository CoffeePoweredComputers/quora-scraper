            "answer_text": "No, most people (including me), simply struggle to identify the \u201ctruth\u201d, in the noise of opinion. Too many eschew the struggle, to settle for the comfortable. While many more, eventually tire of the struggle, and accept the \u201cmost likely truth\u201d, as they evaluate it.

            "answer_text": "In general no. But if the truth being told will rip apart something you have believed for a very long time, and maybe based your life on, I believe they would have a hard time handling it. Then you also have the problem that truth in many cases is not something constant. It may change with time and culture. ",
