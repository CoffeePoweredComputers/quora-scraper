            "answer_text": "How does Kants process of knowledge work? I guess that the person who puts forward these kind of questions - would never recognize the answer. Why? Because the question already speaks its own language. There is no \u201chow it works\u201d within Kants explanations. But you need to read his - works (not just one of them) - sum them up in your own mind with reading others peoples summaries and from that stand of having many sources draw your conclusions on how his mind worked. And, there you can see (within your own mind) - the conclusions he drew from a lifelong experience within science (natural science) and philosophy as to how work processes within the mind works. The mind of a person who thinks that humans and our mind is like the apes or like a computer - has no chance in life to understand Kant - ever. And the answer to your question lies within the fact that he himself said - and it is written on his tombstone: Kant's tombstone The quotation from Kant's works used as inscription (in German and Russian) reads: \"Two things fill the mind with always new and ever-increasing admiration and awe, the more often and more intensely the thinking is occupied with it - the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.\" The justice in this World is eternal. As the justice is Eternal - as is God - there will never be an access to this understanding for those minds that are blinded by their own ambitions, their own need to possess and to be more than their fellow humans. Therefor in short and far from the politically correct: to understand the process of knowledge described by Kant and to actually be able to make use of it lies within the humbleness of the person reading.
