But before telling you anything let me ask you a question. What type of freedom are you looking for? And how you thought You\u2019ll be very if you died\u2026 What is freedom? Freedom word looks really cool. But when I began to understand freedom I found it very sophisticated. Trust me And why I\u2019m telling you that in order to understand this you gotta first think about further in your question. What type of freedom?? Freedom from negativity, failure, crime? Even if you aren\u2019t but it seems like Then let me tell the Ans No\u2026.. You will never have freedom after death. You have to understand what will happen to you when you\u2019ll die. Let me tell you You will never die-- This what our bodies die only. The soul will exist even after your death. What would happen to you if you died with the desire for freedom?  You will regret a lot because after your death your problems, worries, thoughts emotions everything will remain the same as they are right now. Believe me, guys. After you die then you\u2019ll even leave your body but still you\u2019ll be more depressed. So please stop thinking like this. Its a balloon of negative thinking that are coming from shiity mood. Few things you should consider doing right now. Start becoming compassionate gentle forgiver with yourself: I know how you feeling right now. Start becoming compassionate with your self. Learn to forgive yourself that how you only be free form all the problems. I hope my answer would've given some insight Thanks for reading\u2014- Denny Enroll ",

            "answer_text": "(Opinion) Freedom would be Nibbana. Or total annihilation (How can you destroy what is?). Your conciousness may be gone, but the mark of your existence will be imprinted forever on earth, even if no one remembers you. The chemical elements that constitute you will return to the closed system of the planet. You were here and you were you, there is no way to erase this. Non-existence (non-being) could be called freedom, but if you never existed, how could you conceptualize freedom? If you were nothing, how could you know there was something? Death is also life. Life is existence. There is no absolute freedom in life, thus there is no absolute freedom in death. *** ",
