            "answer_text": "What are existential questions? Existentialism is a 20th century philosophy concerned with questions about how and whether life has meaning, and why we exist. An existential crisis is a moment at which an individual questions the very foundations of his or her life: whether his or her life has any meaning, purpose or value. An existential threat is a threat to a people\u2019s existence or survival. The word existential is a combination of the two words \"existence\" and \"essence\", and this tells us what an \"existential question\" is: in essence it is a question concerning the essence of what it means to be alive, such as: What is the meaning of life? Nihilism is the philosophical viewpoint that suggests the denial or lack of belief towards the reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Here are some of my existential questions: What\u2019s \tthe meaning of life? If we leave this life without having achieved \tanything, helped others, to make us learn and grow, show us good and \tbad, let us choose who to be and what to do each day while giving us \tmany opportunities to change and be better.Are\twe in control of our lives? We should learn to be mindful and enjoy \tthe present, think before we act and show understanding. We need to \tbe strong enough to be accepting of yourself and others. Free Will?Is the universe finite or infinite? Is our universe \tjust one of the multiple universes?Are\twe alone in the universe? Why have we not been able to find other \tlife forms?How \tdid the sequence of random events create DNA and all the organic chemistry compounds by way of abiogenesis which \tis the slow generation of living organisms from lifeless matter.(the \torigin of life from nonliving matter)?Why are we sentient? We could have been philosophical zombies that are \tindistinguishable from a normal human being except in that it lacks \tconscious experience, qualia, awareness or sentience.Why does what I see in the world have meaning? When I was born, I was just a jumble of organic compounds that had never seen what the \tworld looked like before. How was this picture of the world created for me?When I look out at the night sky, why are we the first and only animals \tthat seem to be aware of our existence? Why are we the ones able to \task what is the meaning of life?How \tis the \u201cself\u201d created by the brain? Why do we need a sense of self?You can do a search on \u201cexistential questions list\u201d and you will receive numerous sites that will give you a list of existential questions. Just too many to list here. ",

The fact we are all communicating, for example, via innovations facilitated by technology, is the result of asking existential questions to peel the onion of knowing. What ever is of probable potential \u2026 of Science or Art invites us to play \u2026 and the play of mind is the stuff of stars. So, might we ask if the Universe we all can explore is our register of presence that arises for by its nature is to be in alignment with it. One may see the existential question as a means to align our acceptations with our expectations to dilute the experiencing of stress, as opposed embracing the harmony of tension that binds us to all things possible be known by consequence. This is not to say we have to bury our self in the dramatic role of omnipresence of omnipotence \u2026 it\u2019s just a license to play until the permit expires. ",
