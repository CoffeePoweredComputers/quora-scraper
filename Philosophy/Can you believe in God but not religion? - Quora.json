            "answer_text": "Certainly. According to many recent demographic polls, in the United States, the number of people who profess no religious affiliation at all is increasing. And, many of them (called by demographers the \u201cnones\u201d) do believe in God. They simply do not actively practice any formal religion. But, there is certainly no requirement to be religious in order to believe in God. For that matter, there is no requirement to believe in God to be religious. There also seems to be a growing interest in spirituality which can be practiced with or without a formal religious setting. So many people who engage in some form of spiritual practice, such as meditation or yoga, do believe in God. The American Architect Frank Lloyd Wright provided a famous response to the question of whether he was religious or believed in God. In an interview with Mike Wallace he said that whereas many people spell God \u201cG-O-D,\u201d he (Wright) put a capital \u201cN\u201d on Nature and called that God. So, there are any number of variations on the question of belief and the question of religious practice. The Dalai Lama once suggested that in an ideal world there would be as many religions as there are people. For many people, religion and the formal practice of it provide a great deal of comfort, community, and spiritual benefits. For others, they receive these benefits in other ways without the formality of religion. Benjamin Franklin once wrote an interesting parable on religious tolerance which seems apropos here: There was once an officer, a worthy man, named Montresor, who was very ill. His parish priest, thinking he would die, advised him to make his peace with God, so that he would be received into Paradise. \u201cI don\u2019t feel much uneasiness on that score,\u201d said Montresor; \u201cfor last night I had a vision which set me entirely at rest.\u201d \u201cWhat vision did you have?\u201d asked the good priest. \u201cI was,\u201d he said, \u201cat the Gate of Paradise with a crowd of people who wanted to enter. And St. Peter asked each of them which religion he belonged to. One answered, \u2018I am a Roman Catholic.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 said St. Peter; \u2018come in and take your place over there among the Catholics.\u2019 Another said he belonged to the Anglican Church. \u2018Very well,\u2019 said St. Peter; \u2018come in and take your place over there among the Anglicans.\u2019 [And so on for many other denominations.] Finally, he asked me what my religion was. \u2018Alas!\u2019 I replied, \u2018unfortunately, poor Jacques Montresor belongs to none at all.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a pity,\u2019 said the Saint. \u2018But enter anyway and take any place you wish.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely, in my opinion. Think of God as sitting in the middle of a forest. You are standing just outside the perimeter. You need to figure out a way to the center. And once you meet the creator, you must be in a position to understand God and divine actions. The idea is to make you capable of connecting with God through your journey. There are many ways to get there. Religion is a well-trodden road that some great explorer laid out.  It looks like a clear easy path. But there are demands. Traditions set by the explorer as per her/his knowledge. Some conditions that you must follow to progress on the path. Obstacles will stand like pieces of puzzle in front of you and test you. They will say: \u2018Follow this practice or else hitherto shall thou come, but no further.\u2019 Some of these tests make you stronger and a better person. But some are plain deceitful. They threaten you with the stick of divine retribution and add nothing to your journey. Over the time, the latter type of roadblocks have increased in number. In the current age have far too many distractions from this path to God, so we take longer to get there. The fear of not being able to complete our journey makes us respect these superficial tests. Religions are not as pristine as they used to be. They now come with strings attached. Then there are paths like these:  These are not easy. You have to make your own way. You fall, you get up, you think of God who\u2019s always there with you. These struggles are real. They are your struggles. Through your perseverance, you adapt some practices that work for you. These are your traditions. Often, these might be the same practices that people on the religious path took. But you agree another person may not face the same hurdles because everyone\u2019s spiritual journey is different. If you follow the second path, are you an atheist? No. You believe in God. You see the mechanisms of divine all around you. You understand the reason behind the pain you suffer. You might even have a greater insight into God than the wayfarers on religious paths. But you chose a different path, a different institution to reach God. So you don\u2019t believe in the religions propagated by the famous explorers. You don\u2019t believe the tests set by someone else. *All roads lead to God. That\u2019s the truth and beauty of existence. If you are determined, strong and adventurous enough to carve your own path, you will find God at the end of it, regardless of adherence to any religion. *Update: All roads lead to God, if you believe in God that is. Atheists, I understand, believe in a certain set of moral principles and humane logic which guide them on through life. So when in doubt you come back to these principles. Believers flock back to God in the same way. We are simply discussing the need for the institution of religion as a pre-requisite to believing in God here. This answer doesn't pit atheism with theism. Honestly, I have dabbled in both. My decisions are based on logic and humane considerations too. But in my worst moments, I do pray inwardly. So it would be hypocritical of me to call myself an Atheist. I wasn't taught that my Gods are punitive. So I feel no stigma attached to calling myself a theist either. But I acknowledge this might not be the case for everyone. Image Courtesy: Stock photos, royalty-free images & video clips A Clear But Foggy Path ",

            "answer_text": "Can you believe in friendship without conversation? In progress without organization? Relationship with God is absolutely the only place in life that we even consider such a question. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cCan I believe in God without having to participate in anything He does or have to be excessively bothered by Him? Anything we do (at least anything about which we\u2019re serious) involves structure. Video games have rules of engagement. Gaming clusters have rules of conduct. If we go out sailing , surfing, playing baseball, all of these things have rules, conventions, relationships. If we want to improve at them, we learn to follow\u2014and mature into wanting to follow\u2014these. Otherwise, we\u2019ll never get anywhere with them. I have found tat people who try to oppose \u201creligion\u201d and \u201crelationship\u201d don\u2019t really understand what they\u2019re saying. They equate \u201creligion\u201d with a collection of empty observances that are without life. But that isn\u2019t religion. The word they\u2019re looking for is accidie, (OX-ee-DEE), just sort of a going-through-the-numbers coasting. Religion, real religion, is Spirit-filled and vital. It is an adventure of growth in Christ. Religion is not opposed to relationship with God\u2014it\u2019s what defines it. You can certainly \u201cbelieve in God.\u201d You can believe that water is wet. But unless you jump in and learn to swim, it won\u2019t do you any good. It\u2019s the act of commitment to Christ that puts you in touch with the Grace by which we are saved. And commitment is not merely believing the water is wet: it\u2019s learning how swimming is done, and growing in the desire\u2014and doing the work\u2014to get ever better at it.

            "answer_text": "YES! Most definitely you can believe in God without religion. When you stop to realize more blood has been spilt over religion than any other issue, it makes you wonder what is really going on. With Christianity in particular, it was \u201cformalized\u201d using savagery and murder to force people to accept a \u201csingular set\u201d of beliefs and practices. That was followed up later in the church\u2019s history with the Christians attempting genocide on the Arabs during the Crusades. I don\u2019t think either of these was in concert with what Christ had in mind and certainly not the message God hoped would be delivered. Religion has been a principal vehicle to manipulate and control people using guilt and fear. This is contrary to the message God has tried to send to the people through numerous examples all over the world (like Christ, Krishna, Buddha, etc.) that love is the most important essence to embody. Does it make sense that there is only one God and so many people saying, \u201cmy way is the ONLY way?\u201d Is it so surprising that so many people feel disillusioned by religion and really isolated from God, to the point that they try to completely give up spiritual practice and exercise? I washed my hands of religion. At times I was estranged from God. But our spiritual nature, the callings of our soul, keeps poking us with questions. And our true separation from God is brief and only exists because we sometimes \u201cbuild walls\u201d in order to turn our back on the truth\u2026at our most basic level we are spiritual\u2026that is our true nature\u2026 and on that level we can \u201cexperience\u201d God to be real and reaching out to each of us in recognition that we are all unique\u2026and on unique journeys aimed at ever elevating love of self, of God, and of others. We do NOT have to have intermediaries who dictate what path we take. There are infinite paths. And your path is unique to you and your unique relationship with God. God gives you \u201cfree will\u201d to discover your true spiritual nature, connect through the pervading energies of unconditional love, and carry the message of this experience as a \u201clight\u201d to the world.

            "answer_text": "Definitely, you can. It depends on who/what you think God is. If you think God is a man in the sky with a long white beard and a golden staff, a jealous and egotistical being who freaks out when you do not worship him or obey \u201chis word,\u201d a vengeful being who cannot wait to condemn you and throw you in \u201chell\u201d for your sins, then by all means go ahead and believe in/adhere to religion.  Surprisingly, most atheists I\u2019ve come across seem to think the above defines God. For some reason, they always fail to look beyond religious definitions of God, and that is probably why they don\u2019t believe there is a God, because they think the idea is absurd, which it is, when you only look at it from a religious perspective. But if you are an out-of-the-box thinker, then you will realize that the definition of God given above is unrealistic, to put it mildly. You will realize that God is far, far, far above what a lot of religions make \u201chim\u201d out to be. You will also realize that we humans at this stage of evolution have a very limited perception of \u201chim.\u201d Personally, I do not subscribe to any religion, but I believe there is a supreme/supernatural being who is behind our existence, call him God or whatever you like. And no, I do not believe that this being cares about our religion, or whether we worship \u201chim\u201d or not. So, there you have it. You can believe in God but not religion. ",

The word I use is awareness. It\u2019s my own; no one ever told me to have it. It\u2019s just there, and has been for as long as I can remember. It was never not there. I don\u2019t come from a religious family and I\u2019ve never been religious myself. I described my awareness to my mother when I was very young, and she said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s God.\u201d I said \u201cOh ok,\u201d and went about the rest of my day. I\u2019d heard the word before, and as with so many other words in those days, I was pleased to have a concept associated with it. All part of a non-religious kid\u2019s learning process. I did make a point of checking out the world\u2019s main religions later on, and found inspiring, sublime, and incredibly beautiful ideas, art, and poetry in every one. Say what you want about religion, it does express the very best in us. If I met someone visiting here from another star and this being asked me, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way for me to learn about humanity?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cStudy our religions. Leave the science, technology, history, philosophy for later. They\u2019re very important, but they won\u2019t make complete sense unless you do this first.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There are some manipulated religion teachings, we do not have to accept all teachings as the true word of God The true religion teachings teach compassion, patience, feeding the hungry, defending the oppressed, self-constraint, forgiveness; those should bring people together and should transform earth into a paradise The manipulated teachings are based on boasting, promote hatred, skepticism, lack of faith and unnecessary conflicts There is only one God who has revealed the same message to all prophets. The same message revealed to the prophets by the same God must be consistent Religions are made bad the way that we twist them Although the core religion teachings guide us to believe in God and to do good deeds to help others, scholars of each religion have distorted some teachings in order to prove that their religion is the only true religion and that they have the only way for salvation. Jewish scholars teach that Jews are the chosen people of God Christian Scholars teach that they are the predestined, the glorified, and the chosen before the creation of the world Muslim Scholars teach that Jews are cursed, Christians are misguided, and that Muslims are the truly guided people All those scholars are mistaken Most of what the Jewish scholars teach are not the true teachings as taught by Moses Most of what the Christian scholars teach are not the true teachings as taught by Jesus Most of what the Muslim scholars teach are not the true teachings of Islam The common ground of religion teachings includes: In obedience and repentance is your salvation, if you obey and do good deeds, you will be blessed, if you disobey you will be lost; that is the clear message. That message is the most consistent message by Moses, confirmed by Jesus and by Islamic teachings It is wrong to say Judaism is the right religion because there are many additions and changes to what God has revealed to Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, etc. It is wrong to say that the current teachings of Christianity are the true religion because most of the current teachings are the attractive teachings which are not consistent with the strict teachings of Jesus. It is wrong to accept all the current teachings of Islam because there are many teachings which contradict the core verses of Qur\u2019an. Prophets did not teach that God has preserved the holy book; they have advised that there will be changes and have warned of such additions and deletions. Amos 8:11-12 teach that People will be thirsty for the true word of God but they will not find it anywhere Psalm 56:5 teaches All day long they twist my words Jeremiah 8:8 teaches the lying pen of the scribes has distorted the word of God Jeremiah 5:30-31 teach that the priests have distorted the religion teachings and that the people love those distorted teachings People are confused by the contradicting teachings, they try to search the internet for the true word of God, but they find many distorted teachings Instead of the consistent and logical teachings like \u2018Do not have two differing measures\u2019, \u2018The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner\u2019, \u2018The foreigner must be treated as your native-born\u2019, \u2018You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born\u2019 in Deuteronomy 25:13-16, Exodus 12:49, Leviticus 19:33-35 , Leviticus 24:22, Numbers 15:15-16, Deuteronomy 24:14-15 The biased scribes have ignored those true teachings and inserted some additions to restrict justice to the \u2018fellow Israelite\u2019, \u2018my people among you\u2019, or \u2018Hebrew men or women\u2019 They do not teach the original teachings anymore; instead, they teach the manipulated teachings like \u201cYou may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite\u201d In Deuteronomy 23:19-20, Exodus 22:25, Deuteronomy 15:1-2, Deuteronomy 15:12 Instead of the true teaching \u2018You shall not murder \u2018in Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17 The scribes who glorify defeating their enemies ignored the true teaching and added some verses to justify the killing like Exodus 23:23, Numbers 31:16-18, Joshua 6:20-21, Judges 15:14-16 and Judges 16:30 Instead of \u2018Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\u2019 in Isaiah 2:4, they have justified atrocities. Instead of the true and most consistent teachings of \u2018blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 in Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 28, Deuteronomy 11:26-28, Deuteronomy 4:40, Deuteronomy 6:24-25, Deuteronomy 7:12-15, and Deuteronomy 8, they teach that God has chosen them regardless of their obedience as in the distorted teachings of Deuteronomy 9:5-6 and Deuteronomy 7:6-8 When Jacob\u2019s descendants wanted to glorify him, they claimed that he wrestled with God and was saved. The verses in Genesis 32:24-30 teach that Jacob was able to wrestle with God; he said to God \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\u201d Instead of the true and strict teachings of Jesus in Matthew 7:21-27, Luke 13:25-27, Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Matthew 25:35-45, Mark 12:28-34, Mark 10:17-19, Matthew 19:16-19, Luke 18:18-20, Luke 6:46-48, John 14:15 and John 14:21 most Christian scholars like to boast and teach the attractive teachings like Romans 8:30, 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Ephesians 2:5, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16, Colossians 2:14 and Ephesians 1:4 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:11 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who do not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teach that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teach that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood. When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Trinity; they have added verses like 1 John 5:7 \u201cFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one\u201d The bible footnotes explain that verse 1 John 5:7 was not in the original old scriptures. The bible footnotes show many other additions in King James Version which were added to support the claims of trinity and which were not in the old scripture; examples are: In I John 4:3 \u2018CHRIST is come in the flesh\u2019 is an addition In Matthew 8:2, 9:18, 15:25, 18:26, 20:20, Mark 5:6 the word \u2018bow down' was changed to \u2018worshiped\u2019. Jesus referred to himself as \u201cson of man\u201d. Jesus was not all-knowledgeable and he prayed to GOD, so this is enough to say that he wasn\u2019t God nor did God come down to earth to be Jesus. Jesus said, \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know You the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.\u201d John 17:3 Jesus said that he does not know everything; he said that only God knows But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father Mark 13:32 Jesus said that he is not equal to God \u201cI can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.\u201d John 5:30 Jesus said, \u201cThe Father is greater than I.\u201d John 14:28 \u201cJesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\u201d John 7:16 Jesus prayed to God as written in Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, John 17:11, Matthew 26:39, Luke 10:21, Luke 22:44 \u201cmy Father and your Father; my God and your God\u201d John 20:17 The disciples did not pray to Jesus, they prayed to the God and Father of Jesus \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d 1 Peter 1:3  The Muslim scholars who justify killing of innocent people are not true Muslims because they do not obey the Qur\u2019an verses like 5:32, 4:90, 2:190, 8:61, 17:33, 25:68 and 6:151 which teach \u2018You shall not kill - God has made life sacred\u2019 The Muslim scholars who teach to kill the unbelievers are mistaken; verse 9:6 is enough proof for their mistakes, because Muslims are supposed to protect the unbelievers and they cannot protect them after killing them The Muslims who justify killing of those who leave Islam are mistaken because they do not obey the Islamic teachings like Qur\u2019an verses 2:256, 16:125 and 18:29 which teach Freedom of Religion The Muslim scholars who justify the killing of the hostages are mistaken; verse 8:70 proves that the hostage is not to be killed, because Muslims are supposed to comfort the hostages and they cannot comfort them after killing them The Muslim scholars who teach that Islam is the only true religion are mistaken; they have been ordered to believe in what has been revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets as taught in Qur\u2019an verse 3:84 The Muslim scholars who teach that the fate of people is determined before they are born and before they have any chance to do good or bad are mistaken; they ignore the basic Qur\u2019an verses like 17:15, 45:15,43:72, 16:35, 19:63, 19:76, 20:112, 34:50, 37:39, 39:41, 39:70, 40:17, 47:17, 55:60, 56:24, 18:107 and 4:147 The verses teach that God does not predestine people\u2019s fate but gives them the choice either to obey and do good deeds or to rebel and do evil deeds; there is no punishment for those who choose to obey and to thank God. Moses warned of the expected turning from the way he has commanded them, in Deuteronomy 31:27-29 he used strong words like \u201cFor I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against God while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!\u201d And \u201cFor I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of God and arouse his anger by what your hands have made\u201d Jesus has warned the priests who spend more time in the houses of widows. In Matthew 23:14 he said \u201cWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation\u201d In Matthew 7:15-20, Jesus warned of the false teachers who mislead people Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves The same teaching is also written in Luke 6:43-44 As Moses and Jesus warned of the false teachers who explain religion to their benefits, the prophet of Islam has also warned of those who ignore the true teachings and teach different teachings \u201cI will say those people are from me. It will be said, 'You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.' Then I will say, 'Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me!\u201d That is recorded in Bukhari 7051 Book 92, Hadith 4 and in Volume 9, Book 88, Hadith 174 The best advice is to follow the common ground of the clear teachings as taught by the prophets. The same message revealed to the prophets by the same God must be consistent, clear and easy for all people regardless of their level of education or experience The common ground of religion teachings includes: If you obey and do good deeds to help others then you will be saved and blessed; if you disobey, you will be lost and cursed; that is the clear message. That message is the most reiterated message by the wise inspired teachers, Moses, confirmed by Jesus and by Islamic teachings How can you validate my claims? The best advice is to ask God to guide us to the truth. The door is open for everyone to experience divine intervention The wise and merciful father keeps his door open for his children God has more wisdom and mercy than any wise merciful father People can communicate with God at any time Prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have urged us to ask God and taught that God answers the prayers of the obedient believer. Example verses are: Psalm 107:28-30, Psalm 18:6, Psalm 145:18, 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 58:9 Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Luke 6:27-28, James 4:2, Qur\u2019an 2:186, Qur\u2019an 40:60 Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. I have spent years wondering about what the purpose of life is. I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. I had some doubts about the teachings of a certain teacher, I have prayed to God to guide me to the truth I saw in a a very clear dream that teacher in a form of a criminal prisoner, has committed evil, waiting for his trial. In another dream I saw a wolf hiding after attacking sheep; I understood that message as the bad teacher who try to mislead people by the bad teachings as Jesus explained in Matthew 7:15-20 \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d. I also remembered the Parable of the Weeds in which Jesus warned us about the enemy who insert false teachings into the scripture in Matthew 13:24-43 \u2018an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat\u2019 Pray and ask God to guide you about the teacher who claims that God does not exist; you will see him in a bad image Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who teaches that Jesus is God Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who claims that God tests us in this life and will reward us according to our obedience and good deeds Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who taught original sin, atonement, salvation not based on obedience but taught free salvation by a savior to die for our sins Again, do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. Isaiah 58:9 \u2018Then you will call, and God will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I\u2019.

This is why I describe myself as a Christian and not as a Catholic (which is what I was raised as), nor as a Baptist (which is the church that I have attended fir several years), nor as a Lutheran (which I was an officer in), nor any of the other denominations I have attended. I apologize if this offends anyone, but I have issues with all of the denominations. Each has beliefs and/or requirements that I think are wrong. Several churches that I have attended have rejected every translation except the King James Version. I love the literary beauty that is the KJV, but I recognize that there are other versions that are clearer and more correct translations. On the flip side I have visited churches that use simplified Bibles. It\u2019s almost as if the leaders of these churches don\u2019t have any confidence in the ability of their flocks to understand the KJV, NIV or other serious translation. Then there are congregations that say that a believer must be baptized to be saved, While we are instructed to be baptized there is a very clear example of baptism not being required for salvation. The thief on the cross beside JESUS. Then there are groups that say you have to speak in tongues. Or, what about snakehandlers? And, then we need to look at those that look down on those that attend services, but aren\u2019t wearing their Sunday Best. Not everyone has good clothing. Then, there are those that are more concerned about the money you contribute.

Some scientists also believe but they can't prove that the way atheists want it proven. I also believe that created species evolve to some extent to adapt and I don't think is by chance, I believe it was designed that way. But I'm not religious. I don't believe the designer spoke to some guys (prophets) whom religion is fueled by, that I must not eat pork, or snakes, that I must pray on a certain day at a certain time facing a certain direction, that I must wear clothes in public even though he did create me covered like he did birds, that he wants westernized women s tits to be covered, but he is Ok with tribal women to walk naked in the Amazon and in most parts of Africa (double standards) . That it ok for those tribal guys to have many wives and me Only one. I don't think the Designer lives or visit the buildings built by TD Jakes, Benni Hinn or any pastor for that matter, or Mosques or any religious buildings. But the designer gave animals instincts to survive, to protect their young, their own, to find food and to avoid danger. We all have these instincts, to us he gave morals too. That's why we frown on any acts that put our survival at risk like, endangering our young, killing members of humanity, spoiling food or water, or anything that cause conflicts like cheating and stealing. . Those who do that should be banned from the tribe, like lions do ",

            "answer_text": "Yes you can! And it definitely applies to someone who asks that question. By asking the question as to whether you may believe in one but not the other - you are in essence differentiating the two. And if there are factors that isolate one from the other, it means they are two different things. Subjects such as \u2018god\u2019 and \u2018religion\u2019 are high subjective ones. So the difference that may exist in the eyes of someone asking such question may not be present for someone else. To me - they are different things. God to me would mean a \u2018being\u2019 or \u2018entity\u2019 that is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent. That is it! The being/entity has those characteristics but they are just there, it\u2019s not using any of the above for any specific purpose. It has them, but that\u2019s it. Religion attributes meaning to that \u2018being\u2019 based solely on their group\u2019s personal belief and values. That being says this is wrong, that is right. That being says doing this is wrong, so we must do that. That being will do this and this if you don\u2019t comply\u2026 etc etc. In short - \u2018god\u2019 is the hardware, \u2018religion\u2019 is the software. However, if you believe in god but not the religion you were born in then IT MUST MEAN you \u2018wrote\u2019 your own \u2018software\u2019. It means you have your own personal beliefs on the idea of a god that isn\u2019t adopted by contemporary religion. Coming up with your own ideas and beliefs about god is just as right as following a religion. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Religion is dogma and generally offer, sometimes covertly, a definition of God. in Christianity God is referred to as He. Why? Where did you get your notion and definition of what exactly God is? why is it to be relied upon? if you glance at other religions and even ohilosophy, ancient and modern, the scope of just how God can be defined comes into view. i am personally fond of the Hindoo and Sufi definitions of God. Everything, literally, everything, is God manifest. All things. to me that is powerful. but that is just one example of a contrasting definition of God. I like it but it doesn't make it correct. There is no correct in the speculation of gods nature or existence. Most people will answer prophecy. that's part of the dominant faiths of today; divine intervention and inspiration. now we refer to people thaf speak to god and hear prophecies as Potentially insane. To me God can not be contained by words of people and concepts of religion. God does not pertain to gender perhaps, is probably not even androgynous. all things said about God including what I just said are merely conjecture. You adhere closer to the truth by admitting that the truth cannot be known. admitting this kind of ignorance in yourself does not diminish the concept of God. If anything if amplifies it and magnifies it. Strengthens it. C S Lewis has a quote I am fond of, and i paraphrase, if you do not have sufficient reasoning for your belief, you don't really believe it. Faith and reason are not divorced or distinctly different. They strengthen each other. I believe deeply that something (God) is responsible for existence. I don't know how and I don't presume to. I realize I can never know that God is real. I can never know that God is not real. Except through my own reasoning and emotional reflection. which is pure subjectivity. I personally believe objectivity to be an illusion. All things filter through a subjective lens, which is your brain. It it feels good to think you know can know cosmology. But its just not possible. There is no greater mystery than how life and the universe originated. and people that offer me magical and hand wavey explanations for cosmology slightly annoy me. Like having a conversation with children, i just reply in ways so as not to upset them or interrupt their little dream. ",

There is a body of thought and teaching, and a body of ritual that both leads and flows from that thought. There is a set of practices which should be informed by that thought. As well as experiences which are interpreted through that thought, even as they influence the thinking. And while I am very convinced of God, and of the goodness of God, I am much less convinced of all my thought about God. Or of the thought structure of my church, even of Christendom. I do believe that when Jesus told us that the Holy Spirit would preserve the church from error, He meant it, but I do not believe that it is preserved at the point of every decision, as my Roman Catholic brethren understand it. I have seen too much to believe that. Instead, I believe that - over time - the errors will be corrected. That we may travel down the \u201cstraight and narrow\u201d path something like a drunk weaving from the ditch on the left to the ditch on the right, but -thanks be to the grace of God- he provides for us a corrective in time\u2026 and so we get on down the road. I believe that the Church - whether in the universal church (which is what \u201cCatholic\u201d means) or my own part of that, my own congregation, my own fellowship of friends, and even myself - have made many errors, and continue to make many errors. That we have likewise been restored from error and the God intends to correct us more. And that He (the \u201cauthor and finisher of our faith\u201d) will bring us safely home at last. To this end, I continually try to hold much firmer to God than to any of my ideas about God. I believe in God much more firmly than I do in \u201cmy religion.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely no! A Religion comprises of a Creator, a Supreme Being. This is a matter of belief and common sense. We cannot judge the taste of a fruit without tasting it and comparing it with other fruits that are available to us. Same goes with all the Religions on Earth. Some are fake, some are man-made, some have been changed and contradicted with. In my persective, Hinduism cannot be called a Religion because animals that are inferior to Humans cannot be in any way called God or Gods because a Supreme Being cannot be inferior. The same goes with Buddism, a Man cannot be simply called a God or Supreme Being hence Buddhism also fails in the test of being called a Religion. What do we have left? Islam and Christianity Believing in anything without Knowledge is just utter foolishness, as for Christians their concept of \u201cA Creator\u201d (that is the core of a Religion) is not confirmed. A Creator is the meaning given to a Religion. Without knowing Who is the Creator leads to a great series of Confusions that are found in Christianity. God, Son, Holy Ghost, Holy Son doesn\u2019t Mean and Simplify a Thing. Christianity\u2019s core is not based on Revelation from God, it is based on people who have changed it according to what they wanted to hear in thousands of years. Some changes in the Bible occured due to Political Reasons, some due to Social Non-Acceptance etc. The name \u201cChristianity\u201d is derived from the name of Prophet Jesus (PBUH) [Christ] and followers of [Christ].  Now, Islam! The core of a Religion is the One Supreme Being. In Islam, a Creator, A Superior Intellect, A Supreme Being is defined in the most Unique and True way! Allah means \u201cThe One\u201d and \u201cThe Only Creator\u201d. The Core of Islam is based on Truth, not like any other religions! Allah is self-sufficient ; He is One; He does things beyond the imagination of man. He is like no one and no one is like Him. He is free from family bondage, no one is related to Him. There is no one as creative as Him; He is all-poverful. There is no one as creative as Him; He is the Creator of the universe and galaxies. This is a matter of belief and common sense! Islam is derived from a word \u201cSalema\u201d meaning, Peace, Submission, Obedience and Pure. It\u2019s wordly meaning is Submission to the Will of the Only Creator Allah. A muslim is the one who submits to the Will of the Only most Powerful Creator! Allah! Questions arise in our minds, \u201cHow am i supposed to believe in something that i cannot even see or feel at all?\u201d. Well, when you think closely about why human beings, or, for that matter the whole universe, the creatures, trees, rivers, the sun and the moon, the stars, were all created, you realize that to creats anything there has to be a Creator and there has to be a purpose. A meaningful purpose! Since all these are beyond the control and limited imagination of any human being, there has to be someone who knows all the answers. Someone great, someone knowing all, someone immortal. We muslims call this Supernatural Immortal, the Great and Eternal Allah! Some people failed to change the Prophecies in Bible that indicate the Start of Islamic Era. Habakkuk, 3:3 speaks of God\u2019s Help coming from Te\u2019man and the Holy One (coming) from Paran. The Holy one who, to escape persecution, migrated from Paran (Faran in Arabic) to be received enthusiastically in Madina was none other than Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Makkah is situated in Paran. The incident of the migration of the Prophet and his followers is vividly described in Isaiah 21: 13\u201317. That section also foretold the battle of Badr, in which a few ill-armed faithful miraculously defeated the \u201cmighty\u201d men of Ke\u2019dar, who sought to destroy Islam and intimidate those of their own people who turned to Islam.

He called God \u201cFather\u201d - and earned the wrath of the highest religious leaders of his day. Jesus obviously enjoyed a relationship with God at a level that only incurred the envy and murderous rage of his peers. As a Christian I have so often been told that religion came up with Jesus as a way to keep control of the masses; protagonists of this view totally overlook that religious people conspired to get rid off Jesus and have him killed by the Romans. Religion, ritualised religious public performance with the concommitent jockeying for power and influence, has proven time and again to be be the greatest enemy to genuine faith. If anyone ever had faith in God on earth, it was Jesus. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course you can! However, I\u2019d qualify that by saying that it depends on what you mean by \u201cbelieve.\u201d It doesn\u2019t require an association with any organization to profess a belief in anything. Without trying to be over the top philosophical, theological, or hanging on semantics, the term \u201cbelief\u201d I think, holds more weight in the world of religion. Religion is the integration of belief and action, or at least that\u2019s what it should be. It is a set of beliefs that are founded upon an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s perception God and what He expects of them. This is the tricky part, because many different people, groups, sects, religions, etc profess to believe in God but have different understandings of who He is. I completely get that, I think a lot of people are turned off by organized religion for those reasons: the extremists, the corruption, lack of unity, the hypocrisy, the judgement, and all the other symptoms that accompany any system or institution that is run by a human being. Many people forget that Christ\u2019s own church wasn\u2019t infallible (ie frequent disputes among the disciples and apostles, one of his own apostles betrayed/killed him, same apostle stole, after Christ\u2019s death there were still doctrinal disputes such as on the matter of circumcision) and that is all with the power of God quite evidently present. This is where one must make a distinction, for the sake of spiritual progression, between the words \u201creligion\u201d \u201cgospel\u201d \u201cdoctrine\u201d \u201cspirituality\u201d and \u201cChurch.\u201d So to answer your question succinctly, yes you can believe in God (as far as belief means only acknowledging that He exists) without religion. But then my next question would be: Where do you go from there? I\u2019m sure with 96+ answers you have an idea and get the picture, but if you\u2019d like a perhaps unique perspective on it feel free to comment or pm me. ",

            "answer_text": "Religion involves belief and worship (observable changes or actions in your life in response to your beliefs). You can believe in God in varying degrees. You may believe that he exists, but do not know if he has given any revelations to mankind to direct their worship of him. Or, you may know of such revelations but not follow them. Our beliefs vary in depth and conviction. I can believe, for example, that something someone else says seems to be true, but since I cannot verify it, my belief will match my trust in that person and how valid what they have told me seems, in light of what else I know. For example, the Bible speaks of different kinds of belief. We see in the Bible that even Satan, the great liar and deceiver of man, believes in God. He has been in the very presence of God. He knows more of God than any of us possibly could. Yet his belief does not lead him to change his rebellious ways. He has only an intellectual belief. It changes him in no way. Some people believe that God exists and may even show great interest in learning about him and worshipping him, but the interest dies. They may even appear to be a Christian on the outside, and even believe that they are a Christian, but as the trials and hard times of life come, they fall away. What has happened is that they believed in a god that suited them, and not a god that would not or could not keep them in comfort. The Bible talks of a type of faith, that involves belief and trust to the degree that it survives through the dark times of life and continues to the end. This is \u201csaving\u201d faith and evidence of their spiritual rebirth, that they truly are one of God\u2019s children. So how does one obtain such level of belief? The Bible says we are given that faith by God, and that it is not of ourselves. By nature, we are fallen in sin, separated from a holy God. By nature, we cannot and will not believe in or love the true God. It requires that God\u2019s Spirit transform our hearts. But it\u2019s not a magical or mystical thing. God works it out with things we can see and hear in this world. The Bible says that God does this through the preaching of the gospel that tells us of our sinful nature and calls us to repent and trust in the works of Jesus Christ, who was God in the flesh. He lived among us and perfectly obeyed God\u2019s laws, proving him to be without any sin. Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice\u2014taking himself God\u2019s judgement that we rightly deserve. And he proved that it was effective by rising from the grave. God calls us to turn from our ways and trust in Jesus Christ to be our Lord and our savior. This gospel of salvation will bounce off of the ears of anyone unless God they have been transformed\u2014-reborn, first. So how can we know if we have been transformed? We will feel the heavy guilt of our sins before a holy God, turn from our own ways and trust in Christ. ",

Jesus himself was opposed to those who acted religiously, because it is often prideful, filled with self and a \u201cholier than thou\u201d attitude. Instead, the life of Jesus should be our example. Virtually every religion on earth shows respect to JESUS as great, albeit they also often ignore and deny his claims of diety. Jesus taught us plainly to love our neighbors as ourselves and to repay evil with good - to pray for our enemies, to show mercy and many other undisputed, godly attributes. So, of course, I recommend you consider the claims of Christ in Lee Strobel\u2019s book, A Case for Christ\u2026simply a marvelous work from an investigative journalist who sought to disprove Christ\u2019s claims only to find indisputable evidence. I pray the Lord blesses you as you seek the truth. ",

While a person can comfortably rule out and ignore Yahweh and Allah and \u201cChrist\u201d as all purely the inventions of Homo sapiens, that leaves a lot of possible gods one could chose to believe in for whom there's no evidence and no good reason to NOT believe. The Bible itself, and the Qur\u2019an and Torah/Tanakh \u2014 and all their gods \u2014 and the history and culture of their writing and transmission and translation, scream \u201cman made\u201d and provide good reason and evidence to not \u201cbelieve.\u201d But, it's easy to imagine ID creator gods who, themselves, have no interest in religion or worship or praise, but who don't come with the baggage of the Bible as a reason to not believe. So go ahead and pick one and \u2018believe.\u2019 Maybe that god is interested in the evolution of rational thought and Humanism and doesn't care diddlysquat about religion. The god that seems most likely, and who\u2019s totally explanatory and consistent with the evidence of the cosmos and Earth and human history, is a manic-depressive Asshole with multiple personalities and an imp of perverse. And there's not a shred of evidence that She doesn't exist or that's not Her nature. Call Her \u201cGod\u201d if you like \u2014 and believe. ",

You would perhaps deny that I believe in \u2018God\u2019 (as you choose to define \u2018God\u2019), so my answer would be unacceptable. You\u2019d conclude that I don\u2019t really believe in \u201cGod\u201d, so I don\u2019t really know about \u201cGod but not religion\u201d. Or maybe you\u2019d find it all satisfactory. You\u2019ll have to write out a clear definition of \u201cGod\u201d before anyone can give a clear answer in your terms. For example, it would be very difficult to believe truly in the Christian \u201cGod\u201d without also believing in one of the many Christian \u201creligions\u201d. The only commonly understood way to achieve belief in the Christian \u201cGod\u201d is through beliefs and practices written into the Christian Bible. If the words of Jesus are not followed, it\u2019s hard to claim belief in the Christian \u201cGod\u201d. Some very similar \u201cGod\u201d, but it won\u2019t be the Christian one. There are denominations that try to stay as close as possible to the words of Jesus. By following them, it\u2019s indistinguishable from following that \u201creligion\u201d; and believing in the words makes it practically indistinguishable from believing in the \u201creligion\u201d. But in the eyes of most Christians, most Christian \u201creligions\u201d are not really \u2018true\u2019 (except the one they\u2019re following). Otherwise they\u2019d switch. Unfortunately, it gets complicated without clear definitions, and few have interest in working up a definition of their \u201cGod\u201d. ",

To find truth from thes texts is tough like finding salt in samosa (a snack). Let me share some light. Father of human=Another human. Similarly Father of all souls is one supreme soul/God (v r brothers) called as Shiva Allah Yehovah etc (invisible point of light present in soul/Silence world - Golden reddish region above universe). Souls are immortal, comes down 1by1 from soul world to take birth in earth(then takes rebirth based on actions in last few births). Soul may take birth in different country, religion, gender, community etc in next birth. God sees everyone as soul, not by man made differences such as religion,nation etc. so show respect for all genders, religions etc. soul, like a tiny star, present in the center of the forehead (Pineal gland - invisible to eyes) can experience a connection with god by thoughts is called meditation . a way to remove sin(actions out of lust anger greed attachment ego fear jealousy carelessness laziness hatred). Heaven (1language,1kingdom,1dynasty,1country 330million humans lived here are worshipped in temples but they are also living among us after rebirth) and hell (now Temples are built for humans who did good deeds) comes in cycle in earth. The 1God will show Mercy and give blessings for prayers in any form though. But it will last for 1 or 2 births only. if we remember god as he is, he will remove our sins and we will be blessed for upto 21 births in heaven and almost all the births in earth. The same drama repeats itself as it is. God's soul came to earth &take old body for few hours to share true knowledge. Brahmakumaris. The Holy Quran:24.35.God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. Light upon light! God guides to His Light whom He wills. The Holy bible: John 1:5-9 5 God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. The Holy Bhagvad Gita:Chapter 6\"God is like the light and Maya(sin) is like darkness. Just as darkness does not have the power to engulf light, similarly Maya can never overcome God.\u201d Chapter 12.He is like a divine light.RIG VEDA, 10:48, 5. \"I am God Almighty, I am the Light of the world like the sun. Neither defeat, nor death, can ever approach me. I am the controller of the universe, know me alone as the Creator of all..\" ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and you must: just look at the news today: the Pope is not a Catholic. I know, many people will gasp to hear that the pope might not be a catholic. However, what is a catholic and what is a pope? A pope is a figurehead and the catholic church is the church he is the titular head of. Anything wrong with any of that? Yes, a church is an organisation. That is all. It represents itself and as it has convinced the poor and others to follow it and worship a god through it, it is a large, wealthy and very political organisation. Note the word political \u2026 WARNING BELLS RINGING. Because not all members of the catholic church believe in god, we can conclude that some of them will therefore have their own agenda. That being so, we see theft/corruption via the vatican bank. There is sexual depravity in the ranks of the catholic church. There is also elitism and favouritism. In other words, the church, the religion, represents as much skulduggery as you are likely to find anywhere. Praise a god if you feel the need but do it on your own. No church, no religion can help you since it is mainly concerned with helping itself first and foremost. ",

They/it would get less significant the more I understand, and they/it wouldn\u2019t exist if I knew everything. It is a conundrum I\u2019ve often struggled with. Do you believe that there is some sort of an entity interested in a long-term quid-pro-quo, some entity that specifies purposes to our lives and our universe, a creator so to speak? This entity could be unomniscient, non-conscious, and even non-living. It could just be something that we would call \u201cphysics\u201d in the distant future. For me, this entity assumes a purpose for me, for every other living being in this universe and for the universe itself. These purposes are entirely unimpressive in the large scale of things, but at our scale, these can be pretty damn grandiose[1] [2][3][4][5][6]. For me, this entity gives me the assurance that I need to do my best and give everything I could to a cause higher than myself. This entity is what comes closest to a God to me. I do not know what this God is, why it exists or even if it really does. I guess that makes me a \u201cGod\u201d agnostic. But \u201cGod\u201d atheism would mean I don\u2019t believe that I serve any purpose in this world. That I am not needed. Religion on the other hand has rarely served any purpose to me other than being a great way to meet honest, hard-working people. I see no value in spending time on rituals, practices and recitation of mythical stories. I also see no value in personalizing God (or Gods) either. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to be a hardcore atheist until 2011. I never believed in God, his existence and religion, for as long as I can remember. My family practices Hinduism and they'd often visit Hindu temples, but even as a child, I'd just sit outside doing whatever I could. Thankfully, my parents didn't push me to believe in anything against my will. But, my views changed drastically in 2011. There was a series of issues and problems that I faced. To add icing to the cake, I had a near-death experience and I evaded death by the blink of an eye. And, that period of over 4 years, had a profound effect on me. From being an atheist to being a believer was a very strange and positive journey. For some reason, I started getting attracted to God. Strangely enough, I found religion to be an obstruction instead of being an enabler. Due to my new-found faith and curiosity, I started reading religious texts, irrespective of the religion. What surprised me was that almost every religion has the same basic principles. What surprised me even further was that most of these basic principles were heavily misconstrued by self-proclaimed \u201cGod men\u201d. And, the conclusion that I was able to draw was that religion is only a means to an end. The end is spirituality. The objective of spirituality is to find inner peace. That inner peace leads to self-discovery and ultimately leads one to God. In my opinion, God is a force of nature just like magnetic, electrodynamic, gravitational forces. And, there are as many methods of achieving closeness to God as there are countries in the world. Those methods are religion. However, it's not necessary to practice a religion to achieve spirituality. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is affirmative to this question. I do believe in god but not in the religion. This is a question in belief category so the answer will surely depend upon the basic belief of each person. If i have to define my answer then her it goes- The hypothetical property God has never been in the world to give us a actual sight of him or her but yet the sculptures and old written books preferably claim of its presence as a almighty so there is actually a conflict in this statement itself, IF someone is almighty then why would he or she needs to make partition such as religion. So obviously God hadn\u2019t made any religion, Now religion is a basic property which is there because of the thinking that if a group of people has a certain belief then to destinguish each other from other they need to give them a code of conduct or a method to define them so the cross in christian, the janeu in hindu are just a method to seperate people from each other. The other problem with the religion is that they like to engage themselves with a certain god and interestingly that certain god has a different style of living which is unbelievable because how did you know that? For a second if i consider that you know then what about the prophecy that \u201cEvery human creature has its own identities and its own capacities\u201d? If every creature is different then why it is necessary to bind into living a selected method. This is not the end, Now they define that some religion is better than other so they need to rule over the lower caste and this surely makes differences in society, This is tolerant to a certain limit but according to a belief in india people from lower caste weren\u2019t allowed to sit equal to the upper caste people which still exists; black weren\u2019t thought equal to the white ones and it exists too in some places. Now comes the biggest blockbuster, These so called religious people can kill people for the sake of the rules described in their religion. There was a news which i read that a muslim girl was killed just because she was thought of burning Quran(the religious book of muslims), I said thought not accused which later proved to be wrong, people in india can kill their children just because they dare to love someone outcast. I.S.I.S. is obsessed with their own thinking and want to enforce its rule in this world so that their would be just one thinking and one religion in this world which is I.S.I.S., yes I.S.I.S. itself is a religion now-a-days which has its own preachers and followers. There is a dialogue from the hindi movie OH! MY GOD \u201cdharma ya to aadmi ko bebas banata hai ya criminal\u201d(religion either makes a person helpless or criminal) So god is a giver, almighty, a lover, an acceptor, and on the top of it he or she doesn\u2019t have a religion.

            "answer_text": "A2A- Do you believe in a god but not religion? I believe in God and in religion. Spirituality is the most important part of any religion. In fact, if it were not for spiritually improving our connection to God, religion would be nothing more than a social event. It would be similar to praying words without the thoughts behind those words. We are looking for meaning and substance in order to strengthen our relationship with God. The meaning and substance to strengthen our relationship with God comes from spirituality. Religion can help provide that spirituality. However, spirituality is also the result of seeking serenity, from prayer and meditation, from recognizing who you are, and by doing what is best for your soul, and from performing good works and deeds. In other words, all these other things are far and away what is important. These things are the cake. Showing up/participating in religious services is the icing on the cake. Therefore, the question is, do you need icing on your cake? And the answer is, yes, you do. We have an obligation to our fellow man, our children, and our posterity to believe in God and to publicly profess a belief in God. And that means, choosing a religion that best suits who we are. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe in God but not in any particular religion. I shall tell you, why. All religions talk of God and his Avatars as if the eligibility for anyone to have been a God is simply confined to the matters related to morality only. In India, Hindus project Lord Krishna as God because he delivered a lecture on the moralities to Arjuna. If we think with an open mind, same is true of Jesus Christ. There was a time when everyone thought that we should lead an upright life. So they created religions. The people who created the religions did not know even ABC of biology, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion,physics, botany or any other branch of science or engineering. Does it not surprise you that it did not occur to anyone, whomsoever out of them, that only such a person could have created so many things who ought to have had profound knowledge of every branch of knowledge - of biology to have created so many creatures, of physics to have created so many suns and so many planets which completely balance themselves in the space, never ever having to bother whether they would run out of any fuel to keep on revolving in their orbits, of botany to have created so many types of plants on the earth, of nuclear fission and fusion, of the so called chemistry, thermodynamics, relativity and probably anything you maybe able to think of. I wonder why any religion does not speak about the knowledge God ought to have had about biology, botany, physics and all other branches of science and engineering. to have created so many creatures, so many types of plants and all that exists in the Universe. No human being can ever have so much knowledge as God ought to have had to have created what we call Universe. So to think that God could have come in the form of a human being is just a fancy of the people who wanted that everybody lived peacefully on the earth following some tenets of morality. Each religion developed its own tenets of morality. ",

People do not want the truth (\u201cyou can't handle the truth\u201d) they want \u201ctheir\u201d truth. As in \u201cI was born a (fill in the blank) and I'll die a (fill in the blank) \u201c. So that whatever faith one is born into and raised in becomes a matter of family loyalty, not an honesr search for meaning. The same can be said for atheism or science. These have their own dogmas none may question. Yes science is very similar to religion. Belief or no belief is ultimately a matter of choice. One decides on a belief then gathers evidence to support it. Like shooting arrows into the side of a barn then painting targets around them so all the arrows hit the bulls eye. Scientists cannot challenge the dictates of the elite anymore than a Muslim or Catholic. On the other hand there is true truth. And what ever that true truth is, cannot be decided upon by a show of hands. Either we have a God, or we do not. My belief or lack of it does not change the real fact. Who or what He ( or She or they ) may be is not altered by my gathering a group that agree with me. Personally I firmly believe in the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob, the Holy One of Israel, and Father of Yeshua (Jesus), the Creator of all things and giver of all life and every blessing. But this is not true just because I say so. It is all true because He has said so. He has not left us to grope int the dark. He is not hiding. He msy be found if one really wants to. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No. No is the correct answer if you want to be an arse about things. What is God? When you say the creator of all things then you\u2019re drawing from cultural interpretations of God. Even more so when you add characteristics like being interested in you or having some interaction with your life. You can test this for yourself. When you think of God, did you make any consideration of the God of the oceans, or Gods of love and Gods of earth. Chances are you really didn\u2019t. If your idea matches the concept of God that is predominant or has characteristics of the God of your locality, ie Christian God then you have taken on the claims of the religion. Your whole concept of God exists purely on the claims of that religion. If you\u2019re going to say that your idea of God has some elements of the Christian God but you don\u2019t think this and you don\u2019t think that then you\u2019re just making shit up. You\u2019ve no business to make a claim or even surmise your own flavour of God, you don\u2019t have any special super hero powers that the rest of us don\u2019t have, for example. This brings us to the topic of what is God. Without the major religions we don\u2019t have a concept of God. Even if there was a creator, if that turned out to be some greasy teenager running a super advanced version of the SIMS, would you call that kid God? With all the worship and \u201cooooohhhhhh master\u201d that comes with it? I doubt. Without the claims of religion you have no concept of what to call God. Religion doesn\u2019t claim just to know God, religions make claims as to what constitutes a God in a frequency that becomes normalised in groups. If you was to claim that a God has 54 ears and 12 noses, that doesn\u2019t make a concept of God anyone would recognise. For that you need religion. ",

I've tried switching to other religions by going to church with my friends. Came home one night and showed my dad a new bible I got from this new pastor I just met. He looked at it and looked at me and said, \u201cthis is not a catholic bible. You're not allowed to be a baptist.\u201d And then I invited these church people into our house to talk to me about God and he just disapproved because they weren't catholic\u2026 So now, I'm living on my own and choose to believe in whoever I want and that is God. I don't follow any specific religion. I have strong faith in God and pray to him morning and night. I believe the term is agnostic. ",

Sons of gods, pets of gods, miracles of gods, desires of gods, and Gods\u2019 favorite Netflix shows~~we can conclude those stories are 100% bullshit.

Non denomination, just bible teaching believing church. Not man made rules and laws of a religion. Non denomination is where I finally found how to have a relationship with God. My faith is the strongest point of my being. Non denomination leaves you free from all the junk of religions so you can actually worship and find truth without fear of judgement of those around you. If you don't desire going to a church building it doesn't prevent you from your relationship with God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit. Just follow the New Testament in your bible. If you feel you need extra help I highly recomend books by Kenneth Hagin. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes you can. Even the Jesus of the New Testament did not exhort people to adhere to one religion or another, but instead to simply find God. An analogy might be to picture God at the top of a mountain with many paths leading to the summit. It matters not which path you take to get there, just get to the top. It is also helpful not to picture God as some arbitrary figure sitting on a throne somewhere doling out reward and punishment. Viewed instead as the source of infinite Divine Energy (Love) the path to God becomes our own heart as we are an extension of Divine Energy. Many references in the Bible even refer to finding God within; not without. When we practice Love in all actions, words and intentions we are co-creators with God through acts of forgiveness, compassion and patience. Religion can certainly be helpful if you find one that speaks to your spiritual needs and provides an \u201cextended family\u201d to commune with. Ultimately, seeking your answers from within and being in tune with your \u201ctrue self\u201d (a Spiritual Being comprised of infinite Source Energy temporarily existing in a physical state) is the path to understanding what we refer to as God and finding happiness and contentment.

Simpleton said actually I started becoming very quiet and started asking myself within about the existing of the God and one day God did come in my dream and told me to ask any question. I asked him the same question how can I enter the church to find you, dear God. Dear God told me never go to the church because I am also trying to enter that church from so many years. They are not letting me enter it. I would believe God here. ",

I do it all the time and if asked what my religion is, I say God. One who can believe in God, can become spiritually aware to know the Life within themselves as God and then they have the faith in God. It is not something that can be explained to anyone, even to those who know about it. Those who know about it can understand the experience as spiritual awareness but those who don\u2019t know about it call it something else because of limited, material-realm awareness. They think they can explain it away for those who are spiritually aware and don\u2019t seem to realize that spiritual awareness includes the limited, material-realm awareness. ",

Philosophy and science have proved that there\u2019s nothing but bland space and celestial bodies outside earth. Thus, we\u2019ve seen that the religious pictures of God sitting on a throne outside earth is fallacious. Religion was created by man to guide others into truth. It has a lot of advantages, but still most of their doctrines miss out many things. We should remember that the ancients had a wrong idea of how the universe operated, so they were many myths in their perceptions. Natural laws (like gravity, season changes, motion, etc) were attributed to different gods. The ultimate religion is that of humanitarianism. Being a good neighbor and respecting the laws (as long as they\u2019re reasonable). The thought that performing certain rituals is the ultimate end is a great error. The only ritual required is that of kindness. Every reasonable being, even the most militant atheist believes in a God whatever they call it - Big bang, Spirit, Elements, Cell, Unmoved Mover\u2026 We all have our perceptions of God, especially as we ponder over the cause of existence. This is what we attribute as God. ",

I am sick and tired of the narrow mindedness of many religious folk, I tell you. Definitely there is one or two major religions that have some serious problems. Something is just off there. Besides, they will not tell me what to think, to believe. I will decide. Mark Twain said, \u201cIt is good that we have one true religion. But there are so many of them!\u201d It took some work, but, in time, I got to where I am. I read the Celestine Prophecy and many of Neale Donald Walsch\u2019s Conversations with God books, among others. The basic premise of the first book, as I saw it, is that there are no coincidences. I will, if you will pardon the word, testify to that. The CWG books can be summed up in a phrase. \u201cGod is Love.\u201d Then I add, \u201cEnd of sentence, end of paragraph, end of chapter, and end of book. There were a lot of \u201cWOW! Wait a minute!\u201d moments, I assure you. One of the things I like, that matches with my beliefs, is that all religions/beliefs are okay and basically the same. Most major religions do have their equivalent of the Golden Rule. His idea of God made a lot of sense to me. Our problem is God\u2019s gift to us, free will. ",

            "answer_text": " Can we believe in god but not in religion? What actually is god?  What we call god is actually the seven stage muscle tone based default human thinking mechanism that converts our ideas automatically into actions with reliability and efficiency.  Gods of religions don\u2019t use all the seven stages of thinking. The only exception to this rule is the Hindu supreme god Brahman. What is the difference between Brahman and other gods? Brahman automatically detects and solves all problems of life making any worship necessary. No doubt, Brahman has no idol, rituals, beliefs or mythologies. Thus, a Hindu, whose god is Brahman, is outwardly indistinguishable from a Non believer. To make a god of a religion one or more stages of thinking are removed.  Thus, in Genesis God uses just the first five stages  In Exodus It is second to firth stages.  Christianity uses first six stages. Thus, gods of religions modifies our thinking in a unique way.  This modification of our thoughts symbolizes creation by god. If we can somehow add the remaining stages then we would be immune to the rules of the society we live. We will also be immune to the rules of the society if we ignore god and lead a life based on Reasoning. How would our society ensure that we are not using the remaining stages or ignoring god?  If we ignore Rituals and festivals associated with imporant events in our religion then the society will know that we are ignoring god. Thus, if we know god in its complete form we can have a god without being religious. We can live comfortably with people of all relgions. However, it is far more difficult than following a few simple rituals on some days of the year. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe you can. A lot of the time \u201creligion\u201d as you so well note, is the \u201cskeleton of the Truth\u201d that has been instituted by men who have made a \u201cthing\u201d out of a whole lot of rituals and called it faith in God. This is in deed unfortunate because unfortunately it promotes a lie or rather a deception, based on a truth, that then takes out certain things and elevates them instead of God and the result is that people THINK that just because they do those ritualistic things, they are \u201csaved\u201d. We must always go to the Word of God for the Truth because there are many deceiving spirits out there that want to twist and pervert the Truth, but God said HIS Word is Truth! So then we need to realise that not all rituals are necessarily based on the Truth. For instance .. nowhere does it tell people to demonstrate their faith by praying in front of others \u201con street corners \u201d (like the Pharisees) (in fact the Word tells us not to do so!) Nowhere in the Word does it tell us to make an idol image and worship it or light candles to such images. But we ARE told that there is salvation by no other Name than the Name of Jesus and that Jesus is the way the Truth and the Life and that no man can come to the Father except through Jesus ! We are also told that there is healing in the Blood of Jesus and that by His stripes (scourgings) we ARE healed. (No where does it tell us to find the Holy Grail and make a fetish out of it. ) So then these are the basic tenets to the faith; We believe in one God and understand that we were sinners who are/were unable to save ourselves (neither by doing good works ).. and that therefore God sent His only begotten Son that WHOSOEVER would believe in Him would be saved .. and that He was crucified for our iniquities ( sins and trespasses) died and was buried and rose to eternal life after three days and ascended to God where He is seated at the right hand of the Father. We believe in the Trinity =Father .. Son .. and Holy Spirit and that Jesus was the Word made flesh and that He is both fully God (born of the seed of God through His Holy Spirit ) and that He was also fully man having been born of a woman. My Pastors always say \u201cIf in doubt .. go back to the Word.\u201d What is also true is that we need to realise that not everyone who goes to church is actually a convert or , (if rather), a believer. Conversely it could be said that \u201cChristians go to church but not all who go to church are Christians\u201d. Even a Buddhist or a Hindu or even for that matter satan himself can go to church. (In fact we have a saying that one guy who never misses church is satan!! Thats how he knows how best to hurt believers and how to devise strategies to twist the Word .. \u201creligion\u201d being one of them!! ) Religion cuts out the free move of the Holy Spirit and therefore actually robs people of what may be their only chance of salvation!! The trouble with \u201creligion\u201d is that God dosnt support it because it is \u201cpretty\u201d and eases people into a comfort zone and leaves them as sinners \u201cevery man entitled to his beliefs\u201d .. but when they die they are not saved because the Truth has not been preached to them and that then is why you will find that religion continues.. I could go into more detail but i think you get the message. ",

            "answer_text": "We can believe virtually anything if we extrapolate the information on the subject to our satisfaction. Belief is our current position and is fluid. Throughout our lives, we gradually dismiss beliefs we once held. Interestingly, the easiest way to demonstrate this is what we believed in terms of our culture\u2019s folklore, often perpetuated by well-meaning parents and family. Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Boogie Man are all myths created to elicit some kind of control over the believer: being naughty equals no presents from Santa, refusing to pull a loose tooth equals no reward from a fairy, being a \u201cbad girl or boy\u201d means the Boogie Man will come for you, etc. These are sufficient for a childish mind but ridiculous to an adult. That is what makes it fascinating to me when adults cling to the belief in one other mythical being; God. The concept fits perfectly into the behavior/reward/punishment system most of us grew up with, yet many of us cannot relegate it as we did our childhood myths. So in answer to the question, yes, of course, you can. You can also believe that God is an alien from another solar system whose advanced technology makes it unfathomable to us. You can believe that everyone on the planed is wrong and you are right on almost any topic. The permutations of belief are as endless as the number of ideas a human brain can generate - none of which would make any of them true. ",

            "answer_text": "I tend to classify the philosophy of God or the Superpower as follows:     God comes above all and religion is one of the ways to approach him based on a framework experienced by prominent Saints/ true followers that was faithfully recorded/ transferred to the younger generation. This is subject to change depending on the time lapse and changed circumstances but certain religions are too orthodox to entertain such changes. Depending on their environment of living, people collectively devised their own rules and regulations and social norms to worship God abiding to the religious framework. This definitely need not be uniform and could be extremely variable. This again was subjected to change because human race started moving from place to place in search of livelihood and that introduced more anomalies in the practices and beliefs. Above all, countries were administered by different religious rulers that added more complexity. The problem is that the regulations and norms became a sort of unwritten commandments over a period of time. There were self appointed/ socially empowered cultural guardians and leaders who started to take advantage of this system. Rituals and norms that were peculiar to local belief systems were made mandatory. This created social discrimination that we are currently experiencing. To reach God you do not have to embrace any of the above. This is where some people go out of the society and communities to be aloof so that they can have single minded pursuit of God or to get self-realization by soul searching. There are also people who cared for human values and served the society with unconditional love adhering to their religion but their pursuit was pure unconditional love and empathy with the suffering people. Sometimes they have even openly challenged the religion and social norms. Such people also have the virtue to become noble souls. ",

Religion is the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods. Many people believe in God but do not belong to any organised religion. At the moment I\u2019d claim membership in that group although I also identify as Christian and also will claim being Catholic but the latter is questionable since my attendance at mass ended several years ago. I reserve the right to return and recognize that there are many benefits to regular church attendance. You will find atheists incorrectly claiming such persons as myself being one of them since we are not church going. Whether this is willful deception or just wishful thinking on their part is debatable, what\u2019s not is that they are very wrong. ",

Not believing that the god is superhiman would defeat the point of them being a god, so that one wouldn't make sense. (They must be greater than us mere mortals.) Believing in a god that you do not worship is certainly possible. Think Satan; a Christian would believe Satan is real but not worship him. Finally, believing in a god that does not control anything is actually called Deism. The belief that there is a creator but that creator does not interfere with the goings-on of earth at all. So unless you have a different definition of religion, it seems that there are two cases in which you can indeed believe in a god without believing in religion. ",

Spirituality is merely a belief in, well, the spiritual, whatever that may mean to you, be it God, ghosts, magyk, The Force, whatever. Religion is spirituality expressed in terms of community; it drives those who share beliefs and spiritual aspirations together, for purposes of support, discussion, or just socializing in a shared space. It is but one of many avenues for the expression of the spiritual, founded on interaction with others. Is belief in God commonly associated with the major Abrahamic faiths? Yes. But belief in Him is by no means restricted to those within those communities. God, being a spiritual presence, and something (or, one?) that supposedly transcends human perceptions, should have no business restricting the worship of Him to only those who identify one way or another. To quote one of the wisest people I have ever met, \u201cSpirituality gives you the pen and paper. It's up to you to make the best artwork you can out of it.\u201d ",

You might create some private rituals for your idea of this idea of \u201cGod\u201d, but they wouldn\u2019t comprise a religion because there would be no institutionalized worship, dogma, or hierarchy. Religion itself is a man-made structure (the adherents of which claim it\u2019s backed by \u201cGod\u2019s Will\u201d) that serves primarily as a way for men who shy away from open warfare and rough and tumble politics to be able to gain power over others anyway, often without doing much of anything but wear the outfit. In Europe up until very recently, it was common for \u201caristocratic\u201d families to save their title for the eldest son, and send the second son into the military with an Officer\u2019s commission or earmark him for the priesthood. Anything to avoid an honest day\u2019s work; authority without effort (and often without any personal qualification whatever). What else could aristocracy possibly be good for? Modern people in relatively democratic nations who see through religions in this light often walk out of institutionalized religion but retain a private respect for the conception of \u201cGod\u201d that they learned there, only on their own personal terms.

To generalize, in duress, it happens that avowed atheists will appeal to (a) higher power(s) to get them out of their situation. If not belief exactly, it is an example in hope there is a supreme being to save them. Again, no religion but some belif. Finally, animism practiced by remote groups of people might be considered belief in God/supernatural without the level of codification to rise to caling it religion.

            "answer_text": "Preferred to add a new view point that top answers did not have. Also i went through the same dilemma multiple times. Religion meaning as per wiki \"the term religio originally meant an obligation to the gods, something expected by them from human beings\u201d But Sanata Dharma [aka Hinduism] focuses on \u201cDharma\u201d or constitutional position [ground zero or nature] of soul. Where as paths /religion are merely ways for individual to realize [Karma, Jnana, Bhakti, Dhyana] . So there 4 types of religion only. But the final instruction from God was \u201cGive up all varieties of religion [dharma] and surrender[out of love not out of fear] to me\u201d . If you think there is God, then you will start asking what his characteristics are, what he does, why he does. Based on your sincerity of search [4 types of people come to God - distressed, need of wealth, curious, knowledged. You will be 3rd type] , the God opens the gate of realization and you will start seeing things around you with difference and you will soon reach a point of satisfaction of your understanding. Then you will start wondering the final goal. Ofcourse, Human being always looking for love, but in wrong place and person. You will realize that no one loves you or loved you like God so, you will start adhering to one of the 4 religion. There are issues with all organizations. They used religion as tool as most people trusts and follow it. Moment everyone become atheists, the cheaters will continue to use Atheism as a tool to cheat people. The process remains same - only the tool changes [TamilNadu in India a great example of how atheists group cheat people]. Tell me which non-religious organization is not corrupt ? Police, Justice , Education, HealthCare, Insurance\u2026 You never got out of it just because it is corrupt. The best solution is come to your own conclusion of God or simply choose from one. Find right person near you who has done great amount of practice and does not yield to any worldly pleasures. Learn from him. This is a terrible task as we have probably 100+ persons in the whole world and not many of them live near us. ",

Actually that's the real deal, the Bible says you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and you will be saved. Religion is there to guide you but it's not what saves you, the Bible says the law was the school master that guided you to Christ, but now that he is come, the law is needed not anymore. Guess who taught us about the law, religion. But Jesus takes it further and says when the spirit is come, he will guide you in all truth because he speaks not of himself but whatsoever he hears of the father. Then it's climaxed in the book of Corinthians where Paul mentions that we all with unveiled faces beholding the image of God as in a mirror are being transformed from glory to glory. This means you ceased to deal with God through a middleman called religion. Religion had placed a veil on you, you could see in part and not in full, but now that you are unveiled, you have your fellowship with God directly by his Spirit. ",

The impression is religion is a man made organisation or system with rituals traditions requiring people to follow to get benefits. And to me believing is not only believing in something with mind. Believing God is not only believing the existence of God. A lot of people believe the existence of God, the bible says the devil believes in the existence of God obviously but trembling. Believing in God means also believing and follow the teachings of God. That is to do the greatest commission, carry one\u2019s cross, deny oneself and be a sacrifice of God. To be renewed by the Holy Spirit and be a new person, etc. And joining a church to be a part of the church is one of the teachings from God. ",

When Luther rejected Catholicism, he did not lose faith or do so because he had lost faith; what he rejected were the rituals, practices and interpretations of that faith. Hence why his faith is called Protestantism but is still the same Christian faith; just another view of it which in turn became a new religion; a new institution of faith. There are also a lot of practicing Christians (and in other religions) going through the trappings and rituals but in fact not believing any of it. They do so often because of social pressure, not out of conviction. Here in Quebec, the vast majority of people do not attend religious rituals; yet, although officially a secular society, a good number still refers to themselves as Christians, if not as Catholics even; they do believe in a higher power but do not go through any type of ritualistic practice. And others still go to church but only as a social activity, not because they have faith. Faith and religion can exist separately for any given individual.. ",

Then it evolves a self replication and expansion strategy that seeks to keep the religion alive. It isn't a necessity, the building and service, the just religious parts.

The Roman Catholic Chruch, Islam, Judaism and all the others are made by man. If God created these religions then why did ancient people practice different beliefs. Makes sense does it? Religiom teaches you according ro its doctrime and practices and blindly tells you to just believe in God and dont question the Heads of the religions (e.g. Fathers, Imams, Rabbis.). This doesnt emphasize on God and your personal belief. In other words, Religion is like a government on beliefs. In conclusion, your belief is your right. Not for others to judge or choose for you. So simply, you can believe in God without belonging to any religion because no religion can prove or disprove God\u2019s existence. Hopes this helps out! ",

As a complete side note, which takes or adds nothing to my preceding discussion, almost exactly a year ago today, i had an unexpected massive GI bleed, was taken by shock trauma to UMMC, was resuscitated, given 14 units of blood, and recovered, to a large extant. I had had a spiritual experience, at least let's say I believe I did. I had to recite no dogma, no creed, no mantra, or anything else as I entered the other, bright side. THIS just reaffirmed my preceding belief. The experience profoundly changed me, and all for the better.

            "answer_text": "If by religion you mean formal or organized religion, yes. The two concepts are not necessarily linked. The concept of having a belief in god while eschewing formal or organized religion grew after the Enlightenment, as the concepts of individual liberty and personal conscience challenged authoritarian religious dogma. The distinction is probably as old as religion itself, though as far as evidence for early religious beliefs most has to do with public ritual and religious practice. It appears formal or organized religion was a unifying factor in many early societies, though belief in specific deities was probably preceded by ritualistic behaviors not necessarily connected with divinity. The first written evidence of religion was from Sumer in Mesopotamia and dates about 5,500 years ago. However judging by archeological finds at burial sites and the discovery of talismans and statues in excavated settlements, ritualistic behavior and collective religious beliefs seemed to have arisen in the first part of the Upper Paleolithic period, though some think it could have been earlier and even practiced by other hominids In my opinion, most likely there have always been individuals who have sought their own connection with what they considered to be divine or sacred, apart from public ritual or collective affirmation. Some accept and enjoy collective ritual and public affirmation while others prefer solo contemplation. ",

To give an identity for their methods and the group they belong a name was accepted. The other groups had their different guide lines chose different names for their groups and the moderators slowly took the stance as preachers. That is how religions came into their heridage.

Find Bible, either printed or online, if you\u2019ve never read it ask someone who can help. Open at Revelation 17, verses 1 and 2. The religion is being compared to a prostitute, who prostitutes herself with the kings [or rulers, presidents if you like] of the world and is guilty in bloodshed of many nations. Is that not true? Keep reading, in chapter 18 of Revelation God pronounces judgement over this prostitute. Revelation is written in a way as if these things have already happened. Because God is so sure and so capable to do this, consider it done. ",

Keep in mind making Jesus Lord of your life means you do everything for Jesus and for the glory of God. While religion tends to have alot of ritual and tradition following Jesus should be very personal but in order to be the best follower of Jesus you can be you must surround yourself with other believers that will support you, build you up, and most importantly hold you accountable. For alot of of people me included that means finding a church filled with other people on fire for Jesus. Some of us say \u201creligious people suck but Jesus followers are awesome.\u201d Remember Jesus loves you and will meet you where ever your are but once you give yourself to Him and make Him Lord of your life you will change for the better.

He has lived only 2000 years plus ago only forty years after the Roman Colosseum which still stands to this day. Our very Almanac 2017 is based upon the life of this man who some people think is a myth. But he gave everyone no reason to not believe, and yet people create their own religions out of pride, they want it to be about their race or about what they believe. Some people kill others if they don't believe what they believe ,or if they say that the book that they read is from Satan. That is not God that is their own pride ,and they will be punished for, it so yes you can believe in God without religion ",

Religion is generally accepted as Man\u2019s attempt to define or find God or some higher spiritual order, or a set of beliefs. The term can be broadly applied to many viewpoints, even those that do not necessarily include or define God. God, as the Creator of the universe and the all-knowing, ever-present, all-powerful Alpha and Omega, exists irrespective of any belief system we may create. If you observe the natural wold and realize that there is and must be an intelligent design, and therefore a Designer, it makes sense to believe that the Designer, God, exists. As a comparison, Christianity does not define itself as a religion (even though non-Christians may use that term). Christianity is a relationship with God, through His Son, Jesus. It is not a belief-system created by Man, but a relationship initiated by God Himself. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can. The existence of God does not entail the truth of any particular religion. For example, God could be real but have no interactions with humans ever. God could be real and Jesus could have not died on the cross and risen from the dead. God could be real and could have never spoken to Moses. God could be real and could have never spoken to Muhammad. God could be real and could detest any form of religion. The list goes on. All of the former scenarios are logically possible, albeit not necessarily true scenarios. God, taken independently, does not necessitate that there be a true religion. Thus, one can believe in God without believing in religion. ",

Everything we believe about the world around us is filtered through this lens, whether you\u2019re a child, a devout Muslim, a newly-converted Christian, or a die-hard atheist. We build our perception of the world around us based on already-existing beliefs concerning that which we cannot see or measure. Now if you\u2019re asking whether one can believe in God but reject the benefits/practicality/need of organized religion, the answer is absolutely. As a Christian, though, I would point out that the New Testament constantly commands believers to gather regularly for prayer, worship, studying, and encouragement. ",

Technically, belief in a God makes you a theist. Theism itself is not a religion, however - some religions are defined as \u201ctheistic\u201d (belief in a god), with more emphasis on the number of Gods involved (monotheistic meaning belief in one God, polytheistic meaning belief in a plurality of gods).

Can You get a degree,medal from a renounced university of the world just by getting admission ,but not taking classes and not taking exams? No,not at all. The real purpose of believing in some religion means you will completely enter in the ties of the religion not by only just believing.Believing in ALLAH means that you accept it from heart that there is one and only one power ,and that you will abide by the rules specified by tALLAH .....But if you just believe in ALLAH and not in his way of life,which is the very best..it is quite unfair to you and your faith.Your faith is incomplete without \u201c Practice\u201d. All the things which are prohibited are just because those things are harmful to you. E.g: Alcohol is forbidden in a religion,we are quite aware of the fact that it is harmful to our memory,stomach,health.If we are believing in the religion but still not practicing,it is useless to. SO only believing is incompl eye faith,so nourish the soul by practicing the way of life your religion teaches you. #MyOp ",

However, religion is still beneficial, because we have various levels of understanding, culture and enlightenment, which religion entails and it equally buffets many folks against sway to trending distractions. More-so, religion serves as effective channels of fraternity and common values. A source is always an easier vehicle for transportation to our destination, which religion serves.

However, when you capitalize God, you refer to a specific deity that humans associate with specific religious beliefs and rituals. For most people in the Western world, God is the deity of the Abrahamic religions. For people who adhere to any of the non-Abrahamic religons, God is something else. So, can a person believe in God and not religion? Probably not. It seems incongruous to believe in the deity of a specific religion and not believe in the religion associated with that deity. ",

You can also believe in a personal god, one that has less clear, specific rules as a god of religion. For example, you could believe that god simply wants you to be a good person, and that in the end, we either all die or we all go to the same afterlife.

But, you will have had more fun along the way.

Any conception of God is going to be sourced from a religion. If that is the case, then all you are doing is arbitrarily picking and choosing aspects of a religion to adhere and not adhere for reasons. Where does that come from and how do you really do that? You can\u2019t, at least not consistently or rationally do so. Basically, you end up making up your own religion. Bear in mind the role of religion. Conceptually, the existence of a God and religion are severable concepts. However, religion answers the question why and how. It is one thing to believe in the existence of God, but religion explains why God and us are here, and how we are to interact with the deity. The mere belief in God is an empty belief. So, you believe in God, great\u2026now what? That is where religion comes in. ",

By any reasonable definition of \u201cgod\u201d, this aspect of reality is god. But we also know it is fundamentally unknowable and unable to communicate with us in any way. If it could, it could communicate the identity of indistinguishable particles and everything from thermodynamics to certain types of nuclear decay would be behave differently, and we would all die due to the shift in the laws of physics that would entail. So we know that the god that actually exists, that we can discover through the careful study of the universe that god actually made without any human intervention, must not be the god spoken of by any human scripture, which all depend on the person writing them claiming an internal knowledge of god that is provably impossible. So only by rejecting all scripture-based religion\u2014which is to say, all religion\u2014can we come to know god. ",

American Founding Fathers, or Framers of the Constitution, who were especially noted for being influenced by such philosophy include Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Cornelius Harnett, Gouverneur Morris, and Hugh Williamson. Their political speeches show distinct deistic influence.[citation needed] Other notable Founding Fathers may have been more directly deist. These include James Madison, possibly Alexander Hamilton, Ethan Allen,[46] and Thomas Paine (who published The Age of Reason, a treatise that helped to popularize deism throughout the United States and Europe).\u201d ",

In india there are so many religions and people are caught in myths. If you ask one question that whether human came first or religion came first? Oviously the answer is human came first. No body has seen god and those who tell you about god they are just lying and nothing. If you are working for humanity then you are god. People start worshiping you. ",

            "answer_text": "As for Hegel, the representations of divinity are in itself defining for religion. Religion is a relation to something absolute: a religion can be false, or inadequate on this matter. For example, to take a isolated tree as something absolute, a god. In another sense, its possible to resume the believes, and take the better part of a religion. For example, for the catholicism faith, wisdom, love and charity under the sign of God are the essential point : Christ is the result of that, but also the symbol what increases it, because shows the possibility and trueness of this faith. However is really important to understand that a religion is inclined to be a system, and as such it should be taken integrally. Muslims who think they take the better part of Islam while they set piece as the first thing are not so true muslims as the ones who fight for their god: that is the essential point of their faith on God. Even if the believe in God is something taken from a whole, one cannot escape the fact that the essence of its believe reflects on a practical side, and this one develops itself on religion again\u2026 ",

We follow any religion just to live in a particular way as we think it is a requirement of society, family or people around us . But to believe in God is our personal matter . How I understand Him,how I see Him , in whom I feel Him . This all depends on me totally. A particular religion is just a guide .If we don't have a guide it doesn't mean that we can not feel what is the source and a bond between me and every living being. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I think someone might believe in God and not in organized religion. Face it most organized religions were organized to take advantage of the fact that people believed in God. Early individuals realize that by claiming they could speak for or to God they could gain advantage and power in their community. Other individuals joined them in their scheme and a religious hierarchy was formed. They imposed taxes and duties to those who believed in them. They got wealthy and Powerful and eventually you end up with a large organized religion. That structure has survived to today in many forms, but it has nothing to do with whether the individual believes in God or not, it's just a way to gain wealth and power portraying yourself as someone who speaks to or for God. Some things never change. ",

Greek philosophy found that splitting sciences into special fields would be advantageous but as any scientist at the item knew his way around any science separation to the extent of vast gaps in between was inconceivable. 2500 years later we got exactly that, lots of science and lots of gaps. \u2018I don\u2019t believe anything\u2019 is technically impossible.

As far as Hinduism is concerned, it is a philosophy, science and a way of life. All what matters is a person should abide by righteousness. At the same time I am of the view that all religious teachings should be judged by reason. Religions are guidelines for people to lead a happy life without causing harm to others.i ",

            "answer_text": "Can you reject religion and still believe in God? Sometimes people find that an organized religion or system of worship seems constricting. To me, that does not necessarily mean it is false. It seems to me that if one \u201cbelieves in\u201d God (or some other deity), one would also naturally worship him by attempting to follow his instructions, and by performing acts of veneration we generally term worship. One can become convicted that a certain organized system of worship is hypocritical or misguided, but such conviction can come from a deeper conviction about God and his ways, so that the religion is seen as not true to God; or it could come from a loss of such conviction, so that the religion is seen as ridiculous posturing about nothing. So yes, I think one can reject a \u201creligion\u201d or system of worship and still believe deeply in God. I just think one needs to be careful so that one does not set oneself up as the final arbiter of truth. A God worthy of worship is Truth, and one\u2019s own thoughts and judgements should align with that, even if it is not convenient. ",
