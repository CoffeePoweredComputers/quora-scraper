            "answer_text": "Liberals are playing a long game so we often lose the short games. We think the spirit of the rules is important so are loathe to bend or break them when it is expedient. This is why trolling and sock puppeteering tends to be a conservative thing; I would be so mortified at being caught doing something like that I cringe in shame at just the thought of it, yet every day I see more and more sock puppets on the hands of conservative trolls, and not all of them have Russian accents. I often wonder at what conservatives who are obviously lying about Trump are thinking to themselves. How can you feel you are doing the right thing when you have to lie to make your point? Liberals also are bad at unity, perhaps for the exact same reasons as above. We become so concerned about the purity of our position and the importance of our own narrow concerns that we are unable to compromise when we need to. On the other hand, it means we are far less likely to fall in line and obey a charismatic leader blindly (I can hear conservatives getting heated up about Obama worship, but that was never a thing. He was an admirable man, but I wouldn't lie to protect him from a crime he committed) which is a really good thing in my opinion. But that means getting liberals in line is more difficult than herding cats; say what you will about conservatives, they sure do like lining up dressed in uniforms. Liberals can be annoyingly smug and superior, but so can conservatives. I mean, would you rather be stuck in an elevator with a vegan hippie lecturing you about how meat is murder or a evangelical zealot haranguing you about how fetuses are people? Either way, it's misery. ",

            "answer_text": "def. - Liberalism - a political doctrine that takes \u201cprotecting and enhancing individual freedom\u201d to be the central PROBLEM of politics.\u201d So \u201cliberalism\u201d is considered a CENTRAL PROBLEM, not a solution. If peeps identify as Liberals, then they favor a plethora of individual behaviors that were neatly summarized in the 60s as, \u201cDo your own thing\u201d. That mantra has devolved human behavior for hundreds of millions if not billions of peeps to include the leftwing\u2019s renunciation of the rule of law, in its entirety. The most blatant consequential example has been Andrew Weissmann, scumbag lawyer for liberals. In the last 4 years liberalism has encompassed the creation of laws that were never brought before the people in the form of referendums, or campaigns by political candidates. Like Andrew Weissmann\u2019s stitching together a paragraph of one law that was passed by congress, then another sentence from another law that was previously passed, and another law that was previously passed, and that assemblage is then used to force persons of interest to hire lawyers to defend themselves against a non-existent \u2018law\u2019 that Andy used to prosecute people he presumed \u2018violated\u2019 his \u2018law\u2019. No one is going to accuse Weissmann of being a conservative. He is a democratic hit man rogue lawyer using \u2018liberalism\u2019 to \u201cdo his own thing\u201d. He has been bankrupting those who choose to fight his bogus charges, That he has been repeatedly stopped from this Fascist behavior by the Supreme Court does not stop him from continuing to \u2018do his own thing\u2019 in other cases, as he did in the Enron, Kavanaugh, and Trump railroading. The dangers of Liberalism are the fascists using it to run amok, and not being held accountable for the millions of lives they ruin, illegally. ",
