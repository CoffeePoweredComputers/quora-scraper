            "answer_text": "Lacking an established specification for either consciousness or intelligence; it would be possible to argue on both sides of the question.  The wide selection of theories of consciousness compounds the problem.  Examining the question from a different perspective ask:  Are machines necessarily zombies?  If your definition of an intelligent machine requires it to be conscious, the question is settled.  On the other hand, it seems likely that with a different definition of intelligence, perhaps along the lines of IBM's Watson computer system, a system could be highly intelligent without having the features of self awareness that are pre-requisite for consciousness. Applying that same formulation to human intelligence and consciousness, there are examples of exceptional mental ability which lack self awareness and there are also examples of self aware individuals who lack intelligence.  As a gross generalization, in either case, if either facility were enlarged, it seems plausible the other would also increase.  In that sense, the two facilities are correlated. ",
