            "answer_text": "In what way can art bring out the beauty inside? Art can offer insight to the artists imagination. How cool is that? The choices they make in selecting materials and subject is quite revealing if you are open to really seeing their message. Here is one of my fave paintings by Leonora carrington  I could never have dreamed up such an image. It fuels ideas and questions. Here is another by Dorothea Tanning that I also adore :  It\u2019s so sensitively treated and beautiful and something within the artist that she has managed to reveal to the viewer. Last one is an assemblage by Joseph Cornell:  How\u2019s that for beautiful? Should it stay hidden in someone\u2019s imagination? Obviously these are some of my personal favourites but you will find your own and they will be fascinating and beautiful to you. Enjoy x ",

            "answer_text": "Understanding The crowning glory of the human intellect that makes us better and/or worse than all other life forms is - the imagination. In applied form known as creativity to see the beauty in all things is at our center. Everything most profound emanates from the unconscious, all genius, feeling (both intuitive & emotional) & creativity. Art is the best systematized anything at stimulating all of it in the unconscious. Everything done well or deeply appreciated is a form of Art in some form. ",
