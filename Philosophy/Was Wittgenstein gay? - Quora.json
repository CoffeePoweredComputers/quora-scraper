            "answer_text": "Actually there\u2019s no clear answer. The Bartley controversy arose over the fact that he sought to explain Wittgenstein\u2019s troubled persona by pointing out that Wittgenstein frequently had sex with young rough male prostitutes for the duration of 1 month in the direct aftermath of WW1. But many other serious scholars, most notably Ray Monk, showed how Bartley provided no evidence whatsoever for this claim. It is, therefore, too simplistic to say that his philosophy came forth out of his sexual preference. Wittgenstein is very likely to have been hetero- as well as homosexually aroused at times. But what is often omitted in these discussions was that the idea of sexual arousel itself went diametrically against the type of person he wanted to be. PS: And the whole remark about the so-called \u201ccoded diaries\u201d\u2026 bullshit. There have been coded passages in his diaries (which reveal nothing of the sort of things that Bartley has claimed), but there are no coded diaries that elaborately deal with Wittgenstein\u2019s homosexuality.

Also, Wittgenstein dedicated his only published work, Tractatus to Pinsent. In a reply to a letter by Ellen Pinsent announcing the death of David Pinsent in an airplane crash, Wittgenstein writes_ \u201cDavid was my first and my only friend. I have indeed known many young men of my own age and have been on good terms with some, but only in him did I find a real friend, the hours I have spent with him have been the best in my life\u2026\u201d And this is the dedication, he made_  ",
