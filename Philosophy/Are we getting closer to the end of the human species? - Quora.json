            "answer_text": "No challenge to the good heart, but a challenge to the MOTHER parent with a child. No parent truly desires to outlive their own children or child. Some invoke the call of the WOLF, saying this is breeding season. Caring for the care of the child seems an idea most would gladly walk away from. Single parent is becoming a normality. YET the truth remains . Adoption is considered NEVER. Abandoned children litter this Earth worse than garbage bags. The killing squads still exist in places like Brazil, and yes they thrive even in these dull years. Can you call your own self human, when children are being hunted, and then you DARE to say is humanity safe.. AT THIS Time humanity is being adjusted. Covid19. Kill off the old and the weak. This shall amplify for years to come. Noticed over 40 years ago when HIV/AIDS arrived. This virus brings death to a select few. When invented (by nature) . Too much sex and too much population and too much free love. The list could expand. Tammy Fay Baker and her religious husband in Florida, (place of oranges anyway) were content. \u201cgod has come down to this earth to smite all gays.\u201d The end result was they died and then so did god. From helping god to god the destroyer. Removing god the mythical has become easy. Even the church has gotten into the act. Here in Canada over 400 priests were sent to jail for raping children in orphanages and in boarding schools. They took that charge from Canada and threw that into the face of the then Pope. Actual crocodile tears from the pope of rome. What respect is the servant of god if destruction of children is the desire of god. From the time of the 1950s. The suburban wife changed. They read one book. \u201cThe valley of the dolls\u201d. ON mass the world found families divorcing. This is a HIGHER THAN HIGH MASS over and above what any church could consider. To led us to this question , end of the species. Many nations then did a thing. Stop the birth of females. Entire nations took this platitude as truth. Then only men were born, but instead of just not birthing, the males became insane with no one to play with. Males indignant even took to mass scale rape of woman and yes even some weak man would also suffer. Arrogance thrived and war and war and war became the choice. As if by a drum beating out a chant of ownership of men and mankind. (actual was to send them all to war just to die). War and war and war. That country is too small, but kill them anyway. You have reached mental aberration of a human species. Roll the dice and try again. I am 69 and i have the mental record of my own reality which was the unglossy photo report. Can\u2019t believe this or that so find out. The Seattle dock when the ships arrived and the hold of those ships opened and black bags covered wharf after dock and non stop the trucks arrive to take the black corpse bags away. I turned away . \u201cTHIS IS SICK and these people are sick, and even this entire country is sick. Take me now home to Canada\u201d. To see that entire site would truly overwhelm your own mind ; and for decades to come. I am psychic so the idea held on until we reached Canada again. This is how your civilization deals with over population. Butcher each other for no reasonable need. Vietnam and Hanoi SMASHED and defeated the United States. horror of horror. The Meylai Massacre Why was the my Lai massacre significant to history? The My Lai massacre was one of the most horrific incidents of violence committed against unarmed civilians during the Vietnam War. A company of American soldiers brutally killed most of the people\u2014women, children and old men\u2014in the village of My Lai on March 16, 1968.

            "answer_text": "Maybe. But your bigger concern should be the end of you as an individual, not the species. Different people believe different things in regards to death of course. Muslims believe one way, Hindus another, etc. Atheists believe you die and there\u2019s probably nothing else. Physicists say the universe ends in a heat death or big rip. The big bounce hypothesis is generally not seen as tenable. Don\u2019t worry about the end of the human species. Ask yourself the hard questions concerning your own soon-to-be demise. JON STEWART: So where do we go when we die? DAWKINS: Bertrand Russell\u2014well\u2014 STEWART: So you don\u2019t know? DAWKINS: Well, we either get buried or cremated. Or we give our bodies to science. Bertrand Russell said\u2014 STEWART: But you actually don\u2019t know what happens to us? DAWKINS: I don\u2019t know what happens to us, but I know that our consciousness is wrapped up in our brains. I know that our brains rot. Exclusive - Richard Dawkins Extended Interview Pt. 3 - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Video Clip) | Comedy Central Dawkins doesn\u2019t believe in a Creator/God, he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s objective morality, and doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s any such thing as judgment or life after death. I encourage you to not jump on the Dawkins bandwagon. We don\u2019t have much time here. Seek to know who God is and why we\u2019re here, while you still can. Today may be your last on the planet (or mine), while the human species continues as if nothing happened. ",

According to the extremely rapid rise of genetic diseases in the last 110 years from infected sex, causing massive germ line mutations, we have less than 100 years before extinction. The only thing that would stop this is for people to stop spreading STD\u2019s like insane morons. Viral STD\u2019s have this thing where they enter the cells of human zygotes and change the DNA at the most permanent level. The statistics on the rise of genetic diseases is so clear on this. 30,000% rise in childhood cancer is one of the most disturbing statistics in less than 110 years. From obscure to the number one cause of death by disease. Second is genetic deformity of organs, third is congenital heart disease and that is up by 200% in less than 34 years. All of these statistics are available to anyone who wants to know. The fastest rising cancer in the USA is unborn babies with spinal and brain cancerous tumors. Can\u2019t even get born without cancer in the womb. It used to be that cancer was an old age disease and NEVER was found in children. Autoimmune diseases are rampant now. Diabetes is up 600% in less than 40 years. 1 in 9 babies are born now with serious genetic diseases requiring life long treatments and their lives are shorter and more miserable. It is not good. All we have to do is stop infecting our zygotes with mutagenic pathogens. ",

            "answer_text": "Are we getting closer to the end of the human species? Absolutely. 1 Corinthians 15 35 But someone will ask, \u201cHow are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?\u201d 36 You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 37 And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. 38 But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. 39 For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. 40 There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another. 41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory. 42 So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. 43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. 44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 45 Thus it is written, \u201cThe first man Adam became a living being\u201d;[e] the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 46 But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual. 47 The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. 48 As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 49 Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall[f] also bear the image of the man of heaven. Mystery and Victory 50 I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 51 Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. 53 For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. 54 When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: \u201cDeath is swallowed up in victory.\u201d 55 \u201cO death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?\u201d 56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 58 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain. When Jesus Christ come with all the armies of Heaven to rule the Earth as King from Jerusalem all of the resurrected and living saints will be changed into immortal children of God. And later after the Millennium all the saved will likewise be changed while the rest - the unrepentant human mortals/sinners - will be burned to ashes and cease to exist. So yes, every day we are getting closer to the end of the human species and closer to the God species. ",

The Bible tells us how it will all play out in the end. Part of this will be a 1000 year reign by Christ to show us how we could have done much better with the resources here on this earth. A big factor in that is Satan himself will be chained up during that time and not able to influence corruption as he is doing now. Revelation 20:1-7 ESV Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while. Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. ... ",

I\u2019m a Christian, and I understand that there will be a 1000 year reign of Christ on earth when he comes back, and there will still be humans reproducing on the earth (not in New Jerusalem because there will be no marriage in heaven). So I think the human species will be around for about that long at least. The Bible says that when Jesus returns we will be given new bodies. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d still classify ourselves as \u2018human beings\u2019 at that point\u2026 who knows? Ultimately, we\u2019re a spirit and we will be given new spiritual bodies (whatever that means!) Of course, before Jesus returns there is going to be widespread destruction and persecution of people of faith all over the world. Jesus said it would be the worst time in all of human history. The population of the human race will be greatly diminished.

We\u2019ve made a rough bed for ourselves to lie in by burning within a couple centuries fossil fuels created over millions of years. We now will have to face the consequences of the most rapid climate change earth has ever experienced, but we may be able to mitigate the effects if we act together now. Humans are a tropical species that thrived with the receding of continental glaciers. We\u2019ve adapted to nearly every habitat on the planet and even circumvented the plagues that accompanied urbanization as our population exceeded balance. Our aggressive exploitation has altered the landscape and reduced habitat for other species, driving the sixth Great Extinction. It is conceivable that we could learn to collaborate with nature, rather than dominate and destroy that upon which we depend. Using a permaculture approach, we could create natural paradises across the planet and, if we can learn to keep our own population at sustainable levels, we could thrive again. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer is well yes and no. First , yes, because the human genome is degrading. This is a scientific fact. We each inherit over 100 mutations from our parents and experience a similar amount which we pass on to our offspring. Most in themselves are not serious and as such are not seen by natural selection so are not culled out. Nevertheless they accumulate and as such in time are deleterious to the genome. So we are in fact devolving i.e. our genome is becoming less ordered a process of increasing genetic entropy. Read Professor John Sandfords book \u201c\u201cGenetic Entropy and the mystery of the human genome\u201d john Sandford was For many years Professor and researcher of genetics at Cornell University. the common held view that nature is evolving from simple structures to more complex is a myth and is not backed up by TRUE scientific enquiry. Now secondly no we are not coming to the end of human existence. Why? Because as you can see from the above facts we were created complex by a creative intelligence we call God. According to the bible, Gods word, we were created for a purpose to have a relationship with Him and each other and glorify God. How and why this appears to have gone wrong is revealed in the bible too along with Gods plan for eternal existence of humans in a perfect creation in the future. Read John\u2019s gospel And the first 12 chapters of Genesis. If you examine the observable scientific evidence we have today with the biblical world view you will find that science backs up the biblical account, and as more scientific discoveries are made increasingly so.

Human survival isn\u2019t threatened, but I expect something of a population crash from famine, wars, and pandemics as the environment we depend on collapses around our ears. Humanity wont be eliminated though because the environmental crisis is an artifact of over population. Catastrophic population crashes from over population are are not uncommon among other species and the population crash is self correcting. The population drops. Pressure on the environment decreases. The environment recovers. The remnant population flourishes again. If the cause was exogenous and severe, for example flood volcanism or asteroid strike or increased solar radiation, then it wouldn\u2019t be ameliorated by lowering the human population and would more likely be terminal for apex creatures like humans.

If you meant the end of the human species by extinction then my thinking is that if humans make it through the next 500 years they will probably make it to 1 million years (at which point speciation is a genetic inevitability). The reasoning is that the current civilization is highly unstable and humans haven\u2019t collectively learned to cooperate and work together on large scale problem-solving. I think that if they make it through 500 years without civilization collapse then that is good evidence that they have collectively gained this ability and that will greatly diminish the risks going forward.
