            "answer_text": "Philosophy is neither a science nor a religion. Philosophy, science, and religion are belief systems*. In the West, philosophy relies on the use of (deductive and abductive) reasoning to organize its arguments and determine the correctness of their conclusions. (In this answer, all further references to philosophy will be assumed to be of Western philosophy, with its roots in ancient Greek philosophy.) (Empirical) science relies on (deductive, inductive, and abductive) reasoning (but primarily inductive and abductive; much if not most of its \u2018deductions\u2019 are chiefly via mathematics, at least in the physical sciences). See What's the difference between \"inductive\", \"deductive\" and \"abductive\" reasoning? Religion tries to rely on deductive and abductive reasoning, but since many of its conclusions are preordained, the result is many antinomies which, according to the Dominicans, are \u201cmysteries beyond human understanding!\u201d Many of these religious antinomies result from the attribution of omniscience and omnipotence to God. (For a relatively trivial example, can an omnipotent God create a stone so heavy that an omnipotent God cannot lift it!?!) For a non-trivial example of a Christian antinomy, consider the Calvinist doctrine of predestination (see Predestination). \u201cExplanations of predestination often seek to address the \u2018paradox of free will\u2019, whereby God's omniscience seems incompatible with human free will. In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious determinism; and usually predeterminism.\u201d But as early as 300 B.C., the Greek philosopher Epicurus used simple logic to demonstrate the contradictions of religion. To wit, \u201cIs God willing to prevent evil, but is not able? Then He is not omnipotent. \u201cIs He able, but not willing? Then He is malevolent. \u201cIs He both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? \u201cIs He neither able nor willing? Then why call Him God?\u201d For the contrast of science and religion, see Norman Simenson's answer to Are the people treating science as a religion due to their defending it? \u201cPhilosophy is a way of thinking about the world, the universe, and society. It works by asking very basic questions about the nature of human thought, the nature of the universe, and the connections between them. The ideas in philosophy are often general and abstract. But this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world. Ethics, for example, asks about the ideas underlying our everyday lives. Metaphysics asks about how the world works and of what it is made.\u201d See in Philosophy - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \u2026 \u201cIn past centuries natural science was included in philosophy, and called \u2018natural philosophy.\u2019\u201d See in Natural philosophy - Wikipedia Although the split between modern science and philosophy began in the 17th century with the gradual adoption by science of the Baconian \u2018(re)invention\u2019 of induction as outlined in Bacon\u2019s treatise Novum Organum, see Baconian method, and its rejection of much of Aristotelianism (see Aristotelianism | Definition, Philosophy, & History) , the final break took place in the 19th century. See The History of Induction \u2022 John P. McCaskey. \u201cBaconian induction dominated experimental science for the next two hundred years. It was the scientific method that produced countless \u2018laws\u2019 in mechanics, chemistry, electromechanics, even economics, from Hooke and Boyle to Darwin and Say.\u201d On the other hand, induction was generally rejected by non-science philosophers as an altogether imperfect way to discover the \u2018truth\u2019 of things. See Modern philosophy and Modernity and Postmodernity Today Philosophy, Science, and Religion are generally accepted as more or less independent co-equal belief systems. (Which is not to say that they don\u2019t greatly influence each other!) See also Norman Simenson's answer to Are the people treating science as a religion due to their defending it? *Belief systems include all human intellectual endeavors that attempt to explain basic questions of human existence (such as religions, philosophies, and the sciences).

            "answer_text": "It is not true that philosophy directs all sciences. Science is only interested in questions that can be answered with measurements or observations of reality. Philosophy at one time overlapped with science (which was originally called natural philosophy), but with the ascendency of science, philosophy has more and more been relegated to those questions that are not answerable via science. This is not to say that philosophy is of no value. But there is no sense in which philosophy directs all or even any of the sciences. ",
