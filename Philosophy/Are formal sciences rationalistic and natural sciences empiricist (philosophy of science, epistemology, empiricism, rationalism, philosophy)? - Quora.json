            "answer_text": "I guess that answer is \u201cYes, sort of.\u201d But the systems of rational thinking have been developing for far longer than the empirical sciences, since numbers, and especially zero, were codified, originally in written (or impressed) form as forms of control and taxation. Obviously, the Greeks worked on reason and logic pretty hard too, but did not call them \u2018science\u2019. The empirical sciences achieved respectability much later, and not without a struggle against blind faith. Alchemists may have led the way, subversively. It is only fairly recently that the two have been brought together in essential union at the heart of fundamental physics, passing via the periodic table. Philosophically, I would say, a good (by which I mean easily understood by someone like me) answer to the question WHY the two so combine is not available, but combine they do. A fundamental difference between them is the following: formal (rational) systems are closed, each item dependent on, and defined by, the others; empirical sciences rest on observations form the physical world and can be modified accordingly as new information is included or the old discounted. Their ultimate affinity is therefore difficult to make clear and crystalline. ",

            "answer_text": "This question seems a mess to me. Formal sciences as defined as not one of the natural sciences you listed have to be empirical. Physics, chemistry, etc all rely on physical evidence for phenomena, and are thus empirical( empiricist). Natural science, as you call it, are a combination of both empiral and rational thought to some greater or lesser extent. They use both reason and empirical data to reach conclusions ",

            "answer_text": "Formal sciences are those which study formal languages with certain structures to them, like mathematics, computer programming, and logic itself. The languages are abstract and symbolic, the phrases contained within only containing as much meaning as what they can be used to represent. Therefore, yes, it is probably correct to say that languages conform to rationalism, where you can use language rather freely to reason something or come to a conclusion, but a conclusion within an abstract and symbolic setting is not actually empirical. Whereas the natural sciences, those which attempt to explain real world phenomena, come up with empirical evidence to support or refute claims, formal sciences simply focus on creating solutions and reasoning pathways that can function within the abstract framework of the languages. 1+1=2, but \u201c2\u201d does not exist in the universe, it is an abstract concept which is used in counting. \u201c2\u201d is not an empirical discovery, there are pairs of things everywhere so no single thing is actually \u201c2\u201d. \u201c2\u201d is simply a reasoning of addition, that a couple things together can be classified as a greater group falling under the definition of \u201c2\u201d. In this sense, while formal sciences are rational, they are not empirical. This is why mathematics can be cited as evidence or descriptions of certain scientific theories, mathematics alone cannot verify said theories. ",
