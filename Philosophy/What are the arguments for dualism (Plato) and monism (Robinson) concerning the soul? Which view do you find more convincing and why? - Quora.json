            "answer_text": "I find dualism more convincing because it better accounts for our concept of identity. On monism, or naturalistic materialism in general, \u201cwe\u201d are nothing more than the sum of the material components that make up the human body. Yet scientists have long determined that the cells that make up our human bodies are replaced over time (except for the brain, which I shall shortly address). Yet we still harbor intuitions that we are still us despite this cellular replacement. On a literal reading of materialism, however, we are not the same person that we were ten years ago in the relevant sense, which most people reject as absurd. A few materialists who wish to retain the concept of identity therefore associate the brain with the locus of identity. Yet even this resort rests on shaky ground. Some people undergo surgery to modify or even remove parts of their brains due to disease or external physical trauma. If one hemisphere of your brain is removed, does this make you half the person you once were? Most people rightly reject such a literalistic implication as implausible. The materialist\u2019s next step, at this point, is to insist that it is not the physical brain that constitutes the self but rather the memories that reside in it. On this understanding, you are \u201cyou\u201d because your memories (usually) persist over the time that the cells in your body are replaced over your decades of life. But what if you lose some or all of your memories? The implications of deciding that you are no longer \u201cyou\u201d in response to this question are excessively problematic. We would, for example have to rewrite our legal codes in various contexts. If a person murders someone, forgets about the murder he committed, later needs brain surgery to remove one of the hemispheres, and is able to avoid being found out for twenty years before the police and courts finally track him down, then they would have to let him be because he is not the same person, in any relevant manner, who committed the murder. You cannot point to the continuity of the physical body; that has been replaced at the cellular level. Appealing to the brain is shaky; half of it is gone, so he is only half the person he once was. Nor can you point to the man\u2019s memories since he does not remember the murder he committed. In sum, short of abandoning the concept of identity and persistence of the self through time, we need something that transcends the changing material aspects of ourselves to account for our sense of self. It goes by many names: mind, soul, spirit, essence. The best that can be said for monism is that it confines itself to what can be seen, heard, touched, smelled, stored in a test tube, or otherwise quantifiable. Short of spurious fringe accounts, people in society at large do not encounter entities that arguably defy material embodiment. Yet absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Although I do not think my above essay constitutes a Cartesianly certain proof that an immaterial soul exists, at least I hope that it stills any views that the notion of its existence is uncritical quackery.

            "answer_text": "A2A. When understood properly, both. Soul is a bridge between Spirit and Mind and as such is similar to Jung\u2019s use of the word Self, which encompasses both the ego and the unconscious. It is has qualities that are both dualistic and monistic. To further explain, in the unconscious there are uniting symbols and hence it is essentially monistic, though consciousness works with pairs of opposites, frequently with images or representations of unconscious contents such as a hierosgamos or a hermaphrodite. But it also uses images like the circle. The word symbol itself suggests this: sym \u201ctogether or with\u201d bole in \u201cto throw\u201d. Ego or ordinary waking consciousness operates in duality, yes or no, light or dark, pleasurable or painful \u2026 etc. Jung gave no explicit mechanism for how contents of the unconscious produce images in consciousness. But he did mention a Self, which encompasses both ego and the unconscious. Paradoxically, both monism and dualism each have their place. For example in Hinduism we see both Dvaita and Advaita schools that are more matters of emphasis. ",
