            "answer_text": "Taking a personal stand, I guess there are different versions, depths or aspects or perspectives on being uncertain. There is the one belonging to a child (even when that child inhabits the body of a so called \u201cgrownup\u201d) - a unknown uncertainty. Because the child is not aware of being uncertain - of not knowing - because a child is - WHAT IT IS. The mode in which the child moves/acts, speaks/listens and observes/learns and feels is the only mode the child knows. Here uncertainty is a natural base, and the very ground the child builds up on - it is the trigger for knowledge, examining and learning, it is the force the child uses to become in a condition of \u201cunderstanding\u201d. When we grow in knowledge of what surrounds us and is inside of our beings in forms of intentions, feelings and what happens when we do this or that - we know that we can go wrong, something unpleasant can be the outcome of different intents from us or others while testing, searching and trying to add more knowledge to why, what, what for, where, how and all the other conjunctions, nouns and interjections we use for our understanding, gathering of information and knowledge to - gain certainties. Only to find out, that the more you actually know, understand and gain insights on what is, or not, what we can understand or not - the more humble we become in understanding how small the proportion of human knowledge really is. How limited our being is, our brains are, and therefor also the scope of expanding these particular parts of our beings. The heart know, what the mind cannot grip. A sort of fata morgana, elusive Horizonte \u2026 where we KNOW all - already - that we need, for all times.. to ever be, or become, possible. A comfortable, secure, cozy and warm nest to cuddle into. Raining all uncertainties in the entire world upon your being! The Child Regained, found and given the Breath of Life. Holding a firm Grip on the Hands of Eternity thru the Hand of The Eternal God of Truth, in regard to Humans and Being in the World. \ud83d\ude07  Now, if we would not have the constant feeling of uncertainty, even when we have read entire libraries, all the books, papers and documents we can put our hands on and our brains can cope with - then we would not keep on searching. Maybe pondering deeper questions that do not regard only what we can see, hear, take in with our senses - but places where our minds stretch out to go, want to examine, understand. Questions and uncertainties like: What really, actually, takes place after death? What sort of being - is the human being? What is our destiny, our meaning of life - why are we here, what can we do, where are we going? And when we are tired, numb, lost our curiosity, eagerness to learn, know, understand, find out, search for, solve and create more knowledge for understanding the world and our own beings. We can always sit back and become watchers of life. Passing by on the TV set. While we feel we already know absolutely everything there is to know - we have all the answers to all and we have all the explanations to everything. and then there are no more uncertainties that we cannot Google or see on the screen or find on the Internet. We consume. And just because we do not feel the urge to know - as we already know all there is to know. Uncertainties regarding feelings, relations or such can be solved thru not \u201cthinking too much\u201d, \u201cdrowning them in a fog of smoke, drinks or even constant intimate activities - a quick fix sort and kind\u201d. The brain is detached, the heart is detached and so the body becomes also detached from the \u201csoul that lives within\u201d. What we do not know - we do not care about either. Or: \u201cthere is not much to know about that\u201d. So in the latter situations we probably do not have anymore feelings - and not being uncertain either. ",

            "answer_text": "Well yes, uncertainty is a permanent condition, in the sense that we normally relate to knowledge: if your job is to take the facts and connect them up into theory, there\u2019s a host of \u201cepistemological problems\u201d which chase you endlessly \u2014 science does a decent job of working those problems, but at the end of the day nobody can ever eliminate extreme possibilities like \u201ceverything we experience is just a simulation in some higher-order machine\u201d, and so on. Those kinds of propositions cannot be disproved, and even the less extreme problems with certainty-of-knowledge are pretty challenging. But for me, there\u2019s only one thing that I need absolute certainty about: who I am. Since I can provide that certainty myself, not requiring long chains of evidence and theory, I have a high tolerance for uncertainty about everything else. ",
