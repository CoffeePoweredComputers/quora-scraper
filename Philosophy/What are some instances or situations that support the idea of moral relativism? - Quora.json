            "answer_text": "None, at a serious level of consideration. For some very easy (and ultra superficial) examples: 1) may I feed a quarter of a pound hamburger to a person whose protein level is depleted and is also in need of nourishment? 1) No if it is an orphan infant and you would cause major organ malfunctions and even death. 2) Sure if it is a 250 pound football player who finished a game 2 hours ago and is in need of protein replenishment now. 3) May I crack open the skull of my neighbor when both he and I really want it? Sure if you are a brain surgeon who is in the process of restoring cognitive abilities to your neibor. The problem is that the question as stated here\u2014and so very, very often mis-asked \u2014is too superficial and abstract. \u201cNourish the starving if you can\u201d is a would be a moral maxim.\u201d (And thirdly\u2014 another which is not couched in such merely physical-appearing circumstances\u2014 would be \u201cAdmonish your child when that child is working at dehumanizing its companions. So, to do some real (even though brief and superficial) moral explication (in 50 words or fewer): Moral (deliberate) actions are those which enhance the personhood of persons and immoral actions are those which vitiate the personhood of persons. The largely physical examples given at first are elementary ways a qustion (and deed) could \u201cgo wrong.\u201d But one last try to take this answer to a higher level than the merely materialistic-seeming. (Sorry for the brevity, etc. of what follows): Here it is from the philosopher Immanuel Kant: \u201cSo act such that the maxim of your action could be a universal law.\u201d So here some vocabulary: \u201cmaxim\u201d is the consideration (e.g. intention) in a particular case that the acting person may have explicitly in mind for this specific occasion; for example a rule of conduct. (And rules are relatively superficial and one rule might even be in conflict with another. 1a: \u201cfeed hungry people but 2a: don\u2019t kill the hungry (e.g., your ultra obese 600 pound hungry neighbor). (But Kant is more deeply interested in natural laws than in maxims. Laws of nature are universals. He was, in fact, also a natural scientist [Kant-LaPlace Nebula Theory, for example] as well as a philosopher. And he is seeking the lawful necessities in enhancing the personhood of finite persons. His test of a moral intention/maxim and action is whether it is possibly lawful as in the Law of Gravitation: Can it be the case that every event of a certain kind of deed is subject to/governed by a universal law? If a moral maxim could be a (moral ) law then it is also a moral maxim. for (For an example I will make up here): could Kant, on a \u201cblue\u201d day think: \u201c I am very depressed, so I will commit suicide and be out of this pain and that would be moral of me.\u201d No is the answer. For if it were universal Kant doesn\u2019t exist because his mother and Father never existed nor their parents \u2026and Adam and Eve never had a single child because they committed suicide becfore they had any children, and thus neither did Cain or Able\u2026.or Kant\u2019s Mother exist. Post Scriptum: My apologies for trying to summarize 200 pages of Kant into half a page. ",
