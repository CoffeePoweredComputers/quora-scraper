            "answer_text": "To be painfully exact, I can only explain in detail my own consciousness. To be rigorous, I have encountered only vague generalizations which suggest others have consciousness. Authors whom I trust explain consciousness with a variety of theories. When they are being \u201cscientific,\u201d they carefully distinguish their observations from their theories as \u201cneural correlates of consciousness.\u201d Consciousness is a process of experiencing the world while controlling my attention to select only certain aspects of the all the available sensations. These sensations include association reminders arising from memories and knowledge stored in my head. The process includes choosing actions my subconscious proposes to take. This produces the feeling of being in control, of choosing actions to be taken. Consciousness is hard to distinguish from a sense of identify. In some sense, consciousness is an instantiation of identity. In ones family and culture, the close association of identity with my consciousness produces several mentally held role models. Each person constructs their own several role models. Like an actor in a play, frequently their actions are the playing out of one of their role models. Consciousness becomes a member of the audience in such a scene. I ain\u2019t what I was. I may cherish or regret memories of past experience for which I \u201cfeel\u2019 responsible. To the extent I feel my role model choices caused the behaviors and their consequences; I may feel pride or shame for that result. I ain\u2019t what I wanna be. This view of self and identity carries with it a sense of plasticity\u2014I can change, I can be whatever I want to be. I ain\u2019t what I could be. Based on role model appropriate selections for future behavior and choices I can idealize a future \u201cme\u201d that is better than today\u2019s. I ain\u2019t what I\u2019m gonna be. The sense of control and responsibility carries with it notions like duty and honor. \u201cI can and must make this happen.\u201d https://www.quora.com/profile/John-Bailey-43/answers/Consciousness explains in detail what other\u2019s think consciousness is.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve answered different questions about consciousness a number of times now, using the findings of Claude Rifat (who researched consciousness and the nature of reality, scientifically, and for a number of decades) and my correspondence with him, about his work and my own findings, during the 1990\u2019s, until his death in 2002. So far, there have been no serious responses, so I\u2019ll just supply the link to his articles, and express the hope that someone, someday, will take a dive in it too, so it can be discussed. For now, I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s down-to-earth, and totally worth the effort. It is challenging though. And being prepared to suspend judgement is a prerequisite. Claude de Contrecoeur: article index (At shaman-australis.com) Conscious Dreaming and Controlled Hallucinations (Main article) The above are the original drafts. He never redacted them for publication. It can be difficult to read, is there is no clear story line. It\u2019s more like a collage. The bigger picture only emerges after a while, when a sufficiently large number of constituent concepts are understood. A few years ago, lucid-dream-research.com picked up on it. They wrote a lengthy article which was based on Rifat\u2019s work, and adapted and expanded on: https://lucid-dream-research.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Claude-Rifats-Concepts-From-Conscious-Dreaming-And-Controlled-Hallucinations-1.pdf (More sites based on Rifat\u2019s work have come online in the past few years, for which one needs to register first -free of charge though, it would seem.) Rifat does not fully explain what consciousness is. That would be way too much for one person to figure out. He himself also pleaded for more research -even much more. But he discovered many things already, and I\u2019m sure that only few people understand consciousness as well as he did. ",

            "answer_text": "It is extremely important to know that consciousness is a concept and not a thing. The most obvious and intimate reality about us is our own ALIVENESS. This ALIVENESS is self luminous and self evident, meaning that it does not require proof or corroboration from someone else. This ALIVENESS feels intuitively like it is INTELLIGENT. This ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE is screaming out loud \u201cI am not inert like objects, but I am a no-thing and non-material SPIRIT\u201d. This ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE/SPIRIT is nameless, formless, dimension-less, non-local, non-temporal, very near, dear and intimate and it feels like the very core of our BEING or HEART. This means clearly that this ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE/SPIRIT/BEING, being a non-material and no-thing reality, is indestructible and therefore is causeless and untouched by time and space. We should feel confident about this intuition, for we truly trust our own intuition more than we do our own perceptions. Example: We see a blue sky during the day time but our intuition knows that the blue sky is non-existent. The luminosity behind our perceptions namely seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling and thinking, that arises out of this ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE/SPIRIT/BEING is conceptually called as consciousness. Consciousness cannot be separated from the perceptions. They both rise and set together. In deep sleep, there is no time, no space, no cosmos and no observer but just silence and stillness and ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE/SPIRIT/BEING in a state of deep peace and POTENTIAL. This POTENTIAL of ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE/SPIRIT/BEING is actualized differently in all the other known states of human existence namely wakefulness, dreams, swoon, coma, death, hypnotic states, yogic trances, NDE, OBE and altered states of consciousness induced by drugs. This ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE/SPIRIT/BEING is the fundamental REALITY. This cosmos is merely a set of perceptions in this ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE/SPIRIT/BEING. We can never know any object out there as a reality in its own right but all we know and can know is the perception of it. This perception is an internal activity in ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE/SPIRIT/BEING. ",

            "answer_text": "Can you explain in detail what consciousness is? This is my favourite topic that scientists and philosophers alike have no consensus among themselves. There is room for conjecture. There are two somewhat different concepts of consciousness in different civilisations, the Hindu and the Western concepts. Roughly, in the Hindu concept, consciousness is the ability or function or the consequence of the observer or comprehender to differentiate and categorise what interacted with the it(or him). In the Western concept, it is roughly equal to animal or human conscious awareness. We can attempt to unify them by formulating a concept of mind that is compartmentalised into the unconscious, subconscious and conscious mind, where they differ in degree but not kind. The Hindu concept covers all of them whereas the Western concept falls only into the conscious mind compartment and focuses on such concepts as qualia etc. One philosopher of mind divided it into the easy and the hard problems. But there are also other Western philosophers of mind who think the hard problem is not even a problem.I go for the Hindu concept. This concept is more useful in linking human intelligence to artificial intelligence and helps in understanding how life or sentience could evolved from non life and unconscious physical systems, whereas the Western concept will serve the medical field better.I take the unconscious mind as the information defining uniquely the property of any entity or physical system that determines how it will interact with another entity to unfold in certain way in space as an event. This information is acquired by an observer from signals interacting with him in his brain treated as a measuring device and were processed and stored in it. These signals carry information defining the property of the entity interacting with the observer and his brain processes them together with stored information to make decisions and then transmits the decisions to express as his ideas, emotions and actions as his responses. We call ideas and emotions mind. Mind and action are expression in our embodiment of information encoding properties of entities that interact with us to produce the effects on us and our responses. Our brain operates in waves as a result of Evolution. Ancient organisms might have brains operating in different ways but those operated in waves can better survive because waves can better predict outcomes in time and space. Those organisms that didn\u2019t have such brain might have extinct after not too many generations. Our brain, like our body, is part of the universe and I take it that, in the final analysis, they are built up from some fundamental entity. These building blocks built up entities in a Hierarchical complex networks having many hierarchical levels. I call that entity Energy, which is all there is in the universe at the fundamental level. Wave is a form of energy, which term I take to be the equivalence of mass and energy, where energy includes radiations and heat. If you want an analogy, Energy in matter, radiation and heat is like H2O in ice, liquid water and steam. Wave as a form of Energy is a noun as well as a verb. As a noun, it names the entity that contains Energy and as a verb, it describes the process that transforms relentlessly the entities in any region of the universe. Information of any entity or process are encoded in wave parameters. When information are processed by the brain to express as mind and action, the information in the mind and action not only are used to describe them but also prescribe and determine how the interaction will unfold. Our brain is a conscious entity in that it has the ability and function to differentiate and categorise waves interacting with it by their wave parameters. This is the Hindu concept of consciousness. This Hindu consciousness is in our unconscious, subconscious and conscious mind, differing only in degrees, not in type. It is a continuum artificially differentiated by sensory perception not just into degree but also modes such as vision and sound. This Hindu consciousness differentiates and categorises effects from all interactions to keep us survive and living reasonably well, meeting within limit some of our goals. The Western concept of consciousness is limited to the conscious mind, the mind in the awake state, the conscious awareness in which free will to initiate and abort habitually initiated intention is possible. This is consciously aware of Hindu consciousness. A second order consciousness of the Hindu consciousness, limiting it to only in the conscious mind compartment.There are people who think that conscious awareness is determined by brain wave frequencies, because a 7Hz frequency determines whether we are awake or dozing off. As a meditator, I think this is not correct, because, in my meditation, I can go into part of my subconscious mind compartment and be aware of its content. Since the brain is a hierarchical structure, it has levels and as a measuring device, these levels serve as the measuring scales that can be used to measure with accuracy ant signals which are also having levels and in the sane range as that of the measuring scale. In my opinion, awareness is determined by the ratio of the amplitudes of the knowing mind, at the measuring scale it chooses, and the wave of the signals that interacts with it to be aware of. If this ratio is above a awareness threshold, we become aware of that wave. In meditation, we choose lower or finer scales and we magnify the effects measured to increase the measured ratio. Why the ratio? Because we interact to acquire the effect of entity on us at different levels and from this effect we infer the cause of the interaction based on our model of a causal relationship in the wave interaction process. The result is stored in our memory for use in prediction of our future encountering with in similar events. The effects are relative to the wave representing the observer\u2019s measuring scales that determines how he will perform and be transformed in the interactions. The interaction is now a measurement process conducted almost automatically, that is, instinctively or habitually or volitionally by our brain and body and maps to mind and action in response mainly for our survival, and if we have that luxury, then for fulfilling oour desires. Amplitude measures state or strength. Its value is proportionate to the clarity of our ideas and power of our emotions and actions. It allows free will in consciously aware animate to go against the laws of Nature governing the movements of the unconscious and unaware. The unconscious may not be aware of the effects, but it can still differentiate and categorise subconsciously, that is, to a lesser extent. We have the ability to habitually or instinctively differentiate in subconscious and unconscious mind automatically with our brain operating at low level, in preventing us from falling out of bed in dreams or deep sleep. Routines and simple processes can be done subconsciously or unconsciously that consumes less energy and don\u2019t need the attention of the top brain hierarchy that has the second order filter to produce awareness.This is my opinion, which, if it is worthy of some scientific study, may take a lot of resources to do so.

            "answer_text": "As I see it, consciousness can be divided into Universal Consciousness, Personal Consciousness, and, Consciousness-of. So let's look at these. We will go backwards and use some logic. \"Consciousness-of\" results from our interaction with the environment around us and the sensory information which is being created within. If we walk into a tree, that is Consciousness-of. In fact the reading of my musings right now, is consciousness of (including the headache this may give you). Consciousness-of is a projection of sensory information being created by our nerves and other parts, which sometimes coalesces into a linear, slow, thought by thought manner. Consciousness-of can be myopic, like using a telescope to parse reality. Before consciousness-of must come personal Consciousness. That is, that Consciousness that gives rise to Consciousness-of. This Consciousness is the awareness of existence which, by far, supercedes Consciousness-of. It includes most things that one never thinks about, like how we beat our own hearts, or raise an immune response to viral infection. That would be body consciousness existing in the \"unconscious\", as well as slow linear thinking. It's everything that one is, right at this intantaneous moment. That is personal consciousness. However, personal consciousness cannot arise out of nothing. It is not some kind of supernatural ability humans suddenly gained as if through magic. Personal Consciousness (complete body/brain consciousness) must arise from a drive for consciousness. It is this drive that I call Universal Consciousness. Our consciousness is like a bud blooming on a tree. And, if so, what is this \"tree\" which allows our consciousness? Is it the tree of life? Actually, to take this to it's limits, it is the sum Consciousness of everything that exist at this very moment. Every moment is an expression of Universal Consciousness within which we participate in with human-consciousness (boy, I'm getting tired of typing consciousness, I'll switch to \"awareness\"). Awareness of existence is what we are. It is a process, not a self-contained brain phenomenon. We are so intimately tied in with everything around us, that it is impossible to think of. Our human-consciousness is unique to humans, and forms a global human-awareness. That is called the \"Human Spirit\". Humans are like one large organism of awareness, and it's getting tighter and more controlled by advances in communication. The same form of communication awareness exists amongst species. And that is not all. Consciousness is not just a matter of nerves firing, that supposition is simply personal or human awareness. So, we have to reach out beyond our comforting self awareness and apply logic to consider world (Gaia) consciousness. If consciousness is a matter of nerves communication, then we should view the communication of everything. Water molecules in a river communicate with each other, and hang together in the rush down the river. This is analogous to the group consciousness of drivers on the freeway. No difference. Then there is the communication, through light, of every star. Is such communication different from sending neurotransmitters across a synaptic gap? It's is all the same thing. It is movement. So, consciousness is communication. We receive such communication from the outside and the inside. It's all communication. It's the web of existence. We cannot really differentiate what is happening internally or externally. With that point of view, we become conscious-of Universal Consciousness. It's a tough leap for the ego to accept this! In fact, ego must be broken apart into putative components, and be let go a step at a time. At least the self-centered ego is a waste as opposed to self-interested ego. One must differentiate between the two. Eating is a matter of self interest, treating a group to an expensive dinner is self-centered unless one forgets oneself. That's my speal, for now\u2026 Consciously yours. Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is the ability to be aware of ourselves and our surroundings. Primary consciousness just means that you are not unconscious, so are receiving incoming sensory information to the brain. This affects the activity of multiple regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that regulates attention, decision-making, and voluntary action. If an image is flashed very briefly, only the part of the brain directly associated with vision is activated and it does not enter our conscious awareness. But if it is flashed for a longer period, then the lateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices of the brain become active, making you consciously aware of the image. Physiologically, consciousness of a thought is a pattern of neurons firing synchronously. It might be generated by a problem that is being worked on (cognitive reflection) or a memory, or what you ate for dinner, or a dream, or a drug, or a hormone, or something that caught your eye even if the sight did not enter your conscious awareness. Our brain is like a committee of 85 to 100 billion people each of which can do only make one decision \u2013 yes or no. There is a LOT of instantaneous internal discussion about it. (How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer). The end result is the majority opinion of the individuals, none of who can see the big picture. The immediate tally, even if the vote is nearly a tie, gets the go-ahead and we do not get a minority report on the matter to tell us why up to half of our brain thought it was a bad idea; all the routine discussions are done \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d and not shared with our conscious awareness except for small amounts deemed necessary when thoughtful consideration of several options of behavior is beneficial. Our brains constantly work below our level of awareness. Each individual neuron is always hard at work, but all that work of a busy brain does not always produce any conscious thought. It takes care of all the easy stuff; it can drive you home while you daydream and when you get home you don\u2019t remember driving there. But when it needs to work on more complex environmental processing the brain engages higher level areas, including the prefrontal cortex, and it makes some of its processes available to our conscious awareness to bring in active memories in making its decisions. This is our secondary consciousness, or meta-consciousness \u2013 we are aware that we are aware. We are thinking. During general anesthesia, consciousness stops and there is no conscious existence; it is a period of time when the self is absent because no memories are made at any level. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot explain what consciousness is.

In fact the opposite, it is our immediate and present experience, It is a \" given\", a immediate part of our form of life. It is not some thing we have or possess like we have a possess a car, we do not have consciousness, we are conscious. Any \" explanation\" of what consciousnessis is can only be ostensive, you know what it is because you have it, what it is does not have to be explained to you, and what it is cannot be explained to you None of this is meant in any metaphysical or philosophical sense. You already know what consciousness is in the same down to earth way you know what you big toe is or what pain is etc. Basically the question itself is incoherent, partially a linguistic confusion arising from different usages of terms like \"is\" and \" have\" e.g Consciousness is not something that \"is\" in the same way a object or thing \" is\", or something we \" have\" like we \" have\" a car .

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is the body\u2019s navigational system; it consists in the act of paying attention to signals for possible relevance to survival. Attention is a current of electrical impulses generated in the reticular formation of the brain stem, connected to the other brain regions where those signals are processed. Consciousness is just another body function, evolved to keep the body alive and intact for as long as possible. Things have changed since we first evolved; life conditions used to be relentlessly harsh and dangerous and our consciousness, as with all animals, evolved to cope with that, enabling the body to move around in search of food, water, mates, shelter and safety. Now, in the conditions of modern life with its relative safety and many comforts and conveniences, we no longer need to have such an attention / consciousness to survive. Indeed, we lucky ones living in developed countries can indulge in the pleasant luxuries of daydreaming, reminiscing and fantasizing our lives away. We are so far removed from the original conditions of life in which we evolved that we no longer know what consciousness is and ask questions like you ask. In order to regain that knowledge, either we have to place ourselves in those original conditions - not advised, we won\u2019t survive - or, make a point of deliberately observing ourselves during our days - not the way we already automatically \u201cobserve\u201d and criticize / complain / praise / cajole, but real self observation, with no comment, just witness, and you can watch and see exactly what your consciousness / attention is by seeing what it does. Just cross a busy street and watch your attention. It is not easy because it requires a splitting of the attention, one for getting across the street in one piece, and another for watching the watching. It sounds complicated but it is very simple, just watch yourself and see, then you won\u2019t need to ask us this. ",

            "answer_text": "Every sense input creates a temporary consciousness. When you open the eyes a sight consciousness is created and immediately annihilated. Being replaced by a new temporary sight or other sense consciousness. These sense inputs occur many thousands of times a second. They arise and are immediately annihilated. Happening at such great speed, events of consciousness appear to be one continuous flowing event. But that is not what\u2019s happening. The mind, is composed of thought and bundles of related thoughts that operate as apps and modules of apps. The mind tells stories to itself based on perceived realities. The apps and modules are triggered by conditioning or association and add greatly to the stories. This is how reactive thought operates. All of this is noticed by awareness, which operates as a noticing alive presence. Once reactive thought is diminished through insight meditation, awareness (which is your true nature) is discovered in the spaces between thoughts. Once you experience this space, you will be motivated to spend more time there. If you are interested in this you can read the Abidhamma which is the Buddha\u2019s explanation of reality. This is taught by the Theravada branch of Buddhism. This is also available in video lectures on YouTube. Good luck on your journey. \ud83d\ude4f ",
