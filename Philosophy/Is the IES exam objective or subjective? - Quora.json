            "answer_text": "The pattern of the Engineering Services Examination (ESE) which was previously known as Indian Engineering Services (IES) exam, conducted annually by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has been revised from the year 2017. The new pattern, similar to the old one, is a combination of both objective and subjective questions. The new pattern, however, has divided this examination in stages and each stage now has it\u2019s own pattern. Let\u2019s have a detailed analysis of the entire pattern of the IES/ESE exam: Stage 1: Preliminary Exam (500 marks) This stage is completely objective in nature. The exam is conducted in two shifts on the same day. Shift 1 comprises of 100 questions of 2 marks each from General Studies & Engineering Aptitude. Shift 2 comprises of 150 question of 2 marks each from the specific dicipline in which you have applied (Electrical, Civil, Mechanical, Electronics & Telecommunication). Stage 2: Mains Exam (600 marks) The students who clear the prelims stage will be called for this stage. This stage is completely subjective in nature. The exam is conducted in two shifts on the same day. Both the shifts consists of questions from the engineering discipline in through which you have applied for the exam. Stage 3: Personality Test (200 marks) The students who clear the mains stage will be called for this stage. This is the final stage where the personal interviews are conducted. The final merit list is compiled by adding the marks obtained in all the three stages by the candidates who appeared for the Personality Test. I hope this answer helped you. All The Best! ",
