            "answer_text": "Traditional gender roles emphasize male dominance and female submissiveness. A woman who doesn\u2019t mind showing off her dominant side may be perceived as harsh, controlling, or \"bossy.\" A dominant male counterpart, however, is perceived to be expressing gender-appropriate authority. Males who have social anxiety, however, commonly exhibit less dominance, which causes internalized shame. Gender differences in the submissive-dominant pole of behavior become particularly pronounced in people with social anxiety disorder (SAD). This disorder is highly prevalent in adults and, with a lifetime rate of 12.5%, is considered one of the top five psychological disorders. The fear of losing status or the feeling of being lower in status influences social anxiety disorder. People with SAD try to avoid drawing attention to themselves because they fear seeming inadequate. They\u2019ll slump their shoulders and avoid the gaze of others to stay beneath the social radar and avoid being harmed. People with SAD feel embarrassed when the spotlight shines on them, afraid that they will look foolish by gaffes they may commit in public. Men and women with SAD differ in the situations that trigger their fear of public humiliation. Women are fearful of speaking up in front of others, while men can become self-conscious about urinating in public restrooms. Men with SAD find it more difficult to meet women, and therefore are more likely to live alone and remain unattached. There is a critical distinction between how men and women respond to SAD and gender roles, however: Because men are expected to be dominant, those who believe that they do not measure up to society\u2019s norms feel a chronic and deep sense of inner shame. Individuals who believe that their core characteristics and behaviors are socially unacceptable and who place a great deal of value on adhering to societal expectations and norms may be at high risk for experiencing internalized shame.\u201d Men with SAD feel ashamed that they cannot act in the dominating, self-asserting ways consistent with the stereotypical male gender role. Women with SAD don\u2019t have this problem because being submissive and self-conscious is more typical of what many still see as the stereotypical female gender role. Women, in this worldview, are not supposed to speak up in meetings, so for those women who don\u2019t, there\u2019s no apparent social transgression. The shame that men feel over the mismatch between their social anxiety and the expectation that they should try to out-hustle everyone around them leads to a vicious cycle in which shame breeds anxiety which, in turn, breeds more shame. A study found that \u201csubmissive behaviors were more highly related to internalized feelings of shame in men than in women.\u201d This relationship held even when the researchers controlled for scores on the depression scale. Furthermore, simple sex differences didn't seem to account for the pattern of relationships among submissiveness, social anxiety, and shame. The findings apply only to men with SAD, not to men in general. However, because men with SAD are more likely to give in than are men in general, the findings indicate how much of a psychological toll it takes when men find it impossible to assert themselves in interpersonal situations. The shame they experience reflects their perception that they are deficient in a quality associated with their gender. For men who do not struggle with social anxiety disorder, how might behaving in submissive ways affect them? Rather than internalizing shame feelings, men without this disorder may attempt to regain self-esteem by acting in what we might call \"counter-phobic ways.\" Realizing that they have given in instead of asserting themselves, men who show submissiveness feel the need to act in more dominant ways than ever. To sum up: \u00b7 If you are a woman trying to understand your male partner, or co-workers who go from submissiveness to dominance, recognize that they may do this to protect themselves from shame. If you deal with men who seem to prefer retreating into the background, their feelings of shame may keep them perpetually in a state of anxiety. \u00b7 If you\u2019re a man who feels you constantly need to hyper-assert yourself, ask yourself if it\u2019s really a way to protect yourself from the shame you might feel by giving in once in a while. \u00b7 For those of you with social anxiety disorder, knowing the role of submissiveness and shame may help you overcome feelings of inadequacy and find relationships that allow you to express, without fear of ridicule, your true self. As we are in this world for a short period of time, my goal and my colleagues and many clients is to change the lives of people so they can continue to grow, give back to the community, and change the world for future generations (as I think about my children in a very \u201cuncertain\u201d world,) thus leaving a legacy. (It is key to think about our legacy because we are writing it every day! As I have enjoyed writing over 195 articles for Quora readers to \u2018Empower Yourselves,\u201d many are related to your challenge and how the Brain (conscious and unconscious) work; be a \u201cFollower\u201d and you will find things that will be of interest to you (you can go back and check articles where you can get additional information for yourself on a particular subject), possibly to find \u201cyour passion\u201d and allow you to overcome your challenges and attain your goals and thus find \u201cpeace of mind.\u201d I will continue writing articles on Anxiety so look for them.

            "answer_text": "Hi Tudor, I think it\u2019s likely the other way around. A person is consistently submissive because of their anxiety. Myself, as an example, I\u2019m a INFP personality type. A natural mediator, a logical thinker and able to understand others emotional needs even if I don\u2019t personally agree. Yet in any conflict situation that I\u2019m directly involved in, I can become very submissive. Through lots of work on myself I\u2019m now aware that is due to a fear response from learned behaviour as a child. Conflict meant I was a bad person, there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with me. As an adult I find it difficult to express my needs because it provokes anxiety. This looks like submissive behaviour. I am learning to unlearn that behaviour, and finding that my personality type looks like a submissive personality, but In actual fact it is only when conflict is involved provoking a fear response I actually become submissive. hope that makes sense and answers your question.

It may be necessary in a person's job for efficient completion of work. It could be a behaviour pattern in response to a controlling person in the home which keeps the peace. Children who are submissive due to abuse may be chronically anxious without knowing it and unable to put words to feelings because nobody has ever helped them to do so. Undetected this can lead to chronic mental and physical health problems later on. ",

            "answer_text": "It kinda depends. Anxiety can impact anyone, whether dominant, submissive, or somewhere in between. As I read your question, much depends on how you\u2019re defining submissive. All of us have to be submissive at one time or another: at work, at school, or in church. If, by being \u201cconstantly submissive,\u201d you\u2019re being a people pleaser and never tending to your own needs, you may be at greater risk for anxiety and other issues. On the other hand, if you\u2019re comfortable in your skin and you\u2019re constantly *but selectively* submissive, you may be just fine. In other words, you have to be in charge of your submission. If others are demanding it, forcing it, taking it: yes, anxiety is a likely result. But, if you have found situations where service suits and fulfills you, and you\u2019re getting back at least as much as you\u2019re putting in\u2026 then you\u2019re no more likely to be anxious than anyone else.

Submissiveness itself grow as a child grows and often as a result of avoiding certain \u2018perceived dangers\u2019 or \u2018perceived threats\u2019 Anxiety present at this stage itself. So submissiveness increases due to anxiety. Continued submissiveness and self perception of such submissiveness will most probably lead to frustration rather than anxiety. The anxiety that surfaces here is due to its pre-existence and not because of submissiveness. ",
