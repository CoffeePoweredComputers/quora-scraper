            "answer_text": "It is important for colleges to present facts. Part of the process of learning to think is learning to work with facts. It is also very important for colleges to teach the responsible or plausible or defensible interpretations of facts\u2014and interpretation is a kind of opinion. Essentially a responsible or plausible or defensible interpretation of facts is an opinion that is backed up by a consensus of other knowledgeable thinkers (responsible)\u2014or by strong internal logic (plausible)\u2014or by someone standing up in debate and defending it (defensible). Or preferably by all three. So if I say, here is a fact, and here is an interpretation of that fact, and here is a literature survey showing that many experts agree with my interpretation\u2014that\u2019s a pretty good position from which to teach something. Or if I say, here is a fact, and here is my unique interpretation of that fact, and although most experts have rejected my interpretation\u2014here are arguments that I believe show that I am right and everyone else is wrong\u2014this teaching position may be acceptable under the doctrine of academic freedom, especially if it is offered to advanced\u2014not beginning students. But if I say, here is a fact, and here is the correct interpretation of that fact, period. [But I am not going to tell you that most experts reject this interpretation\u2014you need to accept it because I say so]\u2014that\u2019s not a good position for a teacher to take. The bottom line is colleges should teach facts, and they should teach opinions, but they should also teach students how to tell the difference between the two, and equip students with adequate tools to do so.

            "answer_text": "Neither. Colleges should not preach unless they are teaching religious clergy. Colleges should teach people HOW to think. Part of teaching people how to think involves presenting controversial material and expecting the students to interpret it. How the students interpret it and how they back up their interpretations is the point. In primary, middle and secondary school, the emphasis is on presenting facts and scientific principles. Once a student gets to college the focus is less on learning facts and more about learning HOW TO THINK and APPLY knowledge. The problem is that facts change and knowledge progresses. When my father was in school there was literally one line about DNA in his textbook and the treatment of arthritis was either steroids or gold injections (yes they would literally inject GOLD into people's joints), but he is still a practicing physician. He had (has) to continue to learn. Now he is an expert on monoclonal antibodies and the treatment of inflammatory diseases. When my professors at MIT went to college, they used punch cards to write computer programs. The phone I am using to write this post has more computing power than all of the computers at MIT combined at that time. So I have no problem with this teacher\u2019s \u201crant\u201d she assumed (possibly incorrectly) that her students were smart enough to analyze what she said with a critical ear and take from it what they wouldn ",
