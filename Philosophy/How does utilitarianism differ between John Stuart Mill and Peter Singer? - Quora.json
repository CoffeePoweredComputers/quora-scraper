            "answer_text": "Peter Singer takes the Utilitarian argument to its logical conclusion, while Mill spent most of his Utilitarian thinking clarifying the perspective to contemporaries still reeling from Bentham. Bentham, a generation older than Mill, gets credit for launching the idea, radical and dangerous for its day. A raving maniac is pretty close to what Bentham and Mill\u2019s critics called them because of their claim that happiness is humanity\u2019s core moral value. Mill\u2019s most famous defense of Bentham, under attack for saying that Utilitarian demeans humans by claiming that pleasure is their most important human value, was this: \u201cSome kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.... It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.\u201d Singer sharpens and extends the Utilitarianism claim without much changing its basics. Instead of focusing on happiness, whose definition is elusive as can be, Singer shifts to the prevention of suffering, which is much easier to define. Then, he includes sentient animals among those whose suffering humans should be preventing, making him the de facto moral philosopher of the animal rights movement. He makes the provocative claim that excluding animals from our moral concern is in the same category as racism, sexism, ageism, and other isms our society has used to exclude some human beings. He calls is \u201cspeciesism.\u201d Radical stuff, indeed. Additionally, Singer makes it a point to challenge his students and audiences to give money they spend on fancy cars and other frills to relieve suffering around the world. He does a TED talk that is a very good example. Such claims and Singer\u2019s speciesism, however, are mainly just sharpening what Bentham and Mill said two centuries ago. Here, for instance, is what Bentham wrote about animal rights: \u201cThe number of the legs\u201d is insufficient reason to allow them to be tormented. \u201cA full-grown horse ... is beyond comparison a more rational animal\u201d than a month-old infant.\u201d But, \u201cthe question is not, \u2018Can they reason?\u2019 nor, \u2018Can they talk?\u2019 but rather, \u2018Can they suffer?\u2019\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "As hedonistic utilitarians, Singer and Mill have very similar perspectives. Singer benefits from the work of later thinkers like Henry Sidgwick and Derek Parfit, so he is arguably more consistent and better informed than Mill. He changed his position in recent decades moving away from preference utilitarianism and non-cognitivism to hedonistic act utilitarianism and cognitivism. He rejects Mill\u2019s division between higher and lower pleasures and he doesn\u2019t make the mistake G E More accused Mill of making in trying to define good reductively in terms of natural properties like pleasant or desirable. Singer is a non-naturalist moral realist who accepts Hume\u2019s is/ought divide but does not think that this results in us being unable to make objectively true moral claims. ",

            "answer_text": "John Stuart Mill has an individualistic view of utilitarianism , he emphases on the higher pleasure of individuals in a human community whereas Peter Singer has a socialistic view of utilitarianism , he emphases on maximizing the happiness of a community by working towards a common interest in a community . basically a great happiness to Peter Singer is, to reduce the contradiction between self and social human interests .

            "answer_text": "Mill understood reality much more comprehensively--see, for example, \"Essays on Religion.\" Yes, he was a \"utilitarian,\" but not an irrational ideologue. On the other hand Singer is completely reductionistic and it is puzzling that he would even be taken seriously as a thinker, other than for the purposes of exemplifying the self-contradiction of the narrowness of modern thinking. Read more Mill and forget Singer... Hope this helps! ",

I don\u2019t think John Stuart Mill thought that animal rights were a thing. Harming an animal for no reason I imagine would have been out of bounds perhaps, but in situations in which human concerns or human rights weighed versus animal rights, I would imagine that human rights would win.
