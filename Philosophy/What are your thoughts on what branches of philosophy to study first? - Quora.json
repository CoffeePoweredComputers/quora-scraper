If you are studying this on your own, then here is what I have posted in answer to similar questions: [The links I have included in this answer do not appear to open properly if you are using Internet Explorer (unless you use the 'Open in a new tab' function). They open Ok if you are using Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.] First, dial down your expectations. Not one single 'philosophical problem' posed by Ancient Greek thinkers (or any others since) has been solved, or even remotely solved. Nor are they likely to be. After 2500 years of this, we don't even know the right questions to ask, for goodness sake! As Oxford University Philosopher, Peter Hacker, noted: \"For two and a half millennia some of the best minds in European culture have wrestled with the problems of philosophy. If one were to ask what knowledge has been achieved throughout these twenty-five centuries, what theories have been established (on the model of well-confirmed theories in the natural sciences), what laws have been discovered (on the model of the laws of physics and chemistry), or where one can find the corpus of philosophical propositions known to be true, silence must surely ensue. For there is no body of philosophical knowledge. There are no well-established philosophical theories or laws. And there are no philosophical handbooks on the model of handbooks of dynamics or of biochemistry. To be sure, it is tempting for contemporary philosophers, convinced they are hot on the trail of the truths and theories which so long evaded the grasp of their forefathers, to claim that philosophy has only just struggled out of its early stage into maturity.... We can at long last expect a flood of new, startling and satisfying results -- tomorrow. \"One can blow the Last Trumpet once, not once a century. In the seventeenth century Descartes thought he had discovered the definitive method for attaining philosophical truths; in the eighteenth century Kant believed that he had set metaphysics upon the true path of a science; in the nineteenth century Hegel convinced himself that he had brought the history of thought to its culmination; and Russell, early in the twentieth century, claimed that he had at last found the correct scientific method in philosophy, which would assure the subject the kind of steady progress that is attained by the natural sciences. One may well harbour doubts about further millenarian promises.\" [Hacker (2001) pp.322-23.] Peter Hacker (2001), 'Philosophy', in Glock (2001), pp.322-47. Glock, H-J. (2001) (ed.), 'Wittgenstein. A Critical Reader' (Blackwell). Second, begin with Bertrand Russell's 'Problems of Philosophy', which is about as good an introduction to Traditional Philosophy as one could wish to find -- and which is also well written. [Link below.] Then, perhaps read some of the more accessible 'classics', such as Descartes's 'Meditations', or his 'Discourse', Hume's 'Enquiries', Berkeley's 'Three Dialogues', Plato's 'Republic', or his 'Meno' (Aristotle is, alas, far too difficult!), Kant's 'Prolegomena To Any Future Metaphysics' -- steer clear of Hegel (who is impossibly obscure). All of the above (except Hacker) -- and much more besides -- are available here: http://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/philclassics.html Then, check out a completely different approach to the subject: Ludwig Wittgenstein, 'The Blue Book'. http://www.geocities.jp/mickindex/wittgenstein/witt_blue_en.html Traditionally Philosophy has always been regarded as a sort of 'super-science', a discipline capable of revealing fundamental truths about 'reality', valid for all of space and time, ascertainable from thought, or from language, alone. Or, indeed, as some sort of uniquely authoritative moral or political guide, or perhaps even a clue to the 'meaning of life'. But it isn't like any science you have ever heard of. Traditional Philosophers typically spend a few hours in the comfort of their own heads -- by-passing all those boring observations and experiments, with their expensive equipment and a requirement that the individual concerned becomes technically competent --, and, hey presto, they emerge with a set of super-cosmic verities. This isn't to deny that some philosophers engaged in empirical work -- for example, Aristotle -- but that wasn't a core aspect of their work. Moreover, the sciences have gradually freed themselves from Traditional Philosophy by subjecting their work to empirical test (howsoever one interprets this). Nor is it to deny that scientists don't indulge in amateur metaphysics (especially in their popularisations), speculating about the nature of space or time, for example. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphysics/ But, Traditional Philosophy is quintessentially a 'conceptual enquiry', which directly or indirectly revolves around what certain words mean (such as, 'time', 'space', 'matter', 'knowledge', 'belief', 'existence', 'identity', 'meaning', 'language', 'causation', 'justice', 'freedom', 'fate', 'good', 'evil', 'god', 'soul', etc., etc.), but this in fact provides us with a clue to its fatal defects, and why it hasn't advanced one nanometre closer to a 'solution' to its 'problems' than Plato or Aristotle themselves managed. I have attempted to explain why that is so, here (using Wittgenstein's ideas): http://www.anti-dialectics.co.uk/Why_all_philosophical_theories_are_non-sensical.htm If you are studying at college etc., you won't have much choice until at least our second year. Get back to me then. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question I imagine many new Philosophy majors in college ask themselves at about class enrollment time. So too, I would guess, would a person who\u2019s first come to the field as a layman, just trying to get started. Looking back at my own experience, and given what my own degree program students have done, I think the best approach is to take an \u201cIntroduction to Philosophy\u201d class first, and then a class in basic Logic second. The Intro class allows you see how logic is used by philosophers in history of the subject, and then you feel more comfortable in Logic class later, since you\u2019ve been lightly exposed to its use by surveying The Greats. Otherwise, you get that same feeling as when in about 9th grade (U.S.), where you\u2019re doing Algebra every day, shuffling the various equations in different contexts, but thinking, \u201cWhat in the world does this have to do with real life?\u201d Students (rightly) ask such because the theory of Math is being taught separated from its history. Likewise, you don\u2019t want Logic separated from its history of use in Philosophy. There would be no great harm in doing a basic Logic class first, since a competent instructor would, no doubt, talk about evidence-based reasoning generally, and about informal fallacies specifically \u2014 the latter of which are very helpful for students in every class and conversation. Also, the completion of a basic class in Logic is extremely helpful for writing college papers from then on out, too. So having that as early as possible is duly advised. Still, from a purely pedagogical approach, I say Intro. before Logic. ",
