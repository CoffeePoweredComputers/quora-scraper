            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Hamza Riazuddin Thats a big question, too big for any kind of quora answer. To be brief, modernism basically harks back to enlightenment ideals that began in the early 16th century [rennaciance europe], enlightenment ideals include using the scientific method for extrapolating truth from reality, and the use of logic in language to formulate objective truths from a world experienced subjectively. Modernism isn't just about science, it is relevant in culture, art, movies, architecture, politics, just name it, modernism is there. But the key thing to understand about how modernism is related to all these aspects to life is that modernism embraces objectivity. In other words whether you're building a building, or writing a poem, there is some kind of objective method or structure that can make it a better building, or a better poem. Postmodernism is the recent speculated \u201cparadigm shift\" away from modernism, and basically it just says fuck you to everything that I've described so far. Most speculate that postmodernism began somewhere around the early 60s. However, many say the Frankfurt school in the 1930s, comprised of a small group of Jewish Marxist intellectuals in Germany greatly influenced the French intellectuals of the 1960s. So the seeds of postmodernism are very debated. Alot of what I've learned about postmodernism I've picked up from Jordan Peterson, a popular public intellectual that I enjoy. He speculates that 1960s french philosophers like Jacques Derrida, Michel foucolt, and Jacques Lacan saw the undeniable failures of Marxism in Russia and China by that point in time, so they played a slight of hand with their Marxist ideals and replaced it with postmodernism. Ok, so why are the two related? Well, as opposed to modernism which is materialist in nature, while postmodernism is solipsistic. Materialists believe that truth can be extrapolated from reality because we all share the same reality. Postmodernism believes that because reality is filtered through our senses: reality cannot be known to be objective, nobody has greater access to reality, and therefor what is true cannot be known, and truth is merely a subjective claim, nothing more. Why is this related to Marxism, and what does it have to do with postmodern art, music, buildings, or culture in general? Well, think about it! Claiming that one painting is superior to another is a truth claim, so postmodernism says down with truth claims! Everything is art! So postmodern art can quite literally be anything:  Postmodern art. Can you say this isn't art? How about buildings?  Structure is just subjective and oppressive!!! [But what's keeping the building up?? Hmm\u2026.] How is it Marxist? Well since nobody is possibly more or less intelligent or more or less capable [because those are truth claims] why is anyone better or worse off? You see it in the SJW culture too: Sjw: why can't I be a woman? Modernist: Well you have XY chromosomes. SJW: who are you to say I'm not a woman? I feel like a woman, I don't subscribe to your definition of woman\u2026 Modernist: uhhh\u2026. See? If we subvert the definitions and categories, because they are truth claims, everyone can define the rules for themselves. It's narcissistic. I don't believe postmodernism will replace modernism. It isn't stable and it will collapse onto itself, but it is a rebellion against modernism\u2026 but a brief one relatively speaking, not a full paradigm shift. ",
