            "answer_text": "Nobody holds the monopoly on truth. Everyone\u2019s truth is up to them, and you don\u2019t get to tell anyone what to think. What you can do is teach them facts. Give them as much information as you can in order for them to be able to decide for themselves. Was Hitler bad? Sure. But why? It\u2019s no use knowing something if you can\u2019t elaborate on it. If you only learn the rules and not why those rules were created or what purpose they serve, you\u2019ll be in a difficult place in a non-standard situation. A lot of life is non-standard. You can\u2019t have a rule for every single thing - too much to remember. It\u2019s easier to give people tools to help them think for themselves in the right direction. So, I can tell my brother that doing A to others is wrong, or don\u2019t do B, and eventually the list will pile up until he can\u2019t even remember what A was or when it isn\u2019t allowed. Instead, I tell him - if you do A, A will be done to you. He is now motivated to think for himself in any situation: \u201cdo I want this done to me what I\u2019m about to do?\u201d. By letting people think for themselves, you relinquish control over what others think. This is scary for people who are authoritarian or prefer dogmatic practices. Tough titties. Anyone intelligent enough will eventually come to the conclusion that it\u2019s less effort and more reliable to give people tools and show them how to use them. You can now leave them alone and be fairly certain they won\u2019t burn the house down. When I\u2019m teaching a new thing in chemistry to my students, I like to explain why it is important to know, what you can use it for and, if I remember, how people came to such a conclusion. I don\u2019t care about them memorizing shit. I care that they think. No country has a use for an ignorant populus, and a country that does isn\u2019t likely to be a democracy - by definition, if you\u2019re going to be governed by the people, the people ought to know their shit.

I can teach \u201cwhat\u201d. I can only facilitate and encourage students to learn \u201chow\u201d. If students don't want to learn then I can force them to learn \u201cwhat\u201d but for \u201chow\u201d there is nothing I can do. ",

            "answer_text": "The brain thinks for us as babes (crawl before walk; walk before run; cry for help; coo for attention). It is trained further through positive or negative re-inforcement. A baby crawling may chew on a roach. If the baby thinks it\u2019s nasty; he won\u2019t eat it again. He may eat ice-cream, like it if he thinks it tastes good. Touch a hot surface, not like the pain. If he receives love, learns to love. If he receives kindness, learn to be kind. Reading to a child, even when it is in the womb is great preparation. It is crucial for a child to play. Later on do chores and receive rewards. To strengthen thinking skills- technology has become crucial with the utilization of interactive reading, math, science, math, etc., and brain game exercises, which drives their thinking. Scaffolding of questions, highly engaging group discussions, brain storming and use of the \u201cscientific method\u201d helps with this monumental task. When babes and kids do not receive adequate nutrition, or feel neglected, they cannot focus on learning. The basic need for survival (food, love, shelter) will undermine the child\u2019s maximum potential. ",

In Fact, if the answer sounds different, it is perhaps ignored. The teachers are to be trained to appreciate and to highlight unique and different points of views. If such examples are often read out for the diverseness and dissimilarity of the new perspectives, the children would also realize the importance of thinking for oneself instead of following the beaten path.
