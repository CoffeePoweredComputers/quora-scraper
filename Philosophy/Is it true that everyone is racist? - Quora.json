            "answer_text": "Yes! To those suffering with the current monomaniacal obsession with race, not only all people, but the cosmos is saturated with racism. It is like dark matter, dark energy in the universe. It is all over, the simple non-explanation for everything. There are some troglodytes that admit there is racism but can manage to think about economics, foreign relations, the nation\u2019s future, making a living and their family. Boo! Hiss! The universe has only one dimension and that is RACISM. ",

This in fact very popular on college campuses right now, especially among tenured, far left Marxist professors. You can even take the test yourself: Race IAT Don\u2019t worry about your score. You\u2019re most probably not a racist. ",
