            "answer_text": "This answer will be more meaningful and make more sense if you\u2019ve seen The Tree of Life. Malick is eternally on a quest for a sense of meaning and purpose. One example is how he explores the conflict between nature and grace in both the Tree of Life and the Thin Red Line. Nature being a relinquishment to a violent and meaningless universe while Grace is the way of forgiveness, humbleness, and selflessness. He gives his definitions here:  Confronted with the premise that those who follow Grace will not find a bad end, I think Malick wants to believe that following the way of grace is the \u201cright\u201d thing to do but struggles with the reality that suffering is indiscriminate and will ultimately seek out everyone. It appears that Malick is intrigued and perhaps tortured by this question. In the Thin Red Line, PVT. Witt who follows the way of grace, comes across a dead Japanese soldier who speaks to him: Are you righteous? Kind?Does your confidence lie in this?Are you loved by all?Know I was too.Did you imagine your sufferings would be less because you loved goodness? Why should we follow the way of grace if we all end up suffering?\u201d In the Tree of Life, Malick focuses on Jack\u2019s oscillation between nature and grace as he experiences both through his Father (nature) and his Mother (Grace). As a boy he is shown struggling with his identity in this regard. In this scene you can see him demonstrate an act of cruelty (nature) toward his brother, but then he follows it with an act of regret and love (grace).  It appears that as Jack loses his brother, he loses his sense of grace. In the end scene of the movie you could interpret it as him rediscovering grace in his life. Water or lack of water is used throughout the movie as Grace vs. nature.  I ultimately believe that Malick is confronting the question of wether Grace is worth pursuing. While acknowledging and evoking the truths about suffering, he gives his answer with this movie.

            "answer_text": "Oh, the Dirty Harry guy- I remember him. Where's he been! He typically strives for a few recurring themes that repeat in his body of work.  The most obvious of which is the main character's desire for spiritual knowledge and enlightenment. Malick is also good at expressing the dichotomy of nature versus nurture. He seems to admire nature in general as many of his shots are of wide open spaces. While I haven't found many of his movies to be exciting, there's no denying his cinematography is on point. ",
