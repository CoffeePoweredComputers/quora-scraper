            "answer_text": "Hi Quorites, Yes love is seeing beauty in others or admiring something beautiful. It might come in different ways for example:- 1.) If you look at a beautiful girl you are seeing her outer beauty and you might start loving her at some point of time when situations make you meet. 2.) If you start talking to a person who is ugly but when you feel he has a good heart that means you are seeing that persons inner beauty. 3.) If you go to explore world to see beauty in nature at some place you might feel that a particular place was very beautiful to look at. In one word because of beauty love exists without beauty there is no love. HSB ",
