            "answer_text": "Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi; the diseases can be spread, directly or indirectly, from one person to another. Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of animals that can cause disease when transmitted to humans. Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They're normally harmless or even helpful, but under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease. Again infectious diseases can be classified as community acquired and hospital acquired (Nosocomial infections). Hospital acquired diseases are mostly drug resistant and difficult to cure. Clean air, clean drinking water, healthy food, clean environment and public health awareness are essential for community health.
