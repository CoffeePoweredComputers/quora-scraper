            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve heard that all of the decisions we make consciously have already been made emotionally and whatever reason we give for making them is just justification after the fact. Free will is a tricky subject. There is so much that takes place in our subconscious and so much that is the product of conditioning. When we are forced to make an instantaneous decision, do we get a chance to think about it or did we have to do something right now without that luxury? Are we responsible for that decision, or was it made under some kind of duress? What if the only choice we are given is \u201cHobson\u2019s Choice\u201d, in which there really only is one option in spite of the illusion of there being more than one? If you don\u2019t really get a choice, are you responsible for choosing the only option available to you? Many people are never taught how to make decisions at all, because they are never offered options in childhood. The first time they endeavor to make a decision they have to do it by trial and error. People make mistakes. And many people find themselves in one of those positions. They don\u2019t know everything they would need to know to make an informed decision. They literally don\u2019t know any better. Sometimes they don\u2019t really have as many choices as they would appear to have. Life is complicated and other situations might impose their own limitations on what choices we have, especially if they involve other people. There are often mitigating circumstances, hence the saying \u201ccircumstances alter cases\u201d. I\u2019m not saying that this absolves people of bad choices made freely and with all of the information. If it can be shown that we did know what we were doing and it was possible for us to choose differently, then yes, people are responsible for their actions. Unfortunately it isn\u2019t always so clear-cut. So are people fully responsible for their actions? Sometimes, but not always.

            "answer_text": " Reaping flowers by author There are cases where every person was corporately responsible for the actions of one person. In this example case no one was to take spoils of victory over an wicked city marked for destruction for their corporate evil. But one person didn\u2019t have the moral courage not to take and hide gold and riches. As a result a lot of people were killed by a few enemies. Joshua said, \"Alas, O Lord GOD, why did You ever bring this people over the Jordan, only to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been willing to dwell beyond the Jordan! O Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned their back before their enemies? For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?\" So the LORD said to Joshua, \"Rise up! Why is it that you have fallen on your face? Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived. Moreover, they have also put them among their own things. (Joshua 7:7\u201311 NASB*) They found the traitor with the goods hidden under his tent then stoned his entire family. Pretty rough \u201ctaking responsibility.\u201c But it stopped their loses in battle. But that was a special case for a people in a special covenant with the creator of man. Now that creator God determines who is responsible for their actions when it\u2019s sin: The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself. (Ezekiel 18:20, NASB*) It is clear that you are responsible for your own actions. It is a reap what you sow concept. In this passage in the Holy Bible the term \u201csow\u201d is the image of someone who throws out grain to grow wheat in a field. It is a metaphor for sowing actions the result in effects that show up afterwards. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. (Galatians 6:7,8 NASB*) Two types of things are \u201csowed\u201d in these Bible verses. One thing to the flesh and the other to the Spirit. Earlier in the Bible these things were defined from partial lists so you would get the idea. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:19\u201323 NASB*) When each person is judged by the creator God, He will look at your actions and you ways of behaving. I, the LORD, have spoken; it is coming and I will act. I will not relent, and I will not pity and I will not be sorry; according to your ways and according to your deeds I will judge you,\" declares the Lord GOD.'\" (Ezekiel 24:14, NASB*) God is absolutely fair and impartial in this judgement there isn\u2019 t a bribe or a favorite people or excuse that will sway Him. If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth; (1 Peter 1:17, NASB*) If God was inconsistent and turned an eye away from what someone did or didn\u2019t do then He would not be God. But the God of the Bible is not partial. So you are responsible for your actions before God and this for your own sins in any deeds of the flesh. And since every person is a sinner they have to die for their own sins. I can not die for the penalty of your sins nor in the reverse of you dying for mine. Christianity is based on the fact that God took on a human body as Jesus Christ and never sinned and thus never had to die. But Jesus came to offer up a sacrifice of Himself to die for the penalty of our sins. As it was foretold 100s of years before Christ appeared. All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him. (Isaiah 53:6, NASB*) But He commitmented no sin so was innocent and rose from death to life by the power of God to do this. So Christ lives to give life to those already under the condemnation of sin. It also gives us the Holy Sporit to bear the results of good things like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; and more. Now that you know these things their is one thing you are still responsible for: the obedience of faith. That is calling on the name of Jesus Christ confessing your sinfulness and seeking forgiveness through Him and then confess Jesus as your savior Lord inviting Him in to your life. As He said. \u201c\u2026 therefore be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me. (Revelation 3:19b,20 NASB*) This is where real hope is found for any soul out their looking for a Savior to rescue them from reaping what they had sowed, and now to Gentiles also who are non Jewish people in the world like I am. that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tricky question. We must be held accountable for our actions, but I believe you\u2019re asking if the things we do are our \u201cfault\u201d or our \u201cchoice\u201d, which is hard to answer. It is becoming more and more understood and accepted every day that much of what we are and what we do is greatly determined by the environment we experience as a child, and further shaped by traumatic events, culture, and circumstances throughout our lives. It\u2019s hard to say where conditioning and influence end and \u201cchoice\u201d begins. I\u2019ve heard more than one serial killer describe being triggered by something and then almost entirely blacking out in some sense, only to find they\u2019ve brutally killed someone when they \u201cwake up\u201d. We have to hold them accountable, lock them up for the safety of innocent people, but are they really \u201cresponsible\u201d? Furthermore, most serial killers are psychopaths or sociopaths, meaning they literally don\u2019t experience empathy or remorse, and they were either born that way or made that way through immense childhood trauma. Knowing that, can we really say they\u2019re responsible, or that they \u201cmade bad choices\u201d, implying that they could have chosen differently? Much of modern psychology would say that it\u2019s unlikely they could have been expected to choose any differently given their condition and circumstances. Conversely, we can\u2019t give anyone too much credit for the good things they do. Most successful CEOs are people born with a certain disposition that makes them productive and decisive (and often a little psychopathic, actually), they were raised in privileged and/or favorable circumstances, and often have uniquely lucky things happen to them along the way. Malcom Gladwell wrote a whole book about it called \u201cOutliers\u201d. TL;DR: Maybe, but not nearly as much as we\u2019d like to think. ",

            "answer_text": "As I read your question, I was struck by its simplicity. We all have actions that can be considered improper in time and space. The personal responsibility that we take on is one of the more important foundation stones of Civilization. The three cases where this is applicable are When I do something unthinkingly and do harmWhen I assume that I am doing the right thing and am wrongWhen I willfully do something to harm othersWhen I make a mistake, I am called to make it right as best I can. I may need to make restitution or pay something to the harmed party. Sometimes, an \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d is sufficient. If I do some actions willfully, in an instance of believing that it is the right thing but later am proved wrong, There still need to be a putting of things right. If I harm someone by doing something, even when I thought it was the right thing but it turned out not to be, I need to make amends in the situation. It is just the right thing to do. That third category is a disturbing, but very real, situation. I may be driven by jealousy or a need for revenge. I may only want to take another down a peg or two because I perceive that they are annoyingly proud in some way. The issue is not what they did. It is our response. This is a great evil and we need to be aware of the evil inside us that produces these actions. Most applications of worldview have pathways to deal with the first two but are deficient for the third. The Christian Worldview is the only one that I know that has a way to deal with the personal evil that is inside us all. I highly recommend a thorough investigation of that worldview. Be careful of the counterfeits that are available. ",

            "answer_text": "If we first consider that animals are instinctively driven to react to their environment, it becomes easier to understand that we as intelligent human beings, have the free will to make choices, and it is a choice we make to do what is either right or wrong and also good or bad, including that it is a choice we make to lie, and it is therefore obviously a choice we make to make mistakes, and that remains true in spite of the fact that we often don\u2019t know that we are making a mistake. If we choose to deny our responsibility for our own mistakes, the only option left when we discover that there are negative effects as the result of mistakes having been made,, is to blame somebody else and hold them responsible for our mistakes, and that is a choice we make that will have severe negative consequences. Of those negative consequences, it will be a choice we made to absolve our self of our own responsibility that will define who we are as being pitifully weak self-absorbed human beings who are generally not much good to anybody else but our self, and directly because we choose to refuse to accept personal responsibility for our own mistakes, we will naturally be completely oblivious of any of this being true. It also becomes understandable that if we refuse to accept personal responsibility for our own mistakes, we naturally condemn our self to have to repeat the same mistakes, and the reality is that of instead of seeing the world as a wonderful place to explore, we will see the world as a dangerous and threatening place, and that will fuel our fears, and we will naturally be driven to use anger to fight off our fears, and we will naturally be compelled to vent that anger on other people, and that as mean to both, fight off our fears and absolve our self of our own responsibility, and this will have been a choice we made that will very effectively trap us at the mercy of the world. What becomes understandable is that if we do not accept personal responsibility for our own mistakes, it will be a choice we will have made that will be preventing us to be genuinely in charge of our own life, and everything we do that will make us appear as being in charge of our own life will serve to actually confirm that we are living by a lie, and we will learn nothing that really matters from our own life experiences. On the other hand, if we accept personal responsibility for our own mistakes, what becomes understandable is that our mistakes, will also be opportunities to discover what we obviously did not know and most desperately needed to know, which would be at the very least, what would have prevented us from making those mistakes. It therefore becomes understandable that only if we can learn from our own mistakes, that we will have the opportunity to learn from our life experiences and that will have the direct effect of compelling our self to become stronger and wiser people. What also becomes understandable is that personal responsibility is exactly what is absolutely necessary if we are to have legitimate charge of our own life. There may be no greater tragedy, other than a human being refusing to accept personal responsibility for them self and end up living their entire life as an adult child. The inevitable result is that they will not only have ended up wasting their life, but the risk is very high that they might also end up having lived a failed life. Some people believe that a responsible person is someone who can be counted on to arrive on time, always promptly do what is expected from them, like doing their job well and pay their bills on time, etc., but that is not what personal responsibility is about, and all of that can actually be the typical behavior of a human being who is not in legitimate charge of their own life, and it is because they have instead learn only to conform out of their own fears. To have genuine charge of our own life, we must be capable of making the choice of confronting our fears and accepting life as a challenge to risk going into the unknown, and this is exactly what will make life rewarding and interesting, and that is never going to be possible without the acceptance of personal responsibility. It ought to be that by the time they enter into adulthood, every child should fully grasp and understand this to be true, otherwise, they will not have acquire during their formative years, what they needed to make their own way in life. It maybe a truth, that there maybe no greater marker that define a failed life, other than to have failed our own children. It really ought to be that every human being should have somehow manage to learn enough during the span of their life, to be able to claim before they die, \u201cIf not for my mistakes, I would have learned nothing that really mattered.

            "answer_text": "Q: Do you think that we are responsible for our actions? Being responsible for our actions means governing yourself, ownership of your own life, and authority over yourself. Responsibility is ownership and authority. Responsibility is a choice that can only be made voluntarily by the individual. If you fail to make the choice to govern yourself then an external-government will sometimes try to help you or contain you so you do not endanger yourself or others. You lose ownership, authority, and responsibility to the external governing of others. Your parents had to govern you until you did it yourself. Your government has the responsibility to control dangerous criminals because that person doesn't do it themselves. Religion tries to govern those who follow their teachings. But ultimately the individual should take responsibility for everything they are today and govern themselves according to living a happy life while allowing other people to the same. When we blame others what we are actually doing is giving them responsibility over that part of ourselves. We loose ownership and authority and become prisoners and victims to them. But if we take the blame we then own that situation and have authority over it. When you drive a vehicle you are in control. You have taken responsibility and own that situation. You have the authority to create or destroy as you see fit. You have true freedom. The same goes for all your actions. But if you destroy or interfere with others trying to live a happy life also then it is likely that someone will start governing your actions for you. Responsibility is taken. You can try to force others to take responsibility but it never works. They must do it themselves upon their own judgement and free-will. If a person doesn't see a reason to do something they won't do it. Understanding creates hope. Confusion creates fear. Each can be a motivation to act. But only hope gives a lasting good result to empower the individual to govern themselves correctly. ",

            "answer_text": "Taking responsibility for your actions is essential if you wish to be a real person in the World. It means that you will never do anything that you can\u2019t bear the responsibility of. Over the past 50 years the people of the richer countries have starved 2 billion children to death in Africa. They have inflicted gargantuan pain on hundreds of trillions of animals. Yet , they all categorically deny that they have anything to do with these atrocious acts. So, that means that nobody has done all this at all, according to them. So, there are billions of people who are in fact responsible for all the evil acts in the World and they are all non-persons. They are so weak that they can\u2019t admit to having responsibility for their actions. They are the pathetic and cowardly bullies of the Universe. It is always the weakest who are the worst. It is the weakest people who do the Devil\u2019s acts for him. A real dignified person instead, is always responsible for all his actions. A group of human beings is always responsible for its actions as a group. In fact, the law of Nature attributes full responsibility to each individual in a group for all actions committed by the group as a whole. This is in contrast to the criminal attitude in which those people who commit the crimes deny all responsibility and point their fingers always at somebody else. And, unfortunately for the weak people who do the Devil\u2019s acts, death itself is avery difficult matter. Death is the most difficult moment of all in life. You have to be very strong and amazingly fast with your reflexes in order to escape from infinite suffering, especially when deep down your conscience is not clean. You can only die safely if you can accept full responsibility for all the actions committed by the people who you are associated with. You are always guilty by association in this world. ",

Only we are responsible for our action and the consequences they yield.Blaming other for it makes no sense. How? Let me tell you a story which i read in a news paper few days back :- A gardener was working in his garden when a cow wandered in and started grazing on a mango sapling. The sight of his favourite sapling being devoured by the cow outraged the gardener so much that he thrashed the animal to death. The news spread like wildfire. Since killing the sacred animal was a sin, the villagers threatened the gardener to face the consequences. But he denied the charge, saying, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t kill the cow \u2014 my hand did. And as Lord Indra is the deity of hands, it is the Lord who has incurred the sin, not I.\u201d Indra, who was watching all this from the heaven, disguised himself as an old man and appeared at the scene. He started praising the garden loudly, \u201cWhat a beautiful garden! Whoever has planted the trees has done it very skilfully and artistically.\u201d The gardener at once turned towards Indra and said, \u201cThank you, sir. It is my garden. I have planted all these trees with my own hands.\u201d Then the Lord said with folded hands, \u201cWhen you take credit for all the work done in this garden, it is not proper to hold poor Indra responsible for killing the cow.\u201d Just like the gardener in the story, we are quick to accept any praise or admiration that comes our way; while we cite \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d when anything wrong or tragedy strikes. We must realise that no one else but we are responsible for our actions and the consequences they yield.Blaming other makes, No sense. Thanks for A2A ",

So, if you choose to act on a suggestion, it is your choice. If things go wrong, then you can\u2019t blame others for it. You\u2019ll be responsible. Say, on Quora everyday many incredible writers write answers for the questions seeking advice or suggestions. And, you\u2019ll find that at the end of the answer, they write, \u201cYou may try.\u201d So, they not guaranteed the success by taking specific action. They suggested that you may. Chances are high. And, for few users it works. But, for some, it don\u2019t. I remember I wrote an answer on Study Habits. And, I got two message from two users. One appreciated and said that the suggested strategy worked for him to clear the exams. While the other told me it didn\u2019t work for him. You can\u2019t blame others for your failures. You chose to take the action. Like, on the packet of cigarettes, it is labeled that \u201cSmoking is injurious to health.\u201dOn the medicines, you\u2019ll find a label \u201cBest in use for XYZ months.\u201dOn electronic appliances boxes or manuals, you\u2019ll find instructions of DOs & DONTs.So, everyone making a suggestion but the choice will be yours. Therefore, it is your responsibility for the actions you make. Not others. ",

They may have made similar mistakes themselves. But if I did it, the responsibility is mine not someone else\u2019s.

The traffic and what it does to your plans and your schedule is very very real - it\u2019s a calamity. But, it has also become the perfect excuse for a generalized lack of punctuality. Everyone is late to everything. People leave a place at the same time they are supposed to arrive at another. They have something to blame. Not to make any less of traffic but it has created a generalized void of accountability. A real problem has become a built-in excuse everyone easily leans on to never bother to be on time.

They affect our motivation, decisions, attitude, and even just behavior at large. Emotions can serve as data to help piece together an effective way to navigate an environment. And they all come from within. Our whole lives, we've been developing along a certain path that began when we were young. Our feelings can sometimes go down a path of least resistance, because it's what we're used to. For me, sometimes I face paranoia because it's more natural for my brain to process something through that lense than it is to try and appreciate the whole picture. All emotions come from within. The anger I feel, the paranoia, the fear, the happiness, it all comes from my own body processing the world around me in a way that makes sense to it. Understanding this has helped me reign in my behavior. I know people who will jump to anger and accusations as soon as they become suspicious or paranoid, because it's such an easy way to deal with it; project it outwards, make it someone else's problem, and then they don't have to take ownership of it. It's a conscious choice to slow myself down, to sit with those feelings as unpleasant and terrifying as they are, and truly decide how I want to behave in that situation. Does my girlfriend make me paranoid? No, she doesn't. Sometimes she does things that, because of how I grew up, set off flags in my head that send me into self-preservation mode. It's not intentional on her end. It's how my body responds. I don't want her thinking she's the cause of my paranoia; those feelings come from within, and it's my job to understand that so that I can move forward in a productive manner. ",

Being responsible means you can be trusted by your friends, parents and the people around you. You are also able to choose for yourself between right and wrong. This means you are gaining \u2018wisdom\u2019, so an important by-product of being responsible is trust and growth. Can I ask you something? Do you want to be known as \u2018trustworthy\u2019? Do you want to be given more \u2018responsibility\u2019 for your own decisions, instead of relying on your parents or someone else? Do you want to get a promotion, or want to be encouraged by everyone who saw you being \u2018responsible\u2019 with what you were asked to do, or were given? It\u2019s a positive thing to be trusted, isn\u2019t it? Not to have anyone looking over your shoulder, not being nagged at to do the right thing, nor being left out by your friends because they can\u2019t trust you and you failed them in some way. Failure to be responsible leads to people excluding you, or treating you with less respect than you deserve. Think about it. Footnotes[1] Definition of RESPONSIBLE",

            "answer_text": "This question can be looked at from different angles: legal, scientific, ethical, spiritual. And there is a related question about what responsible means, for it suggests that we owe an account or explanation to someone, and its meaning shifts according to how we understand who that someone is\u2014our neighbors? the government? God? All spiritual traditions teach that we are responsible for our actions, which means that we are accountable for them and will face consequences for them. In Buddhism and other traditions that come from India, we\u2019re taught that we are all governed by the law of karma, which unfailingly brings consequences to us for every intentional action we do. Theistic religions have the idea of a final judgment in which the fate of our soul depends on what we have done in life. The teaching is always that pleasant consequences come from good, ethical actions and unpleasant consequences from bad, unethical actions. In this way each one of us is responsible for our actions. Many people profess a materialist outlook that denies freedom and responsibility, but personally I don\u2019t regard that as a tenable position. If there is no such thing as freedom, then the phenomena of consciousness and intelligence have no purpose and no use; their existence is mighty hard to explain. No, we\u2019re responsible. And recognizing this and acting on it, which means acting prudently and ethically, is a hallmark of maturity. ",

Until you accept responsibility for your actions or failures, it\u2019ll be very difficult for you to develop self-respect or even have the respect of others.

When someone truly takes full responsibility for their actions, they would apologize for the action (if it was wrong) and share within that apology why they believe what they did was wrong. The apology will make it clear whether or not the person is taking full responsibility for something, or if they are just wanting to push the blame to someone else. A classic example of this is something called \u201cleft-handed apologies\u201d. A classic example of this is when someone says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry you reacted in such a way by what I did to you\u201d. If you actually listen to the words they are using, you will see there is no apology happening at all! The problem is the other person. Nothing wrong happened on his part, the issue was with the other person \u201cfeeling bad\u201d or \u201creacting in a bad way\u201d. If only they didn\u2019t react in a bad way, then there wouldn\u2019t be any issue. The person giving the apology is wanting to \u201clook\u201d like he is truly sorry, but still walk away thinking he/she is on the higher spiritual ground. Pay close attention to what people say. You will learn a lot about a person if you just listen to them. What goes on in their heart, will come out through their mouth. ",

This does not have to translate to doing things for people all the time. Being able to take care of yourself and those important to you, finishing tasks that you are supposed to finish in a timely manner, and just overall being trusted are all factors in being responsible. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to build trust than money, but trust has very much the same value. If you can build trust and network, then you can give yourself more opportunities. This is very scenario based, but being responsible can have its own selfish reasons behind it. Therefore be responsible. You very likely don\u2019t want to live a life where people are doubting your capabilities in anything you do. ",

Yet...I also KNOW that if I were to shift the entire weight of responsibility for my actions onto these influences, doubtless highly formative though they might be, I would be turning what I pride myself in calling my sensitive reasoning into the sort of self-deluding excuse-finding I find all too odiously familiar (the SS Commandant who offered his love of his dog and family as proof of his underlying humanity....and anyway was just obeying impossible orders...etc.etc.)So..Someone has to take responsibility for my actions, and maybe, more damningly, failures to act, and it might as well be me.
