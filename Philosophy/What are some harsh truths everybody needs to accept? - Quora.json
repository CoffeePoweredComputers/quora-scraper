            "answer_text": "Our home environment is badly infected, because of wiping by t. paper. \u201cA single gram of human feces\u2014which is about the weight of a paper clip\u2014can contain one trillion germs About 1.8 million children under the age of 5 die each year from diarrheal diseases and pneumonia, the top two killers of young children around the world 8. It's Not Just Beards \u2014 the Whole World Is Covered in Poop \u201cThe Journal of Applied Microbiology, co-authored by Gerba, examined the kitchens and bathrooms of 14 homes over 30 week. \u201c The results were about the opposite of what you might expect:\u201cThe highest concentrations of faecal coliforms \u2026 were found in the sponge/ dishcloth and in the kitchen sink drain area while the lowest concentrations were found on the bathroom counter top, on the bathroom floor and on the toilet seat,\u201d the authors write. Also, the cutting board you use to prepare your beautiful, Instagram-worthy meals is likely filthy, too. Gerba has said the cutting boards he\u2019s tested have, on average, about twice as much fecal bacteria as what\u2019s found on toilet seats.\u201d your phone is pretty gross: A recent study from London School of Hygiene &Tropical Medicine researchers found fecal matter on one in six cellphones they swabbed. That same study found fecal bacteria on 16 percent of the 390 hands tested. \u201cThere\u2019s about a tenth of a gram of poop in the average pair of underwear,\u201d Gerba once told ABC News\u201d \u201cThere are 99.000 deaths each year in USA from HAI.\u201d \u201cIn the presence of an antimicrobial, microbes are either killed or, if they carry resistance genes, survive. These survivors will replicate, and their progeny will quickly become the dominant type throughout the microbial population.\u201d The more the microbes are the bigger the chances for them to develop drug resistance.

            "answer_text": "You are responsible for your own actions. You can hope, you can pray, you can dream, and other forces have power over parts of your life, but if you don\u2019t leave the house and make things happen they never will \u2014 and anything you do wrong, YOU did wrong.Do what matters to you and to those you love. You may have a bunch of stuff you have to do that matters to no one, including yourself, in order to get through life, but do not forget to take care of yourself in all things.Your perception is not shared. Everyone has their own map of what they want, what they need, and what to do to get them. You can help them follow their maps, just as they can help you with yours, but never ever forget that YOUR map only affects YOU and YOUR map isn\u2019t THEIR map.Love yourself. It\u2019s hard to accept or even receive other people\u2019s care if you cannot find the value in You. It definitely helps you to share your love with others if you have a wellspring to work with.And the harshest truth that comes to me at this moment: A short-term win often leads to a long-term loss. Be wise in your choices and consider their future outcomes. Do not bank upon \u201cI won\u2019t be here when that wolf comes calling\u201d because it eventually will come knocking \u2014 and if by some fate it doesn\u2019t find you in life, it will find others you wouldn\u2019t wish its company on.",
