            "answer_text": "A quite famous case is DNA structure co-discoverer Francis Crick. The claims that he was on LSD when he did important discoveries on DNA structure are almost certainly false, but there is little doubt he did use LSD later in his life. Maybe Richard Feynman. He was interested but also reluctant, and the other elements are not clear. If you would consider them \u201cintellectuals,\u201d both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have confessed doing LSD in their youth in public interviews. ",

His book, dancing naked in the field of mind, is hilarious and awesome. ",
