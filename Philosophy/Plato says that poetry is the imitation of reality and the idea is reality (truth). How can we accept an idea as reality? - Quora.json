            "answer_text": "Well there is \u201cinvisible virtual reality\u201d and \u201cphysical reality.\u201d An \u201cupper case\u201d IDEA is distinct from a \u201clower case\u201d idea. That is, the lower case is an \u201cimpression\u201d a \u201ccopy,\u201d and sometimes a \u201ccheap imitation\u201d of the original IDEA. The lower case idea include \u201cconceptualization\u201d in the imagination. That is, we get a \u201cconcept of \u2018it,\u2019 whatever \u2018IT\u2019 is.\u201d We try to get a symmetric MIRROR image but we are fortunate if we could get crude anthropomorphic asymmetric grasps that reflect/reflex the \u201cequivalences,\u201d \u201cthe same,\u201d and/or \u201csimilar\u201d expressions between the two aspects of the same reality. When we are cognizant and recognize the \u201ccross connections\u201d between the invisible idea and physical manifestation, then we can identify and accept that the idea is \u201creality\u201d and not in the upper case IDEA and/or lower case idea dimension without a physical equivalence. For example, let us pretend that the \u201cearth thinks.\u201d Now we have some approach to watching the earth transform into poetics.  The sonnet above was composed between 1981\u20131983, which less than four revisions. The \u201cidea\u201d that the earth is a thinking articulate planet and a poem \u201cimitates\u201d AS IF the expression of the names of physical geographical locations and persons are true. Mythologist Joseph Campbell, during an interview with Bill Moyers, suggested that we \u201clook beyond the physical and see the world as a poem.\u201d But, if we do so, the mind boggling events are so far spread out, it appears as if \u201cinvisible\u201d because most people stare at the physical objects, rather than how they all are part of a broader picture, the World as Idea and Will, for example.
