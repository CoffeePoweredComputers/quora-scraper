            "answer_text": "I would hope that seeking the truth is an act we conduct by default. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Religious people are the prime example of people whose priority is not to seek the truth but to seek comforting beliefs, in spite of truth, facts and evidence. Believing in a talking snake and a magic genie residing in the clouds, is symptomatic of a personality disorder that is disturbingly all too pervasive. These people are worse than irrational, they are dangerous. Living in a fantasy world may be one\u2019s \u201cright\u201d, but lest we forget\u2014these beguiled fools VOTE. You ask how seeking the truth manifests itself: I say, look no further than science, philosophy, mathematics, medicine. So the important question to ask is Are you a falsehood seeker\u2014and how does this trait manifest itself? America\u2019s conspicuous absence from the Paris Accord on Climate Change is a glaring example. People who deny facts because they are not pleasant or are not comforting, threaten the well being of society. ",

            "answer_text": "I think a few of the most difficult parts to being someone who\u2019s a \u201ctruth seeker\u201d is that they have to value the truth, or their own truths, higher than other things that may be commonly held above the truth. For example, not being afraid to be wrong is a huge factor. If there\u2019s a timidity to act due to the fear of being proved wrong, then there\u2019s a good chance that one will never know. Another factor has to do with asking questions. How often do you ask questions? Finding out the truth of certain matters or figuring out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false oftentimes requires a circling of questions to be asked. Finding truth isn\u2019t a straight path, it\u2019s a spiraling circle, where each point or fact is analyzed and then upon the next round, is broken down another level until the most fundamental of levels is reached.

True I lost many a friend over that situation of being in your face asking questions. \u201cWhy lie be honest, for gosh sakes!\u201d One area you have a tough time in is finding the prices per ton on ingredients in your medications. One pill was marked up 1,200% the ingredients cost 29 cents per pill! Most chemicals for meds come from China. I bet you didn\u2019t know that! It took me days to find that honest answer! Truth is Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want you to know what they make selling pills! \u201cThey dislike being honest. Gee, I wonder why? It\u2019s all about money.\u201d ",

To see a truth, look at the lie that is being told, how much more work it takes to do it and how many times a thousand more words it takes to relate a lie. E.g. Election of November 2016 Truth: Donald Trump as well as 62,000,000 legal voters in 30 states won it. Lie: All the words that have been written and said since then denying it, would not fit on a sheet of continuous paper rolls that have circled the universe. ",
