            "answer_text": "The modern scientific method is fairly well limited to the study of cause and effect within the four dimensional world that we appear to live in.  The scientific method does not seem to do well in attempting to answer other questions pertaining to existentialism or religion. Such philosophical questions may well apply to dimensions beyond our apparent four dimensional reality.           Many scientists seem to have the mistaken belief that because in the last few centuries the modern scientific method has successfully and rightfully undone or disproven so many former \"religious beliefs\" that therefore, no religious beliefs could possibly have any validity.  Furthermore, many such scientists seem to now have begun to carry this logic even further and to have started investing into science the same types of \"blind faith\" that were formally accorded primarily to religious beliefs.  \"Blind faith\" is nearly always problematic, both in religion, and even in science. For example, blanket pronouncements that the modern scientific method has already reasonably proven the extinction of consciousness upon the annihilation of the brain are a bit presumptuous as any such claim would necessarily have to be based upon the presumption that the exact nature of consciousness was already a reasonably well settled scientific matter.  Any quantum physicist will readily admit that the whole idea of what it means to be an observer, or being \"conscious\" is something that science has only recently just begun to crack the door open upon, and which is yet far far from being a well settled scientific matter. The modern scientific method can easily and handily point out the moment when a flame has extinguished itself.  This would be the moment when the production of heat ceases in the given instance of combustion.  In order for the modern scientific method to be capable of pointing out the moment when the ability to observe, or \"consciousness\" might be extinguished, it would also have to first have a similar understanding as to what exactly consciousness is. The modern scientific method correctly reveals that combustion is a heat producing process, and therefore it can easily monitor its presence or absence.   To this day, the modern scientific method has failed to enable a precise definition of, or a full understanding of the exact nature of consciousness, therefore how could the modern scientific method be capable of enabling the slightly presumptuous claim that the exact moment when consciousness is no longer (is extinguished) has been easily determined?  A recent study into exactly this question unequivocally proved that infact consciousness, with full awareness of one's surroundings, certainly is capable of persisting well after the shut-down of one's brain. Instead, many scientists seem to prefer to make the leap of faith that is required whenever anyone states anything to the effect that anything that does not support our \"credo of materialism\" is by definition impossible, and therefore false.  The credo of materialism being the belief that: \"nothing exists beyond time and space.\"  The same credo itself, becoming all the more ridiculous, as highlighted by the fact that most theoretical physicists even now acknowledge that there was indeed \"something\" that existed, even before time itself, \"time\" being widely recognized as only having started, as we currently understand it, at the time of the \"Big Bang\". Scientists who would make such sweeping claims about the supposed abilities of the modern scientific method to answer such philosophical questions would do well to instead acknowledge that the level of comprehension of the universe so far achieved by the modern scientific method, as Einstein once described, thus far resembles to him the level of understanding of a small child pondering over a great library, who has not yet even learned how to read. On the day that the disciplines of science, philosophy, and religion finally begin to properly recognize the value of one another, and begin to widely acknowledge their own respective limitations, perhaps only then will we begin to have a more truly whole and complete understanding of the universe which we inhabit.

            "answer_text": "Every theory that scientists produce is defined by its boundary conditions. This is a recognition that theories only apply to what they can apply to, so it would be pointless, for example, to take a hypothesis derived from Quantum Theory and try to use it to predict the behaviour of people buying onions. In the most general terms, much of our established science is based upon two principles: 1. That phenomena are consistent and reliable; and 2. That we can exercise complete control over the experimental situation. This has resulted in great success and amazing discoveries, leading to numerous useful applications in everyday life. But there are many phenomena that lie outside the boundaries defined by these principles \u2014 telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, hauntings, time slips, UFOs, glitches, and others less well defined. Many people who regard themselves as scientists, or at least supportive of scientific method, will automatically reject such occurrences, and instead of explaining them will try to explain them away. They are not rejected because there is no evidence for them \u2014 indeed there is a mountain of evidence \u2014 but because they violate the two basic principles and cannot be predicted or controlled. So we have a situation where some scientists reject certain phenomena because they cannot be investigated as other phenomena can, while others have tried to study at least some of them using experimental means. All we can do otherwise is to collect data and employ inductive methodologies to derive hypotheses about their mode of operation. This situation will likely continue for decades to come. ",
