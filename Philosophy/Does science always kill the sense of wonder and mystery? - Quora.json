            "answer_text": "I wish to replace the word \"mystery\" with \"beauty\" above. Not according to Richard Feynman, who said that he felt that science and the understanding of how things worked enhanced the beauty of a sunset. At the same time Feynman did an experiment where he tried to be able to count out five minutes in his head while simultaneously holding a conversation and he couldn't do it, but someone else who he had a bet with was able too, by visualizing a ticking clock instead. Some things diminish other things. Some things do not. I cannot appreciate the visceral beauty of a sunset while simultaneously considering the beauty of its physical optics. I can, however, individually appreciate both, and I can do so fully. Feynman strongly implied that he could hold both types of beauty in his mind simultaneously. I can only do one thing at a time . Perhaps some people cannot do this. Perhaps for them, one thing does diminish the other. Richard Feynman - Wikipedia Science definitely kills the mystery\u2014that's what I like about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Not for me. The concepts and discoveries related to relativity, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, molecular biology, paleontology, and more give my imagination a greater sense of awe, wonder and mystery than any fiction created by an author. Just the mental exercise and thought experiments that those branches (and others) provide are enough to excite, stimulate and give me seemingly endless concepts with which to contemplate. Add to that the core principle that any/all science should be challenged, tested, reproduced so that current understanding/theories are being refined and replaced with even better models of existence? It means that (at least to me) the potential for wonder, mystery and awe are going to always be there. ",

            "answer_text": "It does if that\u2019s how you perceive it. Scientific discoveries usually throw up more follow up questions and increase the wonder and mystery whilst also providing useful knowledge which can benefit our species. I would be hugely surprised if we were ever to discover everything there is to need to know. On an individual basis this is utterly impossible and there will always be an exponentially growing void of wonder and mystery. The more you learn, the more you realise how much you don\u2019t know!
