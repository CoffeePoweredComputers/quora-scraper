            "answer_text": "Some esoteric philosophical books use afterlife as a metaphor for life. Take for example, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which was read to a dead person in front of their family. Now obviously the teaching isn\u2019t for the dead person, it is for the family - but this is a skillful means of delivering weird and potentially insightful teachings to people who are in emotional pain. What appears to be focused on death is in fact attempting to guide us in life and help us make good and responsible choices. ",
