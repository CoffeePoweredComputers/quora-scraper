            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not an example of circular reasoning. Jesus lived, died and rose. This we know from both biblical and non-biblical sources. He is a historical figure, whatever you might think of him. Now, Jesus made some pretty fantastic claims. As one scholar aptly put it, Jesus was either a lunatic, a liar or who he claimed to be - God in the flesh and the Savior of the world. Assuming we are not going to identify Jesus as a lunatic or a liar, we will probably at least own that he was a pretty remarkable character. Most people will admit that Jesus has credibility. He was at least a very \u201cgood man.\u201d So, we have to give some credence to his opinions. And Jesus clearly thought very highly of the Old Testament. Jesus quoted extensively from the \u201cBible\u201d that was available at the time - the Old Testament. He spoke of the law of God as recorded in the O.T. and said not the smallest part of it - not even part of a letter or punctuation would fail to be fulfilled (Matthew 5:18). Jesus also referred to history as recorded in the Old Testament. He never implied that it was just a bunch of stories. He spoke about Sodom and Gomorrah and Jonah and Noah\u2019s flood as historical fact. He rebuked the religious leaders for holding to human customs rather than the Word of God (referring to the O.T.) These are just a few examples. But, by reading the gospels, we can see that Jesus took validated the Bible of his time. More than that, we see that Jesus fulfilled many Old Testament prophecies. Here\u2019s an interesting article along those lines Did Jesus Fulfill Old Testament Prophecy? - Josh.org So, if Christ believed, quoted, validated and fulfilled the Old Testament, then it would not be circular reasoning to say it is true because he believed it to be so.

            "answer_text": "A2A - Is the statement \"The Bible is true because Jesus says it's true\" an example of circular reasoning? No, not necessarily (although it can be). The circularity would be if we start with the assumtion that the Bible is true. However, if we simply start with the assumption that the Bible contains a group of biographies written by early followers of Jesus within the lifetime of his first disciples who knew Him personally, then we can reasonably claim that Jesus probably made these claims (since more than one author reports it, and it agrees with our knowledge of what most 1st century Jews believed about the Scriptures \u2014 there are actually two claims by Jesus: one for the the already existing Hebrew Scriptures, and one about his own words and teaching remaining). The important implied premiss, is that if Jesus was who all 4 early gospels and the other New Testament writings portrayed Him to be, He has the knowledge to know if the Bible is true (and at least the authority as Teacher/Master/Rabbi for all Christians for them to follow his teaching). Then, if we accept his position as Messiah and Son of God, his claims for the Bible provides the foundation for our view of Scripture. It becomes more than simply a number of relatively accurate (but probably flawed) biographies of his life\u2026 it becomes the Word of God. ",
