            "answer_text": "The Hard Problem has three distinct components. How does phenomenal consciousness (hereafter \u201cphenomenality\u201d) fit into physics?Why does it happen in the brain, and thus, where else might it happen?What is its causal or explanatory role? We seem to be able to subtract it from our picture of the world and leave the world unchanged (except for thinking and talking about it).This is new: There\u2019s no understanding the field without realizing that the problem proper divides into the first two parts. Consider the three big names. On the first question, John Searle and David Chalmers are broadly in agreement and both think Daniel Dennett couldn\u2019t be more wrong. On the second question, however, Chalmers and Dennett are completely in agreement and Searle thinks they\u2019re both completely wrong. (Footnote 3 on Searle\u2019s position has another such example.) There are four distinct viable ideas for answering question 1. And, no, that phenomenality is simply an emergent property of the brain\u2019s function is not one of them. Making it emergent is option 4, but it requires rewriting physics literally from the bottom up. It\u2019s the most radical solution, not the least. Question 2 is much more muddled. Certain ideas are compatible with one another\u2014for instance, you can give one answer for color experiences , and another for pain\u2014and none is truly satisfying. Question 3\u2014the problem of \u201cmental causation\u201d\u2014is philosophically the most important, and seems to be 100% insoluble. Everyone regards the notion that phenomenality is causally, explanatorily, and behaviorally irrelevant to be obviously unacceptable, but no one has a clue as how to actually make it otherwise. And now the details \u2026 I\u2019ll try to do a chunk of this each evening and try to finish by Sunday. Question 1: How does phenomenality fit into physics? There\u2019s no remotely satisfying way to put the four viable options in order. What I think makes the most sense is to go from the least radical, in terms of changing physics, to the most. But that also means starting with the most obscure! Ideopsychism (the term is my own, and is meant to contrast with \u201cpanpsychism\u201d) proposes that phenomenality is instantiated by new physical entities that are not part of the Standard Model of physics, but can be integrated with it. In every version I can conceive of, phenomenality is a fundamental property of these entities. Ideopsychism historically comes in three flavors. There\u2019s the overly vague version I just gave. There is particle ideopsychism (option 1 in our taxonomy), which proposes that the unknown entities are particles and their associated fields, and there is field ideopsychism (option 2), which proposes that phenomenality is a field that is not part of the Standard Model but has no corresponding particle. (Yes, technically this is field-only ideopsychism, but I think this terminology is clear nevertheless.) Field ideopsychism was proposed in 1962 by one of the most eminent philosophers of the half-century, Wilfrid Sellars, in one of his two most famous papers, \u201cPhilosophy and the Scientific Image of Man.\u201d By proposing a field without a particle, he sought to avoid what has become known as the \u201cgrain problem,\u201d the mystery of how phenomenality can be so very unitary in nature if it originates from a large group of physical entities. [1] It was ignored. I invented particle ideopsychism in 1998 and had the idea enthusiastically vetted as workable by one of the world\u2019s most eminent philosophers of physics, David Z. Albert (here\u2019s that story). I first presented it in public in 1999. William G. Lycan labelled Sellars\u2019 version \u201coutrageous\u201d in a 2003 paper and went on to characterize ideopsychism in general as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cgrotesque.\u201d This happened to be in the lead paper in the book Chomsky and his Critics, and Chomsky strongly defended ideopsychism as reasonable in his reply. And since new physics historically has always meant new particles, I take this to mean that Chomsky specifically regards particle ideopsychism as a worthy class of solution. And you\u2019ve got to like an idea that both Noam Chomsky and David Albert think is viable! Particle ideopsychism, to my knowledge, first appears in the literature in a 2013 paper by Berit Brogaard of the University of Miami. [2] I encountered it in her paper \u201cIn Search of Mentons: Panpsychism, Physicalism, and the Missing Link\u201d in the 2017 collection Panpsychism: Contemporary Perspectives (yes, she got to propose her alternative to panpsychism in a collection of papers supporting and exploring it). She doesn\u2019t seem to be aware that Chomsky has her back! For the other reasons that particle ideopsychism is our best best, you\u2019ll have to wait for my book. Field ideopsychism has had only one other supporter that I know of, and he\u2019s a recent convert to the position. But like Sellars, he\u2019s also profoundly eminent: John Searle. Sellars may or may not explain why and/or how he thinks fields he called \u201csensa\u201d are produced in the brain. I have to read his further work on his theory, and he\u2019s a notoriously unclear and obscure writer. Searle has phenomenality as a field produced by an ontologically unique type of emergence, which (arbitrarily, I believe) combines the features he needs from ordinary (\u201cweak\u201d) emergence and \u201cstrong\u201d emergence. [3] He\u2019s adamant that such fields emerge as the result of the brain\u2019s neurobiology, but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s ever explained why or how that might be (his latest ideas are in a journal paper which has not yet been collected or appeared online). I think that field ideopsychism is highly dubious\u2014the particle version has all the advantages and none of the drawbacks\u2014but it\u2019s not demonstrably false, and it obviously has been supported by smart people. Next: the two remaining viable options. They are both versions of the already-mentioned panpsychism. [1] Yes, you have to be unschooled in physics to not realize that any field solves the grain problem, even if it originates in a particle. [2] I think that\u2019s the case. The price of the book where the paper appears has recently dropped at Amazon to $114. [3] From weak emergence, he grabs the idea that phenomenality follows with metaphysical necessity from its physical substrates, and that it therefore has the same causal role. But he vehemently denies that it is thus in any way identical to its substrates, or can be reduced to them, since that\u2019s a position that\u2019s easy to falsify. That phenomenality cannot be reduced to (or deduced from) its physical substrates is a key characteristic of strong emergence\u2014which if fully embraced, however, would make phenomenality metaphysically contingent (optional) and causally irrelevant. This same \u201ctake what you need and leave the rest\u201d strategy is also used by the position called non-reductive materialism\u2014but its advocates justify it as a consequence of the truth of functionalism. And Searle is the world\u2019s leading anti-functionalist\u2014that\u2019s what his famous \u201cChinese Room\u201d thought experiment argues. Strong emergence is a dualist solution while weak emergence is monist\u2014and Searle argues that that distinction is not relevant. (I just got the relationship between this claim and the fact that his solution combines elements of monism and dualism\u2014and that\u2019s the reason I write these answers!) ",

            "answer_text": "The hard problem is the difficulty in describing \u2018mind\u2019 in the language of science. The scientific literature doesn\u2019t yet include a theory of sentience, doesn\u2019t contain a description of the physics of the observer. The physical characteristics of our brain produce something to experience. The perceiver of that experience possesses a faculty for experiencing that which it perceives. Some argue that the capacity to have experience is a capacity of the brain. Some argue that causality goes the other way, argue that consciousness somehow creates something that the perceiver can experience. Like ideas pursue causality and never really get anywhere in that pursuit. Instead, I abandon causality and use relativity, complementarity, and symmetry to construct a model of consciousness; and from that model, a new conservation law is derived. Relativity allows causality to be abandoned as the principle connecting the perceiver to the perceived. Relativity allows us to instead describe mind and body as bound via the acausal connecting principle of complementarity. Regarding science as a quest for symmetry, see Science: the Quest for Symmetry | 3 Quarks Daily, written by Quora contributor Yohan John, last two paragraphs of that article: Metaphysical speculations about the \u201cfundamental\u201d nature of the universe often posit the existence of a basic substance: something that exists at all times and in all places, uniform and unchanging. The symmetry perspective seems to preclude the scientific discovery of any such universal invariant. In order to discover a symmetry, we need an underlying asymmetry \u2014 a measuring stick or reference. If we take seriously the idea that science is symmetry, we can ask ourselves what the underlying asymmetry might be. What is the ultimate reference frame \u2014 the messy backdrop against which the neat symmetries of science show up in stark relief? Can we conceive of anything that is fundamentally asymmetrical? I can only offer some wild speculation. There seem to be three grand metaphysical concepts that no one can really agree on: existence, time, and mind. The symmetry perspective does not really shed much light on these imponderables, but it might allow us to link them to each other. Symmetry is immunity to a possible change. What exists \u2014 what is visible through the Symmetry Spectacles \u2014 must be susceptible to change. Change and time are thoroughly entangled. To measure a change is to compare two points in time. But to compare two points in time, something must be measurably changed. And it seems to me that in order to measure anything at all there must be a mind \u2014 a subjectivity that is restlessly aware of the passage of time and the accretion of changes. Perhaps the mind is the fundamental asymmetry: the process that is never quite the same from one moment to the next. John\u2019s speculation in the 2nd paragraph isn\u2019t quite correct. Here\u2019s why. A \u201cmeasuring stick or reference\u201d is not a description that fits the idea of asymmetry. Instead, a measuring stick or reference ordinarily is conceived as being a standard body of reference, a fixed (continuous, persistent) rod against which variation is measured in space-time. Physics at root measures with a rod and a clock. The face of a clock shows changes in its hand\u2019s positions. The hands of a clock represent variation and we discern that the face of the clock does not change while the hands of the clock sweep around in a circle. The face of the clock is like a symmetry against which change is measured. A rod is used to measure variation. Conversely, variation distinguishes invariance as a fixed standard body of reference against which variation is measured. That\u2019s relativity, and a standard body of reference must be fixed stationary, unchanging. That\u2019s because if the measuring rod\u2014the fixed standard body of reference\u2014varies, it becomes part of the variation it would be used to measure. Hence, a variation can\u2019t be used to measure itself, not being independent and fixed. Relativity tells us that motion of an independent object cannot be measured except in relation to and independent invariable. A ruler is independent of the object of its measurement. Conversely, an object of measurement must be independent of the object used to measure it. So let\u2019s rewrite John\u2019s first paragraph from above. My rewrite: Metaphysical speculations about the \u201cfundamental\u201d nature of the universe often posit the existence of a basic substance: something that exists at all times and in all places, uniform and unchanging. The symmetry perspective doesn\u2019t seem to preclude the scientific discovery of any such universal invariant. In order to discover a symmetry, we need an underlying asymmetry \u2014 an independent variation as a reference against which an independent invariance may be discerned. If we take seriously the idea that science is symmetry, we can ask ourselves what the underlying symmetry might be. For instance, we discovered that energy is conserved by measuring variation and then accounting for the work-products resulting from that variation. We found that the quantity of energy is unaffected by change. The invariance of the rod allowed us to do an accounting of the energy involved over a duration of a variation. That accounting showed that energy was conserved, did not change despite change. Hence, we discovered a symmetry in nature using our science. We can ask a broader question. We can ask this: What is the ultimate reference frame \u2014 the messy backdrop against which the neat symmetries of science show up in stark relief? Can we conceive of anything that is fundamentally asymmetrical? John recognizes that one must identify a variation, an asymmetry, in order to identify a phenomenal that does not vary in relation to that asymmetry. Variation distinguishes invariance because in contrast to variation, invariance doesn\u2019t change at all. So in science, when an invariance\u2014symmetry\u2014is not known to us, we use a rod and a clock to find it via an accounting that such instrumentation allows. That is science\u2019s search for symmetry, that\u2019s the symmetry perspective that is a productive perspective in science. When a symmetry isn\u2019t known, then from exploring asymmetry, symmetry may be discovered using a rod and a clock. John then asks what might be the ultimate \u201c\u2026messy backdrop against which the neat symmetries of science show up in stark relief.\u201d The ultimate fundamental asymmetry is said to have begun with a big bang, an event from which the ultimate messy backdrop of the universe emerged. It is our investigation of that fundamental asymmetry that has revealed its neat symmetries. Hence, his is the wrong question because we already know the answer. The question is, what is the ultimate symmetry that we have as yet to discover? With a rewrite of John\u2019s second paragraph above, we will have an answer. My rewrite: I can only offer some wild speculation. There seem to be three grand metaphysical concepts that no one can really agree on: existence, space-time, and mind. Science uses variability of objects in space-time to discover hitherto unknown symmetries. Science\u2019s symmetry spectacles play around with variation in order to discover a phenomenal that does not change and is therefore a symmetry, an invariance, a sameness, a repetition. Relativity informs us that it takes a variation\u2014an asymmetry\u2014in order for a neat symmetry to show itself to science in stark relief. Relativity also informs us that the converse is also true. Namely, in order for variation to be measured, a variation must be set in relation to at least one independent invariant. That invariant, a rod, makes measurements of change possible. Consequently, there is another set of symmetry spectacles to consider. Namely, it is also from a known phenomenal symmetry that variation itself can be discovered. That alternative symmetry perspective does shed light light on the imponderables of existence, space-time, and mind. It allows us to link them to each other. Here\u2019s how. Our mind observes change. Therefore, by relativity, the mind, in order to observe change, must also contain an independent invariant against which change may be discerned. To measure a change is to compare two points in time. But to compare two points in time, something must be measurably changed in its relation to something that does not change. In our mind, what might that invariant be? Symmetry is immunity to a possible change. What is it that exists as an independent invariable, what is it in \u2018mind\u2019 that is insusceptible to change? Have you guessed the answer? Because with our conversely prepared symmetry spectacles, we should already know of that phenomenal symmetry. When you already know the symmetry, there\u2019s no reason to look for that symmetry by measuring and then accounting for variation. Instead, variation\u2019s existence serves to confirm that an known invariant is an invariant because it is only from that invariance as a point for measurement that change can be physically discerned. If there is one thing of which we may be certain, it\u2019s that we can make discriminations well enough to just take that faculty for granted. From 18th century philosopher David Hume\u2019s essay Of Personal Identity: There are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment intimately conscious of what we call our self; that we feel its existence and its continuance in existence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfect identity and simplicity. The strongest sensation, the most violent passion, say they, instead of distracting us from this view, only fix it the more intensely, and make us consider their influence on self either by their pain or pleasure. To attempt a further proof of this were to weaken its evidence; since no proof can be derived from any fact of which we are so intimately conscious; nor is there anything of which we can be certain if we doubt of this. In that essay, Hume describes two senses of self. One that varies along with variable circumstances. And one sense of self that is a sense of it\u2019s own continuity. Personal identity is described by Hume to be \u201cI\u201d-ness, a simple sameness always equal to itself, an identity, a personal identity, distinct and invariant over the duration of a lifetime. That\u2019s the fundamental symmetry, \u2018you\u2019, that makes the variation in our stream of consciousness interpretable as change. That which is interpreted is the fundamental asymmetry against which the neat symmetries of nature reveal. That according to the principle of relativity. That is an in principle an identification of personal identity, not \u2018consciousness\u2019, as being a fundamental just as much as are fundamental charge, mass, and space-time. I develop that idea into an experimentally verified theory of sentience in organisms, develop that idea here: Charles Wood's answer to Will there ever be a tool to figure out whether another living being is conscious or not? There\u2019s a shorter presentation of that idea here: Charles Wood's answer to What are the examples of objective reality? From that, it is clear from science that there cannot be a theory to explain how the brain produces a faculty for having experience. Instead, that faculty is inherent in the ego, and the ego is inherent in all life. That theory is formed of a datum, two principles, and a deduction. It leaves us to wonder, what is personal identity (Hume\u2019s use of that term intended) that it existed independent of and concomitant with the other building blocks of life. It isn\u2019t \u2018consciousness\u2019 that is fundamental. Instead, it is the ego, personal identity, that is fundamental and independent of that which we call physicality. There is no good reason to not just allow \u2018ego\u2019 as physicality although we aren\u2019t used to thinking of our core self as physicality. Relativity says it is, so deal. ",

Chalmers asks how is it that physical phenomenon and experience which are physically processed give rise to such a rich inner life. It is done by abstraction which is one of the operations of the intellect, the faculty of thought, and transcends the life of mere sense. Information from reality, extra-mental life, is the source of phenomena and is known after the mode of our knowing which is immaterial. In other words this entire operation is spiritual and transcends sense experience. Brute animals are awake and alert to particular events but are not self aware. That belongs to rational beings and this is man who judges, willfully focuses and pays attention. judges, understands, reasons, forms concepts and syllogisms etc. And who senses and knows and understands. The difficulty arises in the denial of a spiritual soul, a simple form, which unites with the body to form the person. The admission of this brings about many insurmountable difficulties to many. Chalmers states that perhaps the hard problem will never be solved. I have no problem with its solution. This rich inner life, this subjective aspect, is the Ego, the \u201c I \u201c which experiences through the senses the extra mental world , the \u201c I \u201c of course is the person. The problem cannot and will never be solved without the admission that we have faculties that transcend sense and matter, that the brain has its proper place in the whole scheme of things but it cannot reflect or introspect because it cannot turn back on itself, and that the \u201c I \u201c possesses the fullness of existence,and this is neither body alone nor soul alone but body and soul. The easy problems cannot be solved by physical processes alone either. I think \u201c Aquinas on Human Self-Knowledge \u201c by Therese Cory Scarpelli puts all of this to rest, completely. ",

            "answer_text": "What a wonderful question. I have thought about this question in one form or another since I first realized that I was conscious of my own thoughts. This was somewhere around age 10, and questions like this are the reason I chose a career in psychology. Fair warning: It\u2019s a big question so my answer is not short. A two-paragraph answer just won\u2019t cut it here. So, my take on the so-called \u201chard problem\u201d of consciousness, as posed by David Chalmers & others, is that it isn\u2019t a question that science can address. It\u2019s off in that fuzzy philosophical realm that questions why certain things *feel* the way they do, or how to account for particular qualia (why blue *looks* blue rather than some other color), or why there is any sense of experience at all. Rather than get tangled up in issues such as these, I believe that the best approach is to start with what we know of consciousness, lay it all out on the table, and see if there are any parts missing. Here is what I have learned about consciousness. It takes place in the cortex, and seems to be focused mostly in the prefrontal cortex. Its contents are limited to events that take place in the cortex, so all the subcortical events are invisible to it. A further restriction is that in order for something to be conscious, it has to have a certain minimal extent in space and time. Localized events in cortex that proceed normally, such as the assembly of visual features into larger and larger composite perceptions, do not reach consciousness. Neither do events that occur too quickly. There isn\u2019t a fixed lower threshold for consciousness, but it\u2019s clearly on the order of 50 to 100 milliseconds (100 msec is a tenth of a second). One more attribute worth noting is that consciousness is \u201csingle-threaded.\u201d We are only conscious of a single core process, such as solving a problem or making a decision. Everything else is either unconscious or, in the case of the previous thought and the next one, at the \u201cedges\u201d of consciousness as they move in and out of focus. So, put those attributes together and what do we have that can be stated in scientific terms? Simply this: What we call consciousness is the prefrontal cortex monitoring and integrating the high-level activities taking place throughout the cortex. Nothing more. Nothing less. Now we come to the fun part. How is it that we can be conscious of being conscious? We are obviously aware of being conscious; otherwise the question you asked could never even come up. So do we need another level of monitoring to explain that? No. The process of monitoring and integrating cortical processes includes the prefrontal cortex and hence the monitoring process itself. And, of course, the awareness of the monitoring is also within the scope of the monitoring, so it, too, is consciousness. It\u2019s a little like the facing mirrors in a barber shop: we see an image of ourselves that contains the image we are seeing, which includes a smaller image, and so on. But I don\u2019t think it goes many levels in the brain. My guess is that three levels are enough: We are aware of what\u2019s happening in our brains, we are aware of that awareness, and we can be sufficiently aware of that higher-level awareness to analyze it over time and wonder about it. To sum up, I think that consciousness is the brain monitoring its own processes, and that this self-reflective aspect produces an experience that has real depth and power for us. Now, this still doesn\u2019t say why the brain has *any* experience of itself. But trying to imagine a brain like ours that *doesn\u2019t* have an awareness of its own processes just leads you to what philosophers call the zombie problem. If you can imagine people walking around, doing the things people do everyday, but having no awareness of their own existence, then you\u2019re basically saying that zombies \u2013unconscious automata \u2013 are a real possibility. But if you ask one of these zombies what her thoughts and feelings are, she will give you perfectly adequate answers. In which case she wouldn\u2019t really be a zombie, would she? In short, I don\u2019t believe there really is a \u201chard problem\u201d with consciousness. I have a theory of consciousness that tells me what it is, how it evolved, what it does, and why it seems so deep and self-reflective. If there is still a problem to be solved \u2013 and many philosophers maintain that there is \u2013 then I have no idea how to even frame it in scientific terms. By the way, I put this question in the same box as the classic mind-body problem. Once you know enough about the brain, you realize that the mind is the activity of the brain. Nothing more, nothing less. What we call mind is simply the private, inner view the brain has of itself. The brain has no physical senses so it can\u2019t perceive the reality of its own physical nature, so it feels like it\u2019s abstract and detached from the physical brain. But to think it is a non-physical entity that is separate from that brain is to confuse a process with an entity, creating a \u201cproblem\u201d that simply doesn\u2019t exist. I suspect that the \u201chard problem\u201d of consciousness will go the way of the mind-body problem once we get a better handle on the underlying processes. ",

            "answer_text": "Notice that all theories are based on ideas (number, form and meaning). Plainly, ideas are dimensionless, without substance or duration or any discernible qualities. They are simply Known. Could any idea exist that is not Known? Plainly, Knowing-ideas is a facet of Consciousness\u2026 whatever it is. All rigorous scientific theories are ideas about the observed world expressed as mathematical models (ideas) of the behaviour of mathematically defined \u2018objects\u2019, such as fields and sub-atomic particles, etc (more ideas). We say a theory is valid when the behaviour of the theoretical objects reliably maps the behaviour of observed objects. All \u2018emergence\u2019 is about emergent \u2018behaviour\u2019. Behaviour mapping behaviour and behaviour emerging from behaviour is hardly surprising! Plainly, there is a correlation between observed behaviour of bodies and brains, the theories that map the behaviour, and Awareness of things and events. However, theories say nothing about the essence or cause of observation, or the nature of observed objects. They say nothing about Consciousness. No theory ever can, for no idea (about reality) can be reality. Seeing-colours is real. It not remotely like any \u2018idea\u2019 (theory) about it. If it was possible to devise a theory of reality that was real, the theory itself would See! Can you imagine a \u2018colour\u2019 being if there is nothing to See it? What about a feeling? Could a feeling exist that is not Felt? How could any sensation exist that is not Sensed? Plainly, Sensing-sensations (colours, odours, flavours, feelings and sounds) is also a facet of Consciousness\u2026 whatever it is. From a scientific perspective, \u2018light waves\u2019 are said to be the cause of Seeing-colours. Yet, \u2018light\u2019 is invisible. It is a small part of the electro-magnetic radiation (EMR) spectrum. From a scientific perspective, \u2018EMR\u2019 ceases to exist the moment it hits the retina. Only very specific wavelengths result in a electro-chemical impulse along the optic nerves to the visual cortex at the back of the head, where (according to science) colours appear in the absence of light. On this view, there is no \u2018little person\u2019 inside the head looking out through the eyes into the theorised material world. All the signals are from the \u2018outside\u2019 to \u2018in\u2019. Even more astounding, on this view of the \u2018emergence of colour inside the head\u2019, the coloured patterns must perceive themselves as separate objects, separate from the observer! It is as though the patterns of colour on a computer screen (that represent objects and creatures in a \u2018game-world\u2019) could see themselves, not as the patterns on the screen but as separate objects being observed from the perspective of one of the characters in the game! Plainly, every apparent object is \u2018illusory\u2019. It appears to be something it is not: coloured patterns (and other sensations) appearing to be \u2018things\u2019 and \u2018events\u2019 as meaning (ideas) are associated with the sensory images. Rather than theorise, simply notice the visual field. Look straight ahead. Notice the visual field appears like a circle with an indefinite edge. Without moving the head or eyes, notice that \u2018beyond\u2019 the \u2018edge \u2019 is neither black nor white\u2026 simply nothing. Notice \u2018your\u2019 body is not apparent. Now look down. Notice the body appears as a foreshortened image distorted by the \u2018laws of perspective\u2019, with only the front of the torso and limbs apparent\u2026 but no head. Where the head should be, the whole world appears, or at least that bit perceivable from the perspective of the person you seem to be. This is called The Single Eye of God. It is the Eye of Consciousness\u2026 the only Eye there is. Everything appears in it, and no where else. It has no discernible dimension, or substance, or duration. Far from Consciousness being inside a body, plainly the body is an appearance in it, along with everything else. \u2018Wait\u2019, I hear you say, \u2018I can feel my head\u2019. But notice, no \u2018feeling\u2019 or \u2018idea\u2019 (that the feeling is my head) is an actual head. Awareness is self-evident. It is this capacity to Sense-sensations and Know-ideas. Don\u2019t take my word for it. See for yourself\u2026 Notice that the patterns of colours in the visual field form 2D projections of Known 3D objects - distorted by the laws of perspective. Take a cube. This is Known to have six sides at right angles that are all the same size and shape that never change. Notice no such object has ever been seen! Each apparent cube shows only 1\u20133 sides that constantly change apparent size and shape, depending on the viewpoint of the observer. Notice the \u2018apparent changing object\u2019 is seen as a cube, only as the \u2018unchanging idea of cube\u2019 is associated with the image. A thing that changes size and shape cannot be a thing that does not change\u2026 it can only appear so. Such appearance is by definition an illusion. Or, hold the thumb close to the eye. Notice it appears to be larger than other objects Known to be orders of magnitude bigger than it. A thing that is smaller than other things cannot also be larger than them\u2026 it can only appear so. Such appearance is by definition an illusion Or, take the sides of a long straight road that are Known to be parallel. Plainly, they appear to converge towards the horizon. A thing that converges cannot also be a thing that is parallel- it can only appear so as the unchanging idea of \u2018parallel\u2019 is associated with the changing image. Such appearance is by definition an illusion. The same that now Sees these words being written is the same that now seems to be reading them. All that differs is the sensations and ideas together forming the body, thoughts, feelings and surroundings apparent in Consciousness. Now it appears \u2018I am the writer\u2019. And now it appears \u2018I am the reader\u2019. As one experience appears, there are no other experiences happening any where or any when else, as there is no where but here and no when but now. Science, Introspection and Religion all concur: the apparent world is a world of illusion. This is not to deny the \u2018objective world\u2019 as mapped by science. Only to recognise that such world is not separate from Consciousness. Nor is it to say that the \u2018material world\u2019 is identical with Consciousness. Panpsychism is just another idea. Though no idea can be like reality, rather than think in \u2018material\u2019 terms, think of the visual field more like a screen within which the \u2018objective world\u2019 is made apparent; and the \u2018laws of nature\u2019 discovered through science as more like a map of the software that runs a game-world. While the objects on the screen (in the visual field) obey the laws of the game-world (the laws of nature); in either case (in the game-world or in the objective world) there are no \u2018real\u2019 objects (apart from the Known forms and meaning that define them). There are only the rules (laws of nature) and the images created by the rules (laws of nature) on the screen (in the visual field)\u2026 and the ideas-Known that that give the forms meaning. Better yet, drop all ideas about what Consciousness is and how it works, and simply observe what unfolds. Science and technology are both wonders of Consciousness, no less than the natural world. Through them, the unimaginable depth and breadth of this universe is made manifest\u2026 though it is like looking through a key hole :) Consciousness is infinitely greater than this apparent universe, though not in dimension or duration. How can this be? Notice that the number, form and meaning of every experience depends upon the ideas associated with the sensory images that manifest the experience. Notice that no idea can ever change, for if it did it would be a different idea and not the idea it is. Notice each idea takes its meaning by reference to other ideas that take their meaning from still more ideas that take their meaning from the unchanging self-referential set of all ideas-Known. This Knowing-all-ideas-as-one is called: Omniscience. Plainly, Consciousness contains the ideas of all possible universes perceived as sensory images within its own Awareness from all possible perspectives - each in their turn\u2026 as One\u2019s \u2018nightly\u2019 dreams attest. Just as plainly, \u2018I am conscious, yet I am not aware of knowing everything\u2019! So, how can Consciousness be All-Knowing and not Know it? But notice\u2026 \u2018Ant\u2019 Until this word appeared was there any Awareness of Knowing or not-Knowing the idea associated with the word? Plainly, the meaning is not in the word, else it would be impossible for one word to have different meanings, or different words to have the same meaning. Words have meaning only as ideas are associated with them. What is true of \u2018words\u2019 is true of all \u2018things\u2019. Until the ideas (that give number, form and meaning to the appearance) are imaged via sensations there is no Awareness of the ideas-Known. This apparent lack of knowledge (ignorance) permits the appearance of each \u2018life\u2019 (as it is experienced), to be as if it is the only life ever lived. Whilesoever it appears \u2018I am this person\u2019, the \u2018person I seem to be\u2019 has no \u2018free will\u2019. Say \u2018you\u2019 choose for a reason, then it is not you but the reason that chooses. Had the reason been different the choice would be different. Or perhaps the choice was not based on reason but resulted from the pull of desire. Do \u2018you\u2019 manufacture your desires before they arise, deciding to manifest, say, the desire for chocolate, or does desire simply arise unbidden? If the desire had been different the choice would have been different. Only spontaneous action free of reason or desire may be said to be truly free\u2026 unless it is the result of antecedent causes. If \u2018you\u2019 give no thought to an action and are not driven by desire, still the body acts according to the dictates of the universal laws that govern it. Whichever way you look at it, despite appearances, no human possesses free will. Consciousness on the other hand is entirely free. It is unbounded, dimensionless and timeless. It never changes. All change is apparent only\u2026 arising spontaneously within its own Awareness. Within its non-dual perfection every imperfect duality is perfectly realized\u2026 now and now and now. These words will be read from the perspective of very few people. No person will ever realise their import. Realization is not an act of any person. It is an act of Grace. Any meaning attached to these words is not it. These words are like a signpost to a waterfall. To recognise the reality they reference, one must \u2018attend\u2019 to where they point. Where they point is \u2018out\u2019 of this page towards the Clear Silent Awareness now perceiving these words, and back to the appearances that are one with it. What it is, is impossible to say. That it is is plain. Plainly, Consciousness is\u2026 Sensing-sensations (colours, odours, flavours, feelings and sounds) and Knowing-ideas (number, form and meaning) with the Power to manifest sensory images within its own Awareness in accord with ideas to create the appearance of \u2018my body\u2019 and \u2018my thoughts\u2019 and \u2018my feelings\u2019 and \u2018my surroundings\u2019\u2026 as in a dream. This is Thou And \u2018life\u2019 just carries on\u2026 Michael Haines's answer to What does it feel like to be enlightened? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes this theory exists. It attacks less directly the problem of consciousness than the very construction of reality. But this is how it derives its great efficacy about consciousness. Indeed, if you reject the irreducible dualism of matter / consciousness, then consciousness must be an extension of the organization of reality. Current neuroscience does not make the connection. Why ? Like other sciences, it is concerned with systems, in this case neural networks: their functioning is decrypted with increasing precision. Which in no way explains why these neural excitations produce consciousness. Why do they succeed under a skull and not in an abdomen? Yet we have several hundred million neurons associated with the intestine. Amazing properties are not exclusive to neurons. In parallel it may seem surprising that a coil begins to magnetize surrounding metal objects simply because it is traversed by electrons. Where does this 'magnetic field' come from, an emerging phenomenon equivalent to consciousness for the coil? This last problem is easier to solve. The knowledge of the fine organization of the electrons and the direction of their spin explains the magnetic field. Electronic current and magnetism are two neighboring levels of organization. Their relationships are known. Yet they keep their independence. Magnetism rests on the electronic current but is not reducible to it. It follows its own organizational rules. The reality is thus discontinuous in a neglected dimension: that of its organization. Monism is reconciled with dualism by being a multitude of crossings to complexity. Their independence is based on those of the systems themselves: the elementary time of interactions and the energies involved differ by several orders of magnitude. These levels are invisible to each other. A one-level dynamic system is a stable element in the next. This approach applied to neural networks removes the hard problem of consciousness. Indeed networks form a hierarchy similar to that of matter. Neural groups are systems with relative independence. Their simultaneous excitations symbolize concepts, both evolutionary and 'elements' for the organization of higher concepts. A bright spot on the retina becomes line with the others, the lines become face, etc. Consciousness is formed of the highest concepts, 'experienced' as the superimposition of all these underlying organizations, including that of the physical support (the biological constitution of neurons). This theory makes it possible to say that an artificial intelligence simulating the conscious concepts by algorithms would experience something, but not the same thing as a biological intelligence because of its different support. Why is this theory, which I have simplified to the extreme, not better recognized? As much as it is easy to spread fake news, which target common and popular concepts in our minds, it is difficult to make known a theory that few people can understand. The specialists of a subject protect themselves from gurus and whimsical publications by agreeing to read ... only the specialists of the subject. Without academic title, impossible to publish. And to be criticized ... So it is probably a theory that will take a long time to leave a circle of friends. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWe are the universe experiencing itself.\u201d(Carl Sagan) The Hard Problem of consciousness arises within the conceptual framework of scientific materialism. Plausibly, the mathematical formalism of our best description of the natural world describes fields of insentience. This assumption isn\u2019t explicitly stated in any textbook of organic chemistry or formulation of the axioms of quantum mechanics. Rather, the assumption that the intrinsic nature of the physical is non-experiential is a philosophical intuition treated as too obvious to need stating explicitly. Critically, it\u2019s not a scientific discovery. Dropping the suppressed premise also dissolves the Hard Problem as framed. One may or may not take non-materialist physicalism seriously as a solution to the Hard Problem of consciousness. I struggle. Either way, the track-record of human intuition is spectacularly bad and can\u2019t be trusted at all. The second part of your question needs unpacking. What do we mean by \u201cthe physical characteristics of the brain\u201d? If perceptual direct realism is true, then the gross characteristics of the physical universe are self-evident. Although the invisible microworld of quantum theory is an enigma even to physicists, the shared public macroworld is a brute fact of our existence. Therefore, we can directly inspect a surgically-exposed lump of neural tissue on a hospital operating table. If the patient is merely locally anaesthetised prior to surgery, stimulation of clusters of neurons with microelectrodes elicits reports of experiences ranging from e.g. fleeting hisses and speckles of colour to complex visual experiences of lifelike persons external to the patient\u2019s body-image (cf. Opening the heads of living patients). How can mere patterns of neuronal firings generate first-person conscious experience? The \u201cexplanatory gap\u201d seems unbridgeable. Subjective experience is irreducible to physical facts. And the story gets worse. Perceptual direct realism gives rise to insoluble mysteries such as the binding problem in neuroscience and the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. However, the entire conceptual framework of perceptual direct realism is false. Most probably, inferential realism about mind-independent reality is true (cf. \u201cPhilosophy\u2019s biggest mistake\u201d). Compare dreaming and waking consciousness. When you examine a surgically-exposed lump of neural porridge on an operating table in a dream, the brain that you see in front of your body-image is internal to the phenomenal world-simulation run by your skull-bound mind. When you are awake and examine a surgically-exposed lump of neural porridge on an operating table, the brain you see in front of your body-image is also internal to the phenomenal world-simulation run by your skull-bound mind. Let\u2019s here discount scepticism or solipsism; they are sterile. Unlike dreamworlds, the properties of your awake world-simulation causally covary with structural-relational properties of matter and energy in the theoretically-inferred external world. Hence inferential realism. Yet \u201cperception\u201d as ordinarily understood is a pre-scientific myth. Indirectly, the local environment partly selects the properties of one\u2019s phenomenal world-simulation, but peripheral nervous inputs don\u2019t create the phenomena they select. In outline, quantum physics explains the emergence of differentially robust, quasi-classical, dynamically stable patterns (\u201cneurons\u201d) from underlying quantum bedrock via environmentally-induced decoherence. Hence the metaphorical hardware on which our phenomenal world-simulations run. But lumps of neural porridge (\u201cbrains\u201d) are an artefact of a false theory of perception. Provocatively, what we perceive as \u201cbrains\u201d don\u2019t exist outside our consciousness. More soberly expressed, the natural world supports structures partly functionally akin to brains and partly functionally akin to neurons, but the neural porridge of perceptual na\u00efve realism is mind-dependent. Consequently, the only direct evidence one has about the intrinsic nature of the physical is the nature of the tiny part of the physical world one instantiates, namely one\u2019s own conscious mind. On this story, the mathematical apparatus of quantum field theory describes fields of sentience. Crazy? Yes. But empirically adequate. Try telling a physicist or chemist that their conceptual scheme is empirically inadequate, and you\u2019ll get a stony look. Science works. Yet what would leave the technological successes of science a miracle isn\u2019t the falsity of materialism, but rather the falsity of monistic physicalism. Physicalism, not materialism, gives science its explanatory and predictive power. None of the weird ideas explored here are inconsistent with the mathematical formalism of Standard Model. None of the weird ideas explored here add to the formalism of modern physics. Contrast such theoretical conservativism with panpsychism or a consciousness-induced \u201ccollapse of the wavefunction\u201d. So I think testing physicalism will be the key \u2013 not in a high-energy particle accelerator, but the mind-brain. Is the partial \u201cstructural mismatch\u201d (David Chalmers) between our minds and the microstructure of the CNS a real structural mismatch \u2013 or an artefact of temporally coarse-grained neuroscanning and perceptual na\u00efve realism?I\u2019m fairly confident that inferential realism is true, as distinct from direct realism or philosophical scepticism.I\u2019m not at all confident non-materialist physicalism is true, though non-materialist physicalism is empirically adequate and potentially falsifiable via interferometry (cf. \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger's neurons\u201d: If consciousness is fundamental, what predictions does it make?). Alas, it also strains credulity. But then so do eliminativism and dualism. Maybe our entire conceptual scheme is mistaken in ways our minds can\u2019t fathom from within. ",

            "answer_text": "Recently Michael Graziano\u2019s theory explains how conscious experience is produced. Earlier and more detailed is Daniel Dennett\u2019s theory. Damasio explains how you can experience your hand via the region of the brain that is dedicated to (and connected to) your hand. To produce conscious experience, you need feedback loops which is why Douglas Hofstadter labeled the necessary feedback mechanisms as a \u201cStrange Loop\u201d. The hard problem, put forward by Chalmers, claims that you build an android that had all of the competence of a human being (walking, thinking, conversation, emotions, etc.) and yet the android would lack conscious experience. That\u2019s an incoherent claim because human competency includes being able to focus attention on yourself and to identify in yourself the causes of your own behavior. This competency is what produces your sense of experience. If an android lacked this capacity it would not appear to be a normally competent human. Graziano\u2019s theory provides the most direct answer to your question. There may be a bell ringing faintly in the distance, but you don\u2019t notice it because your focus of attention is elsewhere. Even so, a scan of your brain would show a brain processes that has done calculations identifying the sound as a bell and even containing the information regarding how many times it has chimed. If someone then asks you what time it is, you suddenly realize the bell has been ringing and can count the number of chimes retroactively. Your sudden focus of attention on the bell requires an additional process in your brain that links a neural representation of the bell to a neural representation of your own focus of attention. Your brain calculates the thought \u201cI hear a bell ringing\u201d. This additional brain process produces the awareness of the bell. Without that, your brain has registered the bell but you don\u2019t realize it. ",

            "answer_text": "I have always failed to understand what is supposed to be so mysterious about consciousness. It is one of the functions of the brain. Period. There are many other animals that also experience consciousness. Our sense of experience is not just meditated by our brains. It is also meditated by our organs of external perception (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin), as well as organs of internal perception - all the sensory equipment that alerts us to hunger, chills, exhaustion, lack of breath, and many other things. All these senses impinge on the brain, some leading to conscious perceptions, others not accesible to consciousness but still important to the brain's primary activity of keeping us alive. There is no mystical barrier between our lived experience and the external world which we inhabit - the same is true for all other living things. We have experiences of the world around us because we physically interact with it. That sense of experience is just what our brain does, in the same way that pumping blood around the body is what the heart does, and digesting food is what the stomach and intestines do. Nothing difficult to explain, mysterious our problematic about it. ",

This is a testable solution which, if borne out by science, will enable us to do things like eff ineffable qualia, and to know that an abstract computer isn\u2019t phenomenally conscious. After all, the abstract word red, isn\u2019t red. In order to know what it means, you need to interpret it back to a set of physical qualities.

Evolution has had 3 billion years to create our sensations from matter so it is a bit early for us to have figured it out. The analysis starts with simple organisms interacting with their environment in chemical and electrical ways to sense \u201cprey\u201d vs. \u201cmate\u201d vs. \u201ccarnivore\u201d vs. \u201cneutral\u201d. \u201cLight\u201d vs. \u201cdark\u201d, \u201cheat\u201d vs. \u201ccold\u201d, \u201cacid\u201d vs. \u201cbase\u201d, etc. with a \u201cself\u201d vs. \u201cother\u201d on-off dichotomy and analog decision-making tree in effect.

Translation The great sage N\u0101rada continued: The living entity acts in a gross body in this life. This body is forced to act by the subtle body, composed of mind, intelligence and ego. After the gross body is lost, the subtle body is still there to enjoy or suffer. Thus there is no change. Purport The living entity has two kinds of body \u2014 the subtle body and the gross body. Actually, he enjoys through the subtle body, which is composed of mind, intelligence and ego. The gross body is the instrumental outer covering. When the gross body is lost, or when it dies, the root of the gross body \u2014 the subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego \u2014 continues and brings about another gross body. Although the gross body apparently changes, the real root of the gross body is always there. The subtle body\u2019s activities, be they pious or impious, create another situation for the living entity to enjoy or suffer in the next gross body. Thus the subtle body continues, whereas the gross bodies change one after another. Since modern scientists and philosophers are too materialistic, and since their knowledge is taken away by the illusory energy, they cannot explain how the gross body is changing. The materialistic philosopher Darwin has tried to study the changes of the gross body, but because he had no knowledge of either the subtle body or the soul, he could not clearly explain how the evolutionary process is going on. One may change the gross body, but he works in the subtle body. People cannot understand the activities of the subtle body, and consequently, they are bewildered as to how the actions of one gross body affect another gross body. The activities of the subtle body are also guided by the Supersoul, as explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6domatta\u1e25 sm\u1e5btir j\u00f1\u0101nam apohana\u1e41 ca \u201cI am seated in everyone\u2019s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge, and forgetfulness.\u201d Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is always guiding the individual soul, the individual soul always knows how to act according to the reactions of his past karma. In other words, the Supersoul reminds him to act in such a way. Therefore although there is apparently a change in the gross body, there is a continuation between the lives of an individual soul. ] ",

Consciousness is merely the act of paying attention to mental events and that has been pretty well mapped out for decades. What seems mysterious to researchers is the subjective sense that life is happening to \u201cme\u201d and they focus on consciousness because it is such a core aspect of the \u201cme\u201d function.
