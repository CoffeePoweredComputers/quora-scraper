            "answer_text": "What is the most intuitive act? The most intuitive act is scratching one\u2019s balls. Mind you, they say a woman\u2019s intuition operates on a whole other level! Well it would have to, probably. Wait. I\u2019m thinking instinctual. Intuitive. Not the same thing. Okay, I change my answer. The most intuitive act is changing your answer. Well, your mind anyhow. The act of reconsideration. Nothing is more powerfully, primally intuitive. Second most intuitive act? Plumping for something. Good ol\u2019 Merriam-Webster\u2019s Dictionary has \u201cplump\u201d as verb: \u201cTo favor or decide in favor of someone or something strongly or emphatically\u2014used with for.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful turn of mind, plumping. Call it a hunch, call it a gut call, but it\u2019s guided and led by intuition\u2019s siren call. It\u2019s intuition\u2019s plummeting raptor that screams from the skies in a death-dive and bomb-pounces up in an arc, with the whatever-it-was clutched in its cruel talons. That\u2019s intuition. Well no, all that is more the act of acting on it. Intuition itself is just the feeling. You\u2019re like (not out loud), \u201cHey\u2026.yeah.\u201d From there, some drift thataway to circle in all cool, some pounce, some power-dive shrieking. Intuition\u2019s not about what you do with it. It\u2019s about the it you know what to do with. Suddenly, sometimes. Or dawning like day, welling up from beneath the horizon. Wow. Reason I say plumping is second-most intuitive is, it doesn\u2019t take a rampaging golden monolith of intuition to come to the big inkling. When you haven\u2019t anything decided in the matter, intuition can easily drift in and settle on whatever stirs it up. But the unsettling. The unplumping. The act of reconsideration. That takes a strong, keen lean of intuition, insistently growing to inexorable. Hoo! That\u2019s a potent intuition. It\u2019s not about scratching one\u2019s balls. That\u2019s just instinct. Some urge. ",
