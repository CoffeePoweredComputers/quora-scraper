            "answer_text": "By sharing the everyday responsibilities with her? E.g., grocery shopping, setting the dinner table, combing the news journal for a helpful article that all of you can discuss about over a cup of tea/coffee, and so on. By treating her an important member of the family, and asking for her point of view on every house-hold decision that you take? E.g., if buying a new car, what model would she suggest and why? Her model\u2019s features against your model\u2019s features. Her model\u2019s cost vs. your model\u2019s cost. Etc. By sharing your thoughts, fears, joys, and sorrows with her, just like you\u2019d do with a friend? And maybe, at some point of time, she\u2019d also start sharing all those things with you. By trusting her, and respecting her choices? E.g., her dressing sense, her food preference, her friends, her college major, etc. That definitely doesn\u2019t imply that you should turn a blind eye if she\u2019s risking her life, say by trying her hand at drugs. By giving her freedom, at the same time also making her realize where the lines are drawn? E.g., it\u2019s OK if, once in a while, she\u2019s not in the mood to study, but it\u2019s not OK if she\u2019s avoiding her studies altogether and her grades are suffering because of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Please think slightly different way.. How can I make your daughter realise her mistakes when she acts irresponsible ? The simple answer is Kids generally understand better when something goes wrong and you try to help them correct it. It stays forever in their minds.  This would also allow them to think freely before acting in future on their own a bit more sensibly. Lessons learnt on their own has greater impact than taught. If you try to make them responsible, some times they rebel and feel their freedom is managed by parents.  They also start looking forward to your guidance before doing every thing, which does not help them. It makes them dependant on you rather developing their own individuality and art of learning. Hope this helps... ",
