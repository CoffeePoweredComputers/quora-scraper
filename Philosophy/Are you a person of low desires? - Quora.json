            "answer_text": "For some people they might say I have low desires, and for some, it is too much. And for me, I can't say it's low or not. Because I haven't reached most of the things that I desire; and when I reach it, I don't think it is high enough because it was reachable. The bottom line is, no desires are high or low, it is really up to us on how we see it. ",
