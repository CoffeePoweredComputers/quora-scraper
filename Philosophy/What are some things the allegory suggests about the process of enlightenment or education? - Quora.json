            "answer_text": "What \u201cAllegory\u201d There are lots of stories about individuals that followed the process and achieved enlightenment. The process is very simple but the application can be difficult and frustrating but one perseveres. \u201c Library \u00bb Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 As It Is \u00bb Chapter Two Bg. 2.41 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0938\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0915\u093e \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0930\u0947\u0915\u0947\u0939 \u0915\u0941\u0930\u0942\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928 \u0964\u092c\u0939\u0941\u0936\u093e\u0916\u093e \u0939\u094d\u092f\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0936\u094d\u091a \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u092f\u094b\u093d\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0938\u093e\u092f\u093f\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096a\u0967 \u0965 vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 buddhirekeha kuru-nandanabahu-\u015b\u0101kh\u0101 hy anant\u0101\u015b cabuddhayo \u2019vyavas\u0101yin\u0101m Synonyms vyavas\u0101ya-\u0101tmik\u0101 \u2014 resolute in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; buddhi\u1e25 \u2014 intelligence; ek\u0101 \u2014 only one; iha \u2014 in this world; kuru-nandana \u2014 O beloved child of the Kurus; bahu-\u015b\u0101kh\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 having various branches; hi \u2014 indeed; anant\u0101\u1e25 \u2014 unlimited; ca \u2014 also; buddhaya\u1e25 \u2014 intelligence; avyavas\u0101yin\u0101m \u2014 of those who are not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Translation Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched. Purport A strong faith that by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one will be elevated to the highest perfection of life is called vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmik\u0101 intelligence. The Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.62) states: \u2018\u015braddh\u0101\u2019-\u015babde \u2013 vi\u015bv\u0101sa kahe sud\u1e5b\u1e0dha ni\u015bcayak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e bhakti kaile sarva-karma k\u1e5bta haya Faith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the duties of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity or nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one\u2019s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The resolute purpose of a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is based on knowledge. V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25: a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that V\u0101sudeva, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree one automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone \u2013 namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is satisfied by one\u2019s actions, then everyone will be satisfied. Service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As such, to be well versed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one\u2019s mission in life. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows: yasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101doyasy\u0101pras\u0101d\u0101n na gati\u1e25 kuto \u2019pidhy\u0101yan stuva\u1e41s tasya ya\u015bas tri-sandhya\u1e41vande guro\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-cara\u1e47\u0101ravindam \u201cBy satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.\u201d The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body \u2013 not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer a chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.\u201d So we follow the process and do not speculate about the result! ",
