I found that trying not to process excess amounts of his work for an extended period of time is best. Small chunks, multiple times a day. I burned out after only 30\u201345 minutes of straight reading. On the plus side, he follows a very logical argument that stems from the initial premise he proposes. I would take notes on the premise/hypothesis he establishes and refer back to those notes as you read. I assume this is not your 1st philosophy text? If so, something like Hegel or Plato are much easier reads to start with. ",
