            "answer_text": "Here is how I think one would reason on this. Let us first try to understand with what we mean with \"universe\". It is a (human made) concept, that more-ore-less means the total of every thing that is or can exist in all time and all space. It does not say what can or can not exist, but it just states that whatever there is that exist, it is included in the concept of \"universe\". (of course now some would say and what about the multiverse? well it is a bit of a misnomer, but the multiverse is just the scaled up version of the universe, in which our universe bubble is one of many, similar to how our galaxy is one of many galaxies). So ok. Once we understand that, it would be already quite meaningless to think of something \"outside\" the universe, because we have already defined the universe to contain everything that exists. By definition then, there is nothing \"outside\" the universe, nor \"before\" the universe. Whatever entity there may be in existence of which we do not know anything, also that entity is thought of as strictly being part of the universe. It follows then more or less logically that there can not have been an entity that created the universe from outside. But it does not state that prior to some state of the universe (say: the very dense and hot pseudo beginning as per Big Bang theory, assuming that that theory is correct) there could have been other parts of the universe (prior to the pseudo begin as per Big Bang theory) that causally effected our part of the universe to come into existence, as a physical explenation of our currently formed observable universe we witness today. But that (physical) cause (or perhaps and even likely: infinite causal chain if the universe is thought of having no begin) we could call \"creator\" of the (current) observable universe, but then that is I think a misnomer, because usually a theist would qualify the \"creator\" God as something immaterial, and not a physical object or process. To me personally the idea of a creator God as immaterial and outside of time and space is a bit like turning the world upside down, because consciousness is not causing anything material, but is most likely itself a cause of the material: in the case of humans it is the brain that causes us to have consciousness - but our consciousness does not cause anything directly in the physical world. When we perform an action in the world, it is the brain as a material organ that causes this, and it is our consciousness that is aware of what we do and why we do it. Quite interestingly, brain research has concluded that the conscious awareness comes strictly after our brain already made a decission to do something. In this way also it can be understood that consciousness does not directly cause anything physical. The idea of a God- creator is a human made concept, and is not in any way a theory that explains the existence of the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "Way to open the door for poor or partially informed opinions. Sheesh. People decide what they believe is true, and then pay attention only to the evidence that supports their beliefs. So here\u2019s the science. When Newton developed his physics of the universe, thinkers and philosophers took it and came up with a view of the universe and the way it works that still haunts us, and that you can see in some of the answers below to your question. It was thought to be a mechanistic, deterministic, reductionistic universe that was infinite in time and space. The first three are entirely contingent upon the last in order for the whole thing to be consistent - you have to have an infinitely old universe in order for the laws of physics to be there eternally, making everything happen in a predetermined, cause-and-effect sort of way that you understand by reducing things to their component parts. Take things apart to understand how they work according to the laws of nature, and predict what will happen. That\u2019s Newtonian science. But. The universe is not infinitely old and the laws of physics have not always been here. The universe has not always been here; space and time have not always been here. That\u2019s relativity, specifically the GTR, which tells us that the universe had a starting point, a.k.a. Big Bang, as we call it. Quantum Theory comes along and suddenly 1) things are not predictable, just probabilistic, and really odd things can and do happen, 2) things are not predetermined and it\u2019s not a purely cause-and-effect universe, and 3) when you take things apart to understand them better, when you get to the quantum level, you don\u2019t understand them at all, and nobody does. So the Newtonian universe is only superficially true - it is a relativistic, quantum universe. Worse, it is a fine-tuned universe where if any one of a couple of hundred physical parameters were changed, order, structure, and life go away. It is frighteningly well calibrated to produce life, as though it was intended to do so from the beginning. Even worse, the bedrock principle of quantum mechanics is that nothing happens without an observation; not reality, not the universe, nothing. So not only is it well-calibrated to produce life, there is a mandate that there be intelligent life in order for reality itself to exist. So now you have questions to ask that you did not have - where did it all come from, why, how, from where, for what reason, and who did it? And the answer is \u2026 drum roll \u2026 science does not know. Science is not happy with all of that, but it was, after all, science that gave us all of that in the first place. So among some other mostly lame and/or awkward answers, God is a reasonable answer to all of those questions. We should add that this God has only two identifiable attributes based on the physics of BB - this God is outside of space, time and the laws of physics, and so is the original observer, and since the universe is fine-tuned, this God is the orderer. I would project that since the universe is formed purely of interactions/relations, then God is an interactive, relational God. Gotta love good science. ",
