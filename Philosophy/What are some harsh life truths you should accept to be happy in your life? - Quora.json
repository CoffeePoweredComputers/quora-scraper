            "answer_text": "Life never stops being difficult and we can never be prepared for certain difficulties that may arise. So, there are some universal truths that you need to acknowledge unless you want to remain miserable for your entire existence. 1. Happiness is when you do something for others You need to ask yourself if you are genuinely happy right now.If you are, think of the things that made you happy. And if you aren\u2019t, try to remember the last time you felt happy and why. All these important questions will give you answers to understand that your actions result in your happiness or misery, so always choose them wisely. 2. Everything and everyone you love will be lost This is an eye-opening truth that you should never deny. One day the people you love will be gone as well as the things you worked hard to get. There is nothing you can do to stop that. Appreciate your relationships and the things you have because you may lose it all tomorrow. 3. Even if you are a good person bad things will happen to you No matter how good person you are you will not be immune to bad things. Good and brave people may die young and it is just how life is. What you can do is never allow those people to die without a purpose or cause. 4. Life is unfair Life will always be unfair. Good people don\u2019t get what they deserve and sometimes bad ones do. You should have a positive mind and just enjoy the things you are given. 5. Don\u2019t expect people to be nice There will always be rude people who will mistreat you no matter how nice you are to them. You can expect them to change and you shouldn\u2019t change yourself either. Keep being kind because it is something within you that will bring you positivity. 6. We are never going to be perfect Nobody is perfect, neither you, your partner or anyone else you know. Stop chasing perfection. Accept your weaknesses and work on improving them to make your life easier. 7. Things will change whether you want them to or not Nothing will remain unchanged or stable. Some things that seem permanent might change completely in just one moment. Change is something you can\u2019t avoid, so accept it when it comes. 8. Time wasted is lost forever You will never get back the time you have wasted. Time goes by and it will never stop or come back. Every second of your life counts and once you grow old you will only have regrets for the things you didn\u2019t do. Manage your time better to avoid feeling regret when you are at your death bed. 9. Things will not always turn out the way we expect them to You can make plans as hard as you can, but life is so uncertain that your plans can go to waste in seconds. Those experiences teach us to pick ourselves up and move on into the uncertain future. 10. Time is precious, not money Money is a necessity, but time is much more valuable. If you manage your time properly you will always achieve the things you wanted to and that will bring you the true happiness. 11. Stop trying to make everyone happy It is impossible for you to make everyone feel happy. You will meet people who will try to stop you or criticize you. Just be yourself and work on your own happiness instead of trying to please others. 12. Be productive if you want to live comfortably You need to have a purpose in your life. Setting goals that you will work towards brings meaning to your life. If you want to live comfortably you need to be productive and try hard to reach your goals. And once you reach your goal set another one. 13. Start living, not just existing Existing and living are two very different things. To live means to experience things. If you are having trouble in your life it is difficult to focus on enjoying the ride. However, try to set time aside for yourself and for your enjoyment. Beauty is all around you and you can always appreciate being alive and here ",

            "answer_text": "The Truth is things as they really are according to their true natures, not according to what you think or believe they are or should be. It is the Truth that will set you free. The attitude of the truth-winner is to simply accept things the ways they are, without any dissents and fabrications at all. This is the true definition of the word \u201cmental/spiritual purity\u201d. Thus, conflicts/discriminations/resistances/manipulations do not arise from his thoughts and deeds. When they do not arise, peace/calmness/restfulness is simply there for him to experience at all times! This is how the ultimate bliss of one\u2019s heart is achieved! What would one receive in return from seeking happiness out of something that only contains suffering? The clear answer is nothing else but suffering alone, right? This is the reason why we should let go of these 3 types of desires: sensual desires, desires for existences, and desires for non-existences. The only reason behind these 3 types of desires is simply for us to be happy. Sensual desires are for those who take delights in the sensual gratifications; desires for existence are for those who perceive that fames, statuses, and wealth will make them happy; desires for non-existences are for those who try to deny all types of obvious physical and mental sufferings. In Buddhism, there is no true happiness in a world marked by conditionings and impermanence. This is because there are inherent conflicting forces of conditionings to pull or push against each other that will cause something to arise and cease, which always contribute these eroded signs of exclusion/discrimination/change into the internal and external environments. The accumulation of these destructive signs would gradually increase to reach the final point of annihilation eventually. Therefore, all conditioned things are subject to the same universal life cycle of formation, growth, maturity, and decline. Now, if one desires to seek for true and permanent happiness in such a phenomenon, he desires to seek for something else that does not really exist. The 3 types of desires to be truly happy are all based this same false hope, which will only result in disappointments at the end. Yet, why don\u2019t people realize this simple truth of Dukkha? There are two major types of sufferings. The first type is referred to as the obvious sufferings, such as these physical/mental pains, illnesses, agonies, torments, tortures, miseries, disappointments, grieves, and sorrows; whereas, the second type is referred to as the obscure sufferings. This second type of sufferings can only be realized through deep wisdom. Although they seem to be very pleasant to experience, but they\u2019re still impermanent. Because one does not see sufferings through his pleasant experiences, he inclines to gratify and cling on to them. This is the subtlest form of delusion. Then, he is marked and conditioned by his mind of delusion, by perceiving that there is happiness. Therefore, when the sufferings are obscure, he is conditioned by the cravings to be united with the pleasant experiences. On the other hand, when the sufferings are obvious, he is conditioned by the cravings to reject the unpleasant experiences. The struggles between the two types of cravings can easily trap him into greed on one hand and aversion on the other hand. It normally takes a lot of repetitive disappointments and despairs in one\u2019s life to start waking him up. When he sees that there is only ONE option (suffering), this is the point of his awakening! Then, the desires/cravings to search for happiness will start to disappear gradually on their own automatically. What then remains after is the perfect mental state of complete calmness, peace, and restfulness at last! This marks the end of his restless and struggling life, and so does the end of suffering! It is a delight that leads a sentient being to have a sensual desire or desire for existence. It is an aversion that leads a sentient being to have a desire for non-existence. Both the delight and aversion are the products of delusions. Without the delusions, both the delight and aversion do not arise; without both the delight and aversion, cravings do not arise. Therefore, by avoiding taking delight on one extreme and avoiding taking aversion on the other extreme, in sensory contacts or feelings, one is no longer troubled by objects and notions. This is the Middle Way as you know it. The minds of troubles are the causes of all troubles and sufferings in this world! Without a mind of trouble, one is certain not to cause any trouble or destruction regardless of space and time, which therefore, spiritually transforms himself to become a respected noble and altruistic Arahant! When he can\u2019t no longer do no wrong, he is simply seen to be perfect in a nutshell. Therefore, it\u2019s a false statement to say that a human being cannot be perfect. There are such persons in Buddhism, namely Arahants. The Buddhist way of perfection is not to be expressed through a physical dimension, but rather to be expressed through a spiritual dimension instead! The spiritual qualities of worthiness are rather based on virtue, compassion, generosity, morality, renunciation, wisdom, vigor, patience, truthfulness, resolution, kindness, and equanimity. The attitude of a wise man is not to seek outward to control/fix what is perceived to be wrong to make it right, but rather, to seek inward to stop practicing what is unwholesome or abusive instead. Now when the unwholesomeness is not to be seen from his actions, speeches, and intentions; then, he is simply righteous and wholesome in a nutshell. ",
