            "answer_text": "I would be more in favor of utilitarianism. Deontology, when boiled down to its basic components, is an evaluation that mainly judges actions/situations/ solutions as black or white. Social and ethical maturity would hopefully outgrow this world view. Utilitarianism says to act towards the greatest good based on the effects on the greatest number within the field of influence. But again, this smacks of being an absolute/rigid world view. Any mature adult should be a proponent of humanitarianism. My pocket definition of this is: Do unto others as you would have done unto you WITH the added consideration that One man\u2019s meat is another man\u2019s poison. We should desire to help others in a way that is suited to both their needs and their values, while endeavoring to do no harm to the surrounding environment (including other individuals or groups that may be affected.)
