            "answer_text": "Yes. And they are very common. Think about all of the relationships in life that fall into this category: The relationship one has with a school principal who unfairly criticizes a child. The relationship with a boss who has a bad temper and has held up a well-deserved promotion for the past five years. A relationship with a State Senator who doesn\u2019t have the spine to stand up to an unpopular president. A relationship with a self-centered aunt who may typically only be thinking about herself. A relationship with a sibling who acts like a rival instead of a friend. A relationship with an ex who cheated but they are the parent of one or more of your children. Indeed, we often have relationships with people whom we neither respect nor trust. What all of these relationships have in common is that they are relationships of necessity. Many relationships exist without trust and respect. Want one more? Think about abusive husbands or wives. Does anyone question that neither trust nor respect are hallmarks of relationships like these? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No All relationships are based on mutual respect and trust. Parent and Child, Sibling and Another Sibling, Employer and Employee, Romantic Partners.. they are there because of mutual respect and trust. If either respect or trust is gone, I would think that the relationship between the two persons are merely \u201cco-exitence\u201d instead of an actual relationship. Such as, an employee stays with an employer because of financial needs instead of actually trusting and respecting the employer and the company. Hope this helps. ",

They are stuck there because it\u2019s all they have, and all they know. Sadly, children\u2019s brains make two really big mistakes\u2026..they: over-generalize \u2014 believe what is true in their family is true across the whole worldover-personalize \u2014 believe that what happens to them is their fault; not the responsibility of dysfunctional & wounded adultsThese early beliefs get consciously forgotten, but live on in the unconscious of the child and affect all future relationships until faced/changed through the hard work of introspection.

(On one belief I've lived my life, to never test/judge anyone who is dear to me.) So when you trust someone, you really should do so. Because once that happens, nothing will separate both of you\u2026 Now, let's speak about respect, respect should be mutual towards each other. For example, your partner has grown up in a different environment, so we should respect our partner's culture, behaviour and atmosphere and try to adjust ourselves accordingly. We can't expect our partner to settle in a new atmosphere quickly. We must give sufficient time to our partner. Hence, Respect and Trust are Pillars for any Relationships. ",
