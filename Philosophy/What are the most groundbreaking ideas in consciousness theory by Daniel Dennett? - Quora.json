            "answer_text": "Those who've read Dennet's book Consciousness Explained should be aware that it doesn't actually explain consciousness at all; instead it is a long recitation about what he thinks consciousness is not, ultimately concluding that consciousness is simply illusory and doesn't actually exist.  Stuart Hameroff has therefore jokingly referred to Dennett as a 'zombie' which as most people interested in consciousness are aware is a hypothetical human being who appears from all outward appearances to be a conscious entity but is really just an automaton acting on complex reflexes with no actual consciousness present -- the question usually being, how could you tell they were not in fact conscious?   To accept Dennett's 'explanation' of consciousness is therefore to accept that he believes he's a zombie and that he believes everyone else is too, but the fact of the matter is that we can all examine our own consciousnesses and know by our first-person experience that there are many things present there that transcend automation even if we don't understand the how or why of them.  Dennett just takes an easy way out of the conundrum in a denial process because he has no frigging clue what consciousness is or how it might work in us, which Consciousness Explained makes very clear.  Either that or he really is a zombie. Early on in his book Dennett states that there is no place in the brain where there are structures for any kind of information display, and at that point I more or less skimmed through the rest because his assumptions were so obviously flat-out wrong.  In reality there is a possible flatscreen display area called the septum pellucidum which is a kind of twin-walled membrane formed from the frontal walls of the two lateral ventricles, often with a very narrow fluid-filled space in between the two walls.  In this old drawing from 1901 this narrow space is labelled \"5th ventricle\", but nobody calls it that anymore.    Coronal section of a human brain from Septum pellucidum Once you understand that 1) there have to be biophotons present in those ventricular spaces because all living tissues tested so far have been shown to emit them (they mostly originate from cell mitochondria), and 2) all sensory inputs with the possible exception of olfaction first synapse in the thalamus which is adjacent over much of its surface area to ventricular spaces, and 3) the inner surfaces of the ventricles are lined with beating bundles of cilia which have waveguiding capabilities capable of aiming biophotons at discrete locations within the ventricular spaces, then the functioning of the brain in enabling consciousness becomes understandable based on the synchronization of neural and photic events creating holographically-organized dynamic wave interference patterns in the ventricular spaces which have the capability of interacting with holographically distributed energies in the Zero Point Energy where the Source of consciousness resides.  Think of it as a mechanism for the localization in our brains of a tiny part of the non-local Source of consciousness filling the universe outside our time-bound frame of reference.  Further explanation about this Nexus Theory of consciousness can be found at Karl Simanonok's answer to What are some of the current neuroscientific theories of consciousness?  ",

            "answer_text": "I consider myself a disciple of Dennett.  I certainly don't agree with everything he has written, but I'll try to sketch the ideas that lead me to describe myself that way.  All of these ideas can be found in Consciousness Explained, his most important book. The Cartesian Theater.  According to Dennett the majority of people think about consciousness dualistically:  they visualize the brain as a sort of theater, and consciousness as a person sitting in the audience watching the story play out on the screen.  This is a bad metaphor that leads to lots of invalid reasoning.Cartesian Materialism.  This is what often happens when scientists think about consciousness:  they use the Cartesian Theater metaphor, thinking about one part of the brain as the audience and the rest of the brain as the theater.The Intentional Stance.  This is an argument that it is valid to describe the actions of certain types of systems using \"intentional\" terms such as belief, knowledge, desire, etc.Heterophenomenology.  This is an argument that phenomenological explanations can be valid and scientifically useful if they are treated as explanatory fictions.  (I personally think Dennett is all wrong here.)The impossibility of localizing conscious events to specific places in the brain and specific times.The nonexistence of qualia, in the sense in which many philosophers use the term.No doubt I have left out some important things, but the fundamental concept that underlies all this is that consciousness is a sort of \"user illusion\" generated by the brain, in the same sense that the objects you see on a computer screen are a \"user illusion\" generated by the computer.  What this means in practice is that when we introspect about our consciousness, what we think we perceive has only an indirect relationship with what actually happens inside the brain. (As a footnote, Dennett has also devoted a lot of time and effort to exploring the concept of free will, but I consider that a separate topic and won't say anything about it here.) ",
