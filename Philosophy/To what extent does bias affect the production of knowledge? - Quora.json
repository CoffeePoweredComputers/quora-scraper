            "answer_text": "Everything we learn is subject to our biases and only through rigorous examination can we attain viable, credible knowledge. All information (sight, sound, thinking, imagining) entering the mind, regardless of it's origin or basis in fact, opinion or fantasy is filtered by the filters installed (instilled?) throughout our life. That is to say, everything we see, hear, and perceive is by our very nature, is tempered by our biases. Everything! The goal of every sentient (aware, thinking) creature is to sort through all the \u201cnoise\" from that environment and process into reliable, useful, supportable knowledge. The strength of that knowledge and experience is the most important part of all those processes, including filters and biases is by using them wisely and intelligently. That is no easy task. In my experience, the most difficult biases to overcome to ascertain the truth have been the indoctrination and imprinting on our minds before the ability of critical thinking is developed. Most of our religious, social, language, and cultural beliefs have been implanted at very early stages of our lives and for the most part, accepted as truth without argument or examination. Examining those ideas and beliefs, those a priori beliefs that define our very identities is a challenging excerise and is frought with the dangers of preconceived rules and biases.h Education in the widest and most varied areas is the most probable path to that critical thinking. I have found that the scientific method is the least biased way of sifting fact and truth from fiction and fantasy. The veracity of knowledge obtained is the support and evidence (not just belief or single sources) that can hold up under intense, no holds barred, scrutiny. Good luck in all your endeavors. ",

            "answer_text": "Bias affects/effects EVERYTHING, EVERY HUMAN DOES, EVERY DAY! EVERYONE HAS BIAS. BIAS is an emotion/belief [ie religion, politics, how we treat others, etc.] and we learn these BIASES from the day we are born. MOST Judges, Doctors, MOST scientist, GOOD journalists and MANY other professional people KNOW HOW to \u201cCHECK their Biases at the door\u201d when they go to work! And MOST of those professionals do a good job at \u201cchecking their biases at that door\u201d. To what extent does bias affect the production of knowledge? It All depends on HOW well YOU or I or whoever is the purveyor of knowledge \u201ccheck our bias at the door\u201d. ",
