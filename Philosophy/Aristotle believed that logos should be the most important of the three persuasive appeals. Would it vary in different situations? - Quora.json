            "answer_text": "Yes, makes sense it may vary - As we know, it depends on the audience being addressed - \u201cKnow your audience\u201d! As best as possible what is their fabric of weave of their Ethos (Ethics), Pathos (emotional maturity), and Logos (intelligence to scale for abstract comprehension and logic of processing a set of premise to a truth or false conclusion - And your ability to persuade them of your character of authenticity be trusted). The more one is as a speaker or writer to desire to be effective, and able to adapt skillfully to communicate (Even if - yep - BS) - a good sells person (even honest one) may and will first attend the Logos to build a level of acceptation and expectations to be close (Create harmony/balance) than keep things too much of a distance apart - the greater the distance apart, the more stress the audience may experience - and might the speaker/writer feel and be inept or thought inept and disenfranchise ones target audience - Fan or not - Regardless of political bent left or right, near or far\u2026 it is what it is\u2026 THAT\u2026 it just so happens, the perfect here and now example is the current POTUS would have Aristotle shaking his head trying to make sense our of the noise of his stream of detached thoughts being verbalized like disconnected graffiti vandalism than artistic conveyances: If not laughing hysterically. Other persons, but particularly the current POTUS EVEN is reading scripted narratives written for him to seem in his right mind is cohesive\u2026 His cadence of speech and Pathos of rendering is a dull, emotionless experience - he does not know how to convey authenticity in his claims of Ethos be believed sincere, the Pathos have no sense of real content of empathy nor contextual feel of true sympathy. As for the orchestration of Logos? It\u2019s a ebb and flow of self-contradiction of non-sequitur jabs of gibberish... and he thinks it is poetic genus - every repeated again and again word and phrase of it says - he is very insecure and defensive - fearful - so is it that the ill level of narcissism must frame up their own reality matrix regardless of the reality of consensus of all others common sensibilities. This is not what true philosophical contemplation is about: Which is by its root of meaning from the ancient Greek) to define the idea: Philo = Love/Love of & Sophy = Knowing/knowledge. SO - IN THE ABSENCE OF CONVEYING A TRUE LOVE OF KNOWING AND LEARNING, AND EXPLORING WHAT IS BELIEVE KNOWN, CAN BE KNOW TO BE TRUE OR FALSE, BE KNOWN - The pretense of calling ones self a philosopher is BS rhetoric. It\u2019s just half-baked opinion, not even a semi-hypothesis shy of a few facts missing, and no where near a Theory we can take for a ride and find the constancy of a of consensus of collective experience of some agreement of a reality of cohesive minds. So, full-circle - Logos what you and I can find to trust the sincerity and explore the perceptions and and find some balance of shared perspectives. BUT, without some Ethos we are not trying to BS the other to self-interest, and we approach the ideas with enthusiasm and constructive emotional maturity to be open to risk and open to acceptance - WILL WISELY be of varying elements - depending on the subject and complexity, not of just the subject, but the linguistics used - The use of analogy or metaphoric means to connect and disconnect from comprehension and stress out until we fail to communicate and find agreement sacrificing nothing of our unique personal soul of being - might even upscale it. Only a mindless idiot can be persuaded how to think\u2026 A desire to improve one\u2019s intelligence is self-persuasion to acquire the skills and habit of expanding awareness. We are two things of mind it seems by chance unique to being human - Both take exercising to build awareness skills and aptitudes to apply to our true narrative as philosophical animals - Art & Science - They are the objects of Logos, Ethos and Pathos manifested. And this is my short answer of perspective of my perceptions - for what they are of value of worth depends on my audience my care\u2026 But, a great question asked - good ones are rare on Quora or just attempts to sound like one is a smarty-pants or trying to be philosophical (but anything but that is obvious they are neither in true character). P.S. Aristotle wasn\u2019t always right in his mind - who ever is that perfect\u2026 Not I, for sure. ",
