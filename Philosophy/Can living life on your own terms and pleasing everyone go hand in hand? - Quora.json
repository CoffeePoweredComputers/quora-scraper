            "answer_text": "None can live on their terms 100%. It is simply impossible. Also, none can please everyone always and forever. In my opinion, living on our own terms should mean choosing what we want to study, what to eat, what to wear, which profession to work on etc. So in these choices one doesn't need to heed to the views of others. Also, these choices of ours should not be expected to please anyone including our parents and close ones. At the same time,we should not expect the terms of others to satisfy us. Apart from our personal choices, there are many situations where and when everyone is compelled to do the things according to the wishes of others. For example, one may wish to watch a movie X and his/her friends may want him/her to watch a movie Y. In this situation, either one of those two should give up their wish. Otherwise both can go separately to watch a movie. There are many such situations in life where we disagree with others. When there is a disagreement, there is no way please others in that particular aspect. Anyone involved in the disagreement can appear to accept the choice of other person and seem to be happy. In my opinion, it is false 99% times. So when there is a clear agreement or coincidence between what we want and what others want us to do or have, then our terms can go hand in hand with pleasing others. But this is highly likely to be improbable. As \u00e0 conclusion, in my opinion, living on our own terms and pleasing everyone cannot go hand in hand. ",

            "answer_text": "No. I believe they don't go hand in hand. In fact, in my opinion, they are quite contrary to each other. Living life on your own terms mean following your own conscience and beliefs. You may be wrong in other's view, but you still pursue your aim, because you believe in yourself. You become happy by being what you are and pursuing what you want. Pleasing everyone is the single most bizarre thing in my opinion people would do. It is driven by the desire to get liked by others. It's implicit meaning is that you don't have intrinsic worth so you seek external approval. It never leads to lasting happiness. ",
