            "answer_text": "A metaphysical belief is a belief concerning beings in a the most general sense: a sense which includes not only the physical, spatio-temporal things that most people regard as beings, but thoughts, numbers \u2014 anything that can be said in some sense to be. Geometrical figures, angels, the soul, god. Metaphysicians, traditionally, asked questions like: what sort of beings can be said to be in a primary sense. There seems, indeed, to be a difference between the way that the individual horse is, the way the concept of horse is, and the way that the whiteness of the white horse is. Of these three, only the individual horse seems to be in a primary sense, where the other two beings are dependent on the primary sense. This, at least, is a metaphysical belief. In addition to general metaphysics, which I\u2019ve just described, there is also special metaphysics, which concerns the specific nature of certain non-physical beings: the world (cosmology), the soul (psychology), and god (theology). Outside of Neo-Scholastic circles, though, you probably won\u2019t find many people taking \u201cspecial metaphysics\u201d seriously. Kant pretty much killed it off. While metaphysics was believed to be dead not too long ago, it has experienced a revival of sorts, and there is now a thriving trade in \u201canalytic\u201d metaphysics. I\u2019m not very fond of it, because it tends, in contrast to Aristotle, not to be grounded in an attentiveness to the way things show themselves. It is not, in other words, phenomenological. It is a question, rather, of giving a metaphysical interpretation (a model) for a formal logical construct, such as \u201cmoral logic.\u201d Starting from the semantics of moral statements, one ends up arguing that possible worlds actually exist. I don\u2019t really see the point in this, but then again, it\u2019s not my thing. ",
