            "answer_text": "Morals and values can be the same depending on what they are to you in a given situation. Morals typically deal with an ethical expression of right and wrong. -Examples: Don\u2019t kill people, don\u2019t lie, don\u2019t steal\u2026 Values are usually more complicated and much more in line with what is actually important to you personally. They can vary greatly from one person to another. -Examples: Help those in need whenever you can, don\u2019t talk back to your parents, always give 100%, say \u201cyes sir, no sir, please, and thank you,\u201d etc. Depending on the moral or value you are considering they can fall in line with one another. However, morals typically are immutable and \u201cblack or white\u201d for all situations. Values however typically hold an exception to a particular situation. Here are a couple comparisons that might make it easier to understand where the two can diverge in the same situations: To most it is morally wrong to kill someone else. However, there are many that hold the value that it is acceptable to kill someone else if they intend to do harm to someone else. To many it is morally wrong to lie. However, there are many that also believe a white lie or lie said to protect someone else is acceptable in given situations. In my opinion, values are much more important than morals. As I said, morals are typically black and white and the world is in full color. You should always be prepared to leave exceptions for certain situations. Living life with only two options in all situations can set you up for failure or limit the happiness life can bring... Republican/Democrat, Pro-life/pro-choice, Xbox/Playstation, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "They are not the same. Values are just one element of morality. Values are things we think are good, like honesty and bravery. But the fact that you and I both value honesty doesn\u2019t answer crucial moral questions about how we should behave. What we need in addition are moral principles: how do we put honesty into action? By always telling the truth? By mostly telling the truth, with rare exceptions (such as to save someone\u2019s feelings)? etc. ",
