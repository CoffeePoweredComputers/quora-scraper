            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Not too many events, situations, ideas, concepts, and challenges in life fall cleanly into a category of \u201cblack or white\u201d, \u201cgood or bad\u201d, and \u201cright or wrong\u201d. Though an extremely rare and select few may, there are, more often than not, a lot of grey areas. This applies to knowledge as well. If you are so rigidly defined by one outlook, premise, or philosophy, how can you ever truly hope to grow? If your manner of thought is so narrow as to conform to only one way of interpretive or viewing the world, you become incapable of adequate and fully assimilating, comprehending, and evaluating new ideas and information. One must be flexible enough to at least consider new life experiences, new data, and new concepts. However, this should in no way be taken to say that one must then accept and practice every new idea, notion, or hypothesis that comes down the road heading your way. You must, though, be open minded enough to analyze new information, knowledge, and ideas, and using reason, logic, common sense, and one's own moral compass decide whether or not such things are valid, practical, or worthwhile as far as they apply to one's sense of self, personal scrutiny, and moral outlook. From time to time, such new knowledge and information will come to change you. At other times, one will discover a determined, instinctual, and almost visceral reaction, akin to a \u201cgut feeling\u201d, informing you that a new approach, system of operations, concept, or manner of doing things is not for you or compatible with your sense of self. This is not wrong either. What is wrong is to not have an open mind that allows you to actually, truly, and sincerely take said new information, knowledge, ideas, and concepts and at least honestly and deliberately consider them BEFORE rendering one's verdict. To completely deny one's self the opportunity to at the very least assess, consider, deliberate, and analyze such new data, information, ideas, concepts, and experiences from the very start because of a preconceived, unbendable, inflexible, and close-minded, already accepted sense of a single philosophy or doctrine is the very definition of stubbornness, arrogance, and foolishness\u2026 and no one likes to suffer a fool. A truly enlightened person is willing to adjust their outlook, views, and way of thinking based on the incorporation of new, valid, and ACCEPTABLE information gained. If not, one has condemned themselves to the realm of fools, zealots, fundamentalists, uneducated \u201cknow-it-alls\u201d, madmen, or the likes of the people from the Jersey Shore (A small attempt at levity there at the end). But seriously, if one truly ever hopes to grow, become informed, act and speak intelligibly, have a chance at enlightenment, or even defend one's own viewpoints with success, one must be open minded enough to, at the very, acquire and honestly review and consider new information, ideas, and concepts BEFORE rendering a verdict, or even dismissing it. At least then you will be able to understand the opposing viewpoint and meaningfully defend your own viewpoints and opinions from an educated, learned, and intellectual standpoint. To do all this, one cannot be religated and confined to a singular, narrow adherence to a sole philosophy. To do so would be to become intellectually bound. One the flip side, while remaining open-minded, do not become a subscriber to every philosophy under the sun. To do so would lead one to a place of so many and divergent conflicting conclusions, that not enough the best of logic would assist you in rectifying the monumental contradictions in varying outcomes and conclusions. Mr. Spock's own capabilities would not suffice. There could be a very real possibility of looking down such a rabbit hole as to drive one mad. There is a reason for the saying and cliche \u201cthere is a fine line between genius and insanity.\u201d Just don't try to accept and adhere to all philosophies at once. In summation, don't confine yourself to just one outlook or interpretation. Keep an open mind, be willing to consider and analyze new knowledge, ideas, concepts, and hypothesise, and reason, with a willingness to accept if legitimate or withstanding scrutiny, based on your own understanding of self and their logic and validity, as to where or not they have any usefulness, value, or applicability to you. If in the end, you incorporate them into your intellectual outlook, great! If you decide them impertinent or lacking integrity or relevance by your evaluation and standards, so be it as well! Either outcome is just as valid so long as they have been considered and tested against your reason. An open mind and willingness to honestly consider\u2026 that is truly the important and key!!! *Addition: After reading some of the other answer given here, of which there were none when I began writing my answer, I would just like to point out one key premise concerning philosophy, and that is the epistemology of philosophy. Epistemology is a cornerstone of philosophy, much like the concept of logic or Logical Proofs. In epistemological, it is dictated that valid knowledge, information, experience, conclusions, and hypothesise can be gained and derived from 6 sources. The first five sources are the 5 physical senses (touch, taste, smell, sight, and sound, or hearing). The sixth, and most often forgotten, valid means of gaining knowledge or reaching a conclusion is intuition. In epistemology, intuition, when combined with reason and previously obtained knowledge or experience, is just as valid for reaching a conclusion as anything else. I will give an EXTREMELY oversimplified example that foregoes some nuances of the concept to help illustrate the point: You and I are 10 feet apart and I pick up a baseball. I then throw said baseball at your head. You, as a result, duck to prevent the collision of the baseball with your head. Why did you duck? You have not seen, smelt, tasted, felt, or heard the baseball hit your head. However, based on intuition, combined with reason and previous knowledge and experience, concluded that if you had not ducked out of the way, the baseball would have struck your head and pain would have ensued. And you would have been correct. There is a problem with epistemology, however. Even though it is an essential part and premise of philosophy, like logic, no two people possess the EXACT SAME previous knowledge or experiences. Thus, another person may have come to a completely different conclusion and coarse of action, yet it would be just as equally valid. This is seen in real-world applications when it comes to science and the scientific method. The philosophical doctrines of epistemology and logic are foundation to the scientific method. Thus, when a scientific experiments is performed, and even when the results can be duplicated reliably, time and time again, two scientists observing the same results may come to different conclusions based on those results. It may not like to be admitted, but it happens often and repeatedly. And until proven definitively one way or the other, both conclusions are equally valid. An example: the double slit experiment. One not observed by human beings (or measured or quantified, as some would prefer to state), the particles pass through BOTH slits simultaneously. One observed by a human, the particle passes through only one slit or the other. The result? Some scientists state that it's a misunderstanding. It has not to do with the observation at all, but that when a human is observing, a measurement is essentially taken and that produces the difference in outcome. Some quantum physicists have concluded that matter behaves differently when observed by sentient humans, and that matter is essentially an amorphous, undefined \u201ccloud\u201d of quantum statistical probablities until forced to take shape when observed by a human (think of it like this: everything behind you when you're alone that you can't see, isn't actually there until you turn around to observe it.) Other scientists have concluded that this sounds amazingly like computer software or gaming programs\u2026 the information is stored in memory, but it isn't accessed, compiled, and seen until you reach a point where that information, by necessity, required for use. So who has the invalid conclusion? Well, actually, all of them have an epistemological and logically valid conclusion, based on their own varying previously acquired knowledge and experience. Using intuition coupled with reason, the came to differing conclusions based on their differing knowledge and experience, but all of their conclusions are philosophically and scientifically valid. Only time will tell, ultimately, based on other experiments, which is right. ANOTHER EXAMPLE: even using, what most of us would consider, the pure, logical, and definitive academic discipline of mathematics, physicists come to varying hypothesise and theories based on the same agreed upon rules, equations, functions, and processes of mathematics. In the end, all equations must balance out right? Yet, based on the mathematics of physics, we have such divergent theories as The Big Bang, \u201cM\u201d Theory, the Multiverse, Parallel Universes, Inflation, Supersymmetry, String Theory, the Theory of Everything, and Quantum Theory.

            "answer_text": "If a person combines all philosophies the result would possibly make the person a competent teacher of \u201cphilosophy\u201d. However, the different premises and different conclusions discovered in comparing one philosophy with another philosophy would reveal contradictions in logic. When a philosopher recognizes the Three Laws of Logic, they have a good tool for measuring; but if a philosopher fails to recognize the Three Laws of Logic, what the philosopher has is equivalent only to a \u201cpencil\u201d. A pencil gives the philosopher the ability to \u201clist\u201d the various philosophies, but it does not give the philosopher the ability to distinguish the truth or falsity of any philosophy. The philosopher needs a ruler. (Rulers are sometimes called a \u201crule\u201d and that is interesting, because when we think of a \u201crule\u201d we also think of a \u201claw\u201d.) It is important to know Aristotle\u2019s Three Laws of Logic. Unfortunately, what most of mankind learns first, is that there are different philosophies, and most of mankind does not learn about Aristotle\u2019s Three Laws of Logic, until much later, or not at all. This is why some philosophers make Category Errors. One particular form of Category Error fails to distinguish between imagination and fact. Merely because something is \u201cthought\u201d does not equate to a fact that the thought is anything other than an imagination. Some identities can exist as imaginary identities, but that does not make the imaginary identity equivalent to a truth. Logical fallacies can exist, but they exist in the category of errors, rather than truths. There can be imaginings; but that does not equate to a categorization showing all imaginings to be truths. I can imagine my self King, but that does not qualify in the category of fact or truth that I am indeed a King. It is only true that I fit into the category of imaginings as King. Thus, there can be difficulties when a philosopher concludes that all philosophies are \u201ctrue\u201d. Aristotle\u2019s Three Laws of Logic serve as the measure. This is what distinguishes what is False from what is True. The ultimate category in philosophy is that which distinguishes what is true from what is false. There can be many different kinds of medicines, but not all of the medicines will cure my headache. All philosophies can be understood categorically as existing in \u201cthought\u201d; but that does not equate to the conclusion that all human imaginings equate to \u201ctruths\u201d. If all the contradictions are combined and all identities are combined, and all of the excluded middles are combined, it results in a list of variations in category, while failing to acknowledge the category which distinguishes what is true from what is false. All that is contradictory is false. No philosopher can know this, without first recognizing the Three Laws of Logic. ",
