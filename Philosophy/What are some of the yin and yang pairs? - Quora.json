            "answer_text": "Well, look at anything and you'll find a pair of opposites in it. After all, everything in our universe has infinitely many pairs of opposites, divided so deeply on itself in many ways in some things that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate a single yin yang pair in it, but you will always be able to find one. The most abstract or concrete pairs that don't take much thought or time to find would be many of the pairs found in these answers such as light and darkness, peaks and troughs, and perhaps gravity and fusion.
