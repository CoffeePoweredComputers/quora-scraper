            "answer_text": "\u201cWe are all one\u2026 but taxed separately.\u201d * The idea that we all share a common consciousness is a popular mystical idea: you find it in Advaita Vedanta, for example. And the physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger linked it with his own science-informed attitude towards reality. But how could this be proved using science or logic? Everyone experiences a restricted consciousness \u2014 I have no idea what the person next door is conscious of. Doesn\u2019t that imply a very practical form of separateness? At best, you can recover the notion of a common consciousness by saying that we are all fragments of a larger whole. But why assume this larger whole is a consciousness? Isn\u2019t an \u2018unconscious\u2019 universe an adequate container for all these fragmentary consciousnesses? Perhaps. Perhaps not. It may depend on whether you believe that \u201cto be is to be perceived\u201d. In my opinion the idea of a universal consciousness cannot be established purely through science or logic. As far as I can tell it is closer to a feeling than a provable statement. Mystical traditions and/or abnormal brain states can make such feelings more easily accessible, at least transiently. So, perhaps ironically, the feeling of universal consciousness is very personal. But it\u2019s a feeling that is frequently expressed, and not just in mystical texts! \"Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration \u2014 that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There's no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.\" - Bill Hicks (a stand-up comedian) \u201cStrangers passing in the streetBy chance two separate glances meet.And I am you and what I see is me\u201d - Pink Floyd, \u201cEchoes\u201d  Notes * I heard a version of this joke somewhere, but can\u2019t find the original version.

            "answer_text": "When u wake up from a dream you remember a life you were not physically in. But it had physical attributes. Like your thoughts. That is shared consciousness to me. Conscious in your dreams and thoughts. What does that have to do with survival? Nothing. We dream at night through other people's consciousness. Say you wake up from a dream and u remember you were with someone from your life. Maybe your sister. But it didn't look like them. And in the dream you walk into your home but it doesn't look like your house. Instead it looks fuzzy or maybe even just a little different. And then you wake up and you instantly, with confidence, say it was your house, and your sister in the dream. But if it didn't look like them why would you think it's them? It's because you woke up conscious and that's all you know. And so you think it must have been your sister and your home. That's because the feeling of home is the same to everyone. And when you wake up you cannot fathom being someone else (as you all have expressed on this thread). So even though the dream didn't show you your home exactly the way you know it, when you wake up the feeling of home was so real, you beleive it was your home. Because the feeling of home is so familiar to you that you don't question it. Shared consciousness. And same goes for the sister of yours that you saw in your dream. The sister that didn't quite look like your sister, but \u201cyou knew it was her\u201d. Again you woke up, as you, and the feeling in the dream towards that sister were so familiar to you that it must have been YOUR sister. And you go about your day not even realising you just shared consciousness with someone else. This is just my theory :) Another example of this would be when you read a paragraph in a book over and over again but you keep forgetting what you read. To me that means someone somewhere wakes up across the world and says \u201cI had a dream last night that I was reading a book over and over again.\u201d I think God or the shared consciousness is just trying us all on for size. This world is so amazing and vast I could go on forever with these theories. And there is a way science could figure this out btw. Oh ya and when we don't remember dreams I think it's because there was nothing in them we can relate to. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, just a short answer: For one \"consciousness\" is a very overused and by that misused word, that everybody pretends to know what he/she is talking about, but nobody does, really. Consciousness is not a sticker, which can be applied from the outside without contradiction, it's not words, consciousness is a state. Attesting an inside state to someone else, who you can't ever be, from the outside is always, at least part, speculation. Secoundly I had an aha moment once with the next thought. Consider this: everybody has his/her unique position in time/space; a unique looking point so to say. You've never seen through my 'head-camera' and I have never looked through yours or been you. So what if we're all \"the only one\"? Life is only logical in a sense of all things transitioning into each other while seemingly keeping to certain rules. But think about it again: So what if we're all \"the only one\"? It's not logical, but so isn't dying or fun or having a sense of taste. Maybe existence itself just isn't a \"question\" that can achieve a meaningful answer from the standpoint of logic. So what if we're all \"the only one, who exists\"? And even though life isn't logical enough for such a solution, life is, sure as hell, contradictory enough, to at least, for us, play this thought through as a valid possibility. Maybe everybody is the only one who exists, and we're all here together. PS: don\u2019t put down \u201cdrugged musicians\u201d, as they are sometimes in the footsteps of the age-old tradition of mystics, which try to approach life from the side of it\u2019s immediate \u201cis-ness\u201d, which arises from silence and not always putting a thought between you and the immediate experience of life.

            "answer_text": "Well that depends a bit on your own definition of consciousness, some will allow for sharing and other will not. My understanding leads me to say that they are all separate. Consciousness is the subjective experience of a process in the brain (or several processes depending on where you draw the line). Information is bound together in order to be manipulated or responded too, something that has an advantage over reflexively reacting to separate and current stimuli. As far as I\u2019m concerned consciousness is a feature of the brain, something that the brain does. Much like vision or hearing is a feature of the brain. I do not share someone else\u2019s sight or sensations, nor do I share their thoughts or desires. Sure they may line up from time to time, but we all have slightly different perspectives. A work of art can be interpreted very differently depending on your experiences, despite being the same stimulus. Everything we see, hear, sense, is filtered through our experiences, our memories, our personality, and current state, leading to different ways they are processed subjectively. Whether consciousness is separate or shared is hard to give a definite answer to because there is no consensus on the definition, nor can the subjectivity of the matter be properly studied. From a brain perspective (and definition) it\u2019s personal. But in the end it\u2019s pretty much up to you what fits under the banner of \u201cconsciousness\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is a vital function performed by a vital organ, the brain. It is as prosaic as liver chemistry; they both work to keep the body alive and intact for as long as possible. This view of consciousness should be self evident but it is obscured by the forceful effect of civilization on this cognitive function which affects our thinking about it. Consciousness is basically the act of scanning for signals and then focusing the attention on those relevant to survival. This primordial function has been profoundly affected by the drastic changes in our natural environment. In addition to the advent of civilization and technology and their effect on what our consciousness focuses on, we have learned how to repurpose our survival oriented original consciousness for the entertainment value in it. Ingesting certain chemicals, prolonged drumming, chanting, swaying, complicated repetitive ritualistic motions with odd postures, dance, enduring ordeals, and the trick we learned from the days when we were hunters, sitting absolutely still for extended periods of time and how sometimes the interior of the mind falls silent and the whole world appears to light up from within\u2026 Originally and still to some extent, consciousness is a vigilant sentinel, a watchful lookout on behalf of the body with the brain that performs this task. But we have drugged ourselves, one way or another, into a very strange state of mind, and now we are lost in our thought streams, filled with words, images, memories, moods and fantasies. Now we think consciousness is this wondrous, marvelous, miraculous, unique phenomenon when it is just another body function, an evolved adaptation to being forced to navigate a hostile and sometimes opportunity rich environment. All animals with intact brains, even insects, have some measure of consciousness, so the number you quoted, which apparently is a reference to the human race, must be augmented by trillions more. ",

Now, we don\u2019t yet have a theory of consciousness, but there is nothing we know from physics or chemistry that would suggest how or why non conscious atoms create consciousness. We might have to go deeper into the world, and this would require understanding quantum mechanics, but we don\u2019t have a good understanding of quantum mechanics either. According to David Bohm, there is a fundamental unity or whole underlying all particles. He also argued that it was conscious in some fundamental sense. If Bohm\u2019s interpretation the implicate order is right, are consciousness is most likely linked. Also, there is a great deal of evidence on psi that confirms this. So this might be the direction we should go in. ",

As he states, calling it \u2018Mind\u2019: Indeed, as soon as (abstract) Mind identifies itself with a point of view, it can but identify itself to a particular one. However, this being granted, the mere insistence on the \"particularity\" of a point of view sounds artificial. Since no point of view is available from which all the other points of view would be seen as equivalent, the point of view Mind adopts, when adopted, is not one among others; it is the point of view, self-referred to as my point of view.Let me retain that (abstract) Mind, having no point of view of its own, can but adopt particular points of view and identify itself completely with each of them. Mind is by itself point-of-view-less, just as it is placeless and timeless. The aporia is the following: Mind is not within the world since, even if it can identify itself to any available point of view, it is not identical to this point of view. Nor does Mind stand outside the world, since it has no point of view of its own, independent from the points of view the world can offer. Wittgenstein would say that Mind is the limit of the world.

If I share a consciousness with my wife, how is it that I don\u2019t always know what she is feeling, even when all my attention is on her? If we are all sharing one consciousness, it seems to be in only a very limited way that has little effect on our lives.

If I\u2019ve mistaken your meaning in some way, please do let me know. ",

No one has given us a real definition for kinds of activities that can be accomplished by the human consciousness because very few of us think outside the box. Life can be complex or simple.
