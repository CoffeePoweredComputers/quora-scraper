            "answer_text": "The only way I can answer that is from my personal experiences and years of observing people. Yes, racism exists in every society and yes, some elements of truth exist in a few stereotypes, however stretched or exaggerated beyond all reason. Whether intended to be hurtful and/or dismissive or as an attempt at humor, all of it is fairly a prime of human nature; the need to compare other people to your people. The funny thing, that NEVER seems funny to the person making a snide slur, is that the recipient is likely to\u2019ve done the same about you at some point. \u2018Them\u2019 and \u2018Us\u2019 has been an integral part of our psyche since we first walked upright and noticed that group at the other end of what we thought was our personal savannah. H. Sapiens is a curious animal in that he seldom seems to learn from his mistakes. We also look at ourselves as above or below; better or worse than the next person or persons. Again, this is normal but unfortunate. Let\u2019s see, Asians are supposed to be bad drivers or is that just Japanese drivers? Poles are said to be stupid, Mexicans and blacks are presumed lazy, Irish are only qualified to be cops or crooks, Scots and Jews are apparently cheap, Germans are Aryan supremacists and want to rule the world, All Italians are Mafia, the French are arrogant snobs, Indians smell like curry\u2026Whites think they are superior to all the \u2018darker\u2019 races (but we still like to tan ourselves). God, how many more of these hateful and cruel stereotypes get bandied about day by day. The worst racial offense, to my way of thinking, is the ease with which some black people throw the word \u2018Nigger\u2019 at one other so casually but claim mortal insult if the word comes from outside their race. I find that word to be more offensive than any slander directed at my own ethnicity which is Scot/Norse. I also find it interesting that so many unique and distinct cultures are lumped together as White, Black, Hispanic or Asian. This is a bit off topic, or maybe not\u2026a lot of Hispanics are happy to be called Latinos but Latin was invented by the Italians who are NOT considered to be Latin but White. Can anyone explain that contradiction? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. If there weren\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t have the impact and be believed as much as they are. But it\u2019s only elements. A racist statement like \u201cblacks are more likely to commit crime\u201d is much more powerful and memorable if it relates to a specific incident of a black person committing a crime. Even more so if the crime is gruesome and notorious. The thing that makes it racist is taking that element of truth (a black person committed a crime) and distorting and expanding it in ways that cannot be logically justified (therefore most black people are likely to commit crimes). Without that seed of truth, it\u2019s much harder to convince people to believe the falsehood. This is important to realize because if you try to argue against someone making racist remarks, they will often try to make the argument about the element of truth rather than the unjustifiable claims made based on it.
