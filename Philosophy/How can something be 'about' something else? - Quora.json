Since when did anyone produce a material object about something else? Only the non-material concept could accomplish that! Matter possesses an indeterminacy that only something non-material can overcome! In fact, this difference points the way to the realization that both matter and the non-material exist. Matter is subject to the senses; the non-material isn\u2019t. So something non-material is not subject to the senses, but is only discerned by reason! And only reason can produce anything about something else. ",
