            "answer_text": "Thanks siddhanth for the A2A. The idea behind paradoxes is that some way or the other, they lead to an infinite loop (in a programming sense). So if you have  a rouge AI ( Skynet from the terminator series or Wheatley from the Portal series) you can trick / ask / make them think about a paradox . for ex \"This statement  is true\"  or \" Execute this command; do not execute the above command\". The reason why either of the above would work is that an AI would not be able to identify a paradox from a actual statement if the paradox is worded in a different way i.e., you can make a lot of variations to the same paradox by changing names, objects. etc and there would be an infinite number of such variations. So to successfully detect that it is a paradox, the AI has to know all of the possible combinations, which is not possible so given a paradox an AI would keep on working it till it runs out of memory and comes crashing down. Hence you've successfully defeated the AI using paradoxes NOTE: I got this idea from a Portal 2 game plot which fails on a really \"dumb\" AI ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you mean logical paradoxes.  The paradoxes show the limits of and the defects of certain formal theories.  For example,  Frege's attempt to formalize set theory was shot down by Russel with the famous Russel Paradox: is the set of sets which are not members of themselves a member of itself?  Either answer produces a contradiction.  The result is some restrictions had to be places on which classes are sets and which are not. ",
