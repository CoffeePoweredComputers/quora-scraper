            "answer_text": "When we talk about can/could we should consider what consciousness is. It mainly exist due to sense impressions. Only a small part might be classified as mind-only. And since there are no senses this would be a 'silent' kind of existence unless we assume that such a being can think without words.I don't consider this very plausible but we should keep in mind that the various religions express that such beings exist (Gods, souls and such).  The next question is 'can consciousness exist in a sensual being (like a human) without sense impressions'?The question to this, at least according to hinduism, buddhism and most likely various other religions is yes. These describe a mind state called samadhi in which the mind shuts out sense impressions. All what remains is mind-only impressions.  David Pearce pointed out dreams which is mind only and deprivation tanks which also shut down sense impressions. These confirm that consciousness can exist without sense impressions.  So two things: conscious beings 'born' without senses, not very plausible. conscious beings who experience consciousness apart from the senses: plausible. ",

Now we have 3 brains, and the human consciousness is built by the third on the top of the two firsts. However our experiences with the exteranl world pass through our senses. Without them we are just empty of any possible emperience. In his theory of hanging and seeing, Winicott explain how a young people without the proper touche and feel is just condmaned to death or dementia.  So there is no evidence that consciousness and even complex life, exists without any senses and experiences. Donald Winnicott ",

            "answer_text": "Is it possible to experience consciousness without senses? Phenomenal consciousness is conscious experience, so your question boils down to asking if there can be conscious experience of conscious experience \u2014 i.e. is conscious experience reflexive? I don\u2019t believe that it is. I think what happens is that the idea of conscious experience \u2014 the entirety of the constituents of conscious experience \u2014 arises as a constituent of that entirety. There is nothing that is \u201cdoing\u201d the experiencing, no \u201cexperiencer\u201d, no \u201csubject of consciousness\u201d (unless you want to call the entirety of the constituents of conscious experience the \u201csubject\u201d, as Galen Strawson does). Data from the sense organs are just more of the constituents of conscious experience, and the arising of ideas need not be accompanied by the arising of data from the sense organs. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes consciousness can be experienced without senses. Because consciousness itself is an experience. senses and intelligence takes the experience further. Consciousness is union of knowing (time) and feeling (energy) of known world. This union connects the knowing to known to experience consciously. Senses are effects of consciousness which further expands the knowing to experience further. Senses are tools which helps one to make better idols but the rock as experience already exists. ",

            "answer_text": "During dreams or in a sensory deprivation tank, one may be intensely conscious. Input from peripheral sensory receptors is mostly absent. During normal waking life, the role of afferent discharges to the cerebral cortex from peripheral sense organs isn't to create consciousness. Rather, it's to ensure that the content of one's waking world-simulation tracks fitness-relevant patterns in the local environment.  World-simulation models of conscious experience differ from perceptual na\u00efve realism. ",

Assuming that you mean senses as physical, taste, smell, touch, hearing and sight with no other senses and you want consciousness to erupt out of that, I don't think so. But if you allow for the sixth senses, then yes.  And that could happen under both situations, having had, but lost all senses and your mind is still on, or evolving to consciousness. ",

If yes, then, if we just cut off all its sensors apart, then it would be something concious without senses. If you consider something concious if it can think, then, as we don't need senses while thinking because it's a 'mind' thing, an organism that has lost access to its senses in an accident, can be concious.
