            "answer_text": "-Fire I think this one is pretty obvious, but I would say that the taming of the electron also counts in the broader category of taming fire\u2026so there\u2019s quite a bit in that category including this smart phone with which I am writing this answer. Some may not agree, but this is my answer and they can scream away all they want in the comment section which I am unlikely to read. -Pasteurization Again, pretty obvious right? And also again, I will include something not strictly related to pasteurization, but I do think it\u2019s close enough to be included in the broader category: water purification. The ability to consume food and water without gambling on contracting deadly illnesses every time is pretty important to us I\u2019d say. -Antibiotics (and vaccines) For those times pasteurization just isn\u2019t enough, or not relevant to the infection even, we have medicines! Specifically antibiotics, antivirals and vaccines. Combined I\u2019d say they probably save more lives than most people realize. -Mass Transportation That is to say, the ability of massive numbers of people and things to move quickly around the globe. The results have been somewhat mixed in terms of environmental impacts, health concerns and fostering an absolute obsession with fossil fuels, but still there are few things more impactful. No one said all the impact had to be good, right? -Quora (and the internet on which it is based) Similar to mass transit, except for data, and it moves that around significantly faster than mass transit does people and things. Data moving faster and faster means so many things and has already had so many impacts (although most are likely in our future rather than the past). Primarily the effects are global and much easier to implement than the mass transit thing, maybe I should put it one ahead! But seriously, the reason I said Quora specifically is because fast data transfer and virtual interconnectedness allows people to learn things faster, which really does have an immeasurable impact on everyone around the world. The internet is probably the main tool being used for knowledge transfer today to foster the next Louis Pasteur or Jonah Salk, just awesome! Also Quora helps us learn things, I know it certainly does for me, so of course it must get a shout out. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if you want most impact overall, you have to go back to the things that were invented earliest that we still cannot do without. So, number one would be control of fire. Humans have lived in heavily glaciated environments through much of pre-history, and control of fire was crucial to human success in spreading across the world. There are a lot of technologies from this period which were crucial at the time, but none of them are as indispensable and most have become pretty obsolete. The next big one would be agriculture. We could say that today, agriculture is far more important than even control of fire, except that agriculture depends so heavily on control of fire that it\u2019s unimaginable how we could possibly feed the current population with that agriculture we\u2019d have left if we somehow forgot how to control fire. Invention of the military is the next major conceptual leap that propelled humans forward. A military organization is profoundly different from the normal instinctive behavior of gangs of juvenile males establishing a dominance hierarchy, though aspects of the earlier pattern do remain and dealing with them is essential to a successful military. Military organizations are the crucial step that leads to civilization, both allowing them to exist in the first place and giving them a major inherent advantage over societies arranged by natural human instinct. In point of fact, the military is a more important innovation than civilization and the impact of any civilization is extremely dependent on the military that defends it. To the point that civilization is pushed off the top five, because there are still a couple of inventions that have had a bigger impact. Domestication of animals is next, even if it may have been earlier than agriculture. While domestication is not really indispensable at the purely pragmatic level, it has had a profound and enduring impact on the relationship of humans to the natural environment. Domestication of animals is what connects humanity back to the natural world, despite being as artificial a behavior as the other major inventions. Without domestication of animals, humans probably could not maintain respect for the importance of the wilderness. The only possible bridge emotionally connecting humans to appreciating nature would be cats, and cats aren\u2019t really sufficient for this in the absence of any fully domesticated species. Liking cats really only makes you like cats, it doesn\u2019t make you like all animals, nor appreciate the natural environment. And fifth on our list is money. Money isn\u2019t absolutely necessary to civilization the way the military is, but certainly most of the major benefits of civilization are impossible to realize without it. A fungible medium of economic exchanges is what allows for specialization to maximize overall productivity. Money remains useful even in the absence of civilization, as long as the regulation of the currency supply is not dependent on a central authority. Sorry to say for civilization, but it didn\u2019t get just barely pushed out of the top five. There are still a couple of technologies that have had more impact, like buildings, and clothing. Hugely important, but not quite as much as some other things. If humans didn\u2019t instinctively know how to use simple weapons, weapons would be on this list, but as humans do instinctively know how to use simple weapons, we\u2019d have to talk about particular weapons technologies rather than treating all weapons as a weapon (otherwise we\u2019d have to include other things that are instinctive like language and eating and even breathing). Writing belongs on the list too, it\u2019s ahead of civilization (and maybe buildings) but not up in the top five. Anyway, the top five is just the top five, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a massive cut-off such that there\u2019s a profound difference between the importance of money and writing. ",
