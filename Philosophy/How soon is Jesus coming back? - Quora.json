            "answer_text": "Hi my name is George and I am a born again Christian. I am concerned about what is going on in the world today. I believe we will be the last generation before Jesus Christ returns to the earth. Are you ready? Are you a Christian? Have you truly given your life to Christ? I believe we are running out of time very quickly to make a decision. I believe CERN is altering our reality. There stated goal is to open up a portal to another dimension. Actually what they want to do is open a portal to HELL! They chose to build CERN on an old Appolyon temple site. The people who built the temple believed it was the gate to the bottomless pit. I believe CERN is responsible for the so called Mandela effect. I believe CERN is just another attempt to build the tower of Babble, and we know what God did in response to that. What makes the people at CERN think they can get away with what they are trying to do? But then again what they are doing would be a fulfillment of prophecy. Revelation speaks of opening the bottomless pit. But Revelation is about the final seven years of man on earth. Are you ready? As if CERN was not enough now NASA is getting into the game with project BLUE BEAM. Phase 1 \u2013 A breakdown of all archaeological knowledge by creating false earthquakes and allowing for fake \u201cnew discoveries\u201d that will show the errors in fundamental religious doctrines. Phase 2 \u2013 A holographic laser projection of a deity specific to each region of the earth that will change into a picture of the anti-Christ. The appearances of cities in the sky all over the world are believed to be a test of this system. Phase 3 \u2013 Telepathic communication through the use of very low frequency radio waves to make people believe they are hearing from God. Phase 4 \u2013 Making humanity believe an alien invasion is eminent and making people believe the rapture is occurring and finally a supernatural force will create chaos and cause people to accept the New World Order. This seems to be pretty far fetched to me. My problem is that scripture teaches that Christ will not return until the end of the Tribulation, and that begins with the anti-Christ making a seven year covenant with Israel. I believe we are more likely headed for WW3 and this will allow the anti-Christ to show up and create a peace treaty with Israel. This will be the beginning of the Tribulation. Then comes the BIG DECEPTION! I believe that fallen angels will come to the earth in UFO\u2019s. They will claim to be aliens from another world and will say they populated our planet many years ago. They will claim they have returned to give us a DNA upgrade. But this upgrade will actually be the mark of the beast. Anyone who accepts this mark can not go to heaven. See once the anti-Christ gains control he will bring about peace for a while, but after three and one half years he will go into the Holly Temple in Jerusalem and declare that he is God! At this point he makes everyone receive the mark of the beast or you can not buy or sell anything. Things are really going to get ugly. Are you ready? I believe we will see the tribulation begin very soon. Time is running out to make a decision. I am talking about a decision that will affect you for eternity. Yes there is life after death. But unless you accept Jesus it won\u2019t be very pleasant. I hope my words can impact at least one person for Christ. How can anyone deny that the Bible is God\u2019s word? Every prophecy In scripture either has or will come to pass. The Bible said that Israel would get there home land back and they did in 1948. It also says that the generation that sees the signs given in Mathew would not end prior to the second coming of Christ. We are that generation. Are you ready? Please if you don\u2019t know Jesus Christ as your personal savior make this simple prayer. Lord Jesus I know I am a sinner but you died on the cross and shed your blood for every sin I have ever committed I turn from that sin now and ask you to save me. Please forgive me for my past. If you pray this prayer and believe in your heart that Jesus died for you and for forgiveness of your sins you will be saved. May God Bless You! \ufffd\ufffd\ufffde\ufffd ",
