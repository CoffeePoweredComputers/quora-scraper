            "answer_text": "Yes DID do exist....  I am presenting you one of the most interesting case I have ever read... It is the case of Billy Milligan.This guy had 24 personalities sharing the same body. 10 were known before and other 14 were labelled 'undesirables'. This guy also committed some crimes like armed robbery and 3 rapes in ohio state university. When his lawyers were collecting evidences for his defence the came across it.His personalities are as follow:These ten are the alters whom personalities \"Ragen\" and \"Arthur\" decided were not \"undesirable.\" They freely shared consciousness, and doctors quickly learned of their existences.1.Billy Milligan (William Stanley Milligan) is the core personality.2.Arthur is an extremely sophisticated and educated Englishman. An expert in science and medicine, with a focus on hematology. He is in \"the spot\" \u2013 that is, in charge of the shared body \u2013 during times that required intellectual thinking. Arthur is one of only two personalities who could classify a person in the group as an undesirable.3.Ragen Vadascovinich is the \"keeper of hate\". His name comes from the words \"rage again\". Ragen describes himself as Yugoslavian, has a Slavicaccent and can write and speak in Serbian. He controls the spot in dangerous times and can designate group members as \"undesirable\". He admitted committing robbery in order to support \"the family\", but had no knowledge of the rapes.4.Allen is a con man and a manipulator. He is the most common person to talk to the outside world. He plays the drums and paints portraits. Also the only right-handed self. He is the only personality that smokes cigarettes.5.Tommy is the escape artist; he is often confused with Allen. He plays the tenor sax and is an electronics expert. He is also a painter, specializing in landscapes.6.Danny is afraid of people, especially men. He only paints still lifes, saying that this was because Chalmer made him dig his own grave and buried him in it.7.David, age eight, is the \"keeper of pain\". He comes to the spot to take the pain of the others.8.Christene, age three, was the one who would stand in the corner in school when \"Billy\" would get in trouble. She has dyslexia, but Arthur taught her to read and write. Ragen has a special bond with her.9.Christopher, Christene's brother, plays the harmonica.10.Adalana, a lesbian, cooks and cleans house for the others, and writes poetry. Milligan's attorney claimed that Adalana had admitted to committing the rapes without the knowledge of Milligan or the other alters.The UndesirablesThese people were labeled \"undesirable\" after breaking the rules laid down by Ragen and Arthur. These alters were no longer allowed \"on the spot\" (that is, to hold consciousness) and only revealed themselves after Milligan was sent to the hospital.1.Phil is a thug and took part in planning some small time crimes. Has a Brooklyn accent. Marked due to him being a criminal.2.Kevin is a criminal planner; he helped devise a plan to rob a drug store. Labeled also because he is a criminal.3.Walter is Australian. He calls himself a big-game hunter and has an excellent sense of direction. Was often used as a spotter. He was labeled because he shot and killed a crow.4.April only has thoughts about destroying Billy's stepfather. Declared an Undesirable when she convinced Ragen to kill Chalmer. Luckily though Arthur was able to talk him out of it at the last second.5.Samuel is a Jewish person and the only one who believes in God. Was marked because he sold some of the other people's personal paintings.6.Mark is the workhorse. He is often referred to as the zombie because he does nothing unless he is told, and will stare at walls when bored.7.Steve is the impostor, he uses imitations for comedy. Steve never accepted that he was an MP. He was made to be undesirable because his comedy caused the family problems.8.Lee is the prankster and his practical jokes normally get the family into trouble. He does not care about consequences for his actions. He was made an undesirable because one of his jokes put them into solitary confinement.9.Jason is the pressure valve. He was used at the beginning to release tension for the family, but he caused them to get into too much trouble and was marked as an undesirable.10.Bobby always dreams of leading some adventure or fixing some global crisis, but he has no ambitions and was labeled due to that fact.11.Shawn, who is four and deaf, makes buzzing sounds so he can feel the vibration in his head. He was labeled an undesirable because there was no benefit from being deaf later on in life. (Even though he is an undesirable he was never cast into the shadows beyond the spot; he was just never allowed to take the spot.)12.Martin is a snob, from New York. He wants things just handed over to him without earning them.13.Timothy worked in a florist shop until he encountered a gay man who flirted with him. He went into his own world after that.The Teacher(Not an Undesirable)1.The Teacher, was by far the greatest milestone to helping Billy achieve fusion. He is the sum of all 24 people put together, and has almost total recall of all the other people's actions and thoughts. Source-wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "First, I think you are trying to ask about DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) not MPD, as that has been proven to be an incorrect understanding of DID. DID is a dissociative disorder, not a personality disorder. Many people will find it offensive if you use the term MPD. The answer to your question is yes, alters exist. Here\u2019s an answer that I gave to a different question about DID that may help you understand better what it was like: Dissociative Identity Disorder occurs when a child **under the age of 8** (before the brain develops a \u201cwhole\u201d sense of self) is subjected to intense trauma over a sustained period of time (often sexual or ritualistic in nature, but occasionally severe childhood illness requiring multiple surgeries can also have an impact). The child has no ability to handle this trauma (would likely die from it) so the brain creates a coping mechanism and unconsciously erects amnesia barriers, allowing the formation of additional \u201cselves\u201d or alters (alternate personalities). These alters replace the child in times of trauma, allow them to live a normal life without memory of the trauma. People with DID often experience loss of time, cannot recall important daily or personal details, are often accused of lying bc they don\u2019t remember saying or doing something, are often accused of having wild mood swings (each of these are the result of other alters fronting or taking control of the body), then usually around the age of 30 (but sometimes much sooner) the amnesia barriers begin to break down. This is when most people begin to piece together something is seriously wrong. They remember past traumatic events, they hear voices of the other alters in their system (unlike with schizophrenia, these voices come from within, not without), and they often begin to experience severe anxiety and depression. It can be very confusing and scary to live with DID. Sometimes you blink and hours, days, or even months have gone by. Sometimes you blink and you are in an completely different room. You almost never have recollection of any events that took place during these episodes. Then you also have to deal with the way society treats you. There is intense stigma around DID, even within the psychiatric community where some do not even acknowledge its legitimacy. You also have people who are afraid of you, bc of Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of DID (as serial killers, etc.). It is treated with therapy and EMDR. There are no medications approved to help with DID specifically, but there are some to help with the side-effects such as anxiety and depression. Other things that they wish people understood about DID: We are not attention seeking.Hollywood often gets us wrong and can cause people to unjustly fear us.We are more likely to hurt ourselves than someone else.We often suffer with more than just DID; We usually have depression, anxiety, and C-PTSD that comes with night terrors, flashbacks that will bring us to our knees, and hyper-awareness.Each alter exists because they were needed to protect a child from traumatic abuse.It isn\u2019t something we can get over or put behind usWe don\u2019t do parlor tricks like switching on demand.We have triggers which will cause us to panic or act in ways society doesn\u2019t care for (like cry openly in public, run for an exit, or dissociate completely).It hurts us when the first thing you ask is \u201cYou are going to go crazy and hurt me are you?\u201d when we open up to you about it.And to quote a friend: We have zero control over this disorder.learning to live together as a system takes years of painful hard work.We are not dangerous and there are no bad alters just hurt ones.We are all here because of traumaNone is more important than the other. Just because, one person fronts the most doesn't mean he/she is the priority. Everybody in the system deserves to be heard.1\u20133% of the world's population has DID. It is not rare.Also\u2026. In answer to a question about the portrayal of DID in film: DID is a very complex disorder, so you have your work cut out for you if you want to portray someone with DID accurately. There is a lot of confusion and pain in dealing with trauma, not really knowing for certain what is real from what feels like a dream at times. The loss of time, the never being in control of the alter\u2019s actions but somehow being responsible for them. The feeling of only living a small portion or your own life, as you have no memory of the rest. Feeling like you are a different age than your actual \u201cbody age\u201d or having alters who are not the same sex as the body. There is a lot to consider. Then you add the stigma anyone with a mental illness faces, compounded by the exaggerated stigma of this particular disorder and the fact that so few truly understand it. It is possible for alters to go away for long periods of time, especially if they feel they are no longer needed to protect the host. This can also occur in therapy once the trauma they hold has been told and understood - that is referred to as integration. However, it has been my experience, that even when you think an alter has disappeared for good (gone for years) a certain trigger or extended period of stress can cause them to surface again. No it is not possible to develop DID after the age of 8. A traumatic event experienced after this time could result in other disorders, such as PTSD but not DID. This is something that can only occur before the brain has fully developed a cohesive \u201cself,\u201d thus professionals say 8 is the oldest age at which you can develop DID. I\u2019m not sure about an accurate portrayal of DID in movies. It is such a complex disorder that encompasses almost every aspect of your life, I imagine it would be quite difficult. I think one of the main things they get wrong is an exaggeration of the outward appearance of DID. DID is meant to go unnoticed - it is the chameleon of disorders with its entire purpose being to allow the host to live a normal life (can\u2019t do that if you have overt switches early on) without trauma memory. It is normally perceived as simply severe mood swings and memory loss (all of which can be easily explained away). Only when the trauma begins to flood back in the initial stages of the amnesia barriers breaking down, and you are an adult with a child alter or an alter with a different gender\u2026 that is when the switches are clear and usually then only to someone who knows what to look for and is trusted by the alter. Also, there is a great deal of shame you experience in switching. No true DID I\u2019ve ever known has revelled in it. It comes with embarrassment and severe headaches. So if you see someone who seems like they enjoy DID, I would question the authenticity. Also, in Hollywood, they seem to have a need to make DID very scary. Truth is you must have another condition to make you homicidal or psychotic, most people with DID are much more likely to hurt or kill themselves than another person. The suicide rate is quite high. Hope this helps. I\u2019m adding this to the body of my original answer as well, in case others have similar questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question reflects a fascinating discussion that has been going on for decades. There is no agreement among philosophers, academics, scholars, scientists, psychiatrists, and clinicians. I have witness fights in professional settings when the opinions are so divided that some individuals that have dedicated years of their lives to the subject get devalued and lose their temper. The opinions are extreme, dived and controversial. One of the most interesting and polemic points of view among clinicians is the argument that the formation of alters is simply a form of social compliance, possibly to conform with popular and psychiatric conceptions of psychopathology, but usually in response to therapists on the lookout for the disorder (Baynes et al, 2009). This is true in many cases, and I have observed it myself. Clients that have a propensity to dissociate and are easy to hypnotize, are highly suggestible, and therefore could become victims of abusive therapists that have the need to control and enjoy exercising a significant influence on others. I have seen the clients and the therapists that fall in this description. Most of those clinicians are people that have unhealthy dissociative symptoms themselves and instead of working on integrating themselves, work on \u201cintegrating\u201d others by fragmenting them. But I want to believe that this is the exception and not the rule \u2014as many affirm. But of course, it is difficult to generalize about DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and the structure of the alter-systems, because in many cases the presented structures of some people \u2014that speak up about their own experience\u2014 can be quite complex, and there is little understanding of the extent of our minds\u2019 power and reach. The controversy goes beyond the regular conversations because there are individuals that go into talking about entities out of the self that comes and goes freely into a person\u2019s system when the person hosts them (aware or unaware) due to either a low ego, or a lack of will (those highly suggestible individuals are prone to accept their fate without a fight). I\u2019m open to the possibility that a person can be a host of other minds (or energies) not as a deficit, but as a way to enjoy/experience the extensive possibilities of our existence. I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be fair to deny this option. We can\u2019t really be sure of anything. Even when we have been granted a great cognition, it\u2019s too limited to understand the extent of \u201creality\u201d since what we think is real, it\u2019s actually not. For example, we think we are standing in a still terrain, right? while in \u201creality\u201d is that the terrain and everything else is spinning. Our cognition can understand it, but our perception cannot (Braude). Going back to a more \u201cgrounded\u201d and clinical version of DID, and exploring whether it really exists, it\u2019s a proven fact that we suffer from fragmentation after traumatization, especially prolonged, as a way to protect our psyche from confronting a reality that seems unbearable. The typical example is the child that has a part that loves the (abusive) mother because s[h]e depends on her, while another part will grow hating the mother in the way of hating women, or despising people with the mother\u2019s characteristics (unconsciously), or even having a part that mimics the mother as a way to internalize the hate. Independently of trauma, what I have observed through many years of practicing IFS (Internal Family Systems) is that WE ALL HAVE PARTS. Well-integrated people have parts that know each other, while unintegrated persons have parts that are in conflict and pull into opposite directions creating internal emotional conflicts to the bearer. Depending on how you frame it, a PART can go from simple emotions to emotional states, to ego states, to alters. Explanation of each here What is the difference between parts and alters? Therefore, you could differentiate the nature of the parts before you assign the diagnosis. For me, the issue is not whether DID exists or not, is that the way is treated tends to fragment the psyche of the client further. Once you believe you have DID, you will think that all your parts are alters and will lose control over the protective qualities of your parts. I have seen how clients that believe they suffer from DID surrender control over the parts instead of gaining awareness and control over their emotions, and therefore, over their actions and responses.

They do not call it multiple personalities anymore it is now called DID dissociative identity disorder. I guess that sounds better. Medically there is still a lot not known about it, but I have lived with someone for 30 years that has it. I always thought things didn\u2019t seem right when the person would be so different at times over the years. I thought I was going crazy. But it finally all made since in 2012 when the person after years of being diagnosed with different things was finally diagnosed with DID. I then finally realized after all these years, I\u2019m not crazy! These things did happen over the years that I could never make sense of. This person starting from an age of memories about 3 years old, can Remember being severely abused physically, sexually, and not shown any love. We as humans are not designed to take this so GOD gave children a way of escape. This is all this person has ever known, is that there has always been more than 1. I always thought it was a joke when this person referred to themselves as me,myself, and I. We are thinking about writing a book or something so others who have this would not feel so alone. A lot of people don\u2019t believe it is real and I can understand how they would come to that conclusion. If you have never been around it or seen it then it would be hard to make since of. Even me after all these years is still baffled at times by how can this happen in a human body? The alters all have different looks to them different actions and responses to things likes and dislikes of certain foods. Their talk and walk is different. Different ailments afflict each one of them differently. Not all of them come out though, but the ones who do I have relationships with, via it be one of the children or one of the adults. I have been around them so long I can tell who\u2019s out by the look on the face. Also when they are out if they ever look in a mirror they see what they look like, not what the body itself looks like. If I was to show whoever is out a picture of the body\u2019s face they get really upset and say no it is not me. We don\u2019t do pictures anymore. I hope when they get to heaven that they will all get their own body there. It is really sad and hard to see this on a daily basis, their is not enough time in the day for anyone to be out very long, I find this really hard to deal with because I feel horrible for all of them in one knowing how they got this way and just like the movie click with Adam Sandler jumping thru time missing most of his life, well this is what it\u2019s like for them. NO TIME! They each have their own job in the system that they do, they each also have their own hobbie that they like. It is an amazing thing to witness. WOW! I have really bounced around a lot, I would have to have hours to talk with someone about this or it would take a book to explain this in more detail. Even after you read this you will still have a hard time even comprehending how can this be real it is baffling to our brains who have only ever had One personality inside us and that is all we have ever seen. You almost just have to be around someone who has it to experience for yourself for you to be able to make your own informative decision. Our society is just know really experiencing more knowledge than ever before anytime in history due to being able to communicate all around the world now. I am in hopes that this will be one of the things that is studied and talked about more, so people could have a better understanding of it than they do now. There is still a lot to come to light about our brains and what they are capable of. I hope I did not confuse you. If you are really interested in knowing more about this, just contact me back. I will answer the best I can. ",

You\u2019d NEVER guess I have D.I.D- and chances are \u2014 years ago \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have told you that I did. The reason why?? It is because individuals \u2014 especially mental health practitioners who deny the existence of multiplicity - have done their best to try and \u201cshame\u201d those of us who actually have it into hiding that fact from the world. I really do not understand how folks can question its existence or even say it does not exist when it is clearly listed in the DMS-V. Do they just pick and choose other disorders that they \u201cdon\u2019t believe in\u201d as well and deny their existence? How about OCD, Bipolar? And hey- maybe depression isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d either? DID most certainly IS a mental health diagnosis and the only \u201ccontroversy\u201d is why \u2014 after 1000\u2019s of psychology scholars have agreed it is a legitimate disorder and included it in the DMS- V \u2014 individuals STILL choose to question and reject the obvious results that severe and frequent childhood abuse have on a person\u2019s psyche.

            "answer_text": "Does multiple personality disorder truly exist? It truly does. However, it\u2019s now called dissociative identity disorder (DID). People with DID endured horrific, repeated, and prolonged abuse in early childhood. These resourceful kids used dissociation as a coping mechanism and created alternate personas (alters) so that the abuse \u201chappened to somebody else\u201d. Alters can be of any age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, or sexual orientation. Some alters have accents, skill sets, or deficits the other alters do not share. Here are some facts about DID: Dissociative identity disorder has always been considered to be quite rare but it may be more common than previously thought and some estimate it to affect 1% of the population. This higher estimated prevalence may be due to the millions of now reported incidences of childhood abuse\u2026 Dissociation is present in all races but is more common in American children.Females experience more childhood abuse than males at a ratio of 10:1 and thus more females suffer from DID.However, more males who have been abused may experience pathological dissociation.Dissociative identity disorder is typically caused by trauma occurring at less than nine years of age.Early age of abuse onset predicts a greater degree of dissociation.The average number of alternate personalities a person with DID has is between eight and 13, but there have been cases reported of more than 100 personalities within one individual.Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) Statistics and Facts - HealthyPlace Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder) NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness | Dissociative Disorders Dissociation & Complex Trauma in the Media https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2719457/ Dr. Richard Kluft Archives | Discussing Dissociation ",

I think you may be asking if it is a real thing to actually have multiple personalities. Of course, this raises the question : do we actually have a personality at all, and if so, what is it? Rather than go there, I think it might be helpful to understand that there is a universal psychological process called \u2018splitting\u2019 (closely associated with \u2018projection\u2019), that involves unconsciously severing our awareness of links between mental objects, or actually making false divisions of what is in reality a whole object. That sounds complicated, but for example, every time we see \u2018good and bad\u2019 in separate places - as in \u2018she\u2019s an angel, why is she married to him\u2019, or \u2018we need to close our borders to immigrants to protect our society\u2019 - we are likely to be employing this unconscious splitting process, dividing the complexities of the real situation into more manageable but simpler \u2018black and white\u2019 categories. In certain circumstances this process can lead to fiercer divisions of reality, and become an important aspect of psychosis; for example, an unconscious wish not to \u2018know\u2019 some element of reality can lead to our \u2018hearing\u2019 being lost, or the perception that the television is talking to us. Multiple personality disorder has been described by some in these terms: as a drastic response to traumatic experiences, where the trauma - that is to say something that cannot be tolerated because it overwhelms our psychological defences - is managed by unconsciously splitting our awareness, thereby keeping apart those elements which when brought together represent the traumatic event(s). Whether that constitutes the having of multiple personalities as portrayed on the screen I leave to your judgement. ",

It is really just a complex coping mechanism where a person keeps memories of traumatic events compartmentalized into \u201cseparate\u201d parts of the consciousness. It is one person with different parts but more distinct than just different aspects of the self. We all have those but true DID only exists in 1\u20132% of the population. I know people with it and I have one client with it who knows others with it. I have met a number of people online in a support network for abused people, many of whom have DID. It exists and is typically caused by severe trauma at an early age. There are several factors that have to occur before someone can develop DID, this is why not every abused child has it. ",

It is not terrifying, and I am not a closet ax murderer. A person's alters will be much like them--in fact, their JOB is to make sure no one knows it is NOT the host who is 'up'. Were it not for the trigger of being exposed due a death in the family to a place where some of the severe abuse happened, and the alters panicking as they have no real sense of time and are often 'stuck' in those experiences, I may have lived the rest of my days not knowing what exactly was going on in me.

            "answer_text": "CAUTION: video contains depictions of suicide and domestic violence which may be disturbing for some individuals I love your question! There are two schools of thought on whether or not dissociative identity disorder or DID (called multiple personality disorder until 2013) exists. One strongly advocates for its inclusion as a mental disorder and diagnosis and treats clients with DID. The other side is skeptical to the point of renouncing its validity and going so far as to accuse those with the disorder of faking it. I hold a deep belief in the diagnosis and have a loved one who suffers greatly. In fact, those with DID suffer the most out of all mental illness diagnoses. Over 70% of outpatients diagnosed with DID attempt suicide and many have attempted it multiple times. Self-mutilation is incredibly common and these are not the behaviors of someone trying to fake a disorder. This summer I put together a presentation for my graduate psychopathology class on each of the dissociative disorders with a particular emphasis on dissociative identity disorder (DID). The video focuses on the causes, symptoms, and treatments of dissociation and it addresses your question specifically. I spend time going in depth into distinguishing genuine DID suffers from those faking the disorder and I think you might like that. The video is about an hour long and the feedback I have gotten is that people are amazed at what they have learned and understood about the disorder and those who suffer from it. (I only talk for about the first 5 minutes) I hope you find it valuable ~ Make someone\u2019s Life Worth Living  ",

However, there was a really interesting case study recently in which a blind woman regained sight in some of her personalities but not all. But most interestingly, the visual areas associated with sight were inactive when she was one of the blind personas but active when she was one of the sighted personas. This pretty much rules out malingering or outright faking and provides some fairly compelling evidence for the existence of DID at least in this patient.

Maybe off topic, but I had a client once that I knew for quite a long time, in connection to concerns with her parenting and potential abuse of her children. Out of the blue one day, she came into my office dressed dramatically different than usual, and then later that afternoon came dressed as another person, She did that for almost 3 days telling me that she ha Multiple Personality Disorder. Others assumed she indeed had that disorder. I called her out on it and she stopped, and laughed about how many fell for it. That behavior did not show up again, but she did stalk me later on, and police contacted me about it. Later I heard that she improved sufficiently to gain employment.Hope she is doing well, most of all I hope her children survived the effects of their mother\u2019s actual mental illness/ behaviors ",

            "answer_text": "Do people have experiences that psychiatric professionals label as dissociation? Yes. Do people have experiences where they feel like they are different people with distinctly different personalities and thoughts and physical behaviors at different times? Yes. Are these disorders? No. These behaviors/experiences are reasonable adaptations to experiences that are too painful for a person to cope with. In such circumstances, it makes sense to split off parts of yourself to contain the pain and to contain coping strategies to protect the \u201cindividual\u201d from subsequent dangers that might cause that pain (or similar pain) again. It only looks like a \u201cdisorder\u201d because it is not a common experience, and in most cultures, people privilege \u201cnormality.\u201d We are prejudiced against abnormal experiences and think it is only safe if we have experiences that most other people share. It is true that it is somewhat rare for people to experience dissociation and multiplicity, but it isn\u2019t really that rare, and in any case, rarity of experience is not a reasonable justification for calling an experience \u201cdisordered.\u201d To call experiences \u201cdisordered\u201d is basically to throw your hands in the air and admit you don\u2019t understand anything, and worse, you don\u2019t care to understand it. That\u2019s dehumanizing and stigmatizing. This is why the psychiatric profession is the greatest perpetuator of stigma against the \u201cmentally ill\u201d even as they protest that they are against such stigmatization. I believe they know not what they do, and once their livelihoods depend on the construct of disorder, the cognitive dissonance makes it too hard to consider \u201cmental illness\u201d as a reasonable adaptation to circumstances. As the French say, \u201ctant pis.\u201d Too bad. It really is too bad that the people who are supposed to help reduce stigma are the most active perpetuators of it, without realizing they are doing so. How do they do this? I think I\u2019ll leave that for another question. ",
