            "answer_text": "First of all I love you. Consciousness is what you are; it is not an achievement. A banana cannot become a banana, and neither is breathing an achievement, it is just what you do because you are what you are. But I think you know that already. How does meditation expand one\u2019s consciousness though? By pushing its boundaries. Right now I bet you were not feeling your tongue in your mouth or your shirt on your body, but I bet you are now. That is bringing something from outside your consciousness inside it. It\u2019s not that your brain wasn\u2019t feeling the tongue or the shirt, the brain was doing a very good job doing all that, but it was not inside the consciousness yet. Like a flashlight you can expand and contract the circle of light to focus intensely on one or a few things, or you can expand the circle of light to include many things at once. Like this:  Not only does meditation teach a person that they already have this zoom feature, which we use all the time in in the material world, but we also can use it in our interior world to map and discover the spiritual terrain that is our soul. We hide a lot of our emotion, pain, and thoughts from our consciousness because of a million different reasons. But we have to eventually go inside and deal with them. Expansion of consciousness, for me, also has the meaning of seeing life bigger. You know, stop seeing everything through the lens of \u201cme\u201d and start seeing more through the lens of \u201cwe\u201d. It means stop seeing what is wrong with your life and start seeing what is right, it means to expand your experience into the unpleasant, from which we usually flee in haste! It means loving more and judging less. It means to see things they way God does and not as a mere human body, but as a divine soul in union with God at its very core. It means accept life as it comes and stop thinking you have the right to criticize the blessing God has so lovingly prepared for you in this moment even though you would never have chosen it for yourself. When a person is asleep their consciousness is out, or at least limited to the interior dream. When you wake up, consciousness expands to include the material world. When a person wakes up spiritually something very similar happens. This is how I think about it anyway. Hope it helps. Blessings! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Meditation rewires the whole brain. It also creates more connections between neurons (gray matter, synapses, etc) and between different parts of the brain (white matter). When people talk about woo-woo subjects like \u201copening the 3rd eye\u201d, they\u2019re talking about real processes that are both physiological and subtle. This particular process opens you up to a lot more information that, by default, you won\u2019t normally process. Examples: Seeing and feeling \u201cenergy\u201d. This just means you\u2019re processing very subtle information. Experientially, it manifests as something best described as energy. Nothing \u201csupernatural\u201d about it. It just means you\u2019re taking in more info and processing it. \u201cSupernatural\u201d refers to things that haven\u2019t been explained in natural terms. Nothing is beyond the natural. Our concepts of reality differ from actual reality. Awakening the brain bridges the gap. Higher intuition. This is also a process of using more info, because more info is available to you. It means knowing things without being able to trace it back to the source. It also means the ability to see connections between things, concepts, events, etc that most will not, and connecting dots. The Theory of Relativity came from lucid dreams. Einstein later had to translate it into science, and everything added up. Intuition came first. Before he died, he mentioned that he had a lot more info about Relativity that he wouldn\u2019t have a chance to translate into physics. If he didn\u2019t have the track record that came from transforming physics, people probably would have called him crazy, or they would have thought he was just losing his mind as he was dying. My first major 3rd eye experience is similar to other stories I\u2019ve heard. I kept seeing ripples, as if there was a puddle in front of me, and someone threw a stone in it. I knew it was coming from the pineal gland area. One day, during a meditation, this ripple image \u201copened\u201d and became an eye. I could see everything in the room, although my eyes were closed. Everything had a purple tint. I think that was the only color. This lasted a few minutes. There were other effects, like being a lot more conscious of a lot more things, that didn\u2019t go away. A marketing manager, who hired me to do some marketing for a retreat, recently told me a similar story. The only difference was that everything was black and white instead of purple. I don\u2019t even know how that conversation even came up. I\u2019ll leave you with some Swami Satchidananda quotes and a few others: \u201cTo such people, I say that God is everywhere, not in a particular form, but as an omnipresent awareness or power. God is consciousness itself. And by concentrated, sincere prayer, you are tuning your mental radio to receive that power. If I say there is nice music in this room, some of you may disagree and say, \"We don't hear any music. How can you say that there is music in the room?\" To you, I say get a radio, tune it properly, and you will hear the music.\u201d \u201cIf you want to understand God, tune yourself to God's wavelength. Until then, you can not understand Him.\u201d \u201cOnce you become that, you understand it, but you won't come back to tell. It's something like a drop wanting to know how deep the sea is. It jumps in, but it can never come out to tell you because it becomes the sea.\u201d Rumi, Sufi ecstatic poet: \u201cBut do not think that the drop alone becomes the ocean. The ocean, too, becomes the drop!\u201d Kabir, Indian ecstatic poet: \u201cI am like a pitcher of clay floating in the water, water inside, water outrside. Now suddenly with a touch of the guru the pitcher is broken. Inside, outside, O Friends, all one.\u201d \u201cOh, Friend, Kabir has looked for him everywhere, but to no avail. For Kabir and He are one, not two. When a drop is merged into the ocean how is it seen as distinct? When the ocean is submerged in the drop, who can say what is what?\u201d Catherine of Genoa, Catholic saint and mystic: \u201cMy self is God, nor is any other self known to me except God.\u201d \u201c\u2026 For when God sees the Soul pure as it was in its origins, He tugs at it with a glance, draws it and binds it to Himself with a fiery love that by itself could annihilate the immortal soul. In so acting, God so transforms the soul in Him that it knows nothing other than God; and He continues to draw it up into His fiery love until He stores it to that pure state from which it first issued. As it is being drawn upwards, the soul feels itself melting in the fire of that love of its sweet God, for He will not cease until He has brought the soul to its perfection.\u201d Clement of Alexandria: \u201cIt is the greatest of all lessons to know oneself. For if one knows oneself one will know God, and knowing God, that person will be made like God.\" Saint Teresa of Avila: \u201cFor indeed the soul does no more in this union than does the wax when another impresses a seal on it. The wax doesn't impress the seal upon itself; it is only disposed. I mean, by being soft. And even in order to be disposed, it doesn't soften itself but remains still and gives its consent.\u201d Saint John of the Cross, Spiritual Songs: \u201cWhen there is a union of love, it is accurate to affirm that the beloved lives in the lover and the lover lives in the beloved. Love causes such similarity and transformation in the lovers that one can say that each one is the other and both of them are one.\u201d Chandogya Upanishad (scripture): \u201cAll rivers, whether they flow to the east or to the west, have arisen from the sea and will return to it again. Yet once these rivers have merged with the sea they no longer think \"I am this river\", \"I am that river\". In the same way, my son, all these creatures, when they merge again with Being, do not remember that they originally arose from being and wound their individual ways through life. Now that being which is the subtlest essence of everything, the supreme reality, the Self of all that exists, That art thou, Svetaketu.\u201d Satchidananda again: \u201cSuppose I give a talk for three hours about blueberry pie. Can you taste it? No. I will be wasting my time. Instead, I have to give you the recipe: One cup of this, a tablespoon of that; put this together, mix, and then put it all in the oven. But even that is not enough. You can't just take the recipe book, gold-gilt it, put on an altar, wave incense, and say, \"Blueberry pie, blueberry pie\". You have to get the ingredients, cook them, and eat the pie...God is not something that can be talked of. God must be experienced. The day man started talking of God, he created all kinds of religious fights and quarrels.\u201d Albert Einstein: \"A human being is a part of the whole called by us \"Universe\", a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest, - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. The striving to free oneself from this delusion is the one issue of true religion. Not to nourish the delusion but to try to overcome it is the way to reach the attainable measure of peace of mind. \" ",

            "answer_text": "First it would be required to answer, \u201cWhat is meditation?\u201d, so that an answer can be given to the question. If meditation is an act of concentration of the mind, then the mind will become stronger, in the same way as exercise makes muscles stronger. I believe that thinking about thinking, is a good preparation. Learning to think clearly about \u201cevery day objects\u201d, in a logical manner prepares a solid foundation for future progress. Thinking about thinking was well explored by Rudolf Steiner in his book \u201cThe Philosophy of Freedom\u201d, (1894). From Rudolf Steiners writings about meditation: (See the link below!) \u201cSteiner suggested that a special group of general exercises should accompany all spiritual training as he believed their influence on inner development would be beneficial whatever the spiritual path. These six exercises are: Practicing self-control over one's thinking. For example: for a period of time -at least five minutes- contemplate any object and concentrate one's thoughts exclusively on this object. (A pencil or a paper clip might do.)Development of initiative. For example, choose any positive but free deed, i.e. one that nothing is influencing you to do, and choose a regular time of day or day of the week to practice this.Equanimity. Quiet reactive emotions.Positivity. See the positive aspects of everything, and make the best out of every situation.Open-mindedness. Be open to new experiences and ideas, never letting expectations based upon the past close your mind to the lessons of the moment.Harmony. Find a harmonious, balanced relationship between the above five qualities, practicing them regularly and becoming able to move dynamically between them.The initial three exercises are intended to enable a person to attain self-discipline in thinking, willing and feeling \u2026.\u201d So yes!

When I make coffee in the morning I am not thinking, \u201cOh, now I am making coffee.\u201d I just make coffee. If I am meditating, I am not thinking that I am now aware of myself meditating. I just meditate. Now, let\u2019s get a little more specific\u2026 When we first sit to meditate, especially if we are new to it, we do become aware that we are thinking. So, thinking often gives the illusion of two things - me and my \u201cthoughts.\u201d When you have sat in meditation for some time, you will likely notice that your mind has quieted down. At this point we can, with practice, enjoy just being aware without being aware of \u201csomething.\u201d It is at this very point where your question starts to make sense. We can for a time, think to ourselves, \u201cAha, now my mind has settled, now I can enjoy just being aware.\u201d So, in this context, we might conclude that we are aware of our awareness. This moment right here is the trap! If you are still the observer, observing that you are aware, you are still in duality! This is why I love, love, love, the advice from the great Master, Babuji, that I quote over and over again, \u201cForget yourself, and don\u2019t care for knowing.\u201d We should avoid becoming too tricky in trying to figure this all out. Reality is the most simple thing. Babuji said, it\u2019s very simplicity is the reason we can\u2019t \u201cgrasp\u201d it. We so much want enlightenment or awakening to BE something!

            "answer_text": "Meditation does not raise anything except the veil that obscures your natural state, or reveals \u2018your original face\u2019 as often stated in Zen. You are already Consciousness and have never been anything other but the seeing of it is what meditation can help with. \u2018Show me your face before you were born\u2019 is a Zen Koan that describes how meditation can reveal our true or original \u2018face\u2019. When you're not thinking of anything good and anything bad, at that moment, what is your original face? ~ from the Mumonkan or Gateless Gate. Meditation helps us to gain insight into the nature of mind and of ego. It helps us to detach from compulsive thinking and to align with Being. It calms the mind, that internal noisy chatter, so that we can see that we are not our thoughts, nor are we our feelings and perceptions. Neti - Neti\u2026not this, not that. We can see we are not our thoughts because we are Aware of thoughts. So what are we really? This can be answered by meditation. Beyond thought is the place of Not-knowing. In the Cloud of Unknowing, a book by an unknown author on Christian Mysticism, it says to put everything you know family, friends and foes into The Cloud of Forgetting and enter into The Cloud of Unknowing. This and many verses in the book are very Zen like. Not knowing is in itself a big leap, spiritually speaking, from the belief, for example, that I am this body/mind. In the mind of Not- Knowing we can be clear about the true nature of reality and abide there. Meditation and mindfulness based practices along with self-inquiry are the foundation upon which insight and spiritual awakening can happen. ",

It more of a seeing through the very limited dream of thoughts. You are and always have been unlimited consciousness itself. If that\u2019s the word you want to use for it. Consciousness is just a word. What you are cannot be limited to any word. You realize yourself as unlimited consciousness by gradually seeing through and letting go of the conditioned beliefs of what you are not: body, mind, person, male, female, history, relationships, stories, personality, opinions, preferences, roles, etc. Meditation can help you do this if you honestly pay attention. You realize what you thought was real is not. What is left after this \u201chouse cleaning\u201d is what is real. Meditation along with simply paying honest attention to life itself and questioning every one of your thoughts and beliefs will eventually help you directly experience truth as it is. For me it wasn\u2019t meditation alone that did it, but it helped. Mostly it was life itself. Life humbled me. It showed me the arrogance of my thoughts as well as their limitations and lack of substance. When I stopped trusting my thoughts, I began to pay attention to life. And it was life that taught me to realize the unlimited nature of what I and everything else are. ",

One way is with deep breathing - beeper breathing and retention - deeper level of consciousness. Practice: 1. Take a deep inhale with full lungs, even the diaphragm to move forward. 2. Retention of the breathing with the air inside us. Keep it as long as you can. Increase the time with 1\u20132 seconds every day. Step by step, this can expand seriously the time of retention. Pronounce the AUM mantra while holding the air again and again. 3.  Slow exhale and small rest, and start from 1. again Inhale and exhale to be only by the nose, not by the mouth, on empty stomach, with vertical spine. Deep breathing->control on prana->control on the mind (prana and mind connected). Peace and patience development, improved health and vitality Also deep breathing can have purifying effect and to increase the concentration - it is needed for meditation. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. This is one of the main results of all meditation techniques. There are many techniques, and I will suggest one: gibberish. In gibberish, you make all kinds of sounds, as long as they are not a real language. Pretend you are talking in a language no one knows. Make loud sounds, soft sounds, angry sounds, sad sounds, just create any non-word sounds you like. Really get into it! And move your body around too. After five or ten minutes, stop, and sit silently for five minutes, becoming aware of your thoughts, feelings, or sensations. Just watch. Do not try to change or fix anything. Do not try to stop the mind. Love yourself, and accept whatever happens from your heart. After a month, if you feel to, increase the time for each section by five minutes. Let the new duration settle for a month. Over time, you may end up doing 30 minutes of catharting and 30 minutes of silence. You may be wondering, \"why gibberish?\" The enlightened master Osho explains the need for active meditations in the modern world: \"In Buddha's time, dynamic methods of meditation were not needed. People were more simple, more authentic. They lived a more real life. Now, people are living a very repressed life, a very unreal life. ... Many incomplete experiences go on being collected, piled up inside their minds. \"Just sitting directly in silence won't help. The moment you will sit silently, you will see all sorts of things moving inside you. ... First throw those things out. ...\u2028 \u2028All the dynamic meditations are preparatory to real meditation. They are just basic requirements to be fulfilled so that meditation can happen.\" For more, go here: Exquisite Attention Coaching Good luck! ",

When you really contemplate this, you can see that the real goal of meditation is to get the mind out of the way and let your real being shine through. When we rest in the space of awareness, we are really only resting as what we really are. Awareness is always only aware of itself, but when we are lost in thought, we are unaware of this truth. Through meditation we can see that awareness is always there, and we can experience awareness knowing itself. When we experience this with understanding, we see that all we are seeing is ourself seeing ourself. Experiencing your real self, which is awareness, is really all meditation is about. ",

It is like taking your time to enjoy the scenery, rather than simply zipping past it all. If you want to call it raised consciousness - okay. Also, I never mentioned meditation.

What is the difference between awareness and consciousness? In consciousness the tones of all the muscles of our body are synchronized equalized an unified. In awareness they are not. During Meditation can we be conscious of our consciousness? What is Consciousness? Consciousness is the energy optimizing mechanism of the soul.  An idea is converted into an action in seven stages. An idea can be converted into an action from any of the stages. However, lower the stage at which the idea is converted into an action lower the chances of the idea getting converted into an action. \u2018However, higher stage consume more power and they are more difficult to control because they may get converted into action automatically.  Therefore, if the idea is to be converted into an action in the distanct feature the idea is kept in the stage of day dreaming only for conservation of power. However, as the action become imminent higher stages are preferred to ensure success. Therefore, we can feel all the seven stages of consciousness simultaneously and select the best stage to ensure optimum conservation of power and highest chances of success. It is for this reason that consciousness plays the central role in Meditation.  Since we use semi automatic force, which is made of two forces we can feel, compare and modify the consiousnes levels in the various stages. ",

We chant the One Great Vehicle of MyoHoRenGeKyo to awaken and inculcate our innate Buddha mind. What we call \u201cconsciousness\u201d is a state of mind and the senses as defined in Buddhism. Here is a quote from one translation of the Lotus Sutra (MyoHoRenGeKyo); \u201cAnanda, the bodhisattva Universal Worthy was born in the land Pure and Wonderful in the east. The characteristics of that land I have already explained in detail in the Miscellaneous Flower Sutra. Now in this sutra I will explain the matter in brief. \u201cAnanda, if there are monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen, heavenly beings, dragons, or others of the eight kinds of beings, or any living beings who intone the great vehicle, practice the great vehicle, set their minds on the great vehicle, wish to see the form and body of Bodhisattva Universal Worthy, wish to see the tower of Many Treasures Buddha, wish to see Shakyamuni Buddha and the many Buddhas that are emanations of his body, or wish to attain purification of the six sense organs\u2014they should study this meditation. \u201cto the next never departing from the great vehicle, and by the time they have done so for The benefits of this meditation remove obstacles and impediments so they can see the finest, the most wonderful forms. They need not enter a samadhi, but merely by reciting and upholding it [the great vehicle] they can practice with their entire minds, from one instant of mind one day and on up to three times seven days, they will be able to see Universal Worthy. \u201cThose who are impeded by heavy obstacles will have to do so for seven times seven days before they can see him. Those who have even heavier obstacles will take a lifetime to see him. Those with even heavier obstacles will take two lifetimes to see him. And those with even heavier will take three lifetimes to see him. Because the effects of karma differ in these various cases, it is necessary to explain the matter in different ways. Best wishes, and I thank you for the question. Please continue to ask questions. NaMuMyoHoRenGeKyo ",

            "answer_text": "Meditators commonly use the term presence to refer to the state of being aware of one\u2019s own mental activity (which includes but is not limited to awareness). Presence is familiar to everyone and is easily accessible, for example by taking a moment to see what happens if you try to predict your next thought. But by default we are not habitually aware of what our mind is doing at a given time. Absent this awareness, the mind is normally so engrossed by its thoughts that it mistakes these thoughts for reality, in much the same way that a moviegoer might lose sight of the fact that the movie he is watching is fictional. Meditators aim to make the mind\u2019s awareness of its own activity habitual in order to understand the role of the mind in the creation of our experience. That the mind has such a role only becomes apparent through the practice of presence: if you are not aware of how mental activity undergirds your perceptions, you will naturally tend to take it for granted that your perceptions are simply given to you in the form of raw sense data and memories of past experiences. Presence is not as anodyne as it sounds. It may have unforeseen consequences for your understanding of your self and your world. For example you may realize that what you habitually think of as your self is just a mental construct or projection which is only real in the same sense that the constellation Orion is real. If it arises suddenly, this realization can come as a bit of a shock. ",

There are numerous \u201cfrequencies\u201d available in this heightend state. One must avoid preferring certain ones. Also the insights realized in the meditation need to be put to action in the ordinary states of mind. Past that, meditation accounts for about 10% of the effort, necessary to grow in ones awareness. So yes, it can be a good tool under the right circumstances, but also we are naturally progressing (slowly) up the levels of consciousness. Life experiences make us feel a certain way. Those emotions, for the better and worse, make perfect sense. Our growth is determined by our gradual shift from perception to awareness about how we deal with and act being confronted by those sensations. At an advanced state we take life issues into the meditative state, in order to come to understand about these life issues. The next stage is to take the meditative state into life. This is where one doesn\u2019t react to life situations, but rather responds in a manner different than ones original personality. ",

The reason being that if done correctly, Buddhist meditation leads to the complete removal of \u2018self-awareness\u2019. You need to understand that, from the perspective of the Buddha\u2019s Dharma, what we call \u2018self-awareness\u2019 in the modern Western world is actually an extremely undesirable function. From this perspective, to be \u2018self-aware\u2019 is to be aware, apparently, of something that simply does not exist. Furthermore, it is an idea which leads to the impossibility of escape from the trap we humans find ourselves in here on this plane of existence, which is this: From infancy our brains have seen the external world in a certain way, a way which is completely incorrect, delusional and leading only to death and suffering. The path of Buddhist spiritual development, Bhavana, is to apply meditational techniques to reverse this wrong way of viewing things and to gain the Right View. It\u2019s not easy of course, and only is completed with full enlightenment, but I\u2019m not going to let you keep swallowing that delusion without at least trying to warn you. None of the above of course means that you shouldn\u2019t practise correct awareness, which is Mindfulness based upon the four correct foundations which the Buddha described in the suttas: The body, the feelings of pleasant/unpleasant, the mind and the objects of the mind, such as the senses. Note that NOT ONE of these refers to a \u2018self\u2019, and the Buddha was extremely clear that there is no semblance of a self in any of these foundations. . ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is the act of paying attention to the contents of the mind: thoughts, images, memories, moods, emotions and sensations. Meditation is a method for altering the attention and how it focuses on one set of mental events or another. It can be used to just relax, lower stress (most common reasons) take a break from routine (mediation soon becomes routine too) or it can be like a challenge to oneself, to practice the act of focusing one\u2019s attention on sensation instead of the thought stream which it is naturally attracted to most of the time. Struggling with the tendency for our attention to drift away from sensation (being in the present moment) and back into the thought stream (being \u201cabsent\u201d to the present moment) has an effect on the power of attention. It is a bit like exercising a muscle; struggle strengthens both. ",

Once this becomes an habit, you will be able to assess the effects of your actions positively and adapt corrections to the same. Vipasana meditation will have positive influence on your personality. Vipasana meditation will also make you take mature and wise decisions. You will react to grim situations in a positive way. Natural emotions like fear, suspicion, jealousy, anger, and arrogance will be controlled in the long run. ",

Why are there so many objects of meditation?\u201d or \u201cAre some of them better than others?\u201d or even better, \u201cCan we meditate with attention on the mind itself, and is this different than meditating on an object outside?\u201d Just some suggestions.
