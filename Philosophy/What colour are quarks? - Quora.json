            "answer_text": "We have solid, liquid, and even gaseous masses of identical quarks. Matter is made up of atoms, which in turn are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are composed of a combination of quarks to satisfy the charge of the protons (+1e) and neutrons (0e). What do you think these masses look like? Now, other than the charge, the quark combinations also must obey another rule. The composite particle made up of quarks must be colourless. Now what does that mean? We can't see these elementary particles, so how to verify this concept of colours among quarks? This is where one must understand that the use of colours is just to give an analogy to explain the behaviour of quarks. Protons or Neutrons - Red quark + Blue quark + Green quark = a colourless combination. Mesons - R/B/G quark + R'/B'/G' antiquark. = a colourless combination. In mesons, the primed colours are antiquarks with respective colours - antired/antiblue/antigreen. These colour mechanisms are, simply, a model to explain various interactions regarding the strong nuclear force. Nothing related to the exact colour of any particle ",

            "answer_text": "Remember that to see something you need it to be emitting or reflecting photons\u2026 Colors are related to the wavelength of the photons that land in your eyes. As you know visible light comes from the change in an atom\u2019s energy (i.e. the sum of its internal Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy). Basically visible light coming from atoms is linked to the change in wave-functions of the its electron(s). Deeper: Atomic nuclei also have a \u201ccolor\u201d during some changes of state or configuration: gamma photons. But your eyes would probably not enjoy receiving these kind of photons! Deepest: because a quark has an electric charge, it is able to emit/absorb photons, but that would occur during a particle physics reaction: A few examples\u2026 (if you know how to read Feynman diagrams.)  Actually, there is a place where you could observe a massive ball of quarks\u2026 inside a stellar black hole. Once the horizon of a back hole covers the whole neutron star, it is believed that the star gets so compressed, that the neutron degeneracy pressure loses its battle against gravity. The star because a Quark star, composed of a plasma of quarks and gluons. If you ever manage to see one, and most extraordinarily, return from the black hole, let me know what you have seen ;-)! ",
