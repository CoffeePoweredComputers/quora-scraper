            "answer_text": "The mind does not create reality in the sense that reality would not be there unless the mind was witnessing it. This is a complete misinterpretation of many Eastern schools of thought.  The mind is a lens or a filter which perceives reality from the various senses in a specific way. A fish experiences reality as a fish. A human experiences reality as a human. The two are different.  It is Psychology 101 that the mind is expert at 'filling in the gaps' of perception. All optical illusions are based on this simple truth. Further, in real life, 2 different humans project and attach different meanings to identical experience. They will note consciously and subconsciously different aspects of the experience. They will distort the experience in different ways. The mind creates the 'reality' of the individual. (And also underlies behaviour - which creates consequences - which determines the experiences a person will have - aka karma)  This is exactly why enlightenment is sought. It is complete freedom from distortions, pollution and bias of the mind. It sees truth for real. The limited senses and perception as well create perceived limitations (by necessity). There IS an infinite reality greater than our perceptions - but that's not necessarily helpful to an organism trying to survive.  There is a lot more to it, however that is the essential deal. The scientific method would completely fall apart in all other scenarios, and in fact so would cohesion and the laws of nature. (100% solipsism would solve this issue, but don't kid yourself. I'm real too - and I'm not you.)  Applying the principals of quantum physics to the argument is well-intentioned but completely misguided. It takes those truths completely out of context. It makes as much sense as asserting that bananas taste purple because both were on Sesame Street. ",

            "answer_text": "IThe mind creates reality in the same way an immersive video games does. Each player has his own computer with high speed 3d rendering. The simplest design would project the same image for every players. This would not be immersive. It would mimic the school setup. A better design show to each player a personalized 3d rendering of the world. No matter if it is racing on a road or chasing pokemon, the principle remain similar. In case of car racing, each computer has an identical model of the road and background objects. But the camera location is unique to each player ; each one assigned to one car participating in the race. The game engine simply broadcast the location of the car driven by this player and listen and take note of the position of the car of other participants. Brief, in order to save bandwidth in network communication, the game just exchange coordinates of mobile objects. Everything else is simulated by the video card in each computer. Pokemon does similar network bandwidth tricks. The background image is simply the view captured by the camera on each phone. The acceleration sensors and gyro sensors are used to detect phone motion, to compute the exact 3d field of view. The pokemon game engine or a central server, broadcast the location of each pokemon. When the phone camera field of view intersects one of the 3d object, a colorful pokemon image is superimposed on top of the image detected by the phone camera. For the brain, reality is a mix of the actual data perceived by the sense organs (eyes, ears, etc) and the recursive processing of data recorded in memory. Similar to recursion in software engineering, the data fromvthe current stream of thought is presented to memory for pattern recognition. The neural network that give the strongest signal, the winner of the current voting cycle is influencing the next pattern recognition adding all the data associated as context. ",

            "answer_text": "One position on this question is called solipsism. There is I and then there is the world and all the people, etc., in it that I create. The whole of what one experiences is an advanced form of dream. If the universe were like this, I probably ought to find it behaving according to the nature of my being. You, who don't really exist in this world, would be unlikely to come up with any ways of thinking that were not my ways of thinking. Another position was taken by the ancient philosophers called Daoists. Their position seems to me to be very similar to the early 20th century physicists who gathered around Niels Bohr. Rather than step into the limelight of the physicists I will stick to the Daoists.  According to them there is a reality that humans attempt to conceptualize. However. it does not come broken down into spare parts such as we might collect to assemble an automobile. Instead it is a continuum. A rough analog for the Dao would be one of the old Lava lamps. Run the simulation. Note that there are no visible discontinuities in the stuff within the bulb, and that the differently colored volumes are continuously moving and changing outline. That is somewhat the way the Daoists explain the birth, growth, and death of any creature as a human being, but also all other things. (The rates of change may all be different.)  Like a subject being tested by the use of a Rorschach test, humans (and other creatures) may look at the same volume in space and see different things.    One \"thing\" shades off into another \"thing,\" and creatures reach out and decide that this blotch is a potato and that blotch is a lichen. Sometimes humans detect where they have made a bad choice in \"drawing lines around some kind of thing\" and giving it a name. It turns out that a lichen is made up of two kinds of symbiotic creatures.  Jumping rapidly ahead, humans generally do a good job of picking out salient volumes in their environment and naming them so that they can think about them. But sometimes they mess up. They may draw a special kind of line around a woman and call her a witch, or draw a similar kind of line around a man and call him a warlock. They may then burn them at the stake. Most modern people whom society charges with dealing with those who march down the street staring wildly at people and muttering imprecations would probably have drawn lines around each of them and labeled them as paranoid schizophrenics, put them on some anti-psychotic meds and let them have a better life. The Daoist believed the same thing that the people in Bohr's circle found out. Nature does what it wants, and if it doesn't fit with your ideas about how nature should, or can, behave, well, tough luck. Have a look at The Historical Development of Theory, volume 2, by Jagadish Mehra and Helmut Rechendberg, and you will find many indications that before Heisenberg wrote his \"magic\" paper of 1925, the whole group of them were going a bit nuts because they could not conceptualize or express as an equation what they were seeing in the lab. They were psychologically quite frazzled. Nature just wasn't cooperating, except that \"we rule nature by obeying her, and that was something they had to admit to. Then they made a theory, which nobody can prove because that is the way of all theories, and the theory became one of the most thoroughly substantiated (supported by evidence) of all physics theories. So they made something by their own creative natures that is a good enough \"useful fiction\" that it hasn't failed us yet. That \"thing,\" or those \"things,\" however, are in our minds. They model, or mimic, or something like that something outside of us that we can never experience directly. If that idea is not disconbobulating, then I have failed as a writer. It's not supposed to make sense. If you don't believe me, ask Richard Feynman. I've been teaching about Daoism since the 1970s, and never expected to be able to get beyond saying, \"Well, this is the way that I put it all together. Try looking at it this way and see whether it rings true to you.\" Then one morning I was listening to the Diane Rehm show on NPR (I think it was). She was interviewing some lady who had suffered a stroke that wiped out the language (concept) section of her brain, and, guess what. She described experiences in which all the distinctions that conceptualization makes dropped away as her language center was progressively taken out by an embolism. She described losing the distinction between herself and the shower wall she was leaning on. She became unable to make sense of numbers and therefore had an almost impossible time getting help by way of the telephone. Everything was going back to the \"lava lamp\" state in which nothing was distinguishable from anything else. (Later, in recovery, her mother helped her to once again distinguish among things of different colors.) See Jill Bolte Taylor, My Stroke of Insight. Learn how humans experience the world when their conceptualizations fizzle into nothing. So, to answer your question in her words, \"Concepts are that by which we construct our world and by which we understand it.\" So what is real for us is what we conceptualize. My world is by that very fact not your world. It is the world that I construct out of (presumably) the same elements out of which you construct your world.  But when I die, nothing of any great significance happens to whatever it is that I conceptualized and made into my world. (Your world is still safe. ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "Have you noticed that there are words in our vocabulary which appear to mean something specific, but upon analysis, do not refer to anything specific? For example, the word \u201cuniverse\u201d, what does it really refer to? There is no envelope surrounding all the stuff that\u2019s out there, so does the word \u201cuniverse\u201d refer to all the stuff that\u2019s out there? If so, then this word is really referring to an idea we have about all the stuff that\u2019s out there, because it is just an idea that all that stuff is a \u201cthing\u201d that can be referred to by one word. There is no \u201cuniverse\u201d per se, there\u2019s just a lot of stuff out there (matter and energy) which we refer to by that unexamined word. The word \u201cmind\u201d may be similar in that it doesn\u2019t refer to any single thing or event, just a collection of cognitive processes which happen to be located in one brain. That said, yes, the \u201creality\u201d we live in is a product of that collection of cognitive processes. We are map readers; the brain must make internal maps of external reality, and some maps are accurate representations, some maps are way off base, but regardless of accuracy, they are all just maps, but we must regard them as \u201creal\u201d or we can\u2019t function. There was a film in 1980 called Altered States, about a college professor of psychology who was using himself as the subject of an experiment with powerful psychoactive chemicals. There was one scene that kind of makes the point: he was standing in a doorway in his house when he looked down and instead of seeing the floor, he saw (hallucinated) a bottomless abyss with a raging fire way down there somewhere. This vision made him hesitate to take a step forward on what he was obviously thinking must really be a floor even though it looked like a void with a firey death below. This is our situation; we must regard what our maps tell us is real or we can\u2019t proceed. Now, one may ask, is there an objective reality out there, outside of our minds (of course there is) and if so, what is it like? Is there some mode of perception that we may have access to but for some reason do not know about which will allow us to bypass all our mental maps and perceive that reality directly? There are two experiences, in the realm of a physical sensory modality that I know of which is a direct sensation of objective reality, and that is electricity and gravity. We can feel reality by receiving an electric shock (not recommended because it can be painful and even dangerous) and by sensing the mass of our bodies being pulled downward by the gravitational field of the planet Earth. These sensations are not maps; they are direct. To sense gravity, one must walk around while focusing one\u2019s attention on the totality of the body. One may also notice the electrical energy in the muscles resisting the downward pull of gravity; that sensation is also not a part of the map system in our minds. Best to find a street or path that you can walk on (slowly) that has a slight up grade so you can really feel the pull of gravity on your mass. Too much grade and it\u2019s just a chore. The reason for the slow gait is to feel the pull of gravity, it\u2019s not for a leisurely stroll to facilitate daydreaming. This requires a colossal effort to keep one\u2019s attention focused on the sensation and not be taken by the internal dialogue (another map, an explanatory commentary). We can feel the electricity flowing in our bodies but that is a very sophisticated maneuver. ",

            "answer_text": "Use thoughts to create your reality How you think decides how you will feel, behave and react to external situations. In the above story, Rachel thought that she couldn\u2019t succeed and drew a conclusion about her failure. This assumption influenced her behaviour and she started putting lesser efforts at work which resulted into mistakes. Thus, when she was called for an explanation, it proved to be an evidence for Rachel that she is meant to fail. Her thoughts were reinforced with a solid proof. This further influenced her behaviour at work. Negative thoughts can force you to limit your potential. They create self-limiting beliefs and stop you from achieving what you are truly capable of. You might think that you cannot be good at relationships or running a business or playing music and it turns out to be true. This is because you never made an earnest attempt. You gave up before waging a war. And, because you never tried enough, when failure did hit you, you thought that you are not good enough. Your mistakes reinforced your belief further. But what you think might not always be true. There has to be a way to come out of this negative thinking spiral and explore your potential. The following section will help you with simple ways to develop an optimistic thinking regime. How to think positively? Each of us are born to succeed. The only way to achieve it by thinking in that direction. So, how do you do it? Attempt what holds you backChallenge yourself in doing things that you believe that you cannot. If you are socially awkward, join a social club; if you are scared of doing a certain work, dive straight into it; or if you think that you are a bad parent, consider a vacation with your child. You will be surprised to see how doing these things can raise your self-confidence and pull you out from your self-limiting beliefs.Negate your belief with a proofLook for the silver lining in the clouds. Pay attention to the evidences that do not support your thoughts and beliefs that you have developed about yourself. Praises at work, appreciation for your cooking skills, the attention you receive from your loved ones- it can be anything. Then, use these, to emerge out of negative thinking spiral and give your thoughts a U-turn. Be in the right companyAlways keep company of people whom you can openly share your thoughts and apprehensions with. Knowing their views on your beliefs and following their suggestions can be a perfect way to overcome your assumptions about self. I am a life coach and healer.

            "answer_text": "You are entirely the creator of your reality. Not just partly\u2014all of it. You create it with your thoughts, feelings and beliefs.At first, that seems outrageous, offensive or laughable, because we  can instantly point to events that look beyond our control\u2014our birth  circumstances, our illnesses, our accidents, our oppressors, and that  earthquake or hurricane that killed so many. And of course if we were to  count only our present or recent conscious thoughts, then the first  truth really would be nonsense. No one says to themselves, \u201cI think it\u2019s  time I got mugged.\u201dSo let me say the first universal truth more accurately. At mostly  subconscious levels\u2014starting before birth and fuelled by the accumulated  gestalt of thoughts, feelings and beliefs that were once conscious\u2014you  create it all: every event, detail and nuance of your life.Before birth you choose the highway; during life you choose the lanes. One highway; a million lanes.Your highway is your fixed life parameters: parents, country, skin  colour and so on, but also some pre-set milestones: a particular  partner, a devastating illness, a great good fortune. You choose your  lanes in every second of your waking life\u2014with your thoughts. Your  thoughts accumulate and become potent beliefs, the most powerful  operating at subconscious levels and affecting your next choice. Little  wonder that when something unpleasant happens, we think life has \u2018done  it to us\u2019.You are a part of the great Consciousness. You are a god-fragment who  has deliberately forgotten your wholeness so that your adventures can  be real. The day you live this truth and take conscious control of your  thoughts is the day you declare your freedom and begin your mastery of  life.It\u2019s also the day you cease to be a victim.The first truth defies the laws of traditional science. But modern  scientists, hunting for the fundamental building blocks of the universe,  are discovering other laws. Here\u2019s one: both the existence and the  behaviour of subatomic particles depend on what is going on in the mind  of the scientist. Yes, you read that correctly. It\u2019s not a misprint and  it\u2019s not fringe science; it has been replicated many times.The implications are stunning. As one science commentator put it, \u201cPhysicists these days are battling insanity.\u201dTraditional science assumes that consciousness arises from physical  objects. In fact it\u2019s the reverse, which Hindu teachers have known for  more than 3,000 years. And the Buddha put it this way: \u201cAll that we are  is the result of what we have thought. The mind is everything. What we  think, we become.\u201dImagine a herd of horses, grazing in a field, a few in the sunlight,  but most in the shadows of the nearby forest. Let the herd represent  your accumulated thoughts, feelings and, above all, your beliefs, which  have more power over your life than a hurricane. You raised every horse,  feeding them thoughts in the stable of your mind, never knowing what  powerful creatures they would become after they slipped quietly into the  shadows. And the most powerful of all are completely in the dark\u2014your  invisible beliefs.\u201dNow you might ask, how can a belief be invisible? Surely if it\u2019s a belief, you must be aware of it.But that\u2019s only true of your weakest beliefs. If you think that\u2026 then, yes, you\u2019re aware of a low-power belief. If you believe that\u2026 then you\u2019re aware of a belief with more power to direct your choices. However, if you know that\u2026 you see it as the truth and fail to recognize a potent belief that shapes your life. If you know that eating animals incurs karmic debt, you avoid the butcher. If you know that teenagers are trouble, you create parenting problems. If you know you will lose your faculties as you age, it is the knowing, not the age, that damages you.And the most powerful of all your beliefs is the simplest: the  assumption-belief. That\u2019s a certainty so deep it seems nonsense to  question it. Countless millions are steeped in assumption-beliefs that  make their lives a misery. And yet all beliefs began with the  accumulation of your thoughts. Many of those thoughts began before your  birth, creating the highway of your life. The rest\u2014those that determine  which lanes you travel in that highway\u2014are thoughts that you hold or  once held in this lifetime.Source: THE FIRST UNIVERSAL TRUTH: You are the creator of your reality ",

            "answer_text": "Let's see how it works! This guy called me up and said he needs money for treatment of his mother. We have known each other for a long time but we weren\u2019t close enough either for him to ask money or for me to lend him. He confessed on call that am his last hope as his request has been turned down by many. In the the spur of moment I committed him half the asked amount. Since he was in another town and I had issues with my internet banking so I asked my colleague in the city to deliver cash to him. I made a transfer to him through ATM as we had salary accounts in same bank. I gave my colleague\u2019s number to him to coordinate. Since his phone was not reachable so my friend called me and asked for his whereabouts. I tried to patch the call but it won\u2019t connect. I asked him to be patient, there can be Network issue. After a short while he again called me. I was occupied so i texted him that. Moments later he called back again and in cold and stern voice that \u2018 Nahin Karna toh mana kar do na, Bahena kyun banate ho\u2019 ( if you don\u2019t intend to give money you can say No rightaway instead of making excuses). Of course, I was in no mood to explain! Here\u2019s the answer to the question that - Does mind create its own reality? He believed that no one is going to help him because of his past experience with people on this subject. He extrapolated that experience onto me and reacted without prudence. I had no business to take crap from him and it gave me an easy option to walk out. Indeed our experiences create the belief and then our mind projects that belief onto the world which we call reality. The projection of the belief falls back on us making it look all too real. And then we call it \u201cDekha maine pehle hi bola tha na\u201d (see, as i said it before). My friend must have thought that his interpretation was correct and he did a good job lambasting me. I was nonetheless too happy. In this case the reality in his mind created reality in the real world in real time! ",

There are multiple hell lot of aspects of it, but the which we are concerned about is the core one, So, let\u2019s dive into the working of our mind-stuff called fancily as chitta.. The entire game begins when our sense organs sense something from outside, ears sense sound, skin senses touch and like that things are sensed.. now, this sensed information through a sequence of electrical impulses reach our brain.. our brain has millions of neural pathways.. these electrical impulses are processed by the various nerve centers specified for touch hear or see.. these processed information now reaches to our intellect called buddhi which determines the nature of it thing outside sensed.. our memory comes into play and the things get much more deeper based upon what we have experienced in our past and we are feeling at that particular time.. and this all generates what we are seeing and what is really out there. these all processes are the various processes of our mind for example.. to our start statement.. (unconscious)touch of a rope in the dark the skin touches info reaches to the nerve centers processed here, and this info goes to the intellect and matched with the memory and a reaction or response is generated depending upon how we are feeling at that particular time we get to know or feel even falsely what\u2019s out there.. at the end.. famous John Stuart Mill said, \u201cmatter is the permanent possibility of sensation,\u201d and so is explained in patanjali yog sutras too..

            "answer_text": "I have lived a life of thoughts coming true. I wanted a Masters degree in computer science but funds were short due to my just being laid off from my consulting position and I wanted to be able to market myself better in the job market. So I thought to myself how could I get this degree. Thought being the keyword. Then I went to sleep - woke up the next morning to retrieve my email and there was an email that said your local workforce agency will help you find a job. What that heck - I was just laid off so I went to see what they could do for me. When I arrived a stately woman with radiant silvery hair asked me what it was that I wanted to so. I told her I would like to stay in my field which is information technology and pursue a Masters degree in computer science but I would like to get a job first so I could pay for it. She told me that they had a program that would allow me to go to school, and get a Masters degree but that it was a first come - first serve and that it also was limited to the top 3 applicants. I was told that 25 people had already applied. What would be my chances? So I applied with all the positivity in all of my cells that I would make it and get accepted. A week later I was accepted and my tuition which was $80,000.00 was paid for by the state I lived in. Shortly after I started school I wanted to go back and thank that stately woman with the silvery long hair but I was told that she was out on permanent disability. Also after I attained my Masters with honors they eliminated the program. Amazing stuff. Fast forward to today. Just recently I was asking myself about an image I saw many years ago of the Transmigration levels of life that each soul must go through. I could not remember where I saw this or even if I remembered the correct reference to this subject matter. So today I went to Quora just to pass some time and lo and behold with a few moves of the scroll bar of my browser there was my answer - - right in front of my eyes. When and at what time does a soul enter the human foetus? In my reflection \u201cthoughts\u201d create reality. Call it casualty, coincidence, whatever but I have plenty of examples. Oh just one last one - I played a lottery ticket because a thought in my head said play it. I only won $52 dollars but it was a grateful $52 which made me smile. Next time I am going for the big win. Cheers and best wishes. ",

Humans are particularly adroit at this imagining creating reality. If you mean the Law of attraction (New Thought) - Wikipedia, I personally do not feel this works, or at least, only to the extent of planning. I imagine a nice dinner with a lovely lady. I decide to give her a call, and she says yes. I just created a reality. You cannot wish yourself money, however. Look, if imagination really could affect reality (more than your future physical actions), then NO ONE would go NEAR an insane asylum. Being next to someone doing hallucinogenic drugs would be extremely dangerous; the sidewalks would flow and the sky would rain down. It doesn\u2019t. What\u2019s further, this kind of thinking is dangerous, because if things don\u2019t work out well, or if you have some bad luck, then its YOUR fault, right? That\u2019s such negative thinking. I love that in quantum physics for some reason it's become an excuse to mock all of science. See it's nothing real, nothing true and whatever you think, that's how the world is.

There is a \u201cuniversal and absolute abstract reality,\u201d and there is an \u201coperational relative reality.\u201d - We maneuver through absolute reality, and in doing so, we create our own \u201ccircumstances\u201d and \u201cexperiences\u201d of what already exists. In a sense, it is waiting at the pass. - Perhaps, we should also discern between physical reality and psychological reality. If we consider that these are two aspects of the same abstract, then we utilize the two separate fields to \u201cexperience living.\u201d - Neils Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli, Dr. Carl Jung, and many others thought that these were \u201copposite spins\u201d of the same abstract, operating complimentary. \u201cBohr was convinced that complimentary was relevant not only to physics but also to psychology and to life itself\u201d (Deciphering the Cosmic Number p 102). - So imagine that your \u2018psyche\u2019 has a bi-focal vision of the universe/world. The \u201ccross-hairs\u201d would be staring at a specific space in time, and you are the designated observer. - Pool players, for example, (can apply to any sport, or life in general), create their reality, but are subject to absolute reality. For example, if you smack the cue ball with the cue stick, you might remark, \u201cI knew I was going to miss it,\u201d or \u201cI knew I was going to make it.\u201d The absolute reality that both are possible, but that if you were a good pool player, you would practice jabbing with a snapping wrist on the cue stick, stopping short of smooching the cue ball, as you adjust your aim. - Each adjustment, there is a \u201ccollision\u201d going on in the \u2018bubble-chamber\u2019 within the few cubic centimeters of the skull, on the illusionary stage. That is why good players smile a lot. They \u201csee the future\u201d in the invisible \u201cVIRTUAL REALITY\u201d which is part of \u201cABSOLUTE REALITY\u201d and when they do follow thru, they can \u201ccall their shot,\u201d so that the money ball drops into the pocket and the cue ball does a curtsy and stops atop the table, in \u201cPHYSICAL REALITY.\u201d - You can\u2019t change \u201cABSOLUTE REALITY\u201d because \u201ceverything exists.\u201d However, you can alter your \u201cmirroring\u201d to fall into a groove as a persON. It is like you then are a \u201cPART + icipant\u201d in a projected field of the not yet physically existent future. - Thereby, you are not creating absolute reality, you are reflecting/reflexing your mental and physical location as if creating your own reality, which is good enough for having cash value in playing pool, or other things in life. - There may be better examples, but I hope this works and makes some sense how \u201cvirtual reality\u201d and \u201cphysical reality\u201d can operate as if oscillating to use in a complimentary fashioning.

Granted there are a lot of Honda CRV\u2019S out there, this works with any model, except perhaps a Ford Model T etc. Are there suddenly more Honda CRV\u2019s out there than there used to be? No. The reality is, that there are the same amount. Are you seeing and noticing way more CRV\u2019s ? Yes, that\u2019s your perception of reality. And therefore your thoughts and attention informs your perception, which equals your reality. But how did you get to that thought, there was usually a desire, perhaps even a heartfelt desire. Most purchases this large are usually based on emotion, i.e. I just fell in love with the house or we really loved the neighborhood in these frequent instances we usually then use our thoughts to justify our decisions after we have felt them. Even when presented the same \u201creality\u201d two people can have wildly different perceptions of that reality and therefore different experiences (for them) of the same event. Most of us know someone who is rather shy, who may be mortified at having cake brought out, and having the restaurant staff sing Happy Birthday to them, while another friend (or you) may love the attention and limelight\u2026Same reality different perceptions, therefore for each person their subjective reality is different and ultimately that is what everyone cares about (even Saints) because they are the ones perceiving it There are many books devoted entirely to this subject, the Secret being one, and Norman Vincent Van Peale\u2019s and Richard James\u2019 work as seminal authors of this genre. There are literally infinite examples of this as we are all doing it everyday. For example collectively we used to (in this country) create a reality based on our thoughts (hearts/feelings) that women were not capable of voting, that African-Americans should be enslaved, and then when freed, should also not be able to vote, and that people who love people of the same gender should be denied rights. Fortunately, our thinking (feeling) has evolved.( Except for those that cling to an outdated version of reality which will cause them upset when their personal version does not match the collective version.) We do this individually as well, thinking thoughts that either limit us, i.e. I\u2019m not good enough, this will never work, or allowing and encouraging thoughts that encourage us and support us, I am good enough, not perfect of course, I deserve this, or I\u2019ve done similar things before \u2026I can do this\u2026 Which bring us to who controls our thinking\u2026why we do\u2026.We can only each have only one thought at a time\u2026make it a good one, a constructive one, a loving one and watch your life blossom. Where do our thoughts or feelings originate, well that\u2019s a whole other topic which philosophy, religion, and you have been trying to figure out forever. We will leave that one a mystery for now:) In my limited experience when my thoughts align with my feeling, motivation, inner self, values, and or heart, I feel better and am better able to contribute. I believe that humble, connected, loving beings produce thoughts that create better outcomes for others. And that I believe is our job here to be that as much as we are able to. To love one another. So I would say that it is your hearts that create your/our reality and your thoughts just carry out what you feel to be true and categorize decisions you\u2019ve already made\u2026for example, you let people in front of you in traffic or you always hold the door for the person behind you. We\u2019re not perfect, not expected to be, it\u2019s the try that counts. And when your feeling carried out by your thoughts spark a change in behavior of others, solar panels on your house leads to your neighbors getting some, the picking up of trash in your local park inspires someone else to, smiling at someone in the street perks up their day, you have now altered the broader reality. Congratulations! Here\u2019s a real world exercise you can try\u2026.next time you\u2019re driving your car (or bike) imagine that everyone in every car around you is one of your best friends from High School or College, maybe someone you haven\u2019t seen for a while and you are well disposed to. Now as you drive think of providing them with the distance and space appropriate and just imagine you\u2019re all going in the same direction and to the same destination\u2026 Experience your travel as a cooperative action and as you send out those good vibes and love to them, watch how your travel smooths out and improves. Now do the same thing in your whole life, with everyone. I think that would be awesome if you did! ",

            "answer_text": "I think that believing this premise is a very dangerous slippery slope. I feel believing this creates a version of absolutism, without adequate evidence to support it yet, that assumes everybody deserves everything that\u2019s happening to them. If you\u2019re suffering you deserve it; if you\u2019re well-off you deserve it. This concept of the law of attraction is extremely problematic, not just because of its slippery slope, but because there\u2019s nothing about it that will make the world a better place to live even if it was a fact of nature. True spirituality does not teach hedonism nor how to attain a dream run because the epitome of most religions is attaining unconditional love via life\u2019s trials. I feel that many New Age pushers are contaminating psi research, something as a paranormal investigator that I find disheartening. Experience creates metaphors and metaphors create motivation. Motivation can be an extreme advantage for a person relative to others in any situation when all else is even because after all our motivations are our prime mover. However, objective reality does exist and can hinder what we want to happen irrespective of our thought patterns. I believe thought has great power but I also feel that our thought power is greatly hindered in a physical body. From what I read about an afterlife from respected sources on the matter is that thought has far greater power to create our reality there than here. Nevertheless, regardless of how positive you are or what your mindset is, if you\u2019re in the wrong place at the wrong time you are going to get wronged. For those who\u2019d claim that such misfortunes of others are the result of their thoughts, karma or a spiritual choice - I hope tragedy does not happen to you or your loved ones. ",

And by interpreting either as good or bad, or neither. By rejecting absolutes or embracing them. By the paradox of perceptions influenced by reality that influence our perception of reality. Perhaps such is what gives life its beauty. By recognizing that neither science nor faith is fully sufficient, we are then able to shed the side of humanity that shamelessly begs for an understanding we are not meant to obtain. Reason states that all these events are masterminded by outside influence and any mystical or metaphysical meaning is entirely the delusion of those caught up in the situation. Faith demands that the subjective interpretations are merely personal revelation of the larger context of all these events, guided by some higher purpose. Two ways of looking at the same thing. I'll keep saying it but if these questions are interesting to you then watch LOST. ",

If science tells you that certain experiments prove reality exists exactly this way, whether or not it's observed by anybody, then what is designing and performing and reading these experiments? On the other hand, how many times have we proven that our thoughts create our reality?  Negative attitudes create negative situations, positive attitudes create positive ones.  The power of desire, intent and belief are all well documented, as well as the power of fear, hate, anger and disbelief.   If you think all stringent, double-blind scientific experiments are objective, think again.  Most of the expensive medical research is done by pharmaceutical companies.  Do you think they are objective? So I personally am left to wonder, how much of our reality is in our control or beyond our control?  Historically that line keeps moving.   So the answer to your question is certainly yes, many of our thoughts create our reality but to what degree this is true for an individual or a group depends on the thoughts and perception of that individual or group.

Body is based on isotonic contraction that shortens the muscle and brings about movement. Mind is based on isometric contraction and brings about changes in muscle tone, which provides power to movement. Mind is based on seven stage muscle tone based thinking.  As the idea passes through the seven stages the power associated with increases so that in stage 8 the idea becomes an action in the real world. Thus, mind doesn\u2019t create reality. It just makes a daydream become a real world success. ",
