            "answer_text": "The only Universe we know is the one we live in and it is, at least partly, conscious (at least we are conscious and we are part of this Universe). On the other hand \u201cThe **universe** (Latin: *universus*) is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.\u201d (Wikipedia). The Universe being ALL THE SPACE AND TIME AND THEIR CONTENTS means that it can\u2019t exist, by definition, without the existence of everything that has ever existed, exists and will ever exist within it, including consciousness. The logical conclusion is that, by definition, our Universe can\u2019t exist without consciousness. However, one can imagine an Universe without consciousness but it won\u2019t be our Universe and it will always remain only a speculation. Others specified that there was a time in the past when, because we didn\u2019t existed, probably there was no consciousness in our Universe. That could be true but, being only a portion of space and time, that period is only a part of our Universe and not the Universe as a whole. ",

            "answer_text": "Does the universe exist without consciousness? The only evidence we have is that the universe existed for billions of years before the Earth existed, and more billions of years before animals with brains evolved. There may be other intelligent life elsewhere, but that could not have evolved before the heavy elements necessary for life had formed in a succession of generations of stars. There is no evidence for the various fanciful claims and hand-waving attempts to define supernaturalism into existence. Consciousness and intelligence are emergent properties of material brains interacting with their associated sensory systems and bodily endocrine systems;- and nothing else - unless we consider AI circuits in robots as conscious.

There is nothing behind the observation. \u2018Why there is no observer\u2019 or \u2018there may be an observer\u2019 are all expressions, thoughts arising in the mind. Even the idea of God or \u2018who created this Existence, this Universe\u2019 arises as thinking. When this is clearly noticed, subject-object is seen as a singular, complete, self-sustained process. You can not find the Original as an object. As the investigation will always require a subject-object format. What ever comes before you including stars, galaxies and so on can not be the source. It is an object. It can have some use, function. To come to the source, the subject (you) is also to be included. To see that subject-object is a singular process rests all seeking.\ufeff ",

A person in a doctors office goes unconscious after breathing something. Doctors are very clear about this. The room, the person, the walls etc. Nothing disappears. It turns out after extensive observation that consciousness does not make things exist. Consciousness just observes things. It does not control their actual existence. Final answer: The universe excised long before any person existed. Humans are part of existence for a while. The universe exists whether consciousness exists or not. ",
