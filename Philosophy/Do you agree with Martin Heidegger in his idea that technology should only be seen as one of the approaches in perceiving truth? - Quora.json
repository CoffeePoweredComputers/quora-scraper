            "answer_text": "I will answer this interesting question from the philosophy of Dr. Tom Rockmore. The correct approach to the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, is his own hermeneutic approach, that is, what was the Sitz Im Leben of Heidegger at the time of his writing? The answer is bound with the history of the Nazi Party, of which Heidegger was a member. There is a long-standing myth that Heidegger built on the philosophy of Edmund Husserl. Yet Husserl himself denied it. I am alarmed that this myth endures, because it was founded upon a Nazi fiction. The real reason that Husserl was removed from his chair of Philosophy and replaced by Heidegger, was because Husserl was an ethnic Jew, and Heidegger was a member of the Nazi Party. So please beware of this myth. Now I can address your question. Who ever said that Technology was ever one of the approaches for perceiving Truth? Socrates? Plato? Aristotle? Descartes? Spinoza? Kant? Hegel? Nietzsche? No? Hmm. Also \u2014 what sort of Truth is suggested by Heidegger? A Moral Truth? Truths about Justice? Honesty? Moderation? Courage? Ethics? How in the world could Technology ever serve as an approach to perceiving the Truth of Justice? It can\u2019t. So, what was the hermeneutic Sitz Im Leben of Heidegger\u2019s idea? Was it not the Nazi Party and its gigantic strides of Technology aimed at global domination through war? Was it not the massive bombing of civilians in London? Was it not Nazi tanks in their Blitzkrieg on Paris? Was it not the Blitzkrieg invasion of Russia for extra Lebensraum for Germans? Heidegger was a critic of technology, and called for a simpler life, out in the countryside with the German Folk. There is no way that he wanted to see an Atomic Bomb aimed at Germany. The Berlin Wall was never on his agenda. That is the correct approach to this interesting question, which belongs squarely in the history of its time \u2014 World War 2. P.S. Now that Heidegger\u2019s \u201cBlack Notebooks\u201d have finally been fully released (2020), we can all see in blunt terms the abiding influence of Hitler upon Heidegger. ",
