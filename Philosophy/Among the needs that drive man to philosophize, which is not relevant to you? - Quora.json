            "answer_text": "All philosophy is relevant to the the strength of the the idea put forward and that idea being backed by reasoning. Philosophies that don't meet a burden of reasonable consideration by lack of some tangible connection to our reality are not relevant. Phylosophy: The earth could be flat. Not tangible in our reality, not a relevant. Phylosophy: god may exsist. Not tangible in our reality, not a relevant. Phylosophy: Black holes may be the start, finish and re-start of our universe. Tangible in our reality, black holes exsist. Phylosophy: Winnie the pooh ideology. Tangible in our reality, the Pooh existed. Phylosophy is subjective, just a view of what may be or could be and is open to debate. The phylosophy of Pooh has a merit because Pooh did exsist. A phylosophy that has met the merit of objectivity is a statement of fact if verified. We can't verify good or evil, we can't verify love or hate, we can't verify bad or good luck, we can discuss these ideas. Good ideas have a relevant connection to us. Just my thoughts. I hope this helps Wally ",

            "answer_text": "Peersonally, I think that anything thhat you do for your own selfish good is irrelevant. Note that I said selfish. It is very mature and completely good to do something in wanting to learn something useful, or to grow and become a better person, etc. Those things are not selfish, they're a necessity in maturing. However, reasons like, philosophizing to earn fame, or money, (I don't know how or why you would philosophize to earn fame or money, but I'm not only talking about philosophizing here) is, indeed, selfish. But don't we all feel that way? That just shows that our true human nature is greedy. There are no people that are selfless, but there are people who strive to be. I think, aside from the reason that we need to fulfill our own selfish desires, that all other reasons are relevant and, sometimes, good. It is always a good choice to decide to learn more, depending on the real reason behind it. ",

It's not nessasary to posses some needs, and if talk about which is not relevant, I think it to be the ability to find truth in the nature. It basically not matters that you really revel our the fundamentals of nature, because most important is to find it in yourself. ",
