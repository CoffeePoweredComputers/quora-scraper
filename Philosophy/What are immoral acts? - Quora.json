            "answer_text": "The answer to this is entirely dependent on a person\u2018s belief system. There are people who don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to steal, or to kill. As a Christian, I believe in the Judeo Christian values from the Scriptures. And by that, I mean that there are real morals, defined in the Scriptures, and then there are others out there who have made up \u201cmorals,\u201d or standards of behavior based on their own belief. They believe in moral relativism, I don\u2019t. The problem with moral relativism is that mankind will never agree on what is moral, and many people will indulge in evil acts, and as they killed their moral compass, will justify them as reasonable within some twisted stream of logic. Let me give you an example. In some poor countries, perhaps many, families in a state of poverty with many children might sell their daughters into the sex trade to make money. Because it takes care of the \u201cgreater good\u201d of the family, they justify it is OK. My mother worked in Egypt for a couple years. She was surprised to see her young boy missing hands and feet begging for money in the street. A little later she saw another one, and asked her Egyptian contact what was going on? How did it happen? Her Egyptian contact explained that for poor families, while the daughters might be useful to sell into various sexual moneymaking schemes, the boys made more pitiable beggars if the parents cut off their hands and feet. This increased profits to the family and so it was not an entirely rare occurrence. And I hope anyone reading this found it as monstrous as I did. But it is a perfect example of the evils of moral relativism. ",
