What is currently known based on research done by lead researcher on AGI B. A. Rehl. The theory includes; cognitive evolutionary theory and human consciousness theory. So, one of the projected solutions to AGI would also enable designing a conscious machine. Having said that, in relation to the question, solipsism is based on the belief that there is nothing outside one\u2019s own mind, and solipsists argue that the only true knowledge is what we know about our own internal thinking. Which evidently means everything else is uncertain and untrustworthy. Now, in considering the ability of AGI to even fathom this gargantuan feat of complexity. It is observed that is very much possible to be conscious without being aware of your own existence. It is has been observed, that it possible to think without being aware of your own existence. Consequently, not everything that is conscious is actually aware that it exists. However, there is nothing that thinks that doesn\u2019t exist. Having said that, knowledge of existence requires understanding of potentiality; either in general or a self - specific way, which is apparently rare. Most animals depend on an understanding of processes rather than their potentialities. So, is there a possibility that AGI would enable to design a consciousness capable of producing the processes needed to actualize the intelligence neccessary to swtich Psychological Solipsism? No, that would currently be impossible to even conceive realistically, since, conciousness is not nearly even barely understood. ",

            "answer_text": "If you could switch on an entirely solipsistic Artificial General Intelligence, would you do it? Funny sort of idea, a solipsistic AI. In other words, it would think I am (or any other intelligence it interacted with is) a creation of its subconscious mind. What kind of self-respecting AI even has a subconscious mind? You\u2019d think it\u2019d know its own sh!t a little better. What good\u2019s being a computer at that point if all you get is the same old squish? Anyway, though. Would I switch it on? Sure, why not. I\u2019d take care to see that it wasn\u2019t connected to the internet. Or anything else. Free-standing unit, disconnected from the grid. The outlets it plugs into fed by a generator. A few other computers hooked up to an LAN on the same power so we could have some buddies over and watch how fast it learns to kick our ass on Medal of Honor. ",
