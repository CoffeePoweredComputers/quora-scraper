            "answer_text": "The question is quite tricky. It says \u201cIf nothing exists, does nothing exist?\u201d Logically, the answer would be yes, but it is a qualified yes, an affirmation based simply on the given assumption, supposition, if. In short \u201cif x, therefore x\u201d where x= \u201cnothing\u201d. But if we remove the assumption, the hypothetical supposition, and simply ask \u201cDoes nothing exist?\u201d, then the answer needs another premise, a premise other than the assumption that it exists. For us to be able to answer the question, we have to define or have a more or less common understanding of what nothing and what existence mean. Hence, the answers would depend on the definitions of what these two terms mean. (Actually we may also need to define or have a more or less common understanding of what do means, for in its declarative form the sentence would not only be \u201cNothing exists,\u201d but could also be \u201cNothing does exist\u201d or it can even be \u201cThere is nothing which does the [act of] existing.\u201d) Anyway, I read some answers here, which I find confusing or confused. Big Bang Theory (at least the present so-called standard model) does not assert that everything came out of nothing. What it states is that the present notion of space and time must have begun around 13.6 million years ago, beyond which the current understanding of science is not yet able to explain (FYI: I am not a \u2018fan\u2019 of BBT, I am just trying to clarify.)Zero is not necessarily nothing. For instance, it is a specific point in the number line from which positive numbers follow to the right and negative numbers to rhe left. Zero degree celsius is not the absence of temperature nor of the Celsius measuring unit, it is in fact a specific amount of temperature or a specific point in the thermometer at which liquid water turns to ice.In philosophy, i.e., in materialism, matter is the substance of all things, which includes the non-matter physical entities in physics. Meanwhile energy can be construed as a property of matter.In physics, \u201cnothing comes out of nothing\u201d is but an expression of a law of thermodynamics, the conservation of mass and energy.Now, I know I have not answered the question, but I hope this helps.

This statement assumes that thing = matter and that no-thing = no-matter. We know from Einstein that matter is equitable to energy and represents some form of it. So Noumena can be seen as a state of quiescent energy not producing but capable of producing any-thing. This puts your question of, \u201cDoes nothing exist?\u201d as a oxymoron if we accept that \u201cexist\u201d equates to matter as opposed to no-matter (doesn\u2019t exist). If we can accept that all matter and the observable cosmos are a mixed bag of matter and energies, perhaps the analogy of Phenomena and Noumena are graceful binary and define the two states of matter and non-matter (energy). Therefore nothing, (Noumena) is by virtue of not existing, extant. Threefold Lotus Kwoon Core Teachings of Buddha ",

Take the expression \u201cNothing is the matter.\u201d It is like saying \u201cMatter is nothing.\u201d In the language of physics we see matter as a form of energy vibrating at a certain frequency: \u201cnot a thing.\u201d So now we have an unconventional sense of the familiar expression, \u201cNothing\u2019s the matter.\u201d Matter is energy. Looking at \u201cnothing\u201d as equivalent to \u201cenergy\u201d allows us to rephrase the original question in this way: \u201cIf energy exists, does energy exist?\u201d Now it is clearly an oxymoron. To which we can reply: \u201cThe answer is there is no question.\u201d I like this answer when it comes to matters of the heart. Life is a mystery to be embraced and enjoyed. Questions have their place, but not on the deepest levels of \u201cexistence\u201d where we need to learn the language of love that swells within the human heart.

In this set you could have nothing, zero, all odd integers, even integers, earth, all humans, etc. That is why the universe starts from everything and end at everything. Kinda like life, the beginning of life is a virus, the end of life is a virus. If you start with everything, you will end with everything. Within everything, you create some things like a car, a human, a sun, nothing, darkness, etc. Quantum field theories back the idea we came from everything. The electron field, the positron field, the vaccuum field, Higgs field, etc. already existed and forever existed. We can trigger particle out from these fields by its energy level. ",

There is a concrete definition of \u201cnothing\u201d and I can use it in context just like any other word. If, however, you mean it as a tangible thing, it gets a bit more complicated. Space, for example, is in essence nothing. It is an empty, dark, cold vacuum. So, in one sense it does exist, because space is a very real fact in our universe, but at the same time, it doesn't exist, because it is defined as the absence of \u201cthings\u201d. In the end, however, it\u2019s up to you, to make your own conclusion. ",

Example 2: Have you ever heard the expression \u201cI have don NOTHING wrong\u201d, the absence of wrong doing is described as nothing. Conclusion:The concept of nothing does exist but it exist an abstract(you can not point, touch, feel or see), which is relative towards the meaning of something,so the next time you say \u2018nothing, it might mean your speech lacks sense.

Either something real exists or something imaginary and unreal exists. As such nothing exists is itself a fallacy. It can neither be correct nor true to say that nothing exists. If you insist that nothing exists it can be logically proved that you are wrong because there is your mind imagining that nothing exists and when your mind is present it is wrong to say that nothing exists. As the question is illogical there is no answer possible. However when you consider a closed system like a vacuum tube, it is true that nothing exists in a vacuum. It only means that matter does not exist in the vacuum. If we replace the word 'nothing' by 'no matter' it will be right to say that if no matter exists, then no matter exists. ",
