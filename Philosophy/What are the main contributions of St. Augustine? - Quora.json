            "answer_text": "The Ten Main Contributions of Augustine to Philosophy.  1. Theory of Time: In the Confessions Book 11 Augustine developed a very provocative concept of time. 2. Learning Language: Augustine attempted to explain how small children learn and express language. 3. Faith Seeking Understanding: In his Sermon 43.7, 9 Augustine asserted: Crede, ut intelligas (\"Believe in order that you may understand\"). 4. Ontological Argument: The writings of Augustine also influenced the subsequent formulation by Saint Anselm of the ontological argument for the existence of God. 5. Refutation of Scepticism: The statement of trench philosopher, Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650), cogito ergo sum (\"I think, therefore I am\") is derived from dubito ergo sum (\"I doubt, therefore I am\") and si fallor sum (\"If I am deceived, I am\") by Augustine. 6. Proof of the existence of God from Eternal Truths: Augustine argued that the human mind apprehends universal, objective, unchanging, and necessary truths that are superior to the human mind itself. Thus an eternal God exists to explain these eternal truths. 7. Response to the Problem of Evil: Augustine argued that while evil is real it is not a substance or a \"stuff.\" Rather, evil is an absence of goodness. 8. Divine Illumination: Augustine developed an epistemology (theory of knowledge) known as divine illumination. Human knowledge is thus directly dependent upon God. 9. Creation Ex Nihilo: Augustine vigorously argued that God created the world ex nihilo (creation \"out of nothing\" or \"from nothing\"). Certain points of the thought of Augustine 1,500 years ago are very consistent with the modern \"big bang\" theory within cosmology. 10. The Examined Self: In his Confessions, Augustine was one of the first to write in depth about the self, particularly in relation to God. http://www.augnet.org/?ipageid=376  Augustine developed the Christian principles of original sin, divine grace, and predestination. The theological aspects of both Catholic and Protestant theology are based Augustine's ideas. His ideas also influenced the Reformation leaders John Calvin and Martin Luther, and philosophers Immanuel Kant and Blaise Pascal. His psychological ideas were first published in Confessions, one of the earliest great autobiographies. His insightful descriptions of subjective events (e.g., the will, experienced freedom of the will, the self) begin the tradition of introspection and phenomenology in psychology. Augustine discussed the perception of time and concluded that time is an inner experience, i.e., it is psychological. He anticipated Descartes concerning the proof of self-existence: to doubt is to think, to think is to exist. (Zusne, p. 14) Through the medieval period and the reintroduction of Aristotle's ideas, Augustine's thoughts on psychology were the only accepted ones. Augustine espoused Plato's view that the soul is immaterial and immortal, and that the body is material and mortal. He believed that knowledge was obtained through self-awareness and not from sensory impressions. He thought of the mind as a unity with independent facilities (reason, memory, will and imagination) and originated what is now known as faculty psychology. (Zusne) In his text \"Confessions\", which contains several autobiographical passages, Augustine tackles such issues as family relations, memory, conversion, mysticism, the place of sexual renunciation in religion, time and eternity, and death.

            "answer_text": " When I think of St. Augustine I think of the books he wrote. Most notable are The Confessions and The City of God. Confessions This is one of the first autobiographies (if not the first autobiography) in the western tradition. If you were a great man someone might write a biography about you. It was almost unheard of to write a book about yourself. Usually, when someone writes a book about himself he presents the best picture of himself; Augustine did the opposite. He showed all of the worst sides of himself to let the world know that God saved Him. Augustine wrote this way to portray his theology of depravity and grace. The effectiveness came out of the skill and novelty of his writing. The City of God. This is a long book but it is clear that Augustine did not initially view it as one book. If I remember correctly City of God is divided into twenty books. Augustine would write a book and then a year later write another one. He never intended it to all be read in one shot. This book is a city. It touches on a wide array of subjects: PhilosophyGreco-Roman historyGreek religionChristian theologyAnd even discusses fossils of dinosaurs the ancient Romans discoveredBy the time you finish the book you will be amazed at Augustine\u2019s mind and the journey of learning you completed. There are two themes that run through the book. The City of God which is perfect and holy and the City of Man which is completely the opposite. If you gain nothing else from reading this book you will learn why God is holy and people are not. Conclusion Both books are worth reading. Confessions is a shorter read and easier to get through. If you have never read Augustine I suggest this book first. City of God is worth it but it has difficult to understand material (lots of philosophy) and is very long. However, if you are up to the challenge you will be handsomely rewarded. ",
