            "answer_text": "Of course. For more than a few reasons. The two parts of the bible, were rewritten and edited for political or religious purposes many, many times. Bible - Wikipedia The old testament contains many stories borrowed from earlier traditions. The Flood story was borrowed from the Epic of Gilgamesh, (Tablet 11) a Sumerian tale from 1,500 years earlier -long before the Israelites became a distinct tribe after leaving Canaan.Epic of Gilgamesh - Wikipedia Israelites - Wikipedia The Flood story is also a giveaway as to the primitive and localised knowledge of the writers of that story. It is simply nonsense, for more reasons that I have space for. Then we have the biblical god Yaweh, Yahweh - Wikipedia borrowed from the Canaanite pantheon. Yaweh is either the son of or a version of of El the Canaanite god (hence the name IS-ra-EL) which the bible confirms. The Israelites initially worshipped Yahweh alongside a variety of Canaanite gods and goddesses, including El, Asherah and Baal. At some point, El and Yahweh merged in the belief system of the tribe. So right from the start we have a whole slew of borrowed tales and traditions from various sources. Then we have the many, many contradictions, mistakes, historical errors, misunderstandings, myths and impossibilities in the bible, that eliminate the possibility that it was written or dictated by a being with advanced knowledge. The Problem of the Bible: Inaccuracies, contradictions, fallacies, scientific issues and more. Another giveaway, is that it contains absolutely no knowledge in advance of the time when it was written and what knowledge it offers about the natural world, the laws of nature or the cosmos, is most often comically wrong. An average 10 year old has a better grasp on physics, biology, nature, cosmology and morality than the bible writers. What about its portrayal as a moral guide from a loving patriarchal, all-knowing supreme being? It fails terribly. The bible, particularly the old testament, has frequent and specific demands for violence, murder and genocide by the biblical god, things that today are considered war crimes or crimes against humanity. By our 21st century morality, or even morality as expressed by the Chinese philosophers of the same time, the biblical god was a primitive narcissistic monster. The old testament repeatedly describes an angry, narcissistic, bloodthirsty god who is jealous of the other gods in his Canaanite pantheon (\u2018you shall have no other gods (plural) before me\u2019) and who has far too many very primitive human qualities, to be some kind of \u2018advanced being\u2019. A normal 21st century human would be horrified with what the bible contains if they bothered to read it. Just some of the things the biblical god demands or allows are: You have to kill your family including your children if they don\u2019t worship Yaweh. (2 Chronicles 15:12-13, Deuteronomy 13:13-19, Deuteronomy 13:7-12)When you have enemies you must kill all of them including women and children. (Ezekiel 9:5-7, Jeremiah 51:20-26,1 Samuel 15:2-3You can buy and own slaves and sell your children into slavery but buy back only the boys. (Exodus 21)Men can have multiple wives. (Genesis 16:1\u20134, 29:15\u201330)You can kill your children if they insult you (Leviticus 20:9)And it goes on and on. So if we, as mere humans, are orders of magnitude more moral that the biblical god, how likely is it that these horrors would be demanded by an advanced, all knowing being? The fact that the biblical god insists on having people killed for a whole range of reasons, (actions that we would not accept under any circumstances today) clearly indicates that it was written by primitive people. The other telling indicator of its parochial nature, is that the bible as a whole, is nowhere near as philosophically astute or sophisticated as the Tao or the writings of Buddha, philosophies that were penned around 500 BCE or in a similar time as many of the books of the Jewish bible, that Christians call the \u2018old testament\u2019. In short it is a nasty piece of work. The new testament, although not nearly as nasty, is also a contradictory conglomeration of stories. Importantly, there are many versions of the various texts, and in particular, many that were deliberately left out of the new testament. Nag Hammadi library - Wikipedia There were also many theological concepts including the nature of Jesus that were argued over at the at the Council of Nicaea. That is, they evolved over time, rather than being dictated and then handed down. Experts also point out that there were many edits and additions included in the four gospels, between 70CE and 150CE when they were written by unknown authors. For example, the oldest copies of the oldest gospel Mark (on which the others are based), end at Ch 16 V 8 with the women running from the tomb. No Resurrection and no visitations. No miraculous \u2018post\u2019death\u2019 Jesus. These stories were added much later. Without these imaginative additions, the Jesus myth would never have take off. Gospel of Mark - Wikipedia Also, read it carefully and you get a very different impression than the \u2018Disney Jesus\u2019 promoted by mainstream Christianity. For example, Jesus makes it crystal clear that he is fully in agreement with the nasty stuff we looked at earlier, from the old testament. \u201cDo not think that I come to abolish the Law and the prophets, I come to fulfil them. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. (Matthew 5:17\u201320.) The \u2018law and the prophets\u2019 is the Jewish bible or the \u2018old testament\u2019. And he was not the \u2018peaceful hippie\u2019 commonly portrayed either. \u201c Do not think not that I have come to send bring on earth: I came not to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's enemies shall be those in his own household.\u201d \u201cHe that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\u201d (Matthew 10.34) So much for family values. This back and forth and personality change, is an indication of different authors at different times trying to make different points. Lastly, consider that a large part of the new testament is taken up with Paul and Acts. There\u2019s just one problem: By the bible\u2019s own admission. Paul never met Yeshua/Jesus (assuming he actually existed) The entirety of Paul\u2019s gospel is an original work of his imagination, spiced with some sporadic meetings later with some people claiming to be disciples of Yeshua and with whom he had disputes about many things. Paul the Apostle - Wikipedia It\u2019s important to note that his writings as a whole, rely on direct divine inspiration not even on the stories of the people who claimed to have known Yeshua, so they have absolutely no credibility in a historical sense and provide no evidence for the existence of a historical Yeshua/Jesus. It\u2019s like a biography written by an author without ever researching the person they are writing about. So\u2026 In answer to your question: The bible as a whole is a poorly written, inward looking, unsophisticated literary work written by many unknown authors at different times, edited extensively to suit particular times and agendas and is historically extremely unreliable and full of myths.

            "answer_text": "I suppose the Bible could have been written by anyone that was inspired by God \u2014 it did not require the specific writers whose collected writings have been preserved for us. With respect to praise, Jesus said this: Jesus responded, \u201cListen to me. If my followers were silenced, the very stones would break forth with praises!\u201d \u2014 Luke 19:40 TPT I take that to mean that if certain people did not cooperate, God would find another way to accomplish His will. If different writers were used, would the stories be different? Yes, I think so, but they would convey the same truths. The modern Protestant Bible consists of 66 books, written by about 40 different authors, including shepherds, kings, scholars, fishermen, prophets, a military general, a cupbearer, a priest, a tax collector, and a physician, spanning a time frame of many centuries. It was composed on three different continents, in three different languages, featuring history, laws, poetry, prophesy, proverbs, and correspondence. The question is, do these diverse writings together make up the inspired word of God that reveals His character, plan, and intent for humankind? Believers say, Yes; Unbelievers say, No. But this is not a matter of intellectual inquiry; it\u2019s a matter of personal revelation: The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. \u2014 1 Corinthians 2:14 NIV So, if God does reveal His truth to His followers, why are there so many different interpretations of scripture? I think it\u2019s because, \u201cGod is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.\u201d \u2014 John 4:24 NIV It seems to me that God uses the crucible of life and the struggle to find Him to winnow out those who do not really wish to know Him. Knowing God is possible if we honestly seek Him: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. \u2014 Jeremiah 29:13 NIV And He makes it easy: \u201cHere I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.\u201d \u2014 Revelation 3:20 NIV What is difficult about finding God through intellectual inquiry is this: it requires humility \u2014 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written: \u201cI will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.\u201d \u2014 1 Corinthians 1:18\u201319 NIV ",
