            "answer_text": "The concepts \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019 are properties of statements and propositions. Philosophers regard the property of being either true or false to be essential for a statement or propersition to qualify as being \u2018valid\u2019. In other words, it is a necessary condition that a statement be capable of being either true or false. Aristotle discussed an interesting species of statements which are: \u2018statements about the future\u2019. The statement: \u2018there will be a sea battle tomorrow\u2019 is neither true nor false today but will be either true or false tomorrow. Statements which are about themselves such as \u2018this is a statement\u2019 or \u2018this statement is true\u2019 or \u2018this statement is false\u2019 seem to be invalid statements because they do not convey meaning about something. It would seem from these examples that statements that are valid statements are ones that are about something outside the statement itself. If this is correct then the \u2018trueness\u2019 or \u2018falseness\u2019 of a statement is necessarily relational to what the statement is about. Many people today use the concept \u2018reality\u2019 to denote a logical scope that does not include relational properties. The fact that this is a common way that the word is used does not, itself, make it necessarily correct. For example: the properties that emerge out of the relation between oxygen and hydrogen as \u2018water\u2019 are usually considered to be real and not an image. The term \u2018real\u2019 is often conflated with the term \u2018fact\u2019. Facts occur in time and usually in both time and space. The term \u2018real\u2019 is only meaningful when used in a context where a relation is referred to such as an image, a copy or a counterfeit etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know why but a lot of people out there believe that the truth and reality is a relative thing. It is not. If we can alter reality with our perception, then we\u2019d all be billionaires. But we\u2019re not. That\u2019s because there are truths to this world that we can\u2019t alter no matter what we do. That is reality. Truth is reality. The only difference is that reality is everything while the truth is just one thing. Reality is define as the world or the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them. True is define as in accordance with fact or reality. A tree falls down in the middle of the forest. Just because no one saw it fall doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t fall. There is no such thing as \u201cyour\u201d reality and \u201cmy\u201d reality. There is no such thing as \u201cyour\u201d truth and \u201cmy\u201d truth. There is only one truth and one reality. And that is the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them. Once you base something on notions or presumption of opinion, it is no longer reality. It is no longer the truth. It is an opinion. People who say anything otherwise are wrong by definition. ",
