            "answer_text": "ATA. Many thanks for asking - though please show your name. If they are unedited then yes, they are primary sources and can be relied on in education up to 18 (and sometimes beyond\u2026 read on). Let\u2019s say you\u2019re researching the Renaissance in Florence. You google, \u2018primary sources renaissance florence\u2019. You find: Research Guides: Medieval and Renaissance Studies: Full Text Primary Sources . You\u2019re good to go! There are lots online - some are not in the original format like Internet History Sourcebooks but they\u2019re still usable. Digital Library of Free Books, Movies, Music & Wayback Machine is particularly good for getting books that can be used this way. Often, there are excerpts of primary sources. These cannot be used - because someone has cut them up to give you an impression the author may not have intended. Yes, it\u2019s easier because they\u2019re ready-digested. But that\u2019s precisely why they\u2019re no good. At university level, you should be looking for whole documents and whole collections of documents, so you can understand the range of opinions and viewpoints at the time. You reference them as you would any other item - use the MHRA handbook, I think it\u2019s ch. 11. Then you follow the reference with \u2018accessed at http://www.nameofwebsitehere.ac.uk on 14 October 2016.\u2019 Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I would give a qualified yes, depending on what you mean by transcripts. And depending on what you are studying from the document. Photocopies certainly, if you're simply studying the contents of the document rather than its physical structure. Transcripts of interviews are regarded as primary sources AFAIK. It might also depend on who did the transcribing, because someone doing it officially would be likely to make fewer mistakes than someone who was scribbling it down in order to make a deadline for an assignment or something. :) ",
