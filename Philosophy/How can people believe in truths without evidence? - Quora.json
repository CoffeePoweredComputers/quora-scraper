            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a thought: no one has any belief without evidence. Every belief that a person has is supported by evidence, in some degree or fashion. In fact, if a person holds a belief, then the evidence that they have encountered is sufficient to convince them of that belief. No one chooses beliefs arbitrarily. Now, some, on seeing this claim, will bring up such topics as religious doctrine, urban legends, conspiracy theories, and so on. These represent systems of beliefs that are supposedly \u201cnot supported by evidence.\u201d But that\u2019s just not true. Let\u2019s say that you have been raised in a Christian religious community. You were told from a young age such things as \u201cJesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.\u201d The word of one\u2019s elders and community is evidence. Is it evidence that is objectively convincing outside the community? Not generally, but to an individual, it is sufficient. The words of the Bible, plus the concept that the Bible itself is unerring and incorruptible, is evidence. It\u2019s written right there in black and white; there\u2019s no arguing it. Add in social pressure; it is often considered a sign of weak faith or sin to even question religious doctrine. If you have learned that only evil people question the Bible, how likely are you to give any thought to challenging or testing the evidence you have been given? Anything that comes in through your senses is evidence. However, evidence can be interpreted in different ways by different people. To one of the faithful, the words of the Bible are evidence of an all-powerful Creator. To someone outside the faith, they are evidence of the cultural values of certain civilizations found in the Middle East several thousand years ago. In both cases, they are evidence, but the larger picture they serve differs greatly based on other evidence encountered (and accepted) by the viewer. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: How can people have beliefs without evidence? Answer: Evidence is a matter of trust. Most people do not conduct scientific experiments on their own. We trust the papers that have been published by renown scientific journals because we trust in the integrity of the system and the peer review process. And yet scientific research are not perfect. Many of the research cannot be duplicated (think of \u201cMozart babies\u201d fad that has been disproved now).  Now if you are going into the \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d loony bin, anything goes there: George W. Bush was behind the 9/11 in order to increase US military budget by trillions of dollars (US military budget has been on decline for decades until the rise of recent islamic terrorism, started by Osama Bin Laden, a known CIA funded operative in Afghanistan).Moon landing was a fake because (insert all theories here, flag not falling, Area 51 video shooting, race with Russia\u2019s pressure etc)Hillary Clinton did every crime on the book: murdering government officials, child abuse pizza ring, selling information to (insert any country you want) etc etc.I think the above are lazy thinking. The faulty logic is \u201cthis is plausible, hence it may be true.\u201d It is also childish. Like rebellious teens, conspiracy theorists like to be the \u201codd one out\u201d, standing out because of their uniqueness.  When it comes to religion, the logic is simple: there is power in number If you are the only person on earth who believe what you believe, you are crazy and will be sent to mental hospitalIf you have a few hundred to ten of thousands of people believing what you believe, you are officially member / founder of a cultIf you have a few millions to billions of people believing what you believe, then you are the follower of the one true God.It\u2019s a simple logic: if you are the only sane person in the country of insane people, then you are the crazy one.  And also tradition: most people believe what their parents believe.  ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How can people believe in truths without evidence? A: Without evidence belief is impossible, but the evidence may be a bogus as you like. The beliefs you accept or reject are determined by your capacity of judgement and the quality of your judgement is determined by the quality of the beliefs you hold. Whatever it is that you believe in, no matter how absurd or unreasonable, is truth to you. Any belief, no matter how true and unimpeachable it is can be replaced with another belief if judgement permits. However, once a belief has been formed, it may be extremely difficult for it to be changed, even if it conflicts with other beliefs. Judgement is informed by the beliefs we hold. Perhaps you did not intend your question to be interpreted as I have. But once you understand that the only way we can define truth is through belief you\u2019ll understand this is the only rational way to answer your question. I suspect you are presupposing there is some kind of absolute truth. That would come from a belief system that contains no contradictions, all your facts would conform to reality, and all your inferences would be derived by pure logic. There is no such belief system as yet. Science is working toward it, but it may be unreachable. The revealed \u201ctruths\u201d of religion is full of contradictions and falsehoods and is unworthy of God. Without belief we cannot act. If we are exposed in the jungle and there is a lion, but we do not believe it, we will be eaten. We must be able to act. So we have evolved to be able to quickly form beliefs from patterns around us. We can believe on very little evidence or even false evidence because we must always be ready act. We can\u2019t afford to always wait for logical reasoning. But we always have some information on which we believe. It is better to be mistaken and run from a deer rustling in the bushes than to be mistaken that a sound is just the wind and be eaten by a lion. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine humans at early stages of our species, when we discovered our own existence, the notion of the self. It is a powerful thing when you know there is a \u201cyou\u201d that is alive and doing all sorts of things, you are in charge of your life and wait\u2026 you have emotions? Living is scary and amazing, and then\u2026\u2026 people die. People die??? WTF! How do you cope with the idea that every one you love has an expiration date? You want to keep them forever! And then you think, if they die, do I die? And it hits you, you have an expiration date too. In those days we ventured in analyzing or at least having an opinion on nature. A dark cloud quickly approached us, we could see it in the distance, the flashing lights from above. It's getting closer. Now the lights are accompanied by thunder. What is thunder? It is the loudest noise we have ever heard. Only animals in rage make comparable noises but this is louder and it comes with strange beams of light that furiously hit the ground and start fires that kill animals, and kill us. The lightning claimed the life of my mother but at least the cloud left in peace soon after. Maybe this is what needs to be done, give the light one life and in return it will bring back the waters, the green on the grounds, the animals, the flowers, the fruit. The cloud brought back life for the rest of us, like it does every year. The cloud loves us. Can it be One of us? We can't make thunder or lightning or pour water from the sky. One-of-us has a power we can't understand, but it exists, it took my mother away, although I get it now, she is not dead, One-of-us took her, she's there somewhere. One of us is real and if we are good to him/her he/she will be good to us. Is it him or her? The strongest human being I know is a man, stronger than any woman, but One-of-us is even stronger. He must be a man, a super man. He's up there where no one can reach and manifests himself from time to time when we misbehave. I know, we were being careless, that's why he took my mother. Where do we come from? Why are we here? Everything has a beginning and an end. Where is our beginning? One-of-us, with his almighty power creates life where there is none. He is our creator, The Creator. Explanation of phenomena gives humans peace of mind. In the early ages of humanity, what other explanation could we come up with? This was all the evidence we had and we did the best we could. We filled the gaps of our lack of knowledge with something we have plenty of: imagination. How can people believe in truths without evidence? The reality is that, with some exceptions, we don't. Religion is one of those exceptions. Our parents and teachers plant the seed of belief in our heads early in life, during those years where we also believe in fairies and unicorns, way before we can question those beliefs that make us who we are. Very few things are harder than leaving your self behind and becoming someone else. ",

            "answer_text": "What we perceive as truth is rarely truth.  For example, take your physical eyes.  You most likely believe that objects are still.  However, that is a lie.  It is a lie that you believe, because you have decided that what your eyes tell you is truth. Everything is energy.  Everything is vibrating, undulating, moving, pulsing.   You can only imagine that objects that seem still are moving right now.  But, what you imagine would then be more real than what your eyes are telling you.  What you imagine would be a greater truth.  Can you see the point I'm making?   We can only hear, see, feel, smell, taste, and touch 1% of the information around us.  But how many people believe that the only things real, are what we can detect?  People believe that what is real is what can be seen, touched, tasted, or smelled.  This is how it is 'proven'.   This is an exercise in irony.  you can 'image in' a greater truth than your senses can detect because your mind is not bound by the limitations of the senses.  Yet, some would rather not understand how perceptual reality works.  They would rather used a defunct and inaccurate measure of what is real.   We go throughout our day believing that a hundred illusions are truth.  When and how did we decide they were truth?  We believed the illusions the senses present. We see appearances and misinterpret them constantly.  We think we understand things, that when the bigger picture is revealed, prove false.  We place judgements upon people, places things, based upon a pitiful snippet of what we know, when, in the larger picture, there is an elegant ordering and purpose. We imagine reality based upon what our senses detect.  Now, tell me how that is different than imagining a story around a god? Do you see how we get caught in the cul de sacs of illusory thinking about reality? I do not personally ascribe to religion.  I have had powerful experience via alternate perceptions of the divine force.   But they are not just thinking and believing anymore than you need to believe fire is hot while being burned.   To not believe in something you cannot comprehend is what people do. They misinterpret, incorrectly define what is happening and what is causing life to be as it is They think they are being factual about that, while continuing to believe lies presented by their senses a thousand times a day.   What I am saying is, no one is any more logical in their thinking than anyone else. No one is privy to the full 100% of the information using their 5 senses. Therefore, we are all responsible for doing one thing.  That is exploring, investigating, educating ourselves and willful application of experiential technique to seek out greater truths. Therefore to draw conclusion, to close one's mind to all greater potentiality, possibility and respect of the expansive nature of the universe is the truest definition of ignorance.  We do not know enough to draw conclusions, but the ego is arrogant enough to insist we can. So exactly what evidence are you looking for?  You have no clue.  That is why it is everywhere, and most cannot see it.    That is the joke.  It is self evident.  But you cannot see it any more than you can see objects pulsing. Something to think about. ",

When you put one foot in front of the other, you don't question whether the ground is going to give way, or whether you are going to bounce off the ground and into the atmosphere. Experience tells you this is highly improbable, given an awful lot of evidence.However, when we get into the territory of beliefs - e.g. a belief in God, or a belief in an afterlife, or a belief in extraterrestrial life, then we often don't have direct evidence, but 'evidence' based on unanswered questions, or third party 'evidence' - so in order to fill the void created by those unanswered questions, we come up with the most plausible answer.Good science can start with this process, but it seeks to find evidence (either to prove or disprove) - lazy science or belief just tries to build on the pillars of previous beliefs / science by making loose connections without the annoyance of large swathes of experimental evidence - which often isn't possible to make by the very nature of the claims being made (how can you measure God, anyway?)So people have two options - they either accept they don't know something, or they fill that void with something believable so the brain can make some sort of neural connections and file it away somewhere as 'passed and accepted as believed'.  It's kind of difficult for the brain to make a connection to 'don't know' - it's kind of like an itch that needs to be scratched - either by making something up so you can forget about it, or by investigation, which takes a lot of effort. Belief is much, much easier. ",

Are you referring to the truth that 2+2=4? Are you referring to the truth that God exists (I am a Christian)?Just because we don't see the evidence, does not mean that it is not there. For example, I am a Christian. Many people would say that I have not got any evidence about this fact. My friend (who is anti theist) and me have many a long conversation about this. The issue is I say that I do. I interpret the same evidence as my friend in a different way. He would say that I am assuming. I would say that I am interpreting the evidence. Evidence is a very difficult thing to pin down as well. It all depends upon what exactly do you mean. There are many types of evidence to look at as well. It could be that people are seeing evidence that you don't, or visa versa. That being said, people make assumptions all the time. It is a short cut in our very busy days. If we can assume it mean that we spend less time considering this. This does help us with our day to day lives. As a result we assume just as a way of making sure that we can cope with the vast amount of data that is around it. ",

There exists no clandestine body of truth available only to a chosen inner circle. The answer, then, lies in how we evaluate the evidence. That includes an honest search of how we determine which evidence we consider. So, let's begin our search for truth. Logical arguments, such as those we may have encountered in our study of basic geometry, will provide us with valuable conclusions. Who can build a home without a knowledge of it's basic principles. But we all understand, don't we, that the axioms of plane geometry apply only in planes. So is the shortest distance between two points really a straight line? Or is it a geodesic?Epistemological considerations have brought us a cornucopia of wonderful discoveries and neat gadgets. I'm sitting at Starbucks now, compiling this answer on my cellphone. Ain't caffeine wonderful? But, really, aren't all epistemological considerations, by definition, falsifiable?There is also the \u201ctruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth\u201d we hopefully find at law. But, sadly, we all know stories of Innocents hanging from the gibbet.I submit that knowledge of the true God may be reached only by a process independent of erudition. Else, the least sophisticated of us would remain at the mercy of often untrustworthy clergy.The only thing preventing a person from learning the truth must therefore be found in any bias he may discover and choose to accept or remove from his initial premises.

            "answer_text": "You can use inference. For example, special relativity predicts that clocks moving at different velocities with respect to each other will experience time flowing at different rates, a phenomenon called \"time dilation\". Before any evidence of this was discovered it was shown to be true by the following mathematical inference. Many years later evidence was supplied when an atomic clock was orbited around the earth at high velocity and compared to an identical clock on earth. They showed different times. Simple Inference of Time Dilation due to Relative Velocity Consider a simple clock consisting of two mirrors A and B, between which a light pulse is bouncing. The separation of the mirrors is L and the clock ticks once each time the light pulse hits a given mirror.  In the frame where the clock is at rest the light pulse traces out a path of length 2L and the period of the clock is 2L divided by the speed of light.  From the frame of reference of a moving observer traveling at the speed v relative to the rest frame of the clock, the light pulse traces out a longer, angled path.  Observer moving parallel relative to setup, measures longer path and thus, with same speed of light c, measures longer time 2D/c > 2L/c.A: location of bottom mirror when signal is generated at time t'=0.B: location of top mirror when signal gets reflected at time t'=D/c.C: location of bottom mirror when signal hits bottom at time t'=2D/c. The second postulate of special relativity states that the speed of light is constant in all frames, which implies a lengthening of the period of this clock from the moving observer's perspective. That is to say, in a frame moving relative to the clock, the clock appears to be running more slowly. Straightforward application of the Pythagorean theorem leads to the well-known prediction of special relativity. The total time for the light pulse to trace its path is given by  The length of the half path can be calculated as a function of known quantities as  Substituting D from this equation into the previous and solving for \u0394t' gives:  and thus, with the definition of \u0394t:  which expresses the fact that for the moving observer the period of the clock is longer than in the frame of the clock itself.

But do you have proof? Not really required right? You might employ a third criteria: Have I ever lied to you. If the answer is no then I hope you grant me the belief. But wait, what if I say that I had a very long meeting with him. We talked about all sorts of important stuff for the entire afternoon. Is that plausible. Not at all, he is not known to entertain foreigners in long discussions about the UAE. At best you can meet him 10 to 20 minutes. Secondly I secretly now make a claim of importance. If you believe me then maybe you will do me a favor in the hope I will connect you to this very important chap. So by just stating I am connected high up you might give me food, drink and a nice back rub. I seriously hope that now your radar is spinning. Without some decent evidence this is likely incorrect and I am just playing you. What if I claim that not only did I speak with him at length weekly, but he has appointed me to collect tax. Btw, you are late with paying. Please do so to avoid jail on my number 9227829043374638384928371. Let's make it just 5000 dollar ok. Don't tell others that I made it extra cheap for you. Now this is the moment to insist in extraordinary quality proof. Like TV announcements etc. Because there is no such thing as tax in Dubai. And most certainly they would not employ someone from Holland to collect it. Worse, this is no longer a secret hint at importance. This directly affects your life and future. Sending me money would be a huge mistake. So\u2026 if it is plausible and there is no effect then truth could simply be granted. If there is any effect or there is a serious problem with the claim\u2026 best wait till it is proven. Oh btw.. I have a brother who can heal you. Cancer, short legs, anything.

Outside of instances where there is strong observable evidence for something (such as gravity: you believe in gravity because it acts upon you consistently and without fail), people seem to need to invest in believing in things in order to stem the discomfort of uncertainty. Religion and politics seem to be areas where people believe strongly despite having rational evidence. Once someone invests in a belief, confirmation bias and the echo-chamber effect reinforce the belief. The feeling of securingly knowing something (particularly something as daunting as whether or not there is a God) is quite comforting and also reinforces the belief. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow can people believe in cetainty without proof?\u201d was the question. It has since been moved to the present framing. The question is moot. Proof is not proof without an agreed certainty, and if you have proof you need to trust the source of the proof - does your source comply with the common uncertainty factor, does it make available its statistics, or are you capable of deciphering the uncertainty factor through simple examination of the factuality before you? Today, I believe, the uncertainty factor for eg. pharmaceuticals has been lowered from 5% to 0.5%, meaning in a controlled experiment only 0.5% deviation from absolute 100% replicability is permitted, if the experiment is to be called valid evidence. So, you don\u2019t need to believe in certainty - but if by this measure you sit down on a chair 200 times and it only breaks the 200th time, in a scientific sense you can be certain that it will hold your weight on the 201st seating. On the other hand, if it breaks within, say, the first 10 times, the likelihood that it will break within the next 10 times is quite high (unless you make a stronger assembly than before, when you put it together), making sitting down a question of belief that you can in fact avoid hurting yourself, if it (probably) breaks again. But going for furniture of the non-mass produced type 1 chair is equal to one recipe of pills, making the uncertainty factor easy for such unique furniture to overcome and quite hard for the pills, which is why regulations are so hard: One bad recipy or batch of pills and a LOT of people get hurt, while from the defects of 1 piece of furniture only one person or a few people can get hurt. If the furniture is from IKEA, though, similar high standards of verfication should (or probably already) apply, as one bad batch or design could hurt a lot of people. ",

Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth - Marcus Aurelius 2. TRUTH as a FACT due to evidence Best example is SCIENCE. Science has truth. Science uses the Scientific method which experiments, analyzes, observes and concludes or modifies even, if required, based on the EVIDENCE Without evidence, Truth hides in plain sight. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this clearly you need to distinguish between truth and fact. Truth is something we come to believe as a result of our perceptions, experiences, interpretations and understanding of reality. It may or may not be accurate, and may or may not be shared by others. As such it is a highly relative concept. A number of factors can influence what we think of as the truth: language, culture, exposure to other cultures, religious beliefs, social norms, and moral precepts.  A fact, on the other hand, is a thing in reality -- an action, artefact, expression of reality -- that is verifiable and identical for all observers. For example, consider the following: \"J threw the ball\" is a fact if and only if J indeed threw the ball.\"J threw the ball accurately\" is a fact if and only if J indeed threw the ball accurately as determined by a targeting or measurement system. \"J threw the ball hard\" is a fact if and only if J threw the ball at or above a given (arbitrary) velocity as determined by a measurement systemNow consider the statement \"J is a good pitcher (or J is good at throwing the ball.\" This may be true or not as it depends on subjective interpretations of J's abilities, attitudes, behaviours and reliability in addition to the objective determinations of fact. Truth is an abstraction, a value or belief, that people create and share among themselves often in the absence of facts or in some cases despite factual evidence to the contrary. ",

Our beliefs give our lives stability, reassurance and security. If we demanded proof before we felt certain about something, we would never board an airplane or an elevator. We believe things because it makes us feel better and function more efficiently in our social and physical environment. We might be flexible about some of our beliefs, but others are core beliefs, and are integral to our self-identity and worldview. For example, religious beliefs give us a deep feeling of purpose, security, and even an afterlife to look forward to when life seems depressing. We don\u2019t worry about proof because our mind doesn\u2019t need it. The human mind is a fascinating thing - highly complex, intelligent, creative, flexible, perceptive, but also irrational. ",

When it comes to which religious doctrines I accept, and which rituals I shall perform, I have a different set of justification criteria, one that is less based upon empirical evidence, and more on social and emotional factors.

But when they are not being philosophers they all seem to live as though they believe in other minds anyway. Maybe some people with brain damage or severe mental illness do not believe. And apparently a philosopher called Claude Brunet wrote a book in about 1700 arguing for solipsism, though the book has unfortunately been lost, which is a great pity! But everyone I know - apart from babies who have not quite grown a mind yet - seems to be as convinced as I am that other minds exist. ",
