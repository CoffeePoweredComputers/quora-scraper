            "answer_text": "A2A. There has been an energetic paradigm called the Collective Unconscious since the birth of the human being. Every human being is tied into this energy field. It is where beliefs held by human beings for centuries exist. If they are negative beliefs, they will be there until they are brought to the surface for healing. Every human being draws from this Unconscious Collective. The thoughts and emotions of human beings both unerringly effect this Collective. Every time we refuse to propagate negativity or a limiting belief, we present a challenge to the negative energy within the \u2018Collective\u2019. Our own resonance will magnetize like energy from the collective. We receive many impulses from the Collective. Some are positive, some negative. When we propagate negative impulse, we empower it within the collective. When a negative impulse comes to mind and we stop it, and change it, we are saying, \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d This alters the negativity in the Collective Unconscious, and incrementally begins to break down ancient negative patterns of thought and perception. So we see that we are more intimately connected with or fellowman than we realized. Right now on this planet we are experiencing old beliefs in racism and White Supremacy among other challenges coming up to the surface for healing. There are human beings here now who are at such a low vibratory level, they magnetize this negativity into their energy fields from the collective, compounding it in the world. This happens because the time has come for humanity to become more acutely aware of this existing toxic energy within the Collective. It is time for humanity to make different choices that will heal these energies within the Human Collective Unconscious. Those who absolutely do not accept such ignorance in their own minds and lives, are doing their work of altering and healing the Collective as well. You see, we truly are connected in more ways than most are aware of. Those who are accepting this old ignorance are fighting against healing within the subconscious. Every thought we have serves to either propagate negativity within the Collective Unconscious, or heal and dismantle negativity within the Collective Unconscious. Now if you are talking about an enlightened body of Humanity, there will be such a phenomenon at some point. However, this will require the enlightenment of each human being. When the body of Humanity is made up of healthy cells, we will achieve a unified Human species, one that truly works collectively, embracing our potential for our species to at last be in sync with Divine harmony.

            "answer_text": "IF such a thing is possible, it already exists. However, currently, I would argue that the collective consciousness of Mankind is in the equivalent of deep sleep, as there is very little communication between the constituent elements (between we humans). Perhaps the earliest reference to \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d is found in the Yoga Sutras, as discussed here: TM & the effect of \u201cahimsa\u201d in the Yoga Sutra The relevant passage is: ahi\u1e41s\u0101 \u2013pratishth\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 tat-sannidhau vaira-ty\u0101ga\u1e25. \u201cWhere non-injury (ahi\u1e41s\u0101) is established (pratishth\u0101y\u0101\u1e41), in the vicinity (sannidhau) of that (tat), hostile tendencies (vaira) are eliminated (ty\u0101ga\u1e25). -Yoga Sutras II.35 . Yoga is the \u201ccomplete settling of the activity of the mind\u201d [Yoga Sutras I.2] and we can graph the electrical activity of the brain of a person as their mind settles more and more during the practice of Transcendental Meditation (as coherenc goes up, \u201csettling\u201d is greater):  It turns out, or so the narrator claims, that one can graph the changes in the brain of an individual when a group (in the case below, 30 people) starts meditating together:  This is a graphic example of \u201ccollective consciousness,\u201d or so the narrator asserts. It can only be detected when the brains of the individuals involved are ALL highly settled and so: in the vicinity of that , hostile tendencies are eliminated. The larger the group of people who are in a settled state, the more pervasive the influence of that collective consciousness becomes. Enlightened people are in settled state ala the above, even when engaged in demanding activity, and so don\u2019t need to be meditating to have the same effect on their surroundings and so are active participants of that collective consciousness at all times, meditating or not. So, are we going towards \u201ccollective consciousness?\u201d If the above videos really show what they say they do, then yes indeed. The TM organization is now training thousands of public school teachers to teach the above practices as part of their official duties working for their governments. Within the next few years, it is hoped, 2 million children in Ecuador and another 1.5 million children in Peru will be doing these practices in their home rooms at the same time on a daily basis. That would make them elements in a rather large collective consciousness whose impact may be detectable around the world. ",

(A real astrological event) After that day the world ushered in a new plane of existence for all human and earthly creatures! I\u2019m sure you\u2019re somewhat aware of what an empath is. Well ! Project Gemini has to do with the healing process called twin flaming. Twin flaming , is when two people take part in an equal give-and-take energy healing sequence ! One cannot leave the other in peace, until they they both have finished the healing process equally ! This started all the way back into 2017 for me. at the moment what I thought was that people were just going to start helping each other better without realizing the spiritual process? But ever since then people have been realizing what impacts are and coming to terms with them being empaths !!! It is the collective consciousness the healing of the human connection !!!! Pure connection !!!! A pure connection means that there is no manipulation and trying to take from others! * Pure beauty : Pure beauty is what many people seem to be chasing when they want the perfect body, or they just have to have that one outfit for that one occasion. Or maybe they feel like for self health reasons they need to wear the make up. Pure beauty is what many people seem to be chasing when they want the perfect body, or they just have to have that one outfit for that one occasion. Or maybe they feel like for self health reasons they need to wear the make up. > in reality pure beauty is when people can sense an energy. That your happiness purely comes from their happiness. \u201cWhat makes me happy is your happiness, and Us sharing a happy experience together\u201d ******Fun fact !: you can tell what a woman wants from a partner by what physical attraction characteristics they\u2019re trying to achieve ! Ex: - if a woman wants to look Sexy: that means she wants someone to love her. - if a woman wants to look cute: she wants to be understood. - if a woman wants to be beautiful: that means she wants to be taken care of. ( now under certain circumstances most likely they\u2019re in denial of a certain factor so it all varies if you want pacific details please let me know ) When it comes to twin flaming if by any chance I could give you advice ! The major balance of twin flaming is: \u2764\ufe0f : honesty & : understanding You must be honest with each other and understanding with each other ! ( for more details about what this means please let me know if you have any questions at all I\u2019m always here !) ",

Quantum physics suggests that consciousness pervades ALL things, the whole universe, and I am strongly inclined to agree. Remember, if you will, reading of those monkeys that started washing their bits of food in a lake (or something) and that they lived on an island and had NO contact with others of their kind in another area. BUT, the other monkeys, in that other inaccessible area, ALSO began washing their foods in the same way shortly thereafter. HOW did that piece of information get from one troop of monkeys to another with whom they had NO contact? Collective consciousness. Also, there are multiple examples of artifacts that just sprang up over the earth at around the same times, invented by people who had NO possible contact or communications with one another, but invented the same things at the same time. HOW?? Collective consciousnesses! ",

In the U.S half the population have brainwashed themselves into right brain anxiety driven D.T OCD, as V.P said at the last G20 most want right wing rule now. Human thought is generally isolated to the brain, EGMi maximises use of the left logical/positive brain so our goodness/oneness, this could give humans a hive like society where all think and work energy efficiently leading to a goodness based world democracy. All would have individual thought but it is all logical/positive, I would never bring children into a world where they will be brainwashed into little robots like the kids in North Korea. ",

            "answer_text": "If Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, George Berkeley, Benedict Spinoza, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Francis Herbert Bradley, and Josiah Royce were correct then we already were a collective consciousness from the very beginning. To the philosophical idealists, the world is nothing more than a manifestation in some way of the one true Universal or Absolute Mind. Thus, to those guys, our individual human consciousness is merely a single thread of a vast mind-like all-encompassing process we call the \u201cUniverse.\u201d Royce like to use the metaphor of the vine: individuals are just one branch of the vine, but they are all in reality just one vine. Or, as Plotinus put it, we, and everything else, are \u201cOne.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting theory. It depends on which side of the bed I get up on in the morning what I think of it. (I\u2019m a big fan of Hegel.) Some days I think it is correct, other days I think it is total bullshit. I can\u2019t seem to make up my mind about it. And, I\u2019ve been like that for 30 years. Incidentally, an ancient book from India, the Upanishads seems to have a variation of the same theory \u2014 as does the I Ching of Chinese Taoism. ",
