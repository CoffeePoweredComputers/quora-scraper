This is worth doing research on.Exercise.Drink plenty of water daily.Keep your brain active (reading, writing, or playing games)Stay social. Build your relationships.Of this, I think the advice to stay social and building relationships is probably the most useful. Why do I suggest the above? Because this is basically the advice that my grandmother got from all her doctors to help keep her healthy. All are important to your health and well being. ",

            "answer_text": "Advice for senior citizens: Keep to the side of the path/ sidewalk so faster people can actually get past you. When you walk into a shop, don't stop in the entrance. Understand the world can hear when you stage whisper gossip. When you only do 40 regardless of the speed limit, it's time to stop driving. When you have to slow down to snail pace for every rural corner/oncoming vehicle/signpost/spot of rain/noise in another country, etc, it's time yo stop driving. If you keep losing your keys it's time to stop driving. Telling me about her at number 24, whom I have never met, and her travel plans is not going to inspire me to ring you again next week. When I am telling you about something going on in my life, that is not an excuse to talk about you again. Orange isn't a good look on young people, so it certainly doesn't look good on you. If you are too old to see the long term effect of your policies, you shouldn't be in politics (ahem Mr Corbyn). ",
