            "answer_text": "Think about what it means to be 'modern' in the grand scheme of history. Thousands of years of working in fields, illiterate, cold, starving. And then, suddenly.. Communication. Machinery. Industry. Progress. Optimism. Structure. 'Modernism' refers, vaguely to the spirit that took hold of the west during the late 19th century, when science and technology were beginning to transform everything into what we now think of as the 'modern' world. Think of the Eiffel Tower, proud, geometric, metallic, a celebration of humanity's mastery of matter. Artists then were sincere about their work in a way that seems naive today, and many felt like they were part of the change that was sweeping across society. Scientists and technologists made bigger strides every decade than had been made in the prior century, and it was generally an exciting time to be around. Not un-like how you might feel hanging around singularity theorists in Silicon Valley today.  Post-modernism is, vaguely, a reaction to that. Think of the confusion and disbelief that european intellectuals must have felt in the wake of World War II. Germany, europe's leading progressive and cultural center before the war, had turned it's mechanization against it's weakest citizens, and been leveled to the ground, along with many other countries. Violence was widespread, brutal, and thoroughly 'modern.' It was a hard time to believe in rationality, the inevitability of progress, or even truth. The arbitrary nature of power and it's destructive force were laid bare, and what legitimacy and promise that had once stood behind the idea of the 'modern' world were gone.  I don't think 'post-modern' is usually a very helpful term (at least not a very specific one) but it does gesture at a certain attitude--a skepticism towards truth and authority, a readiness to see politics in science, and brute force in politics. It's not a set of beliefs or theories, so much as a general feeling of dismay at the naivet\u00e9 of an earlier generation.   Compare Bertrand Russell's devotion to logical principles and fleshing out the rational structure of knowledge, to Michel Foucault's blatant disregard for logical argument, citations, or anything that resembles ordinary academic scholarship. Between these two thinkers, you have a caricature of these movements.  As to their significance, I'm not sure how to answer. Significance to who? Both (especially modernism) were important as historical frames of reference that defined how many people saw the world. Today, they're helpful as a reminder that your own perspective is shaped by your environment, and people of future generations might find your understanding of the world to be either crude or naive. If you care about art and culture, generally, and want to appreciate contemporary art in museums, knowing a little bit about these movements can go a long way.  But then again, these movements are old news, and you can live the rest of your life happy if you never think about them again. You might feel slightly threatened by abstract art and Derrida's writing style, but nobody says you have to spend your time around either. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer from the viewpoint of Philosophy, in very brief terms. Modernism refers to Western Philosophy from approximately the time from Rene Descartes (1650) through World War II (1950). That covers many great philosophers, including Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Saussure and Heidegger \u2014 to name only the highlights. (I include Freud the physician and Saussure the linguist because of their profound influence on many later philosophers.) Postmodernism refers to Western Philosophy from approximately the end of World War II (1950) through today. That covers many derivative philosophers who mainly imitated earlier writers, most especially Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Saussure. Postmodern philosophers include Sartre, Barthes, Baudrillard, Foucault, Delueze, Derrida, Lyotard, Rorty, Adorno, Lacan and Julia Kristeva, to name the highlights. That is the overview from Philosophy. There are also perspectives from Architecture, Fine Art and the performing Arts that one could include. ",
