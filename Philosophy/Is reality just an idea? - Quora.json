            "answer_text": "Short answer: no. Explanation: There is reality.We might not have any idea what reality is, but it is what it is, regardless of any of what we think, feel, say, or wish about it. This is basic realism. 2. We form ideas about many things, including about reality. We also form ideas about unreality, for example whenever we make up a story. It is possible to make up a story with very little connection with reality, and to be aware of that lack of connection. When we form ideas about reality, the connection between reality itself and our ideas about it can be stronger or weaker. It seems a bit presumptuous to assume our ideas are correct just because we intend them to be so. More likely is that our ideas, if we intend them to be correct, are at best a close approximation. An \u201cengineering estimate\u201d is often \u201cgood enough\u201d to work with, so we need not be slaves to the ideal of 100% accuracy, which seems likely beyond our grasp \u201cin reality.\u201d (see what I did there?) 3. Reality is what it is, and our ideas of reality are what they are, and the two are almost certainly different in some ways, however large or small. But this does not mean that reality in itself is just an idea. In fact, the existence of a mind capable of forming ideas has to rely on some underlying reality that is independent of any of the notions of said mind. So no, reality in itself is not \u201cjust\u201d an idea \u2014 it is reality in itself. Our ideas are just ideas. They are real enough as ideas, but they are not the reality that is their subject matter. Our ideas of reality may be more or less accurate, depending on real factors. And we might not know how accurate or inaccurate they are, but the aim of Science is to find out. ",

            "answer_text": "The question has \u2018idea\u2019 with lower case. Thereby, I might presume that the upper case, as in Plato\u2019s \u201cIDEA\u201d is not intended. I see \u201creality\u201d like a BLACK HOLE, which might be the best looking representation of an idea of an idea. A black hole has almost all the data in the universe, and from that perspective \u2018it\u2019 whatever \u2018it\u2019 is, is \u201cthe real.\u201d Everything else is simply a projection, including the third dimension holographic animated re enactments throughout timespace. In this case, even something as obscure as a mental thought becomes a FACT PSYCHE\u2019 as a PART of Existence. Existence includes invisible virtual reality and corresponding physical reality. They operate like two complimentary opposite spins, as if oscillating between unconscious and conscious. An individual \u201cI\u201d operates at a subjective/objective interplay. If we can imagine the sun or moon shining upon a body of water, and when we go up the vertical line to see from \u201cabove,\u201d the light is glittering all over the sea. But when we descend and position ourselves on a horizontal plane, the light reflects on the waters pointing directly at the observer. Each \u201cobserver(s) is the center of existence and has a unique point of view. Each is unique having similar and different nodes of associations that crystallize complexes as part of the structure of psyche\u2019. Every individual is also the hero of their own drama, while figuring at the same time in other\u2019s drama(s). No individual can swallow the ocean, let alone all of reality. We can try, but our \u201creality\u201d has a given allotted duration and parameters. Metaphorically, every individual in all generations throughout history found themselves at birth dumped and dunked into some physical geographical location with prevailing political ideologies, religious fervor and/or fanaticism, peer, and other group mentalities that are specific to their culture, like traditions. So, is reality the imposed veil? Are we constrained by our physical bodies to surrender our will and adhere to whatever political ideology or group mentality? If we had the luxury of thought, to be able to appreciate our imagination, and jump out of the third dimension box where we might have to re enact the same pattern of reality, then that is the \u201creality.\u201d But, if our modality of view, can reflect upon a matrix womb where the paradigm mirrors a reality that surpasses our imagination, that that can be referred to as an upper case REALITY. One can argue that the REALITY=IDEA but that we are lower case ideas. This is a psychological/physical parallelism where we might be able to escape the shackles of determinism thru an acausal discontinuity. This would offer us the reality of \u201cfreedom of choice.\u201d But, some may object, citing the problem that human beings=spirit/beast and by extension mind/body. When the \u201cbeast\u201d part becomes both the idea/reality it joins all other possibilities of \u201cREALITY.\u201d I suppose we each can point to our own reality. We might not understand other cultures, but just like a body, we should not expect to transplant a lung to operate as another organ. We are all part of a larger reality/REALITY. NUCLEUS (physics) = SELF (psychology) and by extension ATOM=EGO. At this deeper level of thinking, the idea is that as one gets to know more about their own inner self, and is true to their self, they will be in a fortunate position to become more cognizant of their \u201cPART\u201d icipation with existence. Mythologist Joseph Campbell, when Bill Moyers asked him, \u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d responded with \u201cWe should not look for meaning. We should simply \u2018EXPERIENCE LIVING.\u2019\u201d He did point out that some people are in very unfortunate circumstances, and that they also must \u201cexperience living.\u201d This type of reasoning was also adopted by a Roman philosopher Marcus Aurelius who became a rare good Emperor (The Meditations). Schopenhaurer has the \u201cWORLD as WILL and IDEA\u201d where physical reality is an expression of will and idea. That is the same as the old Greek Demiurge, the sculpturing into the physical realm from the invisible ideas. We sculpture reality simply by mere presence. ",
