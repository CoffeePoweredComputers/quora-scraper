            "answer_text": "The whole Eden story is symbolic. It\u2019s an allegory. Eden is perfection and Adam and Eve were cast out from perfection and their descendants, mankind, must now find their way back through their own efforts and education. You aren\u2019t supposed to take it literally. There were different authors at different times and that\u2019s why there are two creation stories and two flood stories that are different. Genesis 1 is one creation story. Genesis 2 is separate creation story. In Genesis 1, Man is created last. In Genesis 2, Man is created before the plants and animals. Additionally, Adam and Eve are two people who had two sons. One son kills the other. The killer is marked so no one else will kill him. No one else who? Cain marries. Marries who? Where\u2019d this person come from? Some people try to stretch it and say Adam and Eve had more children. But no, the Bible clearly says that Seth is their third child. Eve said God had given her another \u201cchild\u201d to replace Abel. Not another son. Another child. Right there at the beginning you are given the clues that you the reader are not to take it literally. If a book is supposed to be literal perfection it would not have contradiction from the start. Even in the ancient past, people told stories to teach lessons. The listener was not supposed to take them literally and the story tellers would be astounded that people thousands of years later do.

            "answer_text": "Literal. 15 Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of E\u02b9den to cultivate it and to take care of it. 16 Jehovah God also gave this command to the man: \u201cFrom every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction.17 But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.\u201d 19 Then Jehovah God said: \u201cIt is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.\u201d19 Now Jehovah God had been forming from the ground every wild animal of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call each living creature, that became its name.+ 20 So the man named all the domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal of the field, but for man there was no helper as a complement of him. 21 So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. 22 And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man. 23 Then the man said: \u201cThis is at last bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, Because from man she was taken.\u201d 24 That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh.25 And both of them continued to be naked, the man and his wife; yet they were not ashamed. Hope this helps. \u201cHave a wonderful day!\u201d ",
