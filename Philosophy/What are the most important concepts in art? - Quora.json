            "answer_text": "I\u2019m unsure of the question. \u201cMost important\u201d would imply a single concept but then \u201cconcepts\u201d follows.Do we argue down to one, or let everyone have their own?As an artist and as a person with a career in arts education (Art History and public school general arts education), I\u2019ve stayed awake at night with this question.That in itself does not give me license to answer perhaps. So I\u2019ll share my thoughts and leave the real answers to those who have already posted.It seems to me that art has at its root an obsessive idea in the mind of an individual. The idea is a combination of accreted sensory experience that is interpreted and stored in the individual. It\u2019s not factual but situational. It\u2019s not concrete but fluid and dynamic. The idea percolates through the mind until the individual needs to express it.That requires materials and some modicum of courage, skill, or both. The resulting material expression (what we call \u201cart\u201d) is only that- a material expression and it may or may not be accurate. Artists usually see all the things they need to correct while the audience sees the marks they made. I have arrived at this point from a couple of sources. The first is a sensory awareness of \u201cme\u201d and how I relate to the \u201crest\u201d which is everything else. Asking, \u201cwhere am I?\u201d implies a relation to \u201cthat which is around me\u201d and that includes a canvas, brushes and palette in the simplest of terms. (It\u2019s much more comprehensive than that.) Knowing where I am in space in time is essential, I believe in being able to get paint to canvas. Maybe it\u2019s just me. The other source is the mechanism by which an idea with no material substance is translated into material expression. The closest I can come is to recognize that the paint on my brush represents an aspect of my idea. And once that paint is applied, it is at once a representation of my idea, a material fact in and of itself, and a trigger for the viewer. the first viewer is me, and I evaluate what I see against what I have as an idea. Everything changes and the next stroke goes down on the basis of the change. That process is summed up in the term \u201cmetaphor\u201d. It\u2019s where I mostly live with my art production. Again, maybe it\u2019s just me. I would offer that without an active ideation process ongoing in an individual, art would not be possible- at least in a form we recognize currently as art. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: What are the most important concepts in art? A: Just 3 things. (1) Creativity - and - (2) The 12 cluster criteria of Art, and (3) The 6 P\u2019s of creativity. For 1) Creativity, see: StoryAlity #6 \u2013 What is (big-C) Creativity \u2013 and How Does It Work? As I don\u2019t have time explain it here. This is THE classic, short-and-snappy Quora answer and frankly, deserves way more upvotes, you ask me. (Ya goddamn ingrates. Nobody thanks anybody any more, like they did when I was a boy, living as we did, in a brown-paper-bag at the bottom of a rushing river, and as a kid every new day I had to get up at dawn and lick the riverbed clean with my goddamn tongue\u2026) And anyways - see also my article on Genius-level Creativity (in both the Arts and Sciences), out now (ie - March 2018, if it matters that much to you) in The Journal of Genius and Eminence. (see: News) And as for 2) - The 12 \u201ccluster criteria\u201d of art: (Dutton 2009) Okay so here we go. Ready? Coming ready or not. `Characteristic features found cross-culturally in the arts can be reduced to a list of core items, twelve in the version given below, which define art in terms of a set of cluster criteria\u2026 Direct pleasureSkill and virtuosityStyleNovelty and creativityCriticismRepresentationSpecial focusExpressive individualityEmotional saturationIntellectual challengeArt traditions and institutionsImaginative experience(Dutton 2010, pp. 51-61) ie Read Dutton\u2019s great (2009) book, The Art Instinct. And = for more details on it (if you like that sorta thing) see: StoryAlity #120 \u2013 Videogames as Art Yes\u2026? You\u2019re welcome. PS - And Yes - since I noticed, as you were reading, you also wondered this: I am a creative genius. Probably even, a highly-Eminent one. Or not. I\u2019ll be the judge of that, thanks. See: Joe Velikovsky's answer to How do you know if you're creative or not? PPS - OMG I almost forgotted (3) The 6 P\u2019s of creativity. The creative (6.) Person (ality), their creative (5.) Potential (natural biologically determined `talents\u2019, their IQ, Gardner\u2019s Multiple Intelligences and all that), their creative (4.)Process (es), their creative (3.)Product (eg - their: painting, or song - or videogame or movie or novel or a one-liner-joke or scientific theory - or whatevs), their creative (2) Place, (where the heck they are, when they got all creative on us. Some places are empirically more creative than others, and look I don\u2019t have time to get into this. But think of Paris in the Roaring 1920s, or Vienna in the Rennaissance. Or Silicon Valley now.), and finally, their creative (1\u2026) Persuasion. ie How did you (personally) become convinced that Einstein was a genius? A: You listened to other people who told you so. Hey wait - For all you know it\u2019s a big hoax - and wasn\u2019t really Einstein who discovered e=mc squared (namely that Energy and Matter are worth the same in different currencies - and that the speed of light, squared is kinda like the inverse-square law; but, not). I mean, for all you know, it could have been, another guy, also called `Albert Einstein\u2019 and who looked exactly like that other one who claimed all the glory. Were you there at the time? \u2026No? Ok then Mr So-Sure-of-Himself Guy - Then, How do you know, it\u2019s all: true? How do even know this is me, JTV the Genius, actually even writing this? I may have just dictated it to my robot. PPPS - See, my artificial-writer robot: so cool. StoryAlity#141 \u2013 The Robo-Raconteur \u2013 a StoryAlity Theory Artificial-Writer \u2026The robots are coming, (I sent them). I am now aiming to get everyone on Universal Basic Income so the robots can do all the crappy \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cjobs\u201d - and we all can just retire and do our art. (I am just waiting around to collect my Nobel Prize for my discovery of the meme, the unit of culture, first.) But anyways - My Utopia is the best Utopia, ever. Everyone just does art, or, whatever they might feel like. Computers and robots do all the hard (and annoying, and boring) stuff. We do all the: fun stuff. (You should join our Utopia. No really.) ",
