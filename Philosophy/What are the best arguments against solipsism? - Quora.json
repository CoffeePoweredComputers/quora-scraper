            "answer_text": "Solipsism doesn't say anything at all. You still have to account for the richness of your experience, and once you start doing so, it collapses into the standard view, just using a slightly more cumbersome language to describe it. Try it.  Let's look at your direct experience.  Start with the view you see outside your window, and sunlight streaming through it.   You will see some mind-generated-sunlight impacting on your mind-generated-retinas.  Now move your mind-generated-eye until you see refraction of the mind-generated-sunlight through the mind-glass.  If your window has an bevelled edge of the right sort, you may see mind-generated-spectrum colours appearing on your wall.  It turns out that if you study this carefully you can come up with mathematical rules for this refraction in terms that accord to a wave theory of mind-generated light.   If you then study the mind-generated sun it comes from you'll find it is a mind-generated star (similar to all the countless millions of other mind-generated stars) and if you study its mind-generated motion and those of other mind-generated celestial bodies, you can come up with mind-generated orbital mechanics, astronomy and cosmology. Now try talking to someone else, and see what that your mind generates new ideas that you never knew you had.  Listen to a Bach sonata, read a great work of poetry.  Isn't it amazing (and deeply arrogant) to think that your mind can create all these powerful words and music? If only you could repeat this it when you sit down and try to write music or poetry yourself.  But you can't.  Annoying.  It only seems possible to access these extraordinary parts of your mind via mind-generated books, recordings and so on, which often don't seem to be to hand sometimes.  There must be some rules about this -- some kind of separation of the mind-generation that creates and maintains the \"illusory\" external world from the one you can consciously access.   (Actually, while we're on this could you get rid of children's bone cancer, Da'esh and Bashar al-Assad please?  You're generating them in your mind after all, and they don't look very helpful to keep.  Oh, you can't change any of this stuff either?  Pity.) In fact, this extra \"walled off\" part of your mind that generates the external world looks pretty vast and complex doesn't it?  It generated Hamlet, Paradise Lost, Shostakovich's 7th string quartet and countless works in languages you can't speak yet.  This extra part of your mind has huge models of population dynamics, stores of people's actions and stories, contains the actions, motivations, fears and dreams of every creature on earth, in the deep sea, and a set of dynamics that encompasses the whole history of the universe.  This mind is vast, hugely complex and sophisticated.  In fact, its complexity suggests it must be at least isomorphic to the standard view of the structure of the world. See the point?  This extra part of your mind IS the external world.  All you've done is add the words \"mind-generated\" to all the elements of the standard non-solipsistic view.   Nothing else.  All the richness, depth of the external world: other people, animals, objects and physical laws still exist as they did before.  The hypothesis of solipsism is not substantial at all; it is nothing more than a language trick. For convenience, drop the words \"mind generated\" (you might as well do so, since they apply to everything) and you're back right where you started. ",

            "answer_text": "First off, let me explain that to believe in solipsism is to have faith in something other than what is real based on the observable world, so because of that I\u2019m going to be mentioning a much healthier faith that has a lot more backing to it. Without further ado the answer to the question is REALISM. Basically realism is the idea that the only things that exist is the observable world. With that said, the observable world shows evidence that all living humans and all other living creatures have conscious existence and experience. Humans with a living brain are capable of showing all experiences you show and I show. This means they all must have a conscious just like you and I. I don\u2019t want to write anything that shows you doubt cause it will only cause you more fear, but I have to say the truth and that is science is unable to disprove solipsism, however, it is also unable to prove the existence of solipsism. Does this mean solipsism is real? No, again, realism will show you that everything in science has law and order, so the scientific law is that if you have a living brain, your brain is conscious and so is everyone else with a living brain. Okay, so with that comes the reality and that reality is, solipsism is nothing more than a philosophical idea. God is also philosophical, however, reality is, people have explained their conscious experience with seeing God, Heaven, Jesus, passed on loved ones and much more. What I\u2019m saying is that, lucky for you, I do exist in my own conscious mind, and lucky for us, other conscious minds have claimed to seen a beautiful afterlife. Though philosophical is only philosophical and can not be proven or disproven by science, you still have the choice to believe anything you want, but it doesn\u2019t make it any more or any less real. However, in the case of solipsism, it is \u201cnot\u201d real for you and I don\u2019t believe it to be real for me either. You know it is not real for me, and thank you for that, but let\u2019s focus on the truth. The truth is, we exist, and I feel like God exists just as much as any person does on this planet. Science can\u2019t prove or disprove God, but people sure have shown and shared their emotions to explain their examination of God and the Afterlife. ",
