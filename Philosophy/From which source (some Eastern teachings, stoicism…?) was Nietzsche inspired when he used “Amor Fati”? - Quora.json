            "answer_text": "In my reading \u2014 Amor Fati, which means, \u2018love of one\u2019s fate,\u2019 or \u2018embracing the Now,\u2019 or \u2018accepting yourself exactly as you are,\u2019 was Nietzsche\u2019s version of Stoicism. Roman Stoicism taught how to \u2018live in harmony with Nature,\u2019 in the sense of accepting the hand that Nature gave us, including poverty, privation, the elements and even hunting for food. These are the qualities of the good soldier. I believe that young Friedrich Nietzsche was profoundly influenced by his experiences in the Franco-Prussian War. He was 4F because of his frailty and eyesight, but he was conscripted to work on the battlefield as a transporter of the wounded to the hospital. He was therefore accepted by the soldiers as a regular guy, and he fell in love with them. They were majestic \u2014 proud, young, life-affirming, strong, and they made their own rules of life. Nobody told them what to do \u2014 they did their duty as it spoke to their hearts. They followed their captain with genuine respect and admiration. It broke Nietzsche\u2019s heart to see some of them at the end of a battle dead, or severely wounded and screaming. After a few experiences like this, Nietzsche fainted off his horse and was relieved of duty forever. Yet I believe Nietzsche never forgot his few months as a soldier. He proudly wore his uniform. It was these young Prussian soldiers who \u201cseized the day.\u201d They were his exemplars of Amor Fati. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cCulture,\u201d is for Nietzsche inseparable from education; his primary concern is with the attainment of culture. And the \u201cDionysian faith,\u201d amor fati, is\u2014according to Nietzsche\u2014the state of mind that accompanies such culture as he envisages. It is the faith of those who are above any ressentiment because they affirm not only their own being but also all existence, the faith of Spinoza and Goethe. \u201cTo educate educators! But the first ones must educate theselves! And for these I write\u201d [VII, 215]. To educate educators\u2014that might have been Stefan George\u2019s motto; yet the poet and his Circle failed to understand Nietzsche\u2019s own \u201ceducation\u201d beyond his break with Wagner, which, as we have seen, they construed as \u201capostasy\u201d \u2014and George himself became \u201cthe Master,\u201d like Wagner. This is overlooked when George (and Spengler) are pictured as mediators between Nietzsche and the National Socialists. George influenced National Socialism precisely where he differed from Nietzsche. (And this is also true of Spengler.) Inasmuch as the George Kreis evolved a Fuhrerprinzip and a party line, it stood opposed to Nietzsche\u2019s heritage\u2014quite consciously and deliberately opposed to it, as George\u2019s previously cited poem on \u201cNietzsche\u201d shows: Nietzsche\u2019s Socratic protestantism and chronic heresy, so utterly irreconcilable with any form of totalitariansim, were rejected in favor of \u201cconstraint with a circle.\u201d ",
