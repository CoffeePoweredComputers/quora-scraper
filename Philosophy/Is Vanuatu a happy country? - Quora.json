Was there a year ago visiting some of my \u2018kids\u2019 - the youngest of whom was 64! More money around - fibreglass boats with outbosrd, more concrete block and corrugated iron houses (but still lots of thatch and bamboo) cell phones etc, but they appeared to be still the same sort of people in the outer islands anyway. A magical place and lovely people.",
