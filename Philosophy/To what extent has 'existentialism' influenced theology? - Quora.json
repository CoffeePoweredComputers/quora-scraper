            "answer_text": "In my view existentialism had a negative influence on theology. But to what extent is anyone\u2019s guess. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even something one can measure. My reasoning for the negative effect is that existentialism is really just questions about why I\u2019m here, what my purpose is. These are questions that we get answers for in the area of theology or our faith in God. But the questions seem to ignore what we are told biblically and send us on a journey in search of answers that lead us further from theology. The questions lead us into completely different religions. We spend our days pondering ourselves and not thinking about God. It seems kind of an oxymoron because if the answers are within ourselves, we wouldn\u2019t need to ask the questions in the first place. And that\u2019s what theology teaches, that the answers don\u2019t come from within us but from God. That he is the answer. Were existentialism is about me and my experience with the world, it allows for me to be the dictator of my own reality. What I believe to be true based on my experience is in fact \u201cTHE\u201d truth and can\u2019t be wrong. It\u2019s foundation is my life experience and what I think of it\u2019s meaning. But it\u2019s a mess of contradictions. If you and I hold different belief of what is \u201cTHE\u201d truth, truth loses meaning. The only way to make reasonable sense of reality is if \u201cTruth\u201d is a reality. It can\u2019t be a different meaning to everyone, the truth is simply the only truth. A simple way to understand it is in my reality I am 10 feet tall. But you look at me and your reality is that I\u2019m not taller than 6 feet. One of us is wrong. Or we are both wrong, but we are not both right. So the truth must be true what ever it happened to be in this example. Existentialism leads us away from truth and only leads us to question what truth is, what reality is and thousands of other questions but all of them take us further from theology. I suppose it\u2019s possible to find God on a journey into existentialism, but I would think it\u2019s less likely to find him and more likely to lead farther from him. Existentialism is about us asking ourselves for answers. It just seems that the answers are already there in theology. But hey, that\u2019s only my reality. ",

            "answer_text": "To what extent? Of any existential theology one could enquire: to what extent does it skillfully direct and enable the religious seeker to find in his or her own lived experience the reality of what is promised therein? Kierkegaard recommends a \"leap of faith\", while Levinas speaks of the human face which \"orders and ordains\" us. It calls the subject into \"giving and serving\" the Other. It is unsurprising that existential theology should occur, and does in fact do so, in many and radically different forms. Other responses have examples of these. The existential turn reversed the rationalist rhetorical opposition of essence and existence to liberate thought from bondage to definitions and dogma that had become yet another means of maintaining an old order that had outlived its creative energy. It had become irrelevant to many and an insupportable burden to human development. This is the fate of conceptual systems and the societies built upon them. History reveals a repetition of this process over again and again. For existentialism, of course, existence precedes essence. Lived experience and imagination are thus freed from the bonds of the dictatorship of dogma, for which it was often the case that the only freedom offered by required public statements of belief was that of avoiding the stake, or, more currently, entombment in concentration camps of one sort or another. The influence of existentialism on theology is extensive. It has taken many forms as individual experience expressing itself is wont to do. There is a recognizable family resemblance among them all, for an expression of which a shift may be helpful. A statement of this essence, so to speak of course, of the existential turn may be found in what may be perceived by some as a curious place, given the cultural association of this change in thinking with 20th century Europe. Nonetheless, here is one example of its expression from a culture with a deeply established and longstanding practice of theology: \"Don\u2019t go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, \u201cThis contemplative is our teacher.\u201d When you know for yourselves that, \u201cThese qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the observant; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to harm & to suffering\u201d\u2014then you should abandon them.\u2019 Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said. \u201cNow, K\u0101l\u0101mas, don\u2019t go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, \u2018This contemplative is our teacher.\u2019 When you know for yourselves that, \u2018These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the observant; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness\u2019\u2014then you should enter & remain in them.\" As for speculation about sin, death, and any afterlife, the instructions remain focused on the ethical and its effects on lived experience. \u201cOne who is a disciple of the noble ones\u2014his mind thus free from hostility, free from ill will, undefiled, & pure\u2014acquires these four assurances in the here & now.\u201d \"If there is a world after death, if there is the fruit & result of actions rightly & wrongly done, then this is the basis by which, with the break-up of the body, after death, I will reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world.\u2019 This is the first assurance he acquires.\" \u201c\u2018But if there is no world after death, if there is no fruit & result of actions rightly & wrongly done, then here in the present life I look after myself with ease\u2014free from hostility, free from ill will, free from trouble.\u2019 This is the second assurance he acquires. \u201c\u2018If evil is done through acting, still I have willed no evil for anyone. Having done no evil action, from where will suffering touch me?\u2019 This is the third assurance he acquires. \u201c\u2018But if no evil is done through acting, then I can assume myself pure in both respects.\u2019 This is the fourth assurance he acquires. \u201cSo it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-Gone. One who is a disciple of the noble ones\u2014his mind thus free from hostility, free from ill will, undefiled, & pure\u2014acquires four assurances in the here & now: \u201c\u2018If there is a world after death, if there is the fruit & result of actions rightly & wrongly done, then this is the basis by which, with the break-up of the body, after death, I will reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world.\u2019 This is the first assurance he acquires. \u201c\u2018But if there is no world after death, if there is no fruit & result of actions rightly & wrongly done, then here in the present life I look after myself with ease\u2014free from hostility, free from ill will, free from trouble.\u2019 This is the second assurance he acquires. \u201c\u2018If evil is done through acting, still I have willed no evil for anyone. Having done no evil action, from where will suffering touch me?\u2019 This is the third assurance he acquires. \u201c\u2018But if no evil is done through acting, then I can assume myself pure in both ways.\u2019 This is the fourth assurance he acquires. \u201cOne who is a disciple of the noble ones\u2014his mind thus free from hostility, free from ill will, undefiled, & pure\u2014acquires these four assurances in the here & now.
