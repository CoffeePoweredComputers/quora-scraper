            "answer_text": "I wud create a universe free of protocols which would function by impulse and not planned rules and regulations. A school without pressurizing exams and a workplace where passions became professions. I would ban all currency and payments wud be made only in kind...either barters or volunteering services There would be courts which counselled ppl and not kill them There would be no division or boundaries defined ... all the countries would be one and divided into groups with healthy competition and no selfish motives There would be nothing binding,no Marriages...ppl would be free to have relationships with multiple people....the moment one is left free is when they dont wish to defy rules and will then appreciate commitments. It's a free and peaceful co-existence that I'd wish to create ",

We, the humans are really tiny and insignificant in this grand scheme of things and therefore, would not be a priority. But I will take care that there are places which support intelligent life, because, as Carl Sagan put so profoundly, \"Life is the universe trying to understanding itself\". To change anything may put the prospect of supporting an intelligent life in jeopardy, as stated by anthropic principle. ",
