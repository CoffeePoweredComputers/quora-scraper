            "answer_text": "It is usually good to know the truth. However, it is not possible to always know the truth. That would be omniscience! Trying to discover the truth is the focus of many occupations, such as student, scientist, psychologist, political analyst, doctor, or engineer. And the really big truths, such as the meaning (if any) of life, the existence (or not) of God, the immortality (or not) of a soul, are truths that we can never know for certain during our lifetime. A case in which it would be better not to know the truth is presented in the following quotation: \u201cConsider that the worst of all qualities and the most odious of all attributes, and the very foundation of all evil, is lying, and that no more evil or reprehensible quality can be imagined in all existence. It brings all human perfections to naught and gives rise to countless vices. There is no worse attribute than this, and it is the foundation of all wickedness. Now, all this notwithstanding, should a physician console a patient and say, \u2018Thank God, you are doing better and there is hope for your recovery\u2019, although these words may be contrary to the truth, yet sometimes they will ease the patient\u2019s mind and become the means of curing the illness. And this is not blameworthy.\u201d Some Answered Questions, Question 57 ",

            "answer_text": "You know, I would NEVER say that, usually. I mean, about myself and those I love, the TRUTH is best. But while technology has opened up the TRUTH making everyone's live\u2019s so transparent , I read some of the things happening in the world, and wow! While I believe it is TRUTH \u2026isn\u2019t it so disheartening too? And yes, perhaps it really was ALWAYS happening, but some of this TRUTH being shoved in our face daily, really makes one see the world in a very ugly way. Is it BETTER to see it for the hell it is? I wonder. Thing is\u2026it cant be \u201cturned around\" now either. Even if everyone TRIED to conceal it. We KNOW that which we never knew before. Too late. How has the TRUTH set us so Free to know how many cases of child exploitation is going on by Grandfathers ? How refreshing is the TRUTH to know hundreds of cases, where men of the cloth are being accused of touching alter boys? How well informed and exciting is the TRUTH to realize while human rights HAVE been fought for and WON in areas, over the years, we have simply devised \u201cloopholes\" and a means to be \u201c legally\u201d predjudiced and biased? (The HATE remains) I could go on with these buckets of TRUTH that have been displayed and acknowledged. And some of them, yes, I have to say, it would have been better to have not known. But on a personel level I am a big believer of TRUTH, because it is essential for communication in relationships. But there is an art of DELIVERY in truth, too. There is compassion, understanding, and an effort to HELP the situation, with every TRUTH given. Or else, it just come out as an attack and rude, and serves no purpose at all. It can even be DESTRUCTIVE if the delivery is wrong. Better to say NOTHING at all if you see no way to coax someone else (sometimes gently) to see a TRUTH they are completley blind to. At least that's the way I feel about speaking a TRUTH. ",
