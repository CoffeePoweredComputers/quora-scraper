            "answer_text": "I have two related stories that capture my personal philosophy perfectly. I served in the military for almost 25 years, about half of it enlisted and half as an officer. As a captain about ten years ago, I traveled to Chicago to present some of my research at a conference. My daughter was a teenager and because it was in the summer, she went with me. During our first night there, we walked from our hotel to find a nice place to eat. We found Shula\u2019s Steakhouse and started to enter. A man approached us (in a non-threatening way) and began to tell us both about his car that had broken down a couple of blocks away. He described how he was traveling with his wife and young children and their minivan started making funny noises and just stopped working. I had a technical background from my enlisted days, so I asked him a few troubleshooting questions. He got evasive and frustrated that I was asking troubleshooting questions. It became clear to me that he had memorized a script and was simply reciting his appeal for money to \u201cfix his van.\u201d Once I realized he was trying to scam me, I politely ended the conversation and we ate our dinner in peace. I spoke with my daughter about it over dinner and helped her to see the contradictions in his \u201cstory\u201d. She asked why not just give him the money, because he might actually be telling the truth. I told her that it upsets me when people are smart and clever enough to concoct an elaborate scheme, but use those skills to get something for nothing. If he\u2019s that smart and capable, then why not get a decent job, and save himself the shame and effort of lying to people? He was working harder at getting out of work than if he simply got a regular job and worked his way up\u2014not to mention he was clearly being dishonest. Then, on our way home, we stopped at the Chili\u2019s restaurant in O\u2019Hare before our flight. Great Lakes Naval Station is just north of Chicago and there were plenty of Navy folks in uniform around the airport. Several young sailors sat down soon after we did and ordered their meal. As we were wrapping up, I called our server over and asked her to quietly take their bill and add it to mine. I was in civilian clothes and knew they would not recognize me easily, as the guy who paid their bill. They were not within earshot, but we could see them ask their/our server for the bill, and then get told that someone had paid for them and thanked them for their service. They looked at each other and then around the seating area, and realized they had nobody to thank, and just exited the open seating area. My daughter said that it was nice, but that it didn\u2019t really count, because I was military too, just doing a good deed for other military guys. I said, \u201cYeah, but they don\u2019t know that. They probably think it was a civilian who paid. Either way, I want them to know we appreciate their effort and commitment to our country.\u201d My personal philosophy is captured in these examples, because I value commitment to our country, and what it stands for. I value hard work, self-reliance, honesty, and loyalty. Attributes exemplified by the young sailors, and the opposite of the guy who tried to scam us outside the restaurant. ",
