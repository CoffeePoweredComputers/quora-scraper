            "answer_text": "Axioms within their paradigms are absolute truths.  To this extent, they must exist to sustain their paradigms. However, this also ties them to a context, which contradicts being absolute. But it is not truth itself that is aware of any such context. It all depends on the position and the intent of the truth seeker.  How Truth Works - truth by evaluation To obtain a truth value, one must first evaluate a statement. For example, \"The sky is blue.\" True or false? True based on what we see looking up on a sunny day. But to arrive at \"true\", there must first be a statement, and there must be someone to evaluate it. Before evaluation, true or false is not known. Before the statement is uttered, there is nothing to process. As such, truth is obtained through a process, and cannot be obtained without proper procedure. But most importantly, this value can only be sought intentionally. Truth is always relative to both the substance and context of the evaluated statement as well as  the process of evaluation. To this end, if truth is relative, and is a product, then absolute it cannot be. However, there is one statement that must be true for truth to work in the first place, and that is the statement of truth itself: \"True\" is true. As is, \"'True' is true\" is true. And so on... \"True\" will always evaluate to true in a system which seeks truth. It is a requirement for the system to work, and is an absolute truth. It is an axiom of the paradigm of truth. How Truth Is Passed On - truth by assignment We don't necessarily evaluate truth for ourselves. At some point we begin to take other people's word for it. We are handed statements that we are told have already been evaluated and can be trusted. This way we can avoid evaluating everything ourselves. We can also obtain the results of difficult and complex evaluations simply by sharing. This is the communication of knowledge, the sharing of information, and education. We call this learning. Over time, not only do individuals accumulate a collection of truths, but communities and societies also. From collections emerge paradigms. These paradigms become our traditions, religions, and sciences. Needless to say, we are not always right, communication is open to manipulation, and often enough the world changes. When what used to be true becomes false, the universe does not bother to notify us. We must either keep track or realize by our mistakes. These are the trade-off we make so that we do not have to evaluate everything every time forever.  Axioms of Paradigms - truth by definition With that in mind,  let's return to the statement \"true\" and, for fairness, \"false\". When was the last time someone evaluated these statements to arrive at true and false respectively? Who did it first? Actually, no one. These statements were built, not derived. They are definitive, not derivative, but their definition leads to everything else. They are part of the implementation under the hood. And implementation is absolute.  For example:  In math, the concept of numbers is a primitive and is an absolute. There is no point arguing over the existence of numbers when you're trying to count.In science, the concept of evidence is a primitive and is absolute. There is no point arguing over the value of evidence when you're trying to use it to establish new theories.In language, letters, words, and grammar are primitives and are absolute. You cannot argue over spelling and win. They are defined, and not products of evaluation, nor are they open to evaluation.In religion, the concept of god is a primitive and is absolute. There is no point arguing over the existence of god religiously.In economics, the concept of value is a primitive and is absolute. Money is where it all begins.In cooking (to give a household example), the concept of taste is a primitive and an absolute. A cook cannot deny the existence of taste, yet prepare a delicious meal.What these are are paradigms. And their primitives are their axioms. These axioms are defined and are not sustained by logic or proof. Instead, they are upheld by utility and conviction. These axioms are absolute. For example, numbers are incredibly useful, and will not be going away any time soon. At the same time, numbers themselves have convinced us of their worth, and have obtained our trust as axioms of great value. We believe in our number system because it is dependable. This is true for every paradigm. God is a useful concept and sustained by belief. Money is a useful concept and sustained by belief.  Axioms of Paradigms Epic Fail What happens when true expressions are fed to other paradigms? They conflict. If they fail cleanly, we get false. Other times our heads explode. For example: The concept of numbers cannot be argued in math, but it can be argued in theory. The trade-off is we lose our ability to count.The concept of god cannot be argued in religion, but it can easily be argued in science. The trade-off is we lose our faith.To give a quirky yet concrete example, the concept of numbers and letters can easily conflict in computer code. Is 1 a char or an int? Evaluation is intimately tied to the implementation of the machine.Anything can be argued in philosophy. That is why it seems pointless to study it. But it is only because everything useful to come out of it has already branched out into their own fields. Which comes first? The axiom or its paradigm? Axioms and paradigms depend on one another. Paradigms are defined by their axioms, yet axioms are sustained by their paradigms. Which comes first?  It doesn't really matter. Paradigms are like a drawing or a photograph. In the end, what we have is an exposure. It is a picture of a reality all in its own. Where we begin to draw this picture doesn't really matter. What matters is only that we begin to draw it. Say I pull something out of thin air. I imagine. This guess could be true or false based on what context I choose. I evaluate. Once I have guessed enough, I can collect what is true and start to formulate broader generalizations. I think. And finally, from these generalizations, I can extend the paradigm to a broader canvas. I apply. That may be satisfying especially if it suits my needs, but now equipped with a better understanding, I have a better imagination. So I pull something better out of thin air. I repeat. This is the process of abduction, experimentation, induction, deduction, and iteration.  With this process, our exposure expands and improves. We obtain a broader and more concise picture. Our understanding deepens. We become smarter and more capable. This is how paradigms emerge and evolve. Paradigms are progressive. Thus wherever we start, it doesn't matter, since we're going to go in circles anyway. Except with every iteration it gets better. We get better.    The Paradigm of Truth The truth cannot be untied from the test that yields its value. It is the product of evaluation implemented as a process, of substance encoded in expression. It is within implementation that we find our definitions that enable us to test our expressions. It is within expression that we find our ability to describe what it is we wish to test.  Each useful system of this nature becomes its own paradigm that holds its own axioms. Axioms are definitive, and are absolute. But at the same time, they are useless outside their paradigms, making their absoluteness relative to their use. Their use is relative to us, and we are relative to each other, our surroundings, our evolution, and to the nature of the universe. In other words, the truths we utilize are relative to the nature of the universe and vice versa. Hence, we assess truth to be the nature of the universe. This leap enacts objectivity and gives our perceived universe rigidity. This leap enacts absoluteness. I think my head just exploded. We exist, the universe is honest, and truth connects us. These are the axioms of the paradigm of truth.  There have always been attempts to deny the axiom of truth itself. That is of course an option. Every paradigm has an exit. Except, the trade-off in this case is that you are left with no truth. The choice is yours. But I personally would rather get things done. The truth paradigm is incredibly useful, and ultimately that is all that matters as we try to make use of the finite time we are granted on this Earth.  The truth helps us live our lives. ",

            "answer_text": "Woah, woah. Hold on everyone. Folks are twisting themselves in knots to answer this question (some of these responses are 10 page essays!). If I\u2019m not mistaken, the answer is much simpler than some of you seem to think it is. The question can be answered by simply describing truth in the context of subjectivity. So far as we can tell, everything we know (all knowledge) is subjective; subjective in the sense that our only means of knowing any information is through our limited sensory inputs, and our reasoning capacities. That\u2019s all we\u2019ve got (at least for the moment). Once you truly comprehend this, the concept of \u201cabsolute\u201d truth ceases to have any practical utility. Sure, there could be an \u201cabsolute\u201d truth about any subject, like the ultimate nature of human consciousness. But to posit that such a truth might exist provides no evidence for its existence. So even if knowledge somehow depends on \u201cabsolute\u201d truth in some ultimate way, we would never have any way of determining that connection using our current capacities. The best we can say, in answer to the second part of your question, is that all knowledge is fundamentally subjective. This conclusion can be a bit counter intuitive (as many things are). Consider a very intuitive counter-example question: would the universe exist if there were no humanity? I bet you, like me, are inclined to say yes. But again, there\u2019s no way to prove this inclination. It\u2019s an intuition, or at best, a deduction. And even if we all agreed based on the available evidence that the answer would be yes, this is still merely subjective human knowledge. Nothing absolute has been determined. To wrap up, even if there is an absolute truth about any subject, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019d ever know what it is, or be able to deduce for certain it exists at all. If this all still feels counter intuitive to you, don\u2019t worry. As many physicists are quick to point out, our intuitions didn\u2019t evolve to understand the complexity of the universe\u2026 ",
