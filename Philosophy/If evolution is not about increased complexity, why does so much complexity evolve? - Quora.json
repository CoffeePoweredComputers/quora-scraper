            "answer_text": "Increased complexity is a natural result of evolution, and indeed - in general - most forms of life get more complex as they evolve, at least when viewing things on a scale of hundreds of millions of years. The first life form was probably a few strands of RNA encased in a phospholipid bubble. That is, as you might guess, a lot less complex than a human being, or an insect, or a modern bacterium for that matter. I\u2019ve never really heard someone say that \u201cevolution is not about increased complexity\u201d, but what I think whoever told you that meant was that evolution doesn\u2019t necessarily mean increased complexity. For example, this glass sponge, with its intricate tiny scaffolding of siliceous spicules:  Is, from a cladistic standpoint, more \u201cprimitive\u201d than this Placozoan, an amorphous, microscopic blob, essentially a multicellular amoeba:  That\u2019s because the Placozoan is secondarily simplified; it is, in fact, less complex than its ancestors because it evolved to be that way. As a matter of fact, there is a fairly recent new hypothesis that Placozoans and other animals evolved from transmissible cancerous tumours, like Devil Facial Tumour Disease! More on that here: From tumors to species: a SCANDAL hypothesis Another example is modern crocodilians. They are chiefly ambush predators and spend much of their day lying in wait. This isn\u2019t particularly energy-expensive, as you\u2019d imagine, so they make do with being cold-blooded. However, there is evidence that this was not always true. Crocodilians, like birds, have a four-chambered heart generally associated with warm-blooded, endothermic animals. The fossil record also supports this notion. This, for example, is Fasolasuchus, an early crocodile-relative and a highly active predator as big as a T Rex:  Lastly, consider this fact: 800 million years from now, it is likely that the sun\u2019s activities will mean that the only life on Earth will be microbial. You might say \u201cAh, but bacteria will never colonize the stars\u201d, but remember that even a single one of us carries tens of trillions of them. Wherever we go, they will follow, and there they will outlast us. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a mistake whenever we use language that attributes any goal-directed behavior to evolution. There are no intelligent agents driving evolution. But as the philosopher Daniel Dennett says, it can be useful to use metaphors driven by the Intentional stance: Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do. If we use the intentional stance to talk about evolution, we might say that evolution has one goal of increasing complexity. But I think that an even more important goal of evolution is to increase diversity, which often has the secondary effect of increasing complexity. The reason diversity is increased is that variation with selection allows life to fill all available niches with life adapted for every niche. So yes, evolution does increase complexity, but be careful how you define complexity. If by complexity your prime example is our complexity, then you are making the mistake of thinking that evolution is ladder with each higher rung being more complex. Instead, you should think of evolution as a space-filling fractal:  ",

            "answer_text": "I think it IS about increased complexity, specialization, etc. exactly BECAUSE to benefit ones self, you cooperate! This is more complex than just floating around alone. In order to benefit ones self (even a single cell), they cooperate, or one could say they seek out new niches unavailable without cooperation.. more complex in every sense: Just like a school of fish, flock of birds, a bacterial colony, human cells, including a bacteria within us act in concert, they act in a more complex manner than they wold alone. Here are cool examples of individuals combining their individual awarenesses and intelligence in some way to act as one when needed, complex behavior:  Thist allows different of life more likely to \u201csurvive\u201d as Darwin said. It doesn't mean they are \u201cbetter\u201d\u2026 nothing wrong with single cells, they do great where they are unless things are crowded or new opportunities are perceived\u2026 that led to multicellular cooperations, early bacterial colonies, etc. Here is a bunch of cells that \u201cdifferentiated somewhat\u201d to get food, that recognize neighbors and the advantage of staying together: Sponges: Time-lapse of Sponge Cells Recombining See J. Scott Turners work and video on the same website as the above bacterial mutually beneficial actions: Microbes Mind Forum Now too evolution\u2026 we will just skip to humans since the whole things just recapitulates and adjusts itself over time (evolution): Now to the human body; it is a like action according to intended evolution: Evolution is an intelligent layered affair, single cells do things inside themselves, but also with neighbors (including micro-organisms within our bodies) depending on the situation. Internal units are also intelligent cooperating groups of cells (say a functional unit) which interact with other similar units to act as one larger unit (organ). Each \u201clarger\u201d unit is also an intelligent group, and act in concert to produce stuff for themselves and other units in the body as dictated by their (internal to the body) environment, signals from the external (to the body) environment via the brain or we could say \u201cmind\u201d as well as their evolutionary history (what they evolved to do). Each step from a single cell, to bacterial colony, to plant, etc. entailed advantages to each \u201cpartner\u2019 or they would not have happened. In homeostasis for example, stable local environments resulting from cooperation with others (organs provide each other safe consistent dependable inputs to go about their business- lungs provide O2 for example) allow us as a whole organism to pay attention to the external environment, and provide safety and resources for those internal units. This allows further specialization and also provides inputs as mentioned above (fight or flight cues). There is communication all along the way, cues for internal units to take action, and also signals back to our awareness when there are problems internally (more food please!) In humans homeostasis (keeping with that functional example) evolved whereby each step along the way benefited all involved\u2026 by creating a stable interior, those involved with \u201creading\u201d the exterior environment (eyes, brain, ears, etc.) were able to specialize more and more and get better and better (neurons) because other units harvested and delivered products to them, which by specializing dropped many of their old functions. In return, internal units are much more likely to survive with greater external perception by the group. If you think about it, any living thing in a beneficial relationship \u201cspecializes\u201d and shares information\u2026 specialization cant happen without information sharing and benefit: you cant do a specialized job in a company without getting something that you deem beneficial, and the company wouldn't create/demand your position and hire you if your specialty wasn't needed. Furthermore, in general we see that evolution is a \u201clayering\u201d and \u201cchasing\u201d of beneficial rolls as demands arise\u2026 a new circulatory system didn't just pop into existence, rather as demands arose, the previous version expanded and changed to meet demands, in return, the new cells and tissues were taken care of with enough to \u201cinduce\u201d them to change (benefits given). The previous brain wasn't discarded, it still has previous or we could say ancient functions, rather those functions which are used to interface with the exterior world\u2026 they now interface internally (previously more external) and new layers were built on top of them as increased perceptive demands led to \u2018new brains\u201d so to speak built on top of them, using and interfacing with them, but also adding benefit to all\u2026 their environment now includes information and benefit from the new brain. The old structures become supporting structures, from the viewpoint of the organism (here person) as a whole, to the new functions and structures as evolution advances (not meant to mean \u201cbetter\u201d- lets say \u201cmore complex\u201d). Each change anywhere in the body creates slightly new environments, communications including with the brain and mind. Here is more color on \u201cspecialization\u201d, instinct, and all that from this post: David Kincade's answer to Is it possible that there are multiple consciousnesses in every body? Automation: The older systems whose activities, while still intelligent, have been tried and proven over and over and over have become specialized, and \u201cautomated\u201d so to speak: tiger roars, you run\u2026 fight or flight responses for example. \u201cInstincts\u201d or \u201cemotions\u201d are responses that happened so often over time (same response was chosen over and over to a given situation), they became hardwired at the local level, no reason wasting time processing other possible responses when the same one is chosen every time (reflex for example or pH balance\u2026 are not thought about). Over time shortcuts were formed to save time and energy (why waste brain power thinking when a tiger is jumping out, you react automatically). This does not mean that internal systems don't communicate with the modern brain, but they can function in a more automated fashion (based on past experience) from the viewpoint of our sense of self (take homeostasis for example). Again, in this way the awareness can pay attention to the external environment rather than every little blip in salt content or pH\u2026 unless something really important is going on internally, you may crave salt or certain foods if external action is needed. Having things run automatically internally allows more perceptive ability to be directed to the external environment. This helps everyone (every cell and system) inside. Our modern brain and mental capacity is essentially a cooperative effort through evolution to interface more fully with the external environment. During evolution, any time information is shared a larger entity arises, so to speak, AND specialization is implied. Even two early farmers or ranchers that agree not to let the animals dedicate in the stream have formed a \u201cLarger entity). So we can also say that intelligence in the body is also layered, or functions in \"tiers\". Just like the company needing more space is putting up a new building I see going up next door: the head of the firm (\"Consciousness\"- your sense of self, sees the whole project on paper) doesn't need to be aware of what the workers that I see are doing, he is informed through the proper channels by a foreman or others further up the line... he doesn't care about which slab they are pouring today. And a lot of the workers don\u2019t care, or aren't even aware of what is going on at the top, or even know about the rest of the building, just their sections\u2026. they have their own system, within a larger system, based on historical agreements as to operations. In your body, homeostatic functions: \"you\" don't need to know that you're pH is off a tad, but the Kidneys are alerted and take care of it without bothering you. If we were aware of everything going on we'd be dead because the bus would hit us! In fact is it a sick person who becomes aware of many little details going on inside... internal systems start screaming and yelling (aches and pains for example) and not doing their jobs. The whole system, like a society or company, is a cooperative affair, the \"internal eco-system\" you hear about. You have many intelligent units inside that combine to form your \u201csense of self\u201d, all working in sync with your \u201ccentral awareness\u201d. And if you are still with me\u2026 evolution is simply recapitulating itself with technology, or we could say \u201cmanipulation of the environment, skip down to human environment: David Kincade's answer to Where are we on the human evolution curve? Long story short: Evolution IS complexity, increasing, and for sure decreasing (extinction?), but overall, so far increased complexity has occurred overall, not much debate there, and therefore\u2026..

One cup of pond water, ocean surface water, or soil is full of thousands of \u2018simple\u2019 and extremely diverse organisms and they can be from a variety of kingdoms. Even most people's blood is full of thousands of diverse organisms which you can see yourself with dark field microscopy, and it's a miracle people aren't more sick than they already are. This doesn't even include viruses. Life is 3.5+ billion years old, and for almost all of that tome it was simple and tiny. Complexity can evolve, so it does, but organisms can also lose parts such as eyes or legs and lose DNA and become less \u2018complex'. Parasites especially evolve to become more 'simple'. ",

In ecologies that lean towards the homogenous, like the early world spanning ocean and climate, an organism with simple features is suitable and there is very little selection pressure that would see a decline of organisms with simple features over those with slightly more complex features. In ecologies that lean toward the heterogenous, like Earth over the past 1 billion years, then organisms with more complex features can find purchase in the constant rise and fall of niches. ",
