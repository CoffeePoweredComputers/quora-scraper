However, if you are referring to a life well-lived, that involves doing something meaningful wth your life. People are remembered for what they accomplish in life, so what have you accomplished? Have you lived a life beyond yourself? How have you helped others? Have you made a difference in the lives of others? What sort of legacy will you leave behind once you are gone?
