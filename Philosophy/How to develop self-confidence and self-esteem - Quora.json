            "answer_text": "You only live once. And life is short. Much shorter than you could even imagined. Before you know it, your life will soon be flashing in front of your eyes. The only way to develop self-confidence and self-esteem, is to be comfortable in your own skin. When you are, you will not care about people\u2019s affection, how they think about you, how you appear in front of them. Because you will only care about how you feel and you are willing to do everything to feel good in your own skin. Here\u2019s an excerpt from my post, \u201cBe true to yourself: What it\u2019s like if you don\u2019t care about impression\u201d. What it\u2019s like when you decide to peel off your masks Let me tell you my story. My whole life, I had been letting people tell me around, doing different things, pursuing different titles for my career. I played it safe. I played the role of a dedicated and hard-working person. I was \u201cnice\u201d. \u200bUntil one day I woke up, and I felt sick in my stomach. I couldn\u2019t understand why at first, because it was so strange. I felt the urge to go beyond myself, to explore new areas, to try new things. But I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. I just knew that I didn\u2019t like who I was, even if every people told me otherwise. I wanted to break free, wanted to peel off all the masks I\u2019ve been putting on. \u200bFor the first time in my life, I wanted to be honest with myself and others and speak from my heart. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. No, it doesn\u2019t mean I became reckless and ignore my duties. I just chose to be honest with myself and started telling others how I truly felt. And I stopped worrying about how other people think about me. I chose myself first. I become more self-aware of my feelings and emotions Since I started considering my emotions and prioritizing myself, I become more aware of it. I realized I have blindly done many things to please others, while silently killing my soul. I refused to go for a walk in the park with my husband to stay at home and do chores instead. I refused to discuss with my boss about my opinion in the fear that he might not like it. I couldn\u2019t say no to anyone because I was afraid they would hate me. No matter how much I told myself that I was supposed to do those things, I still had the bitter taste in my mouth. I become more protected toward my inner self I thought I knew how to take care of myself, because I take care of people. But since I discovered how I really felt, I knew I hadn\u2019t looked after myself. I became more protected about myself. I only have one soul, if I don\u2019t protect her, who will? \u200bI stop doing things that give me a headache and sick in my stomach. I stop saying \u201cyes\u201d all the time. I speak from my heart. And I start to pursue my dreams. I become more focused and determined \u200bI used to be a zombie. Kinda. I used to mindlessly do things on an autopilot. I woke up on Monday, got to work, went home and felt like crap all week until weekends, where I felt a little bit more alive, and had Monday blue again. \u200bI lost my goal. I lost my emotions and I lost my sparks. Now that I can see things clearer, I know what really matters to me. And I become more focused and determined to follow my own path. I become happier This is undeniable. I care about how I feel, I choose to do things that make me feel good, and I choose to feel good no matter how the situation is. \u200bI realize I can be a happy person if I just stop making myself miserable and be a victim of life. The surprise outcome After you just stop giving a crap about how people think or feel about you, you think they would hate you? Because I was afraid the same thing. I wanted to blend in because of that. Maybe the fear of being an outcast and looking like a pathetic loner was the reason I was so concerned about my impression on other people. Here\u2019s the irony. They\u2019ll like you even more than when you are a people-person. People want to hear my opinion Because they know I will be honest. Even though sometimes they will not like what they hear, but they know they need that. And they seek for my opinions. They respect me more and take my words into consideration. \u200bSome people consider me as their role model and ask for my advice You know the admiration you have for someone being so cool and fearless? I am that someone now. People want me to involve in their groups and their conversations. They listen to me speaking and tell jokes. \u200bSome people even consider me as their role model, they come to me for advice and my response is to listen to their hearts. Being true to yourself is the nicest thing you could do to your soul Let me tell you a secret. Your soul is your best friend. Who has been with you through all ups and downs no matter what? Who has been there for you every time you need? Who has been there for you since day one? Yourself. Your inner self. Your soul. No one else. Not all the people you want to impress. Not even your loved ones. Just you. And there is only one thing she wants. You. So stop being someone else. Give her what she wants. Give her yourself. Your true self. Once you totally surrender to your soul, you will soon realize everything has been in the right place the whole time. And you are the one that keeps trying to mess it up. When you are yourself, there is no hiding, no suffering, and no regret. So what are you waiting for? Peel off your masks and find yourself again. Now. ",

            "answer_text": "This is re-posted from my blog at Gateway of Infinite Pathways  52. BUILDING CONFIDENCE  There was a time, not so long ago, when believing in myself was limited to knowing I could drink a fifth of vodka and then eat a whole extra-large pizza in one sitting. My skills were as dull as a marshmallow and my drive was limited to wherever the closest liquor store was.  I placed no value on my existence, nor did anyone else. It was as if I were incarcerated, doomed to watch the world pass me by through the bars of my little window. To be honest, I was jealous of those who seemed to flow through their days with focus, determination, and purpose. Their attitude was one of self-respect, fortitude, and dedication;  while mine was one of lack, self-destruction, and selfishness. I wanted more than anything to possess what seemed unreachable. Through practice, patience, and effort I was able to nail down the following definition of success and fulfillment. I believe above all other (material) pursuits, beyond money, power, and fame there sits at the top of the mountain, confidence.  Once possessed nothing else is needed. This elusive quality is the elixir of manifestation. It moves in grace, planning its strategy while embracing the moment, knowing what it wants without ignoring the audience. It does not seek to improve its image by boasting or advertising.  It is quiet, calm, and aware. It does not complain, nor does it ridicule. It gives credit and takes little. When this behavior is attempted by those who don\u2019t understand how it must be carefully developed, it comes across as cockiness, and this of course, is the way of oblivion. Here is the equation- Cockiness wants admiration for its \u201cabilities\u201d without being asked to provide actions or a history to back them up. Its modus operandi is recognition and approval. It prefers the sales pitch over the product. Confidence, on the other hand,  wants to take action, thereby allowing it a chance to build a list of achievements. It needs no recognition from others and cares not for trophies. It prefers the product over the sales pitch.  Cockiness lives in a state of reactiveness, it plays the antagonist. Confidence is about moving through life proactively and it plays the ally. Cockiness is quick to point out what needs fixed and is easily insulted, which means it\u2019s reactions are mostly of a mistrusting, defensive nature. Confidence is quick to complement and willing to help, which means it\u2019s actions are mostly trusting and cooperative. How many seek the self-assured life  but  settle  for its adversary?  I certainly have on many occasions, especially when I was a young man. It\u2019s easy to understand the temptation of trying to impress others without having to provide evidence. Shortcuts have an appeal, but rarely do they yield reward. The \u201creward\u201d in this case is the journey, nothing else. It\u2019s like trying to convince someone you\u2019re a bodybuilder without having the muscles to prove it. It sounds funny, but this type behavior is overwhelmingly common. All I can share is what I know so far. Most of what I\u2019ve picked up over the years comes from mimicking the patterns of those who already possess what I want. Here is a list of twelve bullet points that might help. It\u2019s not professional, it\u2019s just my opinion.  Don\u2019t ask others to believe in you; believe in yourself.Make a list of values and ethics that will force you expect more from yourself than others will ever expect from you.Moving or thinking somewhat slower allows for more calculated actions and responses. It will appear to observers that there\u2019s a dedicated mind  behind the process; which there is.Be quick to admit fault. This removes the temptation to blame.Be quick to admit defeat. This creates partners instead of rivals.Be quick to offer praise, be hesitant to express dissatisfaction.Shine a light on the past to sell the future. Nothing beats a track record.Avoid anger, frustration, and resentment. Remember, \u201cHe who walks away from confrontation with the lowest blood pressure, wins.\u201dThe only punishment allowed for \u201cfailure\u201d is to keep going with a new strategy. Repeating old tactics isn\u2019t permitted.DO NOT hesitate to ask for both help and criticism from those who are better than you.Say \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d a lot without embellishment. I.E.- Do you want to eat out tonight? No. Would you be willing to help me next Thursday? Yes.Strive to become better than you were yesterday. The only person you are allowed to compete with is who you were.Am I always confidant? No. I am, however, much more than practiced I used to be, and I expect this skill will increase with continued awareness. Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t  \u201cbreak\u201d at least some of these rules and end up paying instantly for my ignorance. At least I am also confident that by action I\u2019m quite capable of demonstrating what NOT to do. ",
