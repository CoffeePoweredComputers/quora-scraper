            "answer_text": " You have 4 faces: the one you show the public, the one you show your friends and family, the one only you know, the one that even you don\u2019t know existsWant a new personality? Learn a new language. Two, if you want two new personalities etceteraThe Myers-Briggs test is overrated. Changing certain mannerisms influenced my results quite a lot. It\u2019s like saying one month we\u2019re an INTJ, and six months down the road we\u2019ve become an ENFPThe \u201cIntrovert\u201d and \u201cExtrovert\u201d label represent opposite ends of the spectrum. No one is truly 100% introvert or 100% extrovert. You\u2019re likely somewhere down the middle, leaning to either side.During a presentation, to capture your audience\u2019s attention: begin with a story. People love stories and novelty but hate statistics and figures.\u201cDopamine addiction\u201d is the reason for lack of productivity and laziness. Another term for this is \u201cinstant gratification\u201dYou only have 7 seconds to convince someone that you\u2019re the right dude. Make a bad impression and they\u2019ll view even all your great attributes thereafter in a negative light.Watching stand-up comedy before a stressful activity greatly improves your performanceWalking into a room thinking everyone likes you makes you instantly more confidentTrying hard to sound smart has the opposite effectPeople are lazy and will follow the norm. Bottomline? To persuade someone, say \u201ceverybody does it\u201dUsing the word \u201cBecause\u201d instantly helps your message become more persuasive.Using social scripts like \u201cHow\u2019s work?\u201d or \u201cWeather\u2019s great, yeah?\u201d is generic and makes you sound boringFail confidently. If you\u2019re not sure about the answer, say it confidently anyway. Even if you get it wrong, people will have more confidence in you than a dude who stuttered his way through but got it rightIf a person is staring at you, look at their feet. This makes them strangely uncomfortableTelling someone to \u201cdo your best\u201d is counterproductive. Instruct them to set a goal instead. A study conducted showed that participants that aimed for a specific number of sit-ups performed, on average, better than their non-goal counterparts that were told to \u201cdo your best\u201dHaving a Plan B means you have a higher likelihood of failing Plan A. If you have a Plan C all the way to Plan Z, your Plan A is definitely gonna fail.If you want to impress people, shut the fuck up about your achievements. No, really. If they find out naturally, the \u201cwow\u201d impact would be much stronger. Talking about them looks as if you\u2019re vying for their approval, while keeping quiet about it shows a person secure in himselfNot mirroring a person\u2019s body language is an easy way to make the other party feel slightly uncomfortable. So do the opposite, duhDon\u2019t offer to pay your friend\u2019s mom for preparing a sumptuous dinner, even if you felt grateful, unless you don\u2019t want to be invited over ever again. Paying for an act of kindness is insulting.People want to be heard. Letting them talk about themselves and listening intently to them will make them absolutely love conversing with youNothing is ever with no strings attached. Expect to be guilt tripped in the future. \u201cHey remember the time I lent you my phone? Yeah I need a favour\u201d \u201cBut you told me I didn\u2019t need to\u201dIf you know that someone at work is gonna try and confront you during a conference, sit right next to them. They\u2019ll be far less aggressive.If you\u2019re not satisfied with an answer a person gave you, remain silent and keep eye contact. They\u2019ll likely start talking more and reveal further detailsIf you want to get someone on your side, kill them with kindness. People who pissed you off expect harsh treatment, but if instead, you gave them the opposite of what they were expecting, they\u2019ll feel grateful and thus indebted to you. This is how some leaders develop loyalty among their subordinates.",

            "answer_text": "Over the years I've ran into a lot of psychological facts, but so far, these have been my absolute favorites: People with large signatures usually have large self esteem.It\u2019s possible to die from a heart break.People with small handwriting are usually less open to conversations.Smart people mostly have rough handwritings.A lot of us suffer from \u2018Phantom Vibration Syndrome'; the feeling that your phone is vibrating while it actually isn't.People who are easily distracted usually have a high IQ.Talking with women can improve a man\u2019s mental strength.It only takes about four minutes to fall in love.10% of the worlds population is left-handed.People who give excellent advice usually have the most problems; likewise, people who have been hurt the most usually have the best ability to heal.Eating chocolate helps reduce stress.Insecure people are prone to hating people that they barely know.The type of music you listen to affects your perception of the world.Tilting your head while looking up makes you look more sexually attractive to others.Mostly when a person cries, if the first tear drops from the right eye, it\u2019s happiness; if it\u2019s from the left eye, it\u2019s pain.Over 90% of pretty girls usually end up being single, because most men think they are definitely taken.Contrary to most beliefs, our emotion doesn't affect the way we talk, but the way we talk does affect our emotions.Women have twice as many pain receptors than men, and they have higher pain tolerance.The feeling of pain and loneliness are processed in the same part of the brain.A research states, \u201cGirls love their besties more than their boyfriends.\u201d Wow.When you talk a lot about your goals, it becomes less likely that you'll succeed because you'll lose motivation.We can control our dreams.You can only remember 3\u20134 things at a time.The default way we imagine objects is from above and tilted like this (below) Memories become distorted with time, everyone has at least one false memory they believe is real.Here are some body languages and psychological tricks that you might find interesting: The feet don't lie  When you approach a person or group of people, try to notice if they turn their feet's towards you. If they do, then you're welcome. If they don't, well, keep moving Bob. The Ask  If you want somebody to like you, ask them for a favor; it can be as little as borrowing a pen or asking for the time. They will feel that they have made an investment in you, and hence, they'll be more open to you. The Nod  When you nod your head while speaking, you tend to encourage the other person listening to mirror the gesture and agree with what your saying. The Laugh  When you're in a group of people and someone says something funny and everybody starts laughing, try to notice who's looking at you while laughing. People tend to look at the person they feel closest to when they laugh. The Shoes  When in a public place, if someone keeps looking at you so much it\u2019s becoming frustrating, just look at their shoes\u2026like, for a long time; this will make them feel so uncomfortable, they'll probably back off. Bonus trick  If you get pulled over by a cop and he asks if you know how fast you were going, say \u201cI don't know, but you must have been going faster if you caught up to me.\u201d This will cause him to have an existential crisis, giving you a chance to escape.
