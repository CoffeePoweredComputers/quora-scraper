            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t necessarily bad to kill millions of people if they threaten your survival, liberty, or you way of life. It has been done many times with the approval of societies, nations, religions, etc. \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d has many qualifications and exceptions. It is not bad to kill millions of cows because humans have to eat something. The alternatives to eating cows are no improvement, even for cows. Cows would go extinct if they weren\u2019t a human food source. The nauseating aspect of it is that there are almost 8 billion people, and several billion of them eat cows rather than something else. That\u2019s a lot of mass commercial killing of cows. And, the handling of it can be one more nauseating aspect of too damned many humans. But, suppose we let the domestic cow go extinct and plant all the cow pastures in vegetables. What do we to do about all the birds, rodents, insects, and some mammals that will want to eat our vegetables? It would be very kind to share with them. And, the more we share, the more of them there will be. You wouldn\u2019t want to end up having to kill a few million of them, would you? And, what would you do with all that meat, if you didn\u2019t eat it? On the other hand, those cow pastures support a great deal of wildlife, in addition to being self sustaining, and providing other environmental benefits. Furthermore, many ranchers and farmers are learning ways to deal with livestock predators, other than trying to wipe out entire species. Face it. If you are a human you are, by nature and necessity, a killer. Something is going to die in order for you to live, one way or another. Be grateful that you are one of nature\u2019s killers rather than one of it\u2019s killees. But, humans can be humane, and minimize their killing to that which is expedient and necessary. If you want to feel realistic empathy for non-human animals, pity those that are being robbed of their real estate by expanding human populations. Those that are being starved because they are cut off from their food supply. Those that are being poisoned by human waste products. Those species that are going extinct because they no longer have a place to live and breed. Don\u2019t waste much sympathy on a cow. A typical beef cow gets a couple years of a stress free, well fed and cared for, life before it is humanely euthanized. That probably beats the shit out of a typical wild animal\u2019s life and death experience. If cows could be housebroken and taught not to step on children, perhaps we could make pets of them like dogs and cats. Unfortunately, they evolved as ungulates, prey animals (their natural reason for existence is to be a food source for other animals). They lost the riding and working competition to the horse. You can blame that on nature, or your God. There is nothing I can do about it except opt for chicken, or try not to overcook my steak. And, I feel about the same amount of guilt that I would probably feel about killing a human to prevent that human from killing me. I have not yet evolved past being a biological creature. I must eat and consequently the cow must die. I\u2019m not going to feed the beast while I starve. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 it\u2019s all about morality, isn\u2019t it? Humans invent their own moralities. There is nothing immoral about eating a natural, normal diet\u2026 and humans eat cows. My ancestors have eaten meat as long as they have been human beings. Science has some pretty good evidence that human intelligence got a real boost when we began to use fire to cook food, and particularly meat, making it more digestible. So there is nothing immoral about eating meat, or killing, in order to keep yourself alive and healthy. It is the way the earth has evolved to work. So how about the morality in killing humans. Well\u2026 that is an invented morality too. There have been plenty of societies in the past that used humans for sacrificial purposes in religious practices. In some societies the victims were volunteers, and they were treated with respect and were even envied. Humans choose their moralities. I choose to eat cow because it is part of a healthy diet. I don\u2019t kill humans because it is unnecessary and I have been brought up thinking it is wrong. But there are circumstances where I would see it as the best alternative. I don\u2019t agonize over moralities. I don\u2019t overcomplicate my life. I have enough to do. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a moral distinction most of us have chosen to make. Cattle, chickens, pigs and fish got the shitty end of the stick, while horses, dogs, cats, and dolphins at the far better end of it (or so I\u2019d argue), with human beings getting to hold the stick. You can call it arbitrary, and it is. So is the distinction between having sex with a 20-YO, and a 10-YO. Do you also protest THAT choice between what is good and what is bad? If you do, you\u2019ll have to convince the vast majority of us, who are absolutely on-board with it. ",

If we didn\u2019t think it so, then we\u2019d die out as an evolutionary dead end. So, if your conscience wants you to kill millions of humans, then go ahead, I\u2019m personally not going to stop you. You\u2019ll probably get stopped by other people who don\u2019t want you to do that though. ",

I once saw a Steer impale itself on a broken rail gate just because it was too stupid to back up. All the way through. We had to put it down and turn it into dog food.
