            "answer_text": "Well as a Republican I\u2019m going to go ahead and say it. If you think that Liberalism is a Disease.. Then you most likely have a Actual Mental Disorder. Because of coarse its not. First off liberalism is pretty broad. the Current American Conservative movement would have at some point.. been considered liberalism. You believe in Elections? Well Guess what.. Some people would call you a liberal for that. Washington and all the other founding fathers\u2026 called liberals. _ Yes there are stupid Liberals\u2026 There are also stupid conservatives. (And the moment WAY more stupid Conservatives) But that\u2019s just at the moment. Its swings back and forth quite a lot.  Using another great example. The Last really universally liked Republican POTUS (No not Reagan, I said universally) I\u2019m speaking of Eisenhower\u2026 Ya he\u2019s called a Liberal by a good part of the governing body of the GOP. (Actually so is Reagan) ",

            "answer_text": "A disease is defined as something that, if without medical intervention, will cause death. So, clearly, liberalism is not diseases. Liberalism and conservatism are political belief systems based on how people were brought up, where they brought up and what they have learned from various outlets in their lives. Some people change their political views when they get older. Sometimes drastically. Hillary Clinton was a Republican when she first got involved in politics in college, for example. ",
