            "answer_text": "Individual existence is quite possible but may not yield the same results that a group would. You may only exist but may not be able to perform to the best of your abilities due to the very fact that you would be personally required to do all the things all the time. On the other hand, a group mentality would ensure that tasks are distributed and the best person is assigned to each individual task. Thus jobs get done quicker and in a better fashion. ",
