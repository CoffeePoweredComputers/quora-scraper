            "answer_text": "There are two distinct types of direct realism in classical and historical philosophy. If you were an empiricist, believing knowledge only comes from your senses, then direct realism means that you directly perceive your senses and the world through those senses. Aristotle was the last major direct sense realist in this sense, although Searle\u2019s common sense realism is sometimes interpreted this way. Almost nobody was a direct sense realist after considering the role of the mind in shaping senses into coherent perceptions. We infer sensations indirectly from our perceptions and experiments, creating a biological picture of how our bodies work to present the world to us, all very indirectly, highly filtered by the brain, and from a uniquely subjective point of view. The methods of science have evolved to attempt to reduce the amount of subjectivity, accounting for the processing factors, and using reason to infer entities beyond our direct experience of them. If sensation were directly perceived, we would have no need for scientific methods. The other sense of realism is the rationalist sense. Historically, you were considered a rationalist if you believed that we have knowledge of things not perceived through the senses. Typically, those things were thought to be innate and directly perceived by the mind. They might be considered just structures the mind uses to organize perception, or they might be considered universal aspects of the way the world is structured of which the mind is a part which can perceive universal structures. While a few have tried to be indirect realists about these things, typically those like Quine who believed logical and mathematical entities are inferred from sense experience, indirect realism about rational entities has never real gained traction in philosophy. So, historically, it usually depends on whether one is an empiricist or a rationalist. If you are an empiricist, you are most likely an indirect realist. If you are a rationalist, you are most likely a direct realist. There is also a third option. You might think that some belief is empirical and some is rational, and that you need both sorts of beliefs for a good majority of knowledge. In order to make any inference from some hypothesis, experiment, to a conclusion, you need some sort of inferential structure and, most likely, some mathematical entities. But those rational structures aren\u2019t sufficient to gather the data and fill out the content of your experiment. For that, you need some sort of sensation or other method for observation and measurement. So a more fine grained view might maintain a direct realism about the rational components of knowledge and indirect realism about the empirical components. We might further analyze the indirect aspects of empirical perception as being identical with the rational aspects, at which point, the distinction between indirect and direct realism seems fruitless. The distinction itself is entirely historical dependent on a division between rationalists and empiricists, a division no longer necessary to make. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the other way around: indirect realism is no longer viable, only direct realism. Indirect realism is just Plato: the idea that there is a hidden world of the Ideals or Forms, and we have access only to imperfect shadows of this hidden reality. Thus: metaphysics\u2014the idea that from these shadows we should try and construct an image of this hidden reality. But ipso facto, there was never any evidence that such a reality exists, other than The philosopher of the Enlightenment, Kant, pointed out we never have access to things-in-themselves, only to our perceptions of things. Husserl built on this to suggest that it was phenomena (things as perceived) which were in fact foundational. Empiricism too, posited experience as foundational. The positivist moved to get rid of anything that didn\u2019t have an operational test for its existence. Moves like these led to the \u201cdeath of metaphysics\u201d: the end of this Platonic idea of a hidden reality casting shadows\u2014or creating sense impressions, or whatever. I think of it as being like the death of the aether in physics. Light was a wave, waves required a medium, hence the aether was born. After a while, people realised that the aether wasn\u2019t actually doing anything, and a better physics could be constructed by forgetting any supposed medium, and just dealing with the waves qua waves. Hence, the supposed substructure (aether or metaphysics) theorised in order to prop up observable reality (waves or experience) came to be seen as unnecessary: surplus to any practical requirement. When I think of Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Rorty, Maturana, or J J Gibson, I see workers describing the world-as-experienced, without constructing invisible armatures to hold it up. ",
