Limiting online gaming access is very crucial, but always put in mind that you can never coerce or force your child; not if you expect to have an open relationship and you don\u2018t want them to rush into those negative behaviours right when they get into college. While many parents use parental internet filters and software, that alone cannot be used in online gaming. What\u2019s really effective is grabbing the attention as well as the interest of the child or teen. For instance, make up some activities that he likes such as going fishing or hiking. In this way, you get to grab his interest and away from online gaming. In fact, the American Academy of Paediatrics strongly recommends that children and teens need not spend more than two hours per day in front of a television or computer. As long as you\u2019re able to provide him other forms of entertainment and fun, he will give up his online gaming addiction. Do the best you can in providing him the care and attention he needs. That\u2019s part of the reason why teens resort to escapism online; they don\u2019t have anyone to talk or socialize with them. Chatting and encouraging them to make friends with neighbours or do some community help will aid them in realizing that mingling with people in the real world can also be fun and much more fulfilling.   Yes to... Outside games are often much louder and more energetic, allowing children to gain important physical skills and because there is usually less direction from adults, children learn skills such as negotiation and compromise. For example, getting children to build a sandcastle allows them to learn how to co-operate and work together to achieve something. When playing outdoors, a child is also exposed to completely different textures, sounds and smells which they would not otherwise experience indoors. They are often allowed more freedom to explore and discover things for themselves, building their independence and their confidence.  The playground at school is the perfect environment for learning these skills and gives children an allotted amount of time each day to let off some steam and interact with others. This highlights the importance for stimulating outdoor playground equipment. The equipment children use both individually and as part of a group activity, can be extremely beneficial in their development. For example using musical playground equipment can teach a child co-ordination and rhythm simply through dancing along to the music and playing the instruments. ",

            "answer_text": "One word: Misinformation. I come from the days when the internet was a series of UUCP feeds via the FIDO Network and 2400 Baud Modems. BBS's were almost the only way to communicate and phone calls were expensive. Most users were academics. The cost of calls meant that people were economical in their comms and stuck to what they were passionate about. We had flame wars, but for the most part the level of factual truth was high. We looked forward to the day when the net would be universally available, imagining a new age of enlightenment and knowledge.  Then came the www. That abbreviation was the first sign of silliness. Double U x 3? Nine syllables? World Wide Web was three syllables! People instantly grouped themselves into tribes and reinforced each others' prejudices. In a magnificent sea of knowledge, there erupted hills of hogwash, fiefdoms of fallacies and mountains of misinformation,. \"I saw it on the net\" was no longer a guarantee of fact or truth. It only takes a few clicks to fact check - there are even browser extensions that have been developed for the purpose, sites and groups that debunk etc, yet many people choose to mindlessly share complete hoaxes that validate and spread ignorance. The only benefit of this process is that it becomes obvious where the most lack of knowledge lies. Even Quora attempts to deal with this. I fervently hope this is a transitional stage and that the truth will slowly win, but there are no guarantees. Formal education is meant to give you the tools to approach life as a permanent learning process - the net is a perfect tool for that, but only if it is consciously used for the purpose of learning.
