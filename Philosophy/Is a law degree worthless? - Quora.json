            "answer_text": "Is a law degree worthless? Some are, but not all. First of all, there are over 200 sovereign jurisdictions in the world, and a law degree from a prestigious institution in one jurisdiction is of limited value in another jurisdiction. Within the context of the United States, there are some 205 law schools accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). Of those schools, there are about 50 where almost everyone graduates and where almost everyone passes at least one bar exam, and about 15 where anyone who graduates, passes a bar exam, and wants a job as a lawyer can get one. Beyond that, students who do well in the top 100 law schools usually pass the bar exam and find work as a lawyer. There are also a significant number of other job opportunities for people with law degrees. In striking contrast, a significant number of people do not finish law school, and a significant number of people who finish law school in the United States do so at a law school that is not ABA accredited and/or not highly ranked. Their chances of passing a bar exam or finding work as a lawyer are pretty remote, with some noteworthy exceptions. What they end up with is a future mortgaged by student loans and the poverty caused by not pursuing a more practical educational or career goal. Indeed, even those people who go to a highly ranked law school and/or do well in law school are often saddled with student debt for a significant portion of their lives, a state of affairs that affects their choice of jobs, and decisions about getting married, having children, etc. I might add that working as a lawyer is not all it's cracked up to be. Many of the people you encounter as clients are hostile and projecting all the blame on you for problems that they created. Even when your clients are cooperative and follow your advice, the legal system leaves most people worse off than they were. Indeed, nothing is worse than representing someone who is truly innocent of any wrongdoing and/or has a legitimate complaint against a bad actor. That is to say, innocent people often go to jail, and victims are seldom made whole. Seeing this injustice every single day takes a psychic toll. ",

            "answer_text": "I start a lot of my classes off by telling my students: Going to law school isn\u2019t inherently a bad decision, but there are a lot of people each year who make a bad decision when they go to law school. You\u2019re asking a very specific question - is a law degree worth it. I\u2019m going to answer that from a strict dollars-and-cents perspective, instead of in the \u201cexperience/personal growth\u201d sense, since there are much less expensive and more efficient ways to gain that, outside of the qualification to be a lawyer. Law school is a professional school. It trains you to be a lawyer. It qualifies you to be a lawyer. It\u2019s the only thing that does so (outside of some states with apprenticeship programs that tend to not be worth it - going to law school is much more efficient and likely to result in a job). If you don\u2019t want to be a lawyer, then it\u2019s very unlikely that a $200k+ degree that takes three years will be worth it. While there are jobs that would look positively on a candidate with a JD that aren\u2019t lawyer, they\u2019re few and far between. Despite what some say, it\u2019s not a degree that you should get with a view towards it being versatile. It\u2019s a degree you get to become a lawyer. If you do want to be a lawyer, then the math becomes a bit harder. You have to factor in what you\u2019d earn at the job you\u2019d have without the degree, figure out your likely income after law school (hint: don\u2019t expect that six-figure outcome that a minority of law students earn, unless you want to work in BigLaw and are at a top school), and see if the tuition you\u2019d pay and the student loans you\u2019d need to pay back (interest\u2026don\u2019t forget the interest) will balance out. Outside of that, there\u2019s a cost to having six-figure debt. That weighs on you (yes, I know, I said this would be strict dollars-and-cents\u2026but this can\u2019t be ignored). Being stuck in a job that pays well but you hate because you need to be able to afford these student loans weighs on you. A law degree can open up a lucrative career path. It can also lead to crushing student loan debt with few options to pay it back. Look at the career outcomes for students from the school(s) you\u2019re considering (this is my favorite resource for that), consider the amount of tuition you\u2019d be paying, and see if it balances out.
