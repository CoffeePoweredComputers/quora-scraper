            "answer_text": "The appearance of Haley\u2019s comet: According to Wikipedia: During its 1986 apparition, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's \"dirty snowball\" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices\u2014such as water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia\u2014and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy. [Below not from wikipedia] The film ET about a friendly visiting alien was still fresh in people\u2019s minds so there was hope water ice found on comets or similar discoveries would somehow eventually lead to the discovery of friendly alien life. However, this was balanced with Aliens (2) another film released that year that depicted an alien busting out of someone\u2019s chest with blood and gore and a woman fighting frightening aliens with a gigantic flamethrower and machine guns.
