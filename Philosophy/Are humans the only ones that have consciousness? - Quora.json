            "answer_text": "Are humans the only ones that have consciousness? Famously, the only thing I can know for sure\u2014with 100%, absolute certainty\u2014is that I am conscious. I might be in the Matrix or deceived by an evil demon, the world might be a simulation or illusion, I might be a brain in a vat with no real body, I might be a simulation myself\u2026but at least I\u2019m a conscious simulation, if so, since experiencing the sense of pondering the issue itself is necessarily a conscious experience.  Philosophers like to define consciousness in terms of being able to have subjective experiences, about there being at least in principle an answer (not necessarily attainable  to even in principle) to the question of \u201cWhat would it feel like to be\u2026?\u201d They also have a concept known as a philosophical zombie, which is (what appears to be) a person, and responds in every way like a person, but has no subjective experiences and therefore isn't conscious. And although by definition I know that I\u2019m not a zombie, I can\u2019t absolutely prove that anyone else is not a zombie. I could be the only conscious entity. But of course I can\u2019t go around acting as though that were all true. It\u2019s a worthless hypothesis in practice (though not in philosophy), because it\u2019s unfalsifiable. But it does tell me that I have to use inference and induction to assess consciousness, in other people as well as other animals.  So: I look at other people and observe that they appear to be like me in almost every salient way, and that they act in ways that so far as I know, I myself could only do by involving my consciousness. Thus, I infer that other people are probably similar to myself in the consciousness department. I further look at other mammals, like my dog, and see very similar things. He\u2019s made of flesh and bone like me, and has a mammalian brain like mine; a bit different, but fundamentally of a similar structure, albeit a bit simpler. He exhibits behaviours that seem like things that I would do consciously, like expectation and anticipation, and makes complex decisions (compared to dead matter, or things that appear unconscious, such as plants). He\u2019s probably conscious too\u2014although his consciousness, like his brain, is probably a bit simpler than mine. And so I extrapolate, and infer that chimpanzees, crows, parrots, elephants, and dolphins probably have quite complex consciousness, while mice and wallabies and lizards are simpler.  There are some animals that I really don\u2019t know if they are conscious or not, but this doesn\u2019t trouble me so much because I\u2019ve already established that it\u2019s not a binary proposition, but a continuum. Is a frog conscious? It has a brain, and it has behaviours, and it can probably learn to some extent; but on the other hand, some of its behaviours allegedly continue unchanged even if its head is cut off, so quite a lot of what it does is presumably unconscious, since as far as I can tell, things without brains don\u2019t demonstrate consciousness. Insects and arachnids probably have quite a low degree of consciousness, while C. elegans, with 302 cells in its nervous system, is probably too simple to have any conscious experiences. Animals that simple, and bacteria, and plants, and so forth, may have responses to stimuli, but I do not think that it can qualify as consciousness. Every process that I recognise as conscious in myself is quite complex and seems to involve intentional stances and reflexive processes; what is consciousness, what is subjective experience, if not reflecting on one\u2019s stimuli and responses? There seems to be no machinery in C. elegans capable of doing this. It probably can\u2019t.  Computers are not conscious, though I don\u2019t see any reason why in principle they couldn\u2019t be. Indeed, if you could yank an ancient philosopher into the present day, I think we should forgive him for inferring that a computer does not have at least some rudimentary consciousness, given how complex are the behaviours they can exhibit. But complexity isn\u2019t enough; merely being complex does not necessarily imply that something has conscious experience, and while the ancient philosopher might not know where all the complexity in a computer comes from, I do know, and I think that all its operations are too specialised to qualify. In principle, I expect that a computer program could be conscious; in practice, as of right now, they just aren\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Are humans the only ones that have consciousness? I do not understand why this is made out to be a confusing, mysterious, \"we don't know\" type of question.  Consciousness is the state of being aware. In order for us to perceive what is around us and how to interact with it, we must be consciously aware. Animals are conscious. If you do not realize this, you don't realize that humans are animals too. It is said that we come directly from baboons.  How many times have you seen a dog yelp from pain? How many times have you witnessed a bird being trained to talk? I am assuming that you know plants respond to the light of the sun when they lean towards it or close their buds when it's dark and cold. They cannot do this without being aware. Or what about this?  \u200b \u200b  \u200b\u200bThe venus fly trap. They are aware of their prey, will count the number of prey, and eat them.   Does that look like the product of an insect that is not aware of what it's doing? Humans are not special in the superiority sense. Keep thinking we are the only ones experiencing and witnessing the universe and that it was built just for us. Update: I was informed that spiders are not insects. They are in fact called Arachnids.  \" Scorpions, mites, and ticks are also part of the arachnid family. Arachnids are creatures with two body segments, eight legs, no wings or antennae and are not able to chew. Many people think that spiders are insects but they are mistaken since insects have six legs and three main body parts. Most insects have wings.\" My sincere apologies for any confusion this may have caused. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define consciousness. If your definition of consciousness includes subjective experience, then it is impossible to know if other animals, plants and even inanimate objects have consciousness. This is because there is no objective method for measuring subjective experience. We do not witness the subjective experience of other people, animals, plants and things. All we see is behavior. So if you define consciousness in terms of externally observable behavior, then it's relatively easy to claim that all living beings are conscious. Some people even think that the whole planet or the whole universe is conscious. This position is called panpsychism.  Many people seem to want to draw a dividing line between conscious and non-conscious entities. For example, some people only include humans. Others include only humans and \"higher\" animals. Others include everything except plants. If your intuition leads you to the idea of a dividing line, then you can \"work backwards\", coming up with a definition of consciousness that gives you the desired split between 'conscious' and 'non-conscious'. For example, philosophers who say that machines, plants or \"simple\" animals are not conscious define consciousness in a way that requires a \"sufficiently\" brain-like or neural structure controlling behavior. Philosophers who argue that everything is conscious might define consciousness in terms of something abstract, like \"integrated information\".  ",

            "answer_text": "Are humans the only ones that have consciousness? No. According to the very best minds of western philosophy (David Hume, Adam Smith, and Arthur Schopenhauer) animals have the same basic consciousness as humans. The below from Schopenhauer is, with Hume\u2019s ideas expressed in \u201cOf the reason of animals\u201d, perfectly compatible with evolution: \u201cConsciousness is positively only known to us as a property of animal nature; therefore we must not, and indeed cannot, think of it otherwise than as animal consciousness, so that this expression is tautological. Now, that which in every animal consciousness, even the most imperfect and the weakest, is always present, nay, lies at its foundation, is an immediate sense of longing, and of the alternate satisfaction and non-satisfaction of it, in very different degrees. This we know to a certain extent a priori. For marvellously different as the innumerable species of animals are, and strange as some new form, never seen before, appears to us, we yet assume beforehand its inmost nature, with perfect certainty, as well known, and indeed fully confided to us. We know that the animal wills, indeed also what it wills, existence, well-being, life, and propagation; [pg 415] and since in this we presuppose with perfect certainty identity with us, we do not hesitate to attribute to it unchanged all the affections of will which we know in ourselves, and speak at once of its desire, aversion, fear, anger, hatred, love, joy, sorrow, longing, &c. On the other hand, whenever phenomena of mere knowledge come to be spoken of we fall at once into uncertainty. We do not venture to say that the animal conceives, thinks, judges, knows: we only attribute to it with certainty ideas in general; because without them its will could not have those emotions referred to above. But with regard to the definite manner of knowing of the brutes and the precise limits of it in a given species, we have only indefinite conceptions, and make conjectures. Hence our understanding with them is also often difficult, and is only brought about by skill, in consequence of experience and practice. Here then lie distinctions of consciousness. On the other hand, a longing, desiring, wishing, or a detesting, shunning, and not wishing, is proper to every consciousness: man has it in common with the polyp.\u201d Excerpt From: Arthur Schopenhauer. \u201cThe World as Will and Idea (Vol. 2 of 3).\u201d iBooks. There is too much to discuss here. It is interesting that Hume said we know animals have a basic consciousness by probable reason and Schopenhauer says it is known \u201cto a certain extent a priori\u201d. The most interesting thing is the idea that animals must have certain basic ideas or they couldn't have the animal emotions. Dobzhansky had to be proud of Schopenhauer for being so compatible with evolution. And just think he said this before Darwin published his ideas. ",

Therefore, when atoms form into molecules and molecules into cells and cells into multicellular organisms, at some point the entity will become complex enough to manifest its intrinsic consciousness. The Quantum Theoretician  This group of individuals believe that consciousness can change the outcome of the micro, so why not the macro? The Double-slit experiment seems to indicate the validity such a statement has. Therefore, given this argument, one can easily imply that all things are at least somewhat conscious. Otherwise, nothing would occur. The Spiritualist   The spiritualists, in my opinion, fancy both of these ideas. They say that consciousness in intrinsic to energy itself and that one can manipulate outcomes with that consciousness. They use as frames of reference: The Bhagavad-GitaThe New TestamentThe BuddhaPatanjaliYogaEtcPersonally, I hold this last belief. Not because \"Well there's missing information, so it must be so!\" Absolutely not. Years of research, inward and outward, go into my belief on this matter. So, ultimately, the answer to your question is: No. The debate is: Why not, how and to what extent? ",

Many people believe that their pets are \"pleased to see them\" and \"have a personality\" or various other anthropomorphisms,  but how much of that is us projecting our own ideas of consciousness onto a cat? Is there a test I can run on my cat (King Ethelred IV) to either prove or disprove that he is conscious? And finally, can I prove that you, dear questioner, have a consciousness? The answer is \"no\", for a formal logical \"proof\" - however I can gather observational data that shows that you are either conscious, a robot that behaves almost exactly like a conscious person, or a figment of my imagination - however I can never prove any of those statements wrong. So with that in mind, I'm going to stop there - I refuse to answer questions that might have been asked by my own subconsciousness!  ",

            "answer_text": "One of the difficulties here, I think, is that we, as individuals, are interpreting the term \"consciousness\" by different standards and from different perspectives. There is not likely then to be any consensus reached. It is likely of importance to note that the question as phrased does not specify \"human consciousness\" or even \"human-like consciousness\" for that matter. So perhaps we can agree that there are different kinds of consciousness as well as different degrees. It might well be asked whether these different kinds of consciousness share anything in common? I would suggest that they do and that what is shared can be conceived of as \"information processing\". From that perspective the more appropriate question might be, \"Does anything lack consciousness?\" The DNA molecule that \"knows\" reasonably well how to reproduce a member of the species it belongs to? The cat that \"knows\" how to jump or fall from a height and land safely? The honeybee that \"knows\" how to communicate to other worker bees the direction and distance where nectar can be found? The plant that \"knows\" to turn to face the sun to allow photosynthesis to work to best advantage? The celestial bodies that tend over extended periods of time not to deviate from course? The universe that has spawned all these wondrous entities? To claim all consciousness as a trait belonging to humans alone is hubris of the most insular kind imaginable. From the perspective of the universe as a whole, human-type consciousness is not even the best and probably not the final kind - - - just a temporary test of sorts, and it too shall pass in time. Just now machine intelligence is on the rise. Best be on the lookout for the Technological singularity that some predict is on the event horizon. ",

First and foremost, we can't say one way or the other if anyone outside of our own lonely island of consciousness even exists. So, there's that. Assuming that we buy into the illusion that other people seem to have a consciousness like the one we observe through the Cartesian Theater, it's impossible to say whether that consciousness is created or received by the human brain. Moreover, there's nothing particularly special about the human brain when you break it down into its components. As such, even if we could prove that a brain is required for consciousness (which we can't), there's just no way to prove that other animals (particularly other primates and other mammals) do or don't have consciousness.

In fact ALIVENESS and INTELLIGENCE are synonymous. Consciousness is a concept that points to the ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE behind all of our perceptions. So any sign of LIFE in any biologically functional unit is conceptually a sign of consciousness. This ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE is a no-thing. That means that it is indestructible much like space.

In fact this entire cosmos, time and space are appearances or perceptions in ALIVENESS/INTELLIGENCE. This cosmos, time and space arise simultaneously with perceptions in ALIVENESS in wakefulness and sink together in deep sleep, swoon, coma and death.

The unique distinction between human consciousness and animal consciousness, is that only in the human life-form can the soul become aware of itself and God. There are four basic levels of consciousness. Anna-maya - where one is conscious of only food. The consciousness revolves around nourishment. Examples of that level of consciousness are amoebas, plants, fish, insects etc. Also humans on the infant stage, are on that level. Prana-maya is where one becomes aware of one\u2019s body. Mammals and other animals are on that stage. Here the human is a child. Jnana-maya is the level where one becomes aware of the mind. Only humans are conscious of the mind. Animals are only conscious of their body. Here, becoming conscious of the mind, the human is a teen-ager. Ananda-maya is where one is conscious of God. Again, only humans can reach that level of consciousness. Here the human is an adult. One attains the human form of life after transmigrating through 8,400,000 species by the process of gradual evolution. That human life is spoiled for those conceited fools who do not take shelter of the lotus feet of Govinda. --Brahma-vaivarta Purana Krishna says: That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings. It is especially presented in Vedanta-sutra with all reasoning as to cause and effect. \u2014Bg 13.5 Srila Prabhupada explains: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. Krishna is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Vedanta, which is accepted as authority. First He says, \"This is according to different sages.\" As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyasadeva (the author of the Vedanta-sutra) is a great sage, and in the Vedanta-sutra duality is perfectly explained. And Vyasadeva's father, Parasara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity, aham tvam ca tathanye. .. \"we -- you, I and the various other living entities -- are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.\" Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Katha Upanisad. There are many great sages who have explained this, and Parasara is considered principal among them. The word chandobhih refers to the various Vedic literatures. The Taittiriya Upanisad, for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda, describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated before, kshetra is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of ksetra-jna: the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated in the Taittiriya Upanisad (2.9), brahma puccham pratistha. There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord's energy known as anna-maya, dependence upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then, in prana-maya, after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. In jnana-maya, realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, called vijnana-maya, in which the living entity's mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is ananda-maya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which are called brahma puccham. Out of these, the first three -- anna-maya, prana-maya and jnana-maya -- involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called ananda-maya. The Vedanta-sutra also describes the Supreme by saying, ananda-mayo 'bhyasat: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vijnana-maya, prana-maya, jnana-maya and anna-maya. In the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the ananda-maya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the ananda-maya, then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in the Vedanta-sutra, or Brahma-sutra. It is mentioned here that the codes of the Brahma-sutra are very nicely arranged according to cause and effect. Some of the sutras, or aphorisms, are na viyad asruteh (2.3.2), natma sruteh (2.3.18), and parat tu tac-chruteh (2.3.40). The first aphorism indicates the field of activities, the second indicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the summum bonum among all the manifestations of various entities.

The definition of consciousness \u201c the state of being aware of and responsive to one surrounding\u201d according to Wikipedia. When a dog fears something it tries to defend itself by barking. When a tiger is hungry it reacts to its senses and hunts for its food. Humans measure and judge their environment according to themself which makes them comfortable. They do not think in the context of the animal. Same goes with life whenever a scientist tries to find life on another they think of themselves first for example if there is a planet light-year aways with extreme cold temperature it will be not suitable for human to live there but there is still life for the microorganism living there and adapt themself to that environment. That planet has still life. The same animal has conscious too but they are less consciousness than humans. To check which animal has more consciousness scientist conducts an experiment in which they keep the animal in front of the mirror. The experiment was to check do the animals identify themselves. Some animals behave like there was another animal in front of them. Some of them identify themselves as those animals where elephants chimpanzee and dolphin. Only these animals where identify themselves. So yes animal has consciousness. For plants, they have even less consciousness than the animal. ",

Only in theory yes, but not in practice. Since most of us are egotistical self-centered creatures, how can we claim to be self-aware? We act as is we are unconscious of our actions. We do not think of their consequences. So, in my opinion humans are infinitesimally more conscious than animals. But no more. ",
