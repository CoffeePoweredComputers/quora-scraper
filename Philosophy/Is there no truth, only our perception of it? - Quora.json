            "answer_text": "Not so; there is something special going on. The truth always exist in a specific context. Take blue, for instance, and the word means something else in the paint store than on the couch with the shrink. Truths that stand by themselves without contexts aren\u2019t really truth-truths. Something similar is happening with matter in the universe, if you allow me to take you out of your comfort zone. Matter has two behaviors: divergent and convergent. Divergent action for matter occurs at the largest level, the universal level. All matter is moving outwardly at that level from one another. Convergent action occurs at the \u2018local\u2019 level. A planet, for instance, has all matter converged into one mass; same for a star. Solar system and Milky Way also have convergent action, but while the dance among the masses is danced on one and the same tune, the masses will never become a single mass. Back to truths: if we declare the context (planet, star, solar system, galaxy) then we can find all kinds of truths. Undeniable truths. If we declare the context the universe, however, then there is no single basis for all, even though we can declare the action we see as outbound for all. The outbound action occurs not because of matter\u2019s nature, but despite matter\u2019s nature. Given the chance, matter will cling, it\u2019s in its nature to do so. But it can only do so with that what is found close by. The largest sustained convergent action in our universe occurs with galaxies. The largest level for a truth and its context, if you get the drift. So, yes, there are many truths. And, no, the absolute truth is only based on words like separation, outbound and diverse journeys, or what is probably the most famous truth: the only certainty is uncertainty. Even God can be seen as smaller than the largest entity in our universe: space. There is nothing greater than space, it factually being emptiness (that can get taken in by matter). Space is so much nothing that it doesn\u2019t even have borders. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you saying it is not there but we only perceive it to be illusion type of experience? I don\u2019t think you are saying that: What you are saying is that it is there, we cannot see it but we sense it and hence the mind makes an image of it. That is what we have done for centuries taken from the natural laws of the Universe and manifested into our living space. That is the relationship we have with the Cosmos. What do you mean by Truth? To me, it is a baseline infrastructure whether real or invisible which is unchanging and omnipresent and will always be what it is no matter what you try and do to it. The baseline infrastructure keeps the whole Cosmos intact and in their orbits. Some you can see as the manifested world and the others are invisible energy forms and also stable and unchanging in its infrastructure. I will go as far as saying this because of the way we perceive the Cosmos and then innovate and manifest into our cityscape that if you want to see a mirror image of one\u2019s working mind, then we only need to see the infrastructure of the cityscape. That is our mind you are looking at; our mind in the infrastructure and the working of the cityscape, including all the chaos as in the mind, especially the self-talking thinking mind. How can a chaotic mind create a peaceful environment? The cityscape is an equivalent of the thinking mind. I said it: so what are you going to do about it? Scientists are already coming to what the unseen in us and around us looks like. The energy fields. Can you see the magnetic field emanating from your mobile phone or your computer, no, until you place a meter in front of it? and perceive what it looks like. There is no Truth? what! your question: only our perception of it? NO! you actually mean it is not there and we are making it up in our minds. It saves me explaining the rest of it about the infrastructure of the Universe being a real thing. Watch this video for some thrilling insight into our future.
