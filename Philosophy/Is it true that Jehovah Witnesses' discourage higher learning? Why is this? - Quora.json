            "answer_text": "Yes. It is one of the main reasons left the group as a teen. My father even planned to pull me out of high school, where I had top grades and scores, bc he deemed I was too worldly, not obedient enough, and against the Watchtower. Witness culture is a bit strange. Yes, they are fundamentalists and conservative. But many fundamentalist groups still operate Bible colleges and even advanced degrees. There is nothing from their key doctrines, that Jesus is not God, that he is Michael, that Jehovah\u2019s name is glorified, and that the end is near that need set up such a conflict. As far as I am aware of current rules, no one is kicked out. But you can be stripped of any ministerial privileges within the Kingdom Hall. This is a huge deal for believers. It would affect men more than women bc women are allowed no ministerial status. Even the children of an elder going to college may trigger loss of privileges. You hear over and over again how much you learn as a Witness. Yes, they do encourage literacy. If you notice, the Watchtower is written at lower and lower comprehension levels. They fight modern science. Perhaps one could follow Newtons\u2019 laws. But once you get into Einstein, beware. And, of course, evolution is viewed as a grand conspiracy by science to further Satan\u2019s agenda. The Watchtower also paints a picture of college students having wild sex, doing drugs in huge qualities, and other mayhem. Some Witness teens who want to go to college arrange for a local two-year stint at a community college. You are told that you cannot follow knowledge and Jehovah. I was a Political Science major. A lot of their histories and political analysis is factually wrong. There are few safe subjects one can study. I yearned to read Shakespeare, Donne, Milton, Bob Dylan, Dostoevsky, Moliere, Camus, Sartre-the general classical literature of western thought. It was important for me to read and know it if I were going to reject it as a Witness. Almost every writer or thinker of note is not a Witness. In fact, I can think of no great Witness thought leader. But more than the awkwardness of such moments is the issue of control and indoctrination. Before Columbia University, I imagined higher education meant fact acquisition led by super bright professors. Indeed, that is a powerful element in a basic college education. My professors made us read deeply, broadly, and closely. The material must be mastered. But even more importantly was to learn critical thinking skills. I can be obsessive with my studies. It took a while before I gained the confidence to analyze the materials presented. We also learned how to research. A technique had to learn and relearn as a lawyer. If one has these skills, it becomes much harder to accept the Watchtower as a fount of wisdom. The Watchtower truly does not seek people who question. Indeed, people who ask too many questions are dropped as Bible studies. You do not study the Bible as most faiths do in the Watchtower groups. Rather, you study the Watchtower with some slight references to their own translation, which itself is very controversial. You learn healthy skepticism. How do you learn how to read Homer and then not think about the Watchtower in a similar vein? Most faiths encourage such comparisons. Not the Watchtower. Frankly, I do not know why. But they loathe it. Fundamentalism itself raises many issues. But as I noted, it is not fundamentalism itself that discourages higher education. Somehow small Bible colleges get state accreditation. Most Ivies and other elite schools started as seminaries or advanced training for ministers. We tend to think of the Massachusetts Puritans as conservative in faith. I read, however, that a staggering number were Cambridge and Oxford graduates. They set up Harvard and Yale for divinity studies. Knowledge and God were not adversaries, as the Witnesses make it. The upshot is that many Witnesses come from poor to working-class backgrounds. It is not a faith that attracts the upper middle class and affluent. When a white middle-class kid who is a Witness forgoes college, they can usually make it up if they leave. It is so much harder when your family has no money. I knew bright Witnesses who just hung around and never gained great life skills. They stayed poor. I should note that they also discourage advanced art or music training or any craft that might have a sustained apprenticeship. It is sad and unnecessary. But they allow no dissent. So people who feel strongly about education almost always leave. When I started college, I just wanted to be left alone by the Witness. I hated the hatred they had of others. But it was my basic faith. I knew no other. When my father tried to take me out of high school, I was frantic. I knew the ACLU, my principal, my teachers, and a host of social service agencies would help me. But the price would be so high. They set up a conflict and make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Suffice it to say I had doubts. But the college confirmed my doubts. It was many years before I even trust another faith group just enough to sit in a church in an aisle seat so I could leave quickly. Also, if all college students had such wild sex and parties college would be far more popular in the United States. LOL. The U.S.Army would need to be called out to restore order. And so many of my Witness peers were kicked out without any college for sexual immorality and drugs. No one in college is forced to have sex or drugs. Again, my experience was with an Eastern elite college. But there are so many faith-based colleges that encourage higher education around the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Likely, you have heard the lie parroted by many opposers that the Jehovah\u2019s Witness organization prohibits the pursuit of a college education. Is this true? The simple truth is that Witnesses young and old alike have to make their own decisions as regard to what and how much education they need. However, as a Christian organization, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses provide guidelines designed to help individuals \u2018count the cost\u2019 of pursuing a college education while working to live up to their Christian dedication. (Luke 14:28) So what do our publications say about pursuing a college education? Do we prohibit it? \u201cProhibit\u201d Obtaining a College Education? Where? Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses do not prohibit college education. And to be honest, they do not encourage it either. What Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have done over the decades is issue balanced warnings against pursuing a college education for the wrong reasons, while urging members to think about why they are pursuing a college education using questions like: \u201cWhat are my goals in life?\u201d, or \u201cam I looking to support my service to God, or get ahead in this world?\u201d. These are very logical questions for any Christian to ask themselves. As far back as the 1950s, we have published information that leaves it up to the individual. Consider this statement from the May 15th, 1956 Watchtower p. 313, par. 14: \u201cHe must decide whether his ambitions are toward the popular trend of materialism or not\u2014whether he desires to get ahead in the world, to attain a high position and honor and esteem of men which a college education subsequently leads to. In making his decision he must bear in mind the question: How will this affect my position in the New World society and my relationship toward Jehovah God?\u201d In that same article, we read: \u201cWhether a person should or should not seek such higher education is dependent on the individual and what he desires to gain from life, present and future.\u201d Do those sound like prohibitions to you? Absolutely not! Are we the only ones that have similar views? Consider statements in the New York Times by Lawrence Mishel, President of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington DC: \u201c . . . We also need to prepare many students for jobs that don\u2019t require college degrees. . . . A four-year college degree is not the panacea that many people think it is. . . . There is plenty of snobbery afoot regarding college educations. Some esteemed academics \u2014 conservative and liberal \u2014 wrongly equate college graduates with \u2018smart people\u2019 and \u2018skilled workers.\u2019 Many conservative and liberal educational policy experts demean destinations other than college. We need a nation that has and values all sorts of work and skills, which means providing decent pay and benefits for many types of jobs.\u201d Our opposers ignore the fact that not all educated people view college as the \u201cpanacea\u201d (cure-all). After all, not many things stoke the flames of prejudice and fear more than convincing others that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses want to control you and your children by removing education as an option. This is why we urge all readers to look into our beliefs for themselves to get the facts. (Acts 17:10, 11) Let us compare the statements from the 1950's with our most recent teachings on this issue with the January 2015 JW Broadcast, the one claimed by our opposers to be \u201canti-education\u201d. In that video, (starting at 4:11) Anthony Morris of the Governing Body made statements reaffirming the position we have maintained since the 1950s: \u201cUltimately, it is the decision of the parents as to the amount of the secular education they feel is necessary for a child to later care for a family of his own. . . . So parents and children, you need to have a goal, and you need to have a plan. If you are missing either one, Satan will provide it for you. Young people, ask yourself: Why am I considering additional education? Is it because I am pursuing a specific skill or trade to support my service to Jehovah\u2026?\u201d What the preceding statements demonstrate is that, far from prohibiting college education, we are teaching people to think for themselves, and reason on the matter, before making a decision, and not to blindly follow the trends of the world around us. (Proverbs 1:4; Romans 2:12) In contrast, among Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are doctors, lawyers, scientists, educators and so on; fields of expertise that would require a college education. Logically then, such individuals would not qualify to become one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses if we prohibited college education. Do we \u201cDiscourage\u201d Getting a College Education? Some mischaracterize the warnings and guidelines we provide as \u201cfrowning on\u201d or \u201cdiscouraging\u201d college education. College education is not itself discouraged; however, what we caution on is the emphasis that is usually placed on gaining material and social success, which runs counter to the advice of Jesus and John. (Matthew 6:19-21; 1 John 2:15, 16) Our organization exists to build faith in God and to help people get on the road that leads to everlasting life, hence, it is our responsibility to provide warnings on what could lead one away from that road. (1 Timothy 6:9-12) So what are some of the claims made by opposers that serve as \u201cevidence\u201d that we discourage college education itself? Consider several articles that our opposers like to quote. \u201cRather than being content with \u2018sustenance and covering,\u2019 those who devote themselves to getting a \u2018higher education\u2019 usually want to be able to enjoy \u2018the rest of the things\u2019 that money can buy.\u201d \u2014Watchtower, February 1, 1967, p. 76 This article is cited as evidence that we teach a causative relationship between college and materialism. What this article connects is materialism with discontent with sustenance and covering, not college education. It is saying that when people become discontented with sustenance and covering, they usually seek college so they can buy more things. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses do not teach that all who attend college do so for materialistic reasons, as you will see later. Let us move on: \u201cUniversity and college campuses are notorious for bad behavior\u2014drug and alcohol abuse, immorality, cheating, hazing, and the list goes on.\u201d \u2014Watchtower, October 1, 2005, p. 28 According to some of our opposers, this statement is cited as proof that we \u2018demonize\u2019 college. But they fail to understand what it says. It says \u201ccollege campuses\u201d (indicating dorm room life) are notorious for those things \u2013 it does not say \u201ccollege\u201d itself. This means other options are available such as attending a college near home that enables students to live off-campus, or securing housing that allows living away from campus, or even online courses. The point our organization is making is to avoid environments that would jeopardize our spiritual welfare. Next: \u201cHow sad that some have fallen away from the faith as a result of succumbing to the demands on their time and energy or of getting entangled in unscriptural conduct at college!\u201d \u2014Watchtower, October 1, 2005, p. 29 Our opposers claim that by this quote, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are saying university is the cause of some leaving the faith, and thus should be avoided to keep ones faith intact. While it is true that some have left the faith after attending college, this article is linking the \u201cdemands\u201d and \u201cunscriptural conduct\u201d as the reason some have \u201cfallen away from the faith\u201d, not simply attending college. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses issue similar warnings about the workforce. Demanding jobs and engaging in unscriptural conduct on the job can lead to a loss of faith, so does that mean that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are telling their members not to go to work? Hardly. But our opposers don\u2019t want you thinking that far. Finally: \u201cAre we encouraging young ones, who are often steered by schoolteachers and others to pursue the world\u2019s higher education, to set spiritual goals instead and pursue the highest education\u2014divine education?\u201d \u2014Our Kingdom Ministry October, 2011, p. 3 It is claimed that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are hypocritical with this statement because we \u201ctake advantage\u201d of those who have college educations to advance our preaching work. However, a \u2018hypocrite\u2019 is one who professes a belief, but acts in a way that disagrees with that belief. What would make us hypocritical is if the Governing Body were doing the opposite of what they are saying. The simple fact that college educated Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses exist does not make us hypocrites. We do not prohibit college education, so how can we be hypocritical by using those who have college educations? What we have learned thus far is that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses do not prohibit college education or discourage it. Rather, we simply offer guidelines that assist Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in having the right motivations if they chose to attend a university, and we educate them on the obvious spiritual dangers that can accompany college life. Secondly, we encourage less time-consuming alternatives that will be discussed next. What We Encourage While Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses neither encourage nor discourage college education, they have acknowledged the benefit of secular education overall and endorse options that would not put a Christian in spiritual harm. Note the November 1, 1992 Watchtower, p. 17: \u201cTheir schooling will teach them not only many subjects but also the learning process. True Christians do not stop learning and studying when they leave school. What they get out of their studying, however, will greatly depend on their knowing how to study. Both secular and congregation schooling can help them to develop their thinking abilities.\u201d Page 18 of that same article states: \u201cSome have taken training courses that have opened up job opportunities enabling them to engage in or resume full-time service. One sister in the Philippines was the family breadwinner, but she wanted to pioneer. The branch reports: \u2018She has been able to do this because she has received additional education to qualify as a certified public accountant.\u2019 The same branch report stated: \u2018We have quite a number who are studying and at the same time have been able to arrange their schedules to pioneer. Generally they become better publishers as they are more studious, provided they do not become overly ambitious in worldly pursuits.\u2019\u201d Consider the March 8th, 1998 Awake!, p. 21: \u201cSome Christians have found that pursuing additional education, in the form of either academic or vocational studies, has assisted them in caring for their family\u2019s material needs. Caring for one\u2019s family is proper, for \u2018providing for one\u2019s household\u2019 is a sacred duty. (1 Timothy 5:8) Gaining the skills needed to do this is a matter of practical wisdom.\u201d Added to this, our organization encourages other alternatives that will not consume too much of the time that could be devoted to being a disciple of Christ. (Matthew 16:24) One such recent example is noted in the January 2015 JW Broadcast mentioned in the outset. Philip Brumley, legal counsel for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, stated that instead of becoming a doctor, one could become a nurse, and instead of becoming a lawyer, one could become a paralegal. His point was to encourage his listeners to select a career which would allow them to take care of themselves and support their Kingdom activity. The April, 1999 Our Kingdom Ministry, p. 8 said this: \u201cWhat have you cultivated as your prime concern during your youth? Are you mainly interested in seeking financial advantage, or do you really want to use your life to advance Kingdom interests? A university degree does not guarantee success in the job market. As an alternative, many have acquired marketable job skills by means of apprenticeship programs, some vocational or technical school education, or short-term college courses that require a minimum of time and involvement\u201d. I would like to just reiterate the fact that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are a spiritual organization with the goal of helping people become followers of Christ. (Matthew 28:19-20) This helps add context to the reason why we encourage the type of education that would assist in advancing this purpose, instead of education that would detract from that purpose. Speaking of following Jesus, what were his views on higher education? What Was Important to Jesus? Jesus was the wisest man to ever walk the earth. However, it was well-known and openly acknowledged that he did not attend the schools of higher learning. (John 7:15) When Jesus chose his 12 Apostles, these men were evidently chosen because of their faith, not because of their level of education. (Acts 4:13) Jesus revealed that Jehovah favored humble people, not those who relied on their own intellectual capabilities. (Matthew 11:25) The Apostle Paul, who studied under the tutelage of Rabbi Gamiliel who is probably the most famous Rabbinic scholar in history, all but abandoned those teachings to follow Jesus. (Philippians 3:7,8) His reasoning had become completely foreign to the Pharisaic schools. What is the point? That we endeavor to follow in Jesus' footsteps. Higher education was not itself condemned by Jehovah or Jesus, rather, it was not the priority for them. Likewise, Jehovah's Witnesses do not condemn getting a college education, but we prioritize \"seeking first the Kingdom\" just like Jesus recommended. (Matthew 6:33) Are Parents Disciplined for Their Child's Choice? When a post like this proves our opposers wrong, they start moving back the goal posts. In this instance, one tried claiming that an elder's qualifications can be brought into question if he \"allows\" his child to get higher education. Again, this is patently false. There is not one piece of literature so much as implying this. The only way an elder's qualifications could be brought into question in regard to a child's choice of higher education is if the elder encourages the child to pursue higher education without consideration for the child's spiritual health. An adult child of the elder is considered beyond the elder's influence. Elders cannot be held responsible for the choices of their adult children if they did not encourage those children. Elders are only asked to step down with children under the age of adulthood if those children are disobedient or the elder gives counsel contrary to the publications in line with 1 Timothy 3:2-4. Whether or not the child chooses higher education has nothing to do with that. As we have seen, the publications do not prohibit higher education. Now the January 2015 JW Broadcasting quote from the first header indicates that it is the parent's choice to determine the amount of higher education their child receives. This has certain caveats. First, this assumes the parent to be the source of the funding. If the parent controls the funding, then the parent controls how much higher education the child can undertake. If the parent allows unlimited amounts of schooling, allowing the child to put aside spiritual pursuits, then the parent may be seen as encouraging such spiritual abandonment. We do not discipline parents for this in any way, but it may bring their qualifications for priveleges into question. The child's attendance of higher education, in itself, is not, and never has been, grounds for such restrictions. In review, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses do not prohibit college education, nor do we generally encourage it. We offer guidelines that discourage attending college for the wrong reasons, and warn of the spiritual harm that could result. However, each Witness ultimately has to make their own decision and cannot blame others for their choice. We respect and acknowledge the place education has in our society, and encourage worthy alternatives to four or more years of college education for those who are considering it. Do Jehovah's Witnesses 'Prohibit' Higher Education? ",
