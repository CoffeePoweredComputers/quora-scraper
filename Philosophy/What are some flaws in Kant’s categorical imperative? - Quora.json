            "answer_text": "Rewritten, 27 June Kant\u2019s CI suffers because it claims to find absolute norms without qualification. Some lies seem good, suicide sometimes seems the best way, lying promises, you can imagine, might be just the right and the good. This leads you to quality the imperative, e.g., never lie except to save a life, if someone is suffering horribly with a fatal disease, suicide is fine, make a lying promise to Stalin in order to stop mass executions, blah. blah. Kant wants to say that if there is a contradiction in the very nature of the act, it has a an a priori feature and is indisputable. Lying makes communication impossible, suicide to improve life goes against life, lying goes against fair communication. He thinks it\u2019s possible to find the absolute logical essence of a moral demand. As a result, he has you spilling the beans to the Gestapo that you have a Jew in the cellar, or confessing everything in court, or counting on the death penalty as just in itself. Perhaps the best that can be said for the categorical imperative is that it is a good guide. It has leading principles. Moral judgements are fallible, but should pass some sort of reasonable guide. It does seem to reflect the common view of moral principles. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the main flaw that I see with Kant\u2019s categorical imperative is that it is excessively austere. That is, it can yield false negatives. That is, it will prohibit some behaviors that common sense would permit. This is because, ultimately, Kant\u2019s categorical imperative remained dualist, much like Western tradition\u2019s claim that Reason must always fight with the Passions to do the right thing \u2014 and that no harmony between them is probable or plausible. Actually \u2014 even the ancient Greeks saw a plausible harmony between Reason and the Passions \u2014 so Kant\u2019s categorical imperative is simply too austere for common sense. ",
