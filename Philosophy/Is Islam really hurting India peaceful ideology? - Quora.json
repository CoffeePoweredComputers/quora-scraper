            "answer_text": "Not really. Muslims people live in best democratic country in the world, that is india. They are much better off living in india rather than living in countries like Saudi Arabia or Iran where a lady has to have a marriage certificate while walking on the road alone and must be accompanied by husband. In Iran, a muslim lady is placed in jail if no hizab. Muslims from India are very peaceful people. Have you ever heard that Indian muslim has any terror activity, never. Half of Indian movie industry and most talented movie stars are Muslims. Muslims are India like Hindus. All religions live together in peaceful manner. Occasional problems are created by outsider from Pakistan or initiated from outside. Two of Indian ex-presidents were Dr. Zakir Hussain and Dr. Abdul Kalam, were muslims and so many ministers are. In short, Islam in India is a peace-loving religion. ",
