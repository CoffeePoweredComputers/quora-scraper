            "answer_text": "I have three daughters. They are multiracial and do not look traditionally white, nor do they really resemble their mothers\u2019 ethnicity\u2026 I would say they look \u2018racially ambiguous\u2019, the way you would have trouble pin-pointing The Rock\u2019s ethnic background if you never googled the guy. As a result, they both blend in well, and stand out a lot. They know they do not look like the typical citizen of the country in which we reside. They know, too, that they do not look like the people where their mother comes from, either. They are unique. A special blend. They\u2019re aware that they look different. They are proud of their tan skin, their different features, their unique facial structures. They love looking the way they look. And they would never look down on, or up to, anyone who looks different than them. This covers the racism part, I\u2019d say \u2014 they treat everyone as they themselves like to be treated. No kitty gloves, no undue reverence, and never any nastiness of bigotry based on looks. Just treat everyone as fellow human beings. Regarding the homophobia part\u2026 hard to be homophobic when their favourite uncle is my gay brother! A huge, burly beefcake of a man who throws them in the air like rag dolls and has cook-outs with them, watches Pokemon with them and Avatar and what-not and is just their all-time best buddy. So what if he sometimes brings home a dude? Leaves me with sexism\u2026 my eldest daughter wants to be a \u201cdancer and tattoo artist\u201d. My second daughter, just today, told me she wants to be \u201ca lady cop and shoot criminals\u201d lol. Number three can barely talk yet, so I\u2019ll leave her out of the equation for now. But I can tell you this \u2014 my daughters can be anything they want to be, I\u2019ll encourage the shit out of them to realise whatever dreams they have. So I\u2019d say any sexism that might have prevailed was pretty much nipped in the bud there. Children will just follow the example set by their parents. Treat other folks well, don\u2019t bad-mouth those who are \u201cdifferent\u201d behind closed doors, because kids ears have a weird tendency of hearing whatever thing they\u2019re not supposed to hear most. And above all\u2026 bring a lot of different folks around. Expose your kids to hard-working ladies. Non-stereotypical gay and lesbian folks. People of different cultures, races, religions. Be friendly with a wide variety of people, and your children will follow your footsteps and be friendly to a similarly wide variety of people. Talk the talk, walk the walk, and ensure your children see you walking it and talking it so it will seem as natural to them as breathing\u2026 do this and you won\u2019t even have to bring these issues up.

            "answer_text": "Those are all complex topic, lots of ADULTS still don't understand some of these concepts. I would say always teach them to live by \u201cThe Golden Rule\" treat others how you would want to be treated. Teach them to show love and positivity to others. Teach them that it is not okay to be mean to others just for the sake of being mean. I'm gonna try my best on these next ones: Racism: If you and your children are people of color then you could explain that, in this world some people will judge you based on the color of your skin, or the way you look (I would say 11 years at the youngest maybe? I am also a person of color and I know we have all had \u201cthat moment\u201d when we realize that yes, SOME people in this world will judge you by the color of your skin. So in my opinion I would explain it when the time comes) If you are white I would say just use the golden rule, when I was in elementary everyone was kind to everyone (most of the time) we didn't know what racism was, what sexism was, what homophobia was. Just teach them to be kind to others, racism is something that kids learn from adults. If you're children ever start to become racist as they age, it is in your hands to decide what to do with them. So good luck with that Sexism: Again, when we were little kids we didn't know what sexism was. I remember during field day I said, \u201cDon't let a GIRL beat you!\u201d The teachers never told me \u201cDon't say that, that is SEXIST!!\u201d They simply taught me that was NOT an okay thing to say. I never said it again. So basically, when they are young, if they say something sexist firmly say \u201cNo\" or whatever you have to do to imply to their little minds that \u201cHEY, that is not an okay thing to say, so DON'T say it!\u201d If they become sexist when they are older, say, your teen son starts saying stuff like \u201cwomen are less than. Women are retarded, they are so weak\" OR your teen daughter starts saying stuff like \u201cExile all men, men are trash, etc.\u201d I was originally going to say That the parent of the same sex should handle their respective child, but I think it's up to you. Maybe the same sex parent, maybe both parents, maybe the opposite sex parent. You decide which is more effective Homophobia: I don't really remember any gay kids being in my elementary, BUT in 6th grade there was actually 1 guy who was. It was kind of a \u201cdont ask, don't tell\" kinda thing, in my 6th grade elementary no one really cared. So yea I'm going to admit that this one is a lot tougher, it's relatively new (not homosexuals but the way it is nowadays) we are all learning together. Again I say just teach your kids kindness and the golden rule at a young age and then tackle problems as they get older. This is a really tough one, but I think it's just because of the time. I would say give it a few years and we will get somewhere. Now if you see them being BLATANTLY being homophobic, posting stuff like \u201cfuck gay people, gay people should be hung, if you are gay don't talk to me, etc.\u201d Or see them saying those things in real life put an end to that right away. THIS is much easier to deal with in my opinion due to its blatantness. That is not something they should be saying in this day and age. So in conclusion, I would say with things like these you have to be more round-a-bout way. Instead of saying that these things are \u201cbad\u201d, ASSOCIATE these things with \u201cbad\" (This only works with young kids) But if you do this while they are young then it will be MUCH easier when they get older. \u2022 Raise good kids \u2022 Live by the Golden Rule \u2022 Do not tolerate these behaviors That's the best I could do and I hope this helps in some way, it's good that you are actively trying to teach your kids these things, so thank you for that. Just remember, we are not born racist, sexist, nor homophobic. We are TAUGHT these things. Good luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "i think when they start maybe 1st or 2nd grade. Latest in 3rd grade because these days children's innocence is taken sooner and sooner. they learn more and more about the world every day, it is only best that we teach them the good things and the best of our society rather than them learning the worst and acting upon it. But you should let them know as soon as possible, even if it is in kindergarten, but start simple like perhaps racism because they start school and will start to wonder hmm why is she white, or why is he black, or why do they sound funny?, it is important to let them know that was how they were made, and its okay, not one thing is the same in 1 unique person.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say that you could talk with a child about racism and sexism when they\u2019re about to enter kindergarten perhaps. You could say that we\u2019re all human and that it doesn\u2019t matter what color we are, but they might start to meet children who dislike some people only because they\u2019re a certain color. Tell them that this is the wrong thing to do and that you hope that he or she will always treat everyone the same way. Also, you could say that no one should ever mistreat all boys or all girls. Sometimes girls say that they don\u2019t like any boys, or boys say that they don\u2019t like any girls. You may rather play and hang out with other boys (or other girls) because you like to do the same things and this is fine. But don\u2019t go around hurting girls\u2019 feelings by saying that you don\u2019t like girls (or vice versa). If the truth be told, I never gave my daughter this talk. I assumed that she wouldn\u2019t be racist or sexist and she wasn\u2019t. Homophobia can be saved for when a child is a little older\u2014maybe 10. I\u2019ll leave you to figure out what you want to say. I used to volunteer at a preschool. They are color blind when they are preschoolers, and they are fine with playing with the opposite gender.

What i think is more important than the explaination of how and why these things are bad and wrong , is the example you set. If you show thru action , standing up against homophobia and racism and word choice, not using derogatory words, and calling out those who do. You will never need to explain homophobia, racism , sexism as bad. You will have shown all along thru out their lives that thees things are bad. Lead by example you kids will learn , kids pick up on things more than we give them credit for. The fact is if they need an explanation as why thees things are bad, then you have already failed on setting the example. ",

The Sneetches will teach a morality lesson about the silliness of racism, and if they are very astute, about the people who use racism to profit from it. Children love having stories read to them.
