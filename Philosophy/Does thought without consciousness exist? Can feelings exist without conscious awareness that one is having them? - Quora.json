            "answer_text": "I think yes. What makes a thought conscious is the act of the mind recording that thought and playing it back for review. Brains think and feel all the time\u2014it continuously controls our behavior, but if we do not review it, or play it back, or if our attentional circuits are not focused on those thoughts or experiences, they will not be reflected upon and will not be understood. It is this act of reflection that makes a mental event conscious. Consider the split-brain patient. Mental events occurring on one hemisphere have no way of being communicated to the other. Goals and thoughts that emerge on one hemisphere, say the right side, do not get communicated to the left side. The left side of the body (controlled by the right hemisphere) reaches for some object, the TV remote, say, and pauses the TV show. Ask the patient why he or she did this, and the patient will respond verbally using the left side of the brain, which is cut off from the brain states of the right side, and may confabulate. Suppose the right side wanted to pause the show to go get a drink from the fridge. The left side may very well get this right, but it will be by accident. What\u2019s more likely is that it says something like, \u201cI was getting bored of the show\u201d or \u201cI want to do something else\u201d without being aware of the other hemisphere\u2019s desire for drink. This pattern of confabulation is often found in those who have had their corpus callosum (the fibers bridging the two hemispheres) severed to prevent dangerous seizures from spreading across hemispheres. I think in a similar way, we can have thoughts and feelings and not be aware of them consciously. Even normal people get why they do certain things wrong under controlled experimental conditions designed to trigger specific behaviors subconsciously. We don\u2019t even realize we\u2019re confabulating. The best understanding of consciousness suggests that we\u2019re merely observing passengers in our own bodies, at the whim of what the brain has already decided to do, and then sends these packages of sensory experiences with the label of \u201cyou decided this, you wanted this\u2026\u201d as an illusion. Brain scans reveal this marked delay between reported conscious awareness of a decision and the neural event potentials which are indicators of the brain states which lead to such actions. The implications for Free Will are interesting to be sure. A fantastic discussion of these topics and ideas can be found in \u2018Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics\u2019 by Gary Drescher. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Thoughs anf feelings are qualia, that is elements of the consciousness experience. So if any of these elements exists, there is a consciousness experiencing them, even if this consciousness experiences only that. This may happen to us in some confused dreams where we have a feeling but nothing else. . Added to this quick reply: we tend to think that consciousness is a specific entity (soul, spirit, etc.). This arises the problem of the nature of this entity, and how it handles sensations, etc. The theory I developped (which is similar to what Buddhists say) say that the consciousness IS its own content: sensation, etc. So that there is no need for an entity experiencing them. This matches what we observe in some dreams, where these elements are present alone, without a feeling of a self experiencing them. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Consciousness produces thought, by scanning or using a part of knowledge in memory. Yes. Consciousness can be aware of its feelings as well as emotions. It takes not in real time, but within an instant, giving the feeling that it is real time. Feelings are generally and often considered true, unbiased and unemotional due to their low intensity, though both are prompted by perception of external events or even thought. Fragmented or divided consciousness causes emotions. Most emotions can be dangerous as they can be limitless in their actions. Feelings arising from unfragmented Consciousness are generally harmless as their magnitude or parameters are narrow and limited. It may also be noted that as most terms have been over used and in various extreme contexts, they have lost their original meanings and have acquired new meanings. ",

            "answer_text": "You have thoughts that you are not aware of, in the sense that your brain have lots of information processing that never reaches your consciousness. It is also possible to be distracted in such a way that you don't register feelings in your conscious mind. You didn't notice the spider crawling up your arm\u2026 However, it does not make sense to talk about emotions without consciousness. If you don't experience the emotion, there is no emotion. It is still possible to not be aware of emotions. You can be sad, or happy without realizing it, but you still have this emotion and people around you can see how you feel. ",

Do you, for example, believe that a rabbit that runs very fast away from a predator has a feeling of fear? How about a mouse, which has even less brain? Is a mouse uncoscious of being afraid? Or do you believe that the mouse has both feeling and consciousness? I cannot prove you wrong \u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "I've seen it argued that feelings can't be unconscious, and certainly in one sense, feeling is by definition the same as awareness. Perhaps the Freudian concept of the preconscious might be helpful, in that we can have a feeling without our conscious being aware of it. Likewise, the wishes/feelings in the unconscious are not available to conscious thought. As regards actually thinking unconsciously, I imagine that thought is probably mostly unconscious anyway. It is often not as logical as we like to imagine. We shine the torchlight of consciousness on it, but most of its workings remain in darkness. ",

So there are degrees of awareness (focused attention) which is probably a function of the voltage of the current of electrical energy constituting the attention. One can have many thoughts and feelings taking place but we, our attention, misses them. They remain subconscious thoughts and feelings. ",
