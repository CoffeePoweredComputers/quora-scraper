            "answer_text": "Modernism is an established literary movement in European and American literature. Post-modernism is an emerging movement that is in the process of being defined and established. Asad\u2019s excellent description of Post-modernism reflects what is widely accepted and I believe is close to what history will settle on. An important characteristic of Modernism was its assault on culturally established mores, religion, and beliefs. Part of what the Lost Generation lost was a loyalty to tradition and the past. A similar and important characteristic of Post-modernism is the rejection of the meta-narrative\u2014the idea that there is one story that all are a part of. Whereas a Modernist might envision each person\u2019s story as an equal thread in the evolving tapestry of society, the Post-modernist rejects this and sees each thread equally important on its own whether it hangs free and frayed or gets tangled with the threads of others. It seems that a current preference is for the idea that all entanglements are random and therefore both equally meaningful and meaningless. Thank you for the A2A. ",
