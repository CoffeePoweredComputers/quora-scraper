            "answer_text": "A lot of the futuristic technology we see in sci-fi movies is so amazing it\u2019s hard to imagine that it may someday exist in our homes. In reality, it may exist already. Modern technology has advanced to the point where we can now control our TVs, lights and even our thermostats from our smartphone. That\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. 1. Automated Robots We are still a long way from a full-featured, humanoid-like robot that can operate freely. That said, automated robots already exist and are being used in a lot of homes today. Devices like the iRobot and Neato are designed to autonomously travel around your home and clean the floors. That\u2019s about as far as we\u2019ve come for consumer-based robots anyway. Of course, this is just one robot that is currently in production. It won\u2019t be long before we see more automated helpers moving into our homes. 2. Smart Appliances As our devices such as our phones, watches and even jewelry become smarter and smarter, we\u2019ll all begin to realize the benefits of owning smart appliances. Imagine a refrigerator that can have a nice glass of water waiting for you when you get to the kitchen \u2014 ordered directly from your mobile phone. Think of how awesome an internet-ready microwave would be \u2014 automatically tweeting out your quick meal to the world. Okay, so that last example was more of a joke but you get the point. 3. Lighting Controls Turning on a lamp or ceiling light from a wall switch is old fashioned now. Provided you have the right setup in your home, lights can now be controlled from mobile devices, touchscreen panels or an automated system. NEST, a smart thermostat, can even be programmed to turn on lights in your home and cool the air inside as soon as you return from vacation. Imagine being able to program your system so that it turns on lights at various times of the day or night. Advanced lighting controls are becoming more commonplace, though many hope that the technology will soon be a standard feature in new homes. 4. Power Tracking or Energy Efficient Tech Your car tells you when it needs an oil change, so why doesn\u2019t your home tell you information like that? Think of an air conditioning unit that can send you alerts when the air filter needs to be changed.It won\u2019t be long before there are more than just a couple competitors in the market and power tracking systems become a modern home standard. 5. Smart Toilets It seems a little silly taking a pot that you do your business in and making it \u201csmarter,\u201d but it\u2019s already happening. There are toilets in Japan that will perform a urinalysis after people do their business, and then inform them whether or not they have diabetes \u2014 or are at risk for it. It seems that\u2019s one of the main uses for smarter toilets, keeping us healthy, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it. You can learn a lot by analyzing stools and urine. Toilets may soon be able to tell women they are pregnant by analyzing urine, or that someone has colon cancer thanks to their stool. 6. Centralized Entertainment and Streaming Devices Cable TV is overpriced, outdated and pretty inconvenient these days. Sluggish and buggy set-top boxes are only a small portion of the problem. It\u2019s no surprise then that a streaming revolution is happening right now. The future of entertainment lies in a centralized streaming system which provides homeowners \u2014 and guests \u2014 instant access to their digital entertainment. Thanks to internet-based subscription services like Netflix, Hulu and even YouTube, homeowners can stream content live to their TV relatively cheaply. Of course, it does rely on a decent internet connection, which is a different issue entirely. Thank You ",
