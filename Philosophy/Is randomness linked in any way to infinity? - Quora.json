            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. There are some minor mathematical relationships, but nothing that I would consider hugely significant.  Perhaps the most interesting of these (to me) is that if you randomly select a number between 0 and 1, with equal chance for every number, the probability of selecting a rational number (fraction) is precisely 0--though that does not mean it is impossible!   [EDIT TO ADD:] This relates to infinity because not only are there infinitely many fractions in [0,1], but there are fractions \"infinitely close\" to every number in [0,1]. (We say that the fractions are dense in [0,1].)   I would say that the link is more psychological, as in: infinity and randomness are both mathematical constructs that most people do not understand very well, and for which human intuition generally fails.

            "answer_text": "Well, they are certainly at least linked in this question. Beyond that we might say that a random number in the interval [math](0,1)[/math] has an infinite non-repeating decimal expansion with probability one, because almost all such numbers are transcendental. But I don't think there is any profound or deep link between randomness and infinity. ",
