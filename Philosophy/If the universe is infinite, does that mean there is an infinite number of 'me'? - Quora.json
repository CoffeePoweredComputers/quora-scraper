            "answer_text": "Question: If the universe is infinite, does that mean there is an infinite number of \u201cme\u201d? Answer: It doesn\u2019t. No. However, it also doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility. But it also rather depends on what you mean by \u2018infinite\u2019 and by \u2018me\u2019. Your question is a great one for debate in a philosophy class. Unfortunately Quora is a great site, but it isn\u2019t really structured for debate. Infinity is a tricky concept, not least because there are degrees of infinity. For example, there are an infinite number of countable positive integers. And there are an infinite but uncountable number of rational numbers between zero and one. Aleph 1 infinity is greater than aleph null. Don\u2019t even try wrapping your head around the higher alephs of the transfinite numbers. And infinity is all too often confused with unbounded, which is very similar in most regards, but \u2026 not quite the same thing. So if there are an infinite number of billiard balls in the universe, each bearing a seperate positive integer on it - 1, 2, 3 , 4 \u2026. etc to infinity, then you do have an infinite universe with an infinite number of billiard balls in it, but each billiard ball is just a billiard ball - limited, individual, distinct. No billiard ball is infinite. But then - you are not a billiard ball. It is certainly true in a multi-verse that there are an infinite number of almost identical universes / versions of the universe which would include an infinite (although infinitely lesser number) of versions of you. But strictly speaking a multi-verse refers to an infinite number of universes, rather than an infinite universe. And if that confuses you (which is entirely understandable) you probably need to do a little research into definitions of \u2018the universe\u2019, and study concepts of infinity, which will require you to look into maths a bit. What I suspect the question is alluding to is the idea that \u201cin a truly infinite universe anything that can happen must happen\u201d, which includes the idea that there must be an infinite number of similar Earths populated with almost identical people, history etc., including infinite people genetically and nurtured identically to \u2018Me\u2019. Logically, that does have to be true. It also requires the universe to be a particular kind of infinity with an infinite amount of matter in it remaining in some sort of steady state configuration. This is very very VERY different to a universe of finite mass with unbounded spacial dimensions, which is also sometimes confusingly referred to as infinite. It is possible we live in the unbounded version. We currently have no evidence that we live in a Universe with infinite mass. But even in an infinite steady state universe with all these parallel worlds this doesn\u2019t exactly yield an infinite number of \u2018Me\u201d. Apart from being identical to \u2018Me\u2019 in every way these person\u2019s have nothing whatsoever in common with \u201cMe\u201d. That may sound confusing, but it is true. They are simply identical to \u2018Me\u2019, but that apart they have nothing in common with \u2018Me\u2019 at all. Each can make it\u2019s own decisions and go its own path. They will never meet me, communicate with me, or be aware of me in any way, thanks to the limitation of the speed of light. They may technically be part of the same infinite universe as \u2018Me\u2019, but they are not part of the same observable universe as \u2018Me\u2019. That word \u2018observable\u2019 makes universes of difference, quite literally in this case. Or, stated another way - we are into a question of definition of \u2018Me\u2019. See why this really needs a debate forum rather than Quora? Fredrick Pohl wrote a lovely Sci-Fi story about the \u2018Me\u2019 problem once. In the story some form of tachyon transmission and replication had been created. So I could step into a scanner on Earth, and then walk out of the scanner unchanged, still \u2018Me\u2019. Meantime the scanner broke everything about \u2018Me\u2019 down into some sort of digital signal and transmitted it faster than light to a receiver on some distant world (lets call it Hades) which used the signal with a replicator to rebuild an exact copy of \u2018Me\u2019. That \u2018Me\u2019 then stepped out onto a world like HELL still undergoing terraforming. What did that \u2018Me\u2019 do. It immediately hated and swore vengeance against the \u2018Me\u2019 back on Earth, still enjoying the good comfortable life who had condemned this other \u2018Me\u2019 to a life of torment on Hades. Of course the \u2018Me\u2019 on Hades could never even meet the \u2018Me\u2019 on Earth. But what it could and did do was walk into a scanner on Hades and send a tachyon stream back to Earth which went into a replicator and produced another copy of \u2018Me\u2019 on Earth, sworn to revenge against the first \u2018Me\u2019 on Earth. This is the \u2018Me\u2019 problem. It is also evidence that the light speed barrier may be a blessing, because at present there is no evidence that tachyons exist, or that the light speed barrier can be broken, or that my Quantum state can be digitised for transmission (Dan Simmons has great fun with this). So hopefully you will never meet one of your other \u2018You\u2019s. But if you do, you will realise that an identical \u2018Me\u2019 is no more \u2018Me\u2019 than an identical twin brother is \u2018Me\u2019. As I said, it\u2019s a wonderful question for a debate forum, but in the context of Quora this highly inadequate answer is about the best I can do. Hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a couple of ways (at least) that you can mean \u201cinfinite\u201d universe. We\u2019ll call them the classical and quantum views. \u2014 In either case the universe has a cosmic horizon. Beyond that horizon spacetime is expanding (ref: metric expansion) faster than the speed of light; that means it has moved out of causal contact with you. We can\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there; so, if you want to say there are pink elephants and dragons and unicorns there \u2014 at least from this vantage point I\u2019m at now \u2014 I can\u2019t falsify those assertions. If you want to say there is a copy of you outside the visible universe, I can\u2019t falsify that. \u2014 If you want to get down to the quantum view, then we need to ask do you mean an infinite number of \u201cyous\u201d at this point in time; or, an infinite number of yous over some course of time. Yes, there are infinite number of yours over some course of time. That, really, is a classical or quantum thought. \u2014 If you\u2019re wanting multiple coexistent yous, within the visible universe, then you\u2019ve got a potential issue with a postulated prohibition against creating exact quantum copies. So, this would have to be a naturally occurring instance. Given a ridiculous amount of time, nothing prevents two of yous from coming about; you may recur after  years, give or take an order of magnitude. But, that\u2019s still not the probability (or occurrence rate) of two of yous. I\u2019m still going to say that quantum information cannot occur in two places simultaneously. You\u2019ll need multiverse theory for that; and, by definition, that\u2019s not existing in the same universe. Multiverse theory is different from being outside the causal boundary of our \u201cvisible\u201d universe. \u2192 Shifting your vantage point would shift the causal boundary in the classical theory (and, that\u2019s real stuff \u2014 I can falsify that). On the other hand, you can\u2019t shift between parallel universes in multiverse theory; yet another way of saying no two yous will ever be in the same universe. \u2014 So, the answer to your question is Yes, it\u2019s possible that you will recur; yes, it\u2019s possible that you occur in different \u201cuniverses.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be allowed that two of yous coexist in the same universe.

Not only that\u2014an infinite universe implies an infinite number of intelligent brains floating in it, called Bolzmann brains, each randomly formed out of atoms in its environment that happened to bump into each other. The absurdity goes even further if we assume the univese is also infinitely old. For then the night sky would have to be as bright as the surface of the sun (Olbers' paradox) and the universal entropy would be already maximized (a dead universe.) Infinity is an indispensable concept in mathematics and poetry, maybe also in philosophy and theology, but untenable in physics and in relating to reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply yes, but take the word \u201camount\u201d out of the question because infinity and amount cannot co-exist. If infinity is the model we belong to then yes we are part of the same picture. I am not sure if you are meaning our souls or our bodies. The atoms that make up our bodies will live forever in one form or another so yes our material being has infinite life. If by infinity you mean no end and no beginning in a timeless space free of boundaries then yes, our souls or consciousness will always live and process life through the prism of our understanding and willingness to accept new information and new ways of being. Infinity is the most important concept we will ever consider because as soon as we start to think about all the implications of infinity partnered with eternity we realise that our religious concepts of finite states of being and even physical places we think of as heaven and hell cannot possibly exist in the model of infinity free of boundaries and therefore, undefined. The only way to process infinity is to consider a state of constant flow through a single point of consciousness. There is an ancient saying \u201c144 angels dancing on the head of a pin\u201d. I love this saying because it perfectly describes the concept of a spaceless sentience with a single focus. Energy does not take up space nor can it be contained. Matter responds to energetic intention. In ancient literature there is much reference to the river of life, a constantly flowing energetic field. Einstein saw the universe as a connected field of energy with depressions where material objects like stars and planets existed. His model demonstrates an infinite connectedness which eradicates the separation into compartments like heaven, hell, life, death and time. These things are illusion and yes we are infinite. ",

            "answer_text": "Hugh Everett came up with this in the Fifties and like most new ideas it was stillborn. Hard sciences\u2019 types are judgemental of unconforming ideas. But Everett was appreciated posthumously. Innovators must die before \u2018sainted\u2019. His theory was based on quantum physics and field \u2018vibrations\u2019. Different universes have different \u2018channels\u2019. He believed he would \u2018change channels\u2019 because death in one universe might still be life in another. Everett was a nerdy genius but with a mystical tendency. As far as universes go, I can see a Space scape full of them orbiting their progenitor and of different ages. Ours might be middle aged. As they expand, they merge and swirl into their parent until released back into the metaverse around. Maybe universes haven\u2019t centers but metaverses might. ",

The universe is indeed infinite but it is a word that involves everything including empty space, even though we cannot observe the entire universe, it can never be entirely filled up, as time is passing by new galaxies are being formed so there is an impossible chance that a second you will exist infinitely, but there might be someone like you in the future.

So there would be an infinite number of world's identical to this one and we know this is a possibility so if there is an infinity of world there has to be an infinite number of you who asked this question and got the response of everyone who answered or will answer this.
