            "answer_text": "Sure it can. Both \u2018the truth\u2019 and \u2018being racist\u2019 are subjective terms. Lets talk about the IQ gap you mentioned. I saw a documentary about this in particular. IQ and Race. (or was it Race and IQ?). Anyhow, statistics show a gap, Black people generally fall back. But upon researching it further, it turns out that the IQ tests are biased. Not intentionally of course, but they are. It turns out, that Black people living in white communities or neighbourhood score similar to others, and white people living in the so called \u201chood\u201d score low. Some even claimed that IQ tests are more about adaptability to certain conditions than about being clever. It turns out that they only score less because of social, cultural, and economic factors; nothing to do with their ability to be smart as a race. So, if you acknowledge that it\u2019s the race, not other factors, then yes, it\u2019s racist. Other so called \u2018truths\u2019 can be the same. Moreover, statistics are NOT the truth, nor are they scientific evidence. Statistics are simply the results of a survey conducted on a certain sample. A similar survey can be reproduced with different results. Moreover, it says NOTHING about reasons other than the researcher\u2019s opinion. Nor are they universal (example, some blacks can score higher than most whites). The above research shows a simple fact: the scores of blacks, on average, are lower. Nothing more, nothing less. Just like there is also a well documented black-white income gap. This doesn\u2019t mean that they are racially incapable of scoring higher or getting more income. ",

            "answer_text": "No, truth cannot be Racist, because Racism is simply wrong as incorrect, and truth is, well, truth. There is however a concept of \"lie by omission\", that is inapplicable to scientific research (scientists supposed to be able to aggregate multiple results and interpret statistics correctly) yet should be paid attention to in a casual conversation or general media. Also, some people can be eager to brand you a Racist instead of balancing your reference with missing information out of intellectual laziness or political zeal. With that in mind, it would be prudent and considerate for anyone referring to the research and different opinions and concerns in relation to it(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence),  to mention a few rather obvious facts to ensure correct perception: While some research shows difference in IQ scores, distribution is significant, which means significant number of black people will have IQ well above the IQ of any white person who needs to to be explained that. Apologies if that sounded as an insult. Asking questions on interviews, reviewing credentials and offering tests while staying colorblind will give you much better workforce with higher IQ then eliminating black applicants from consideration in advance - apart from being morally wrong and illegal, the latter strategy would be outright stupid. IQ alone is not enough to assess if the person will be successful in a given job, business or other endeavor. Strong work ethic, commitment, genuine enthusiasm, healthy positive attitude, open mind clear of dictate of old ideas, and not to forget better education, will trump 10 IQ points difference hands down.",

            "answer_text": "This is not a yes or no question. If you make an observation about someone or something that is true, that's one thing. If you take that observation (or if that observation is based on a set of assumptions you have about their race--which is inevitably the case in our society) and then apply it to a broad category of people on the basis of their race, it is a racist statement.  One of the fundamental challenges in talking about race and racism is that we don't have a broadly shared definition of it. The definition provided by Quora, \"Racism is a form of systemic discrimination that has negative or positive economic and social impact on a group or groups of people based solely on their participation or exclusion from economic and social activities,\" is a good first step because it shifts the focus to the collective impact that racism has on its recipients.  Race is a social construct that was created to determine and then justify the distribution of social, economic, cultural, political, and material wealth. By creating a black race, Europeans and Americans were able to justify slavery--the extension of one person's will over another person--and all the atrocities that accompany it (and the legacy of slavery that endures, i.e, mass incarceration of and terrorist police state against black people in the U.S.  Orientalism, the fundamental racism that affects Asians and what used to be or is currently \"the Orient,\" (racist term) like the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, the Pacific Island (currently inappropriately lumped together with \"Asian\"), was created to justify Western imperialism from the days of Alexander in Egypt, Marco Polo in China, trade wars against China, i.e. the Opium Wars, American imperialism throughout the Asia Pacific and their subsequent the mass exclusion from migrating to the U.S.--a country that destroyed their countries' governance, natural and human resources, political stability, family structures, cultural norms, languages, arts, science, etc. Orientalism allows for Donald Trump to receive broad support for his violent and dangerous brand of racism against Muslims and Muslim Americans, and the policies that have allowed the U.S. government to illegally detain and torture innocent people who are Muslim or are perceived to have some kind of affiliation to Islam. Orientalism supports the idea that Muslim=terrorist.  Race in the Americas allowed for the extermination, robbery, and disenfranchisement of indigenous people in the U.S., for the colonial invasion and taking of Puerto Rico and Latin America by Spain and later the U.S.  Race is a serious issue. Stereotypes of any kind are racism because they rely on and perpetuate the constructs that have allowed for injustice for millennia. ",

            "answer_text": "No. A true statement is a true statement. Only how you use that statement can be considered racist or not. When you say that the IQ gap is a fact, people are likely to go beyond that in their minds and believe that what you really mean to imply is \"white people are superior to black people\".People are likely to think that because it's commonplace in our society for prejudice to be disguised with euphemism and indirection. So, maybe you just need to explain yourself better. And, as for reasons for the IQ gap, there is a positive correlation there which however, simply put, cannot be shown to imply causation. ",

When correlation is mistaken for causation, then application can misrepresent the truth. \u201cMost green people are incapable of swimming.\u201d That would be racist because the reason why many green people can swim is because they had no access to a pool growing up. They aren't incapable, they just never learned how. By using \u201cincapable\u201d you're setting a false difference between green and purple people when there really is no difference. To close the loop, we discriminate against people we believe to be different. If you're referring to the Narnian Flu, it may have originated there, heck the leaders of Narnia may not have reported it to the world as they should have. \u201cNarnia\u201d refers to ALL Narnians, though, who had nothing to do with it. So calling it the Narnian Flu can bring wrath and shame to innocent individuals. Is it racist to call it the Narnian Flu? It may not be the intent, but it's a way off placing blame on innocents. ",

But black people should look at this and ask why and how they can change there action. It's like arresting a black person for stealing a TV and He thinks it's racist to arrest him. He won't accept his actions is what got  him arrested not race.  racist would be bringing up facts that are no longer real like black slavery. Or facts that are untrue. People need to be held responsible for there actions. And not just say racist and that makes there behavior accepted. Don't be fooled by the Politically Correct BS. The Truth may hurt but it's not racist. ",

Truth is dealing with the backstory and history, and dealing with all sides from different sources, not just one. Truth is not perception or even mere observation, neither is it based in fear or hatred. It is objective (that is it stands on its own outside of ones own belief system) and not subjective based in ones own experience or prejudices). Truth is often obscured by people who want to use part of it, but hide the rest because it doesn\u2019t fit their agenda. If you want to speak truth, speak the whole truth, not only just what you want others to hear. It is then that truth often become a lie. ",
