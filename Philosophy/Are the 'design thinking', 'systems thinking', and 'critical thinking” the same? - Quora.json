            "answer_text": "No they are not, although they can all be used together, especially if you are trying to tackle significant strategic issues. Systems thinking and critical thinking are both forms of logical thinking. Systems thinking relates to understanding how broad systems work, how processes flow, and how inputs effect outputs. It is also related to games theory. You should be good at systems thinking if you can prepare flow diagrams, write code, play chess, or understand physics. Critical thinking is more relevant to working with language, words and symbols. It can be about applying formal logic to assumptions, or choosing between options. You are probably good at critical thinking if you are good at dissecting the plots of books or movies, if you critique advertisements, if you understand why politicians do the things they do, or if you enjoy debating. Finally, design thinking is a specific methodology for innovation with a strong focus on user experience. It employs a couple of types of non-linear thinking: divergent thinking, which is really about creativity without constraints, and convergent or synthetic thinking, as the process starts to put constraints around the novel ideas.
