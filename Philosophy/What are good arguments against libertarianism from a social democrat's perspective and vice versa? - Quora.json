            "answer_text": "I called myself a Libertarian for about 20 minutes back in the 80\u2019s. Then I learned that Libertarians truly do not believe in government oversight of anything other than: 1) the printing of currency, 2) protecting our borders, and 3) maintaining our military. That\u2019s it. There is no belief that the government can or should act on our behalf in any way aside from those 3 ways. No environmental protections, no consumer protections, no safety net to help the needy, elderly and infirm (IE: no SS, no Medicare, no Medicaid, no food stamps, no WIC, etc.), no equal rights protections for any special interest group, no Planned Parenthood funding for clinics in underserved communities, no punishing of corporate polluters, no affordable health care, and some would even say no public schools. Nada. They believe the states should take over most of these roles with the federal government being shrunk down to a tiny fraction of its current size. So, one could argue that Libertarianism is in many ways the exact opposite of Social Democrats\u2019 belief that our government exists to serve us. SD\u2019s believe the government should create and enforce consumer and environmental protections, hold corporate polluters accountable and protect the public from those who seek to use their wealth and power to write laws that benefit them at the expense of everyone else (IE: banks attempting to loosen the oversight put in place to protect us from another banking fiasco, or Nestle believing they can privatize public water supplies for their own use despite the public\u2019s reliance on that water supply, etc.). SD\u2019s fully support public education and want equal access to excellent schools and affordable health care for everyone, not just those who can afford fancy private schools or expensive insurance. Libertarians like the Koch Brothers have spent their lives and a good portion of their personal fortunes trying to undermine every aspect of our social safety net, undo the ACA, and get rid of regulations they feel are too costly and unnecessary (despite the fact that these regulations were written by Congress to address specific complaints or problems such as unsafe working conditions, or the poisoning of air and ground water around coal mines, etc.) So, those who see and are upset by the amount of racism and inequality we still have in banking, housing, educational and occupational opportunities, health care outcomes, etc. and believe we need the government to stand up for the powerless would be Social Democrats. OTOH, Libertarians would insist that all people are responsible for fixing their own problems and should not rely upon the government to help them, regardless of whether they were born into poverty or privilege.

            "answer_text": "Best arguments from a social democrat: Libertarians assume that property rights derived from homesteading are absolute, when in reality they should be communally determined. If a person is born into a society where all land is already 100% owned, then they are not free to merely exist without working (since trespassing laws would presumably reign). This is not freedom. The counterargument from libertarians that such an argument could apply to all property is flawed because land is a special type of property that is different from others: it is scarce, necessary for life, and without substitutes. Food and clothing can be grown, water is always accessible (to varying degrees), shelter can be constructed, and medicine may not be needed, but a piss poor individual who starts off with zero land ownership has a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of surviving as an independent entrepreneur.We reject the NAP if applying this principle on a society-wide scale results in consequentially inferior outcomes. In other words, our starting moral principles are consistent so you cannot question the ethics of our subsequent positions without debunking consequentialist ethics first.Libertarians find ways to argue that the market will fix the tragedy of the commons and the free rider problem in every case except defense. If they were consistent, they would advocate for private militaries and police forces as well. In other words, libertarians are just hypocritical anarcho-capitalists.Best arguments from a libertarian: Most everything that can be done through the government violently can be done through the people peacefully via voluntary measures. See: Sankar Srinivasan's answer to How do libertarians propose on how the more vulnerable members of the society be taken care of?Capitalism as it currently exists is crony capitalism, so stop using a strawman to force libertarians to defend an indefensible position. You will never see a libertarian ever support bailouts, subsidies, corporate lobbying, etc. In a libertarian society, companies are successful only because they generate value for customers, and customers in a libertarian society will always have choices.The logical conclusions of libertarian philosophy are minarchism/anarcho-capitalism, which are morally sound when properly realized (see my previous linked answer). On the other hand, the logical conclusion of collectivist progressivism is Orwellian socialism, where free speech, property rights, and even bodily rights (forced blood donations, anyone?) do not exist. This is obviously not morally sound no matter how you spin it.",
