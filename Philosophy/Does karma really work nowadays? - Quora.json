            "answer_text": "I think it works with some people who are honest. Doesn't no with others, because many others doesn't think about karma and repeatedly make mistakes but i haven't seen anything bad happening with them, instead always good things happens with them and they live a luxurious life. doesn't know whether they are happy or not. May be in the later stages of life, may be our children's may suffer due to our own Karma. Or may be if there is something called rebirth we have to suffer it. Because every natural thing is mysterious. One of the example is Ramakrishna was suffering from throat cancer had the ability to get cured if he asked mother kali about it but he didn't ask anything because he knew that it was because of his karma (ignorance of health). Which he suffered till death. So karma really exists in all our activities. We will never know in what way it will come back. ",
