            "answer_text": "You know you\u2019re thinking too much when you start to be afraid of existing at all. Try concentrating on feeling for a change, feeling life inside you and in nature around you. Learn to meditate on it. The answer to the question you\u2019re asking reveals itself to you on a spiritual level and through the practical experience of living \u2014 a balanced harmony of body and mind is required to understand living. Go too far into the realm of the mind, you will lose track of your body and fall into spiritual separation from the natural processes in and around you \u2014 which in turn results in imbalanced thinking, and brings you no closer to understanding life itself. That courage, the drive to live, exists in one\u2019s spirit (body+mind) \u2014 as well as our sense of balance. ",
