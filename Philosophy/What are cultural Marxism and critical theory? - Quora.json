            "answer_text": "The Frankfurt School, i.e., the school of thought associated in part with the Instititute for Social Research at the Goethe University Frankfurt, raised a number of interesting ideas. It was founded during the interwar period, and largely consisted of neo-Marxists critical of existing systems \u2014 be they capitalism, Nazi fascism, or Soviet communism. They consisted most prominently of Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Leo Lowenthal, Walter Benjamin, Herbet Marcuse, and Eric Fromm. Many of these theorists believed that traditional theory could not adequately explain the turbulent and unexpected development of capitalist societies in the twentieth century. They implemented new theories and methods into Marxism: cultural hegemony, psychoanalysis, praxis, popular culture industry, communicative rationality. Most importantly is critical theory. It emphasizes critique of society and culture by the application of knowledge from social science and the humanities. It is directed at the totality of society, and it should improve understanding of society by integrating all major social sciences, including geography, economics, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, and psychology. It has a tendency to be called revisionist by more fundamentalist Marxists for its combination of Marxian analysis with sociological and philosophical traditions. Cultural Marxism, until the late 1990s, was an academic term used to refer to anticapitalist critiques of culture, including the global commercialization and commodification of culture (e.g., advertising, U.S. film industry, tabloid magazines), often from the Frankfurt school or similar theorists like Antonio Gramsci. It also referred to the critique of the Frankfurt school by more Orthodox Marxists of revisionism and their high academic non-revolutionary nature: i.e., that they were not revolutionary Marxists, not political Marxists, not flesh-and-blood, fighting Marxists, but merely cultural Marxists. However, more recently it refers to anticommunist propaganda and conspiracy theory spread by paleoconservatives and invented by Nazi Germany pre-war, originally labelled as Cultural Marxism as part of their degeration theory. According to the nonsense conspiracy theory, Jews, the Frankfurt School, and other left-wingers have infiltrated media, academia, and the sciences in a decades-long plot to undermine Western \"culture\" \u2014 essentially, the Illuminati conspiracy, but taken seriously for some reason.
