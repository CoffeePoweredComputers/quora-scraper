            "answer_text": "No. Let\u2019s systematically consider Tom who \u201cknows\u201d he was born on April 2nd. Tom has the belief he was born on April 2nd. However, many people have beliefs that are unjustified. Perhaps Tom was initially uncertain about his birthday, and, being a fan of Marvin Gaye who was born on April 2nd, convinced himself that his birthday was April 2nd. Simple belief is not enough for knowledge as knowledge is conventionally understood.Tom has the justified belief he was born on April 2nd. Tom has a copy of his birth certificate which clearly has April 2nd recorded as his birthday. This form of official documentation is enough for Tom to feel justified in believing he was born on April 2nd. We now have a strong belief that is strongly justified by the relevant standards of evidence conventionally accepted.Tom has the justified true belief that he was born on April 2nd. Herein lies the problem. How is Tom to know what is true? If knowing requires justified true belief, then Tom must descend into a infinite regress of needing to \u201cknow\u201d the truth of his justified belief in a proposition before he can actually \u201cknow\u201d the proposition. It does no good to say it is objectively true that Tom was born on April 2nd since Tom does not have access to that objective perspective. He is constrained to belief in propositions that he has subjectively justified. While belief and justification are subjective activities, truth is wholly objective.Therefore, knowledge can not be justified true belief. What then is knowledge? Most humans are quite willing to consider Tom\u2019s belief in his April 2nd birthday based on conventional standards of evidence as \u201cknowledge\u201d. If Tom were to discover that, upon his April 1st birth, his parents and their doctor conspired to document his birthday as April 2nd to avoid the sigma of being born on April Fools Day, most of us would not condemn Tom for saying he \u201cknew\u201d something he did not. There was epistemic honesty in Tom saying he \u201cknew\u201d April 2nd was his birthday based on his strongly justified belief. What does this teach us about knowledge as it is conventionally defined? Knowledge is intrinsically a soft concept that depends on the following: The threshold of credence which an epistemic agent deems adequte to \u201cthrow the switch\u201d from no knowledge to knowledge. While the concept of belief is instrinsically gradient, we have found the linguistic term \u201cknowledge\u201d useful to describe a rather vaguely defined high degree of belief. This threshold is entirely subjectively defined. Here we have not yet introduced justification. Some epistemic agents reach this credence switch based on wishful thinking such as in #1 above.The threshold of justification at which a more rational epistemic agent deems adequate to \u201cthrow the switch\u201d from no knowledge too knowledge. For the rational agent who wishes to justify their belief with evidence, they subjectively determine at which point in their assessment of the balance of evidence they decide they finally \u201cknow\u201d the proposition in question.Knowledge can never escape subjectivity. The objective truth behind the justified belief remains inaccessible to the knower. Epistemic agents are limited to subjective assessments of claims, and do not have access to the objective truth of the matter. Is is nonsensical to go beyond justified belief and say you \u201cknow\u201d X because you also \u201cknow X is true\u201d. This would require a vicious recursion into how you know that you know what you know.Since 1) knowledge is based on justified belief, 2) justified beliefs are based on evidence, and 3) evidence is intrinsically gradient in that it most commonly arrives incrementally to modify the balance of evidence, justified belief is itself necessarily gradient. Rational belief is a degree of belief that maps to the degree of the relevant evidence. (See the graphic below.) When new confirming/disconfiming evidence arrives, the rational mind adjusts their credence in the proposition accordingly.Philosophers may stipulate a philosophical definition of \u201cknowledge\u201d that requires that the proposition be known to be true by some omniscient agent, but this stipulated notion no longer has semblance to the conventional notion of knowledge, and has no utility in conventional parlance. Based on this discussion, we can conclude that knowledge is, at best, a useful linguistic term that denotes a degree of belief that has passed a subjectively defined credence threshold presumably based on a healthy subjective application of standards of evidence. You will note that scientists in nearly all fields tend to shy away from the term \u201cknowledge\u201d. They employ more nuanced terms such as n sigma or n standard deviations to get at the evidential degree of certainty. If one wishes to maintain epistemic honesty in context where nuance counts, more nuanced terms such as \u201cI tend to believe X\u201d or \u201cI am very uncertain that X\u201d. This reflects a desire for epistemic honesty in full acceptance of the intrinsically subjective nature of belief and justification.  ",

            "answer_text": "Whatever else \u2018knowledge\u2019 is, it\u2019s a word. There is no \u2018fact of the matter\u2019 what words \u2018really\u2019 mean. They mean whatever linguistic communities decide that they mean. An important aspect of responding to questions of this type, in my opinion, includes stressing that we should reformulate all of them into something answerable. There just is no answer to the straight ahead question asked here. At least 3 reformulations that would be answerable would be: The lexicographical question) How does a well defined linguistic community use the word \u2018knowledge\u2019. This is what dictionaries provide. The hermeneutical question) What was \u2018knowledge\u2019 for Kant/Hume/Martha Stewart/etc. This is what much exegetical philosophical or \u2018critical\u2019 work is about. Examining texts created by influential individuals to attempt to extract an account of what some word or concept meant to them. The normative question) How should we define this word? This is what many disciplines do. These are where \u2018terms of art\u2019 come from. The word W means X within medical science, etc. In my opinion, the answer to all three of these options regarding \u2018knowledge = justified true belief?\u2019 is: Yes. I think that is how the word is typically used, I think that is what the word meant to most \u2018canonical\u2019 thinkers, and I think that is how we should use the word. But! That is not to say \u2018knowledge is justified true belief\u2019. And as long as authors are clear what definition they are using, we can probably get along with a plurality of different but related definitions for \u2018knowledge\u2019. Personally, when I use the word, I mean justified true belief, and I make sure to make that clear to readers. ",
