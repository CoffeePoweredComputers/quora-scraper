            "answer_text": " Metaphor for finding justice. Photo by Author The only principle at play in your question will be entropy. Because of the basis of ethics being statistical of the populist instead of moral absolutes based on righteousness. A populist that believes there are no absolutes; that we come from nothingness; exist from a random chance of chemistry in a random Cosmos; that we are therefore considered impersonal; and are basically only a machine. These machines then provide data to where the mass determines what is ethical at the time by statical means. What was unethical yesterday becomes ethical and the past unethical. Just look how California looks at adult men having sex with children who consent. Instead of being labeled as a sexual predator. Do you not agree that evolutionary theory at a basic level has no answer to ethics? Don\u2019t you agree if rational is only defined by science and mathematics that the questions of God existing; love; morals; and the soul are dead to reason and logic? They are considered irrational. But those big questions still remain that post modernism still can not answer. Philosophy no longer can help you. You can thank Hegel for the destruction of antithesis and use of synthesis to compromise truth and absolutes. Classic philosophy is dead. That leaves you with existentialism in the populist and art, music, the culture and even the religious.  Ref. Francis Schaeffer, Trilogy, p.234. No answers there. In fact antiphilosophy grows with Critical theories on gender, sexual orientations, fat phobia, race, and cynical theory. It now is impossible to define justice in any stable form. It will breakdown into chaos. That is by design. You just have to see that some realize it before others. Like Jean-Paul Sartre (1905\u20131980) who viewed the world to be rationally absurd. Try to authenticate yourself by giving money to a poor man on a street corner as an act of your will. It is absurd. What does it matter. He is nothing. The situation is nothing. But by an act of your will you are authenticated. Really by something with no rational or logical content? All directions of the acts of the will are equal. You could have decided to hit and run that poor man on the corner as an act of your will and have equal authentication. It is a hopeless position to stand on. The trail of a final experience, or feelings of dread, or definition of words that constrains philosophy away from metaphysics all lead to the big questions into a world of anti-philosophy today. They are stuck between rationality and hope in a dichotomy that eludes humanist unity. Where do you think gender expression winds up with 1000s of possibilities beyond male and female? Or elitist Europeans who found a new world via technology they could exploit the indigenous natives not being like those today who acted similarly as elitist who manipulate technology to exploit your personal data to make money, or exploit your vote, or your value rating as a citizen in the collective or state. Colonialism deconstruction social justice would lead to technology deconstructionism today not to 1619 or 1492, but to 2020. It is all absurd and leads to chaos. More riots in the street and killings in the city. You should ask yourself why did man abandon the Reformation basis of rationality and pursue the Renaissance man? When man had found unity between rationality and hope in progressive revelation instead of progressive liberalism. Progressive revelation starts with a Creator who communicates that we were made in His image. Giving us personality, self awareness, a conscience, and a soul. He reveals His brilliance in DNA \ud83e\uddec design and our ecosystem that is impossible to self create and that is His point. The whole random Cosmos would turn dark before life would be created. And that is even mathematical. But we get answers by specific revelation in the Holy Bible. Again starting with our human dignity. Then God said, \"Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\" God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them; and God said to them, \"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\" (Genesis 1:26\u201328 NASB) It should be obvious we were made different from animals with no self image or conscience to bother them. Their soul does not go into a funk when hope is lost. But with Renaissance man views anything supernatural as irrational and thrown out. But the Bible claims to be truth beyond sciences with power and personhood that aren\u2019t necessarily contrary with Sting Theory possibilities with multiple dimensions in time and space. It is better than dark matter. The God who communicates wants man to know His word is true. The LORD said to Moses, \"Is the LORD'S power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will come true for you or not.\" So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. Also, he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and stationed them around the tent. Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do it again. (Numbers 11:23\u201325 NASB) The issue is not with God, but men who reject the God of the Bible. People whose the Spirit rested on them to communicate for God felt that rejection also. The LORD said to Samuel, \"Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being king over them. (1 Samuel 8:7, NASB) This rejection is told to us is because of our sin and being a sinner in need of a Savior. It drives man\u2019s deceitful heart to reject the truth from God and minimize it, to rationalize it doesn\u2019t exist. God\u2019s efforts persist as Jesus explained in simple terms that a lowly farmer could understand. \"Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT AND DUG A WINE PRESS IN IT, AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey. When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his produce. The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned a third. Again he sent another group of slaves larger than the first; and they did the same thing to them. But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.' They took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?\" They said to Him, \"He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the proceeds at the proper seasons.\" Jesus *said to them, \"Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone; THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'? (Matthew 21:33\u201352 NASB) Jesus was that cornerstone whose foundation is true on every side. He is the Truth and was that Son who died so man could be free. The Reformation Man recognized it and found unity and peace. The man of the Renaissance world never did. NASB used by permission from the Lockman Foundation ",

            "answer_text": "Ethics is a journal of rules relative to a society, association, or doctrine. A particular ethic may or may not conform to humankind\u2019s pursuit of humble-integrity. The record of the journey to humble-integrity is human ethics. Not all humans participate. The fourth century BC Greeks suggested some behaviors for developing humble-integrity. I share my interpretations of the principles. First, accept that ineluctable-good constitutes civic behavior. Second, ineluctably good citizens neither initiate nor tolerate harm to or from any person or civic institution. Third, civic citizens develop human equity under statutory justice. Dissidents are encouraged to reform. Fourth, fellow citizens who reject humility invite woe and may suffer statutory law, even though justice has not been established. Civic citizens develop and encourage humble-integrity under statutory justice. ",
