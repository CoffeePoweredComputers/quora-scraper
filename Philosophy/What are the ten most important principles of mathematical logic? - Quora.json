            "answer_text": "I am not sure, what you mean by writing on principles of mathematical logic. If one takes into account, for example, logic of zero-order (classical propositional calculus), then one introduces the logical variables, the logical functors: conjunction, disjunction etc., one defines also the set of all well-built formulas (language of classical propositional calculus), one also assumes that the logical formulas can take only one from two logical values: \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d, and defines also the notion of tautology (a well-built formula, which takes always logical value \u201c1\u201d). In such approach you can check, whether the given formula is tautology, by using zero-one method or method by contradiction (of course, you need to know the tables of truth for conjunction, disjunction etc.). Moreover, if one considers logic of zero-order (classical propositional calculus), as a system, then there are necessary: axioms and rules of inference. For example, you can write such system of logic of zero-order (classical propositional calculus), symbolically as: <R_{0+}, A>, where R_{0+} - the set of rules of inference (there are: Modus Ponens and substitution rule), A - the set of axioms of classical propositional calculus. Of course, one has also to define and operation of consequence, and now one can derive new theses of classical propositional calculus. ",
