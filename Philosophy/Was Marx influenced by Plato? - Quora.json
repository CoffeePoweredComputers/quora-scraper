            "answer_text": "There is no proof that Marx was influenced by Plato. In the history of philosophy, it is usually said that philosophy originated from Plato\u2019s dialogues but I think it was overrated by some Socratic worshippers. For countless generations, people have been falling into the same problems as did the philosophers 2000 or 4000 years ago, because the way we are using language makes us ask the same questions as they did. Wittgenstein showed a revolutionary approach to such philosophical problems, which is worth checking out. And Marx showed that he was influenced by Aristotle and when a young student he was interested in Stoicism and Post-Hellenistic philosophical schools. People have usually made connections between Plato and Marx because of Karl Popper\u2019s works. He argued the philosophical origins of Communism were in Plato\u2019s work. I agree with some parts of Popper\u2019s work but it seems he hardly made any distinctions among Hegel, Marx and Engels. Marx isn\u2019t Platonist nor Hegelian, and he abandoned Philosophical activities because its nonsense in contrast of Engels who in the end has become a metaphysician in Platonist-Hegelian tradition.

            "answer_text": "I think Marx was probably not influenced by Plato, regardless of Popper and of Socrates\u2019s communism among the Guardians in the Republic. Popper is an inventive anti-totalitarian, and the Republic\u2019s communism is to try to free philosophers from earthly ties (whereas in Marx\u2019s future society we all labor in order to satisfy needs and to shape and reshape nature and ourselves. Marx was in many ways a student of Aristotle, however. I think he calls Aristotle the mightiest thinker of antiquity in the opening chapters of *Capital*. I could go a lot further, including to Aristotle\u2019s kind of dialectical reasoning in his lectures/books, where he starts from common opinion and then uses facts and logic to clarify it further and further, and including Aristotle\u2019s emphasis on what people do as an important part of any book, like the Politics, talking about what they should do or what human virtues are. I don\u2019t believe that paintings depict philosophers accurately, but Raphael has Plato pointing towards the heavens \u2014 and, presumably, the realm of Ideas \u2014 and Aristotle pointing towards the earth or the world around us. Marx clearly is in Aristotle\u2019s camp. ",
