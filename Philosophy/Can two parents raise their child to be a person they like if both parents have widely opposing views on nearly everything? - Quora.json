I got my PhD. and retired as the head of the foreign language department of a foreign university. 2 divorces (My bipolar had a lot to do with that) My youngest brother had 3 boys, married his high school sweetheart. One of his boys just graduated from West Point. My middle brother took a little longer to graduate from college but now heads a successful health care management company based here in Houston. Happily married with one boy. All that to say as parents just be the type of person you want your child to be. ",

However my husband and i have different views on things the boys (my 2 youngest) need to be doing around the house. I say they need to help out and clean up after themself where as my husband says they will just make a bigger mess and I should just do it myself so I dont get stressed out and have to yell at them. My husband and I don't agree on much when it comes to the boys and chores. ",

If their conversations are civil, genuine and respectful the child could learn a great deal and they could both like him as a person (all other things being equal). On the other hand you could get parents who NEVER have opposing views who could do a terrible job by never discussing anything. Its way more about respect than opposing or similar views. ",

And hopefully not be gazing at their narcissistic navels, considering their kid just an extension of their, in that case, very immature self. ",
