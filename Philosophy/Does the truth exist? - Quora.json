            "answer_text": "In classical metaphysics truth is what corresponds to reality. If I claim to hold an apple in my hand and I actually do have an apple in my hand it is truth. If I claim to hold an apple in my hand but I don't actually have a apple in my hand then it is false. Truth is a label that we give to things that correspond with reality. But what now is actual reality ? What is the truth about reality itself? Welcome to the world of Metaphysics. I personally hold that God is both a logical and metaphysical necessity for existence itself. God himself is metaphysical in nature and so it is only fitting that Reality itself will always remain metaphysical in nature. I hold to the classical metaphysics of Aristotle. At least as far as methodology is concerned. Thomas Aquinas built his metaphysics off of Aristotle and many hold to Aquinas\u2019 metaphysics to this very day. Here is an article on Reality but you would do well to contemplate it for yourself. Keep in mind that everyone most hold to some form of a philosophical worldview. We have no choice but to philosophize and presuppose something about the nature of reality and existence itself. All men must live by faith by divine design. God is forcing Man to hold metaphysical/ontological commitments of belief concerning reality itself. For God alone is ultimate reality and this is where all rational metaphysics must lead if one wants to know the ultimate truth of things. If you can conclude to the truth of these things then the question becomes which god is the true God? Reality - Wikipedia ",
