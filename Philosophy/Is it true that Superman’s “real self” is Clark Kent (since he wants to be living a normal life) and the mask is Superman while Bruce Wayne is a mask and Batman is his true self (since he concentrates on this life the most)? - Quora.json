            "answer_text": "True? It's a slippery slope that has been written either way for both characters. Before Marvel arrived on tye scene the secret identity was a civilian one. It was mostly an afterthought on the writers part and inherently a disguise. Clark being the real guy does much to humanize Kal El and allows us to relate to him better. But he's still a bookish nerd that no one in their right mind would ever think is Superman. The case can, and has, been made both ways. Now look at Batman or rather Bruce Wayne, billionaire playboy. That is most certainly an act. But the writing, as I stated, isn't consistent. Sometimes Bruce is an upstanding member of the community who simply exercises a different sort of power to achieve equally noble goals. The better question is what you, the reader, think. Which version of Superman and Batman respectively appeals to you more? Then go out and look for that as there is plenty of both out there to be found. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on the writer, and there have been a lot of different ones, but in the stories showing their tragedy and soul best, the answer is: No, Superman is not really wearing a mask, Superman is an immigrant, an adoptee, the last son of Krypton, sure he may have a Supergirl, a Powergirl, a Krypto and a Kandor, but Krypton is dead, but as long as his heart beats, Krypton is not entirely dead yet... but the very same man is also a former hayseed city Metropolitean US tax payer and citizen. Two roles, two histories, two sets of values, combined in one man who is fighting the good fight and contributing to society. Not so different from a cantor in a very small synagogue, GP during the week, you might not recognize him in his different role, but he is just the same guy, with a very interesting life. Clark Kenting he is just down-playing his abilities to integrate in the social experiment, so he can be really a US Citizen, American or Earthling, while being nice about it. He is not wearing a mask, at least not in that identity, he is just showing different aspects of himself. Batman tends to be Batman... ",
