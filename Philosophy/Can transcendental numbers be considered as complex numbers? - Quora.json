            "answer_text": "First, here's why any non-zero root of any complex number can always be determined . Let z\u2208Cz\u2208C be any complex number.  Let s\u22600s\u22600 be any real root.  (It can actually be complex too, but real is probably what you meant.)  If  z=0z=0 then z1s=0z1s=0.  Otherwise, \u2203\u00a0r\u2208R+\u2203\u00a0r\u2208R+ and \u03b8\u2208[0,2\u03c0)\u03b8\u2208[0,2\u03c0) such that z=rei\u03b8z=rei\u03b8.  (See Complex number: Polar form if you don't know why this is true.) Then let  x=z1s=(rei\u03b8)1s=r1s(ei\u03b8s)x=z1s=(rei\u03b8)1s=r1s(ei\u03b8s).   So we see that x\u2208Cx\u2208C is one possible ss-root of zz.  (I say one possible because there are infinitely many valid roots, but that's not so important for your question.) Now, as for transcendental numbers, they can be real or complex.  That means that the roots of a transcendental number can always be computed as well (as we just showed). So the conclusion is, there must not be a contradiction. Perhaps you are misunderstanding the definition of a transcendental number.  Such a number is, itself, not ever equal to the root of any polynomial equation with rational coefficients. So an equation like x2\u2212c=0x2\u2212c=0 has roots given by the positive and negative square root of cc.  And such a root always exists (although it may be complex).  But it will never be transcendental as long as cc is rational. ",

If a number aa is transcendental it has all of its nth roots, but they are also transcendental. You can construct the polynomial xn\u2212a=0xn\u2212a=0 but it doesn't have rational coefficients. ",
