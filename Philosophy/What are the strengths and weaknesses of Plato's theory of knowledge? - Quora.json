            "answer_text": "Plato\u2019s theory of knowledge is that knowledge is justified true belief. That is, to qualify as knowledge, a belief must be true, and we must be justified in believing that it is true - it is not just true by coincidence. The strength of this theory is that it has stood the test of time and applies in almost all cases. The weakness is that there are a small number of exceptions, known as Gettier Problems. ",
