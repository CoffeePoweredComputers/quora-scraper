            "answer_text": "Quoted from 'thisibelieve.org' \"Since, I was a child my parents taught me that the life I have right now is a blessing from God. I believe life is a blessing from God simply because we get the chance to live it even for a short period. God created male and female and blessed them. Also, I see complexity of the universe and life. I believe that there has to be a starting point of how we all started because life is to complex to just have happened. For example, birth itself is a miracle. I feel that watching a child grow is one of the most wonderful things in this world. Children are a gift and blessing from God so we must treasure them for as long as we can. Also, when I looked into the anatomy of human being, I personally concluded that this is the most awesome human body with its miraculous structure and function could never evolved automatically without a wise designer behind it and I believe that God is the creator behind this mystery of life that we have. However, one day when my little sister passed away two years ago, I came to the point in my life when I started to lose my faith to him. I was down and helpless because God couldn\u2019t do anything to bring back my sister. He left a big scar in my heart that will never be erased because even if I pray to him everyday the life of my sister can never be replaced. Yet, after all the difficulties that came in to my life, my parents never losses faith to God. I regret blaming him for taking my sister\u2019s life. Though he only gave us eleven years to spend time with my sister, I still thank him, that was eleven years of so many great and unforgettable memories that will always stay in our heart. I remember when we used to go to the park with my sister. We had so much fun and laughter together. I will never forget the moment when I seen her being born in this world. It was the most wonderful moment in my life. I can still picture my mom\u2019s facial reaction after my sister was born. Her face was full of happiness. She cried for a moment and thank God for the life of my sister. My family is very thankful to God for giving us a chance to treasure every moment with my sister even for a short period of time. At the end, I believe that life is a blessing from God no matter how long because he gave us the opportunity to live our life, and so we have to appreciate every minute that we have in this world. Each of us is only here for a time and none of us can assume that we\u2019ll be here tomorrow. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t easy to see life, particularly human life, with a certain level of objectivity. You see, it\u2019s a fixed framework within which we work and do all our thinking, and no wonder it gets overwhelming in here. We have a lot to do and think about before contemplating life and its meaning. Most of us don\u2019t bother because there are sufficient hormones inside us to engage our conscience. Also, we have some kind of a stabilizing and filtering mechanism inside our heads that would prevent us from asking too many questions. But some of us who have moved up the Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs have spare time to think about more unimportant questions. Questions like is life meaningful? First off, is life a blessing or a curse? My answer would be neither; life is just a complicated physical system that is not yet entirely comprehensible. The universe has no plans laid for us. My answer is dreary and not in line with the general human thought process, which has utmost reverence for reasons. Humans can\u2019t live with the fact that most of the things happening around are random events, and therefore, they go on to make plausible stories about everything. So when we think about life in a holistic sense, we tend to create our own stories by choosing sides. Life is either deemed a blessing, something desirable, worthwhile, or a curse, an illusion, a vicious cycle. It is difficult to think of life as something that just is, with no \u2018actual\u2019 meaning and maybe without a creator. We love to live in denial. The most popular answers to the question of life are in our religions. There\u2019s no doubt that religions have acted as great stabilizers to us by providing convenient explanations and purpose, a role that has been of late assumed by nationalism and humanity. And it\u2019s amazing how our religions share similar structures, with partly humanitarian and partly supernatural themes. However, they do differ in the fundamental way they look at life. Some will tell you that life\u2019s precious, and others would expect you to break this cycle of life. Of the two approaches, the blessing one is a more obvious stabilizer: given the axiomatic desirability of happiness, enjoy your lives, and even when you can\u2019t, value it as something inherently and almost infinitely valuable. Modern humans have tried to rationalize this thought by shifting the value from life to the vivid experiences (given the part of our lives outside our body is plenty for our brains to feast on) that we might gain in our lifetimes. I reckon that thinking of life as something precious is not nonsense because we know and understand nothing beyond our lives. I mean, depending on how you define life, this statement can have many complicated implications. One obvious implication is that we can\u2019t be certain about the afterlife. Another is that even if everything going around us is an illusion, this illusion\u2019s all we can be reasonably sure about. I might know stuff about the universe, but my knowledge and understanding, which are definitely affected by my brain\u2019s interface to the world, are very much the part of the physical system my life is. If our life is the fixed and the all-mighty framework in my consciousness exists, should it not be the strongest contender for the objectively \u2018valuable\u2019 list? The Eastern/Indian approach is to think that it\u2019s all suffering, pain, and illusion, which I assume is a less intuitive but a more conservative approach. Emotions are one of the driving factors of life, and since the world sucks in ways unimaginable, you may not always be able to hold on to your \u201cblessings\u201d approach. So, what do you do? You assume the default status as suffering so that you have a kind of consolation when you are grief-stricken. When you\u2019re not, then you may either live in the moment (maybe value it more) or think of that phase as a distraction or an evil plot to drag you into more sufferings. To me, this approach\u2019s too gloomy. It warrants mass suicides unless we conceive a heavenly breakaway in the form of literal heaven (baikunth/swarg in Hinduism) or salvation (Moksh in Hinduism and Nirvana in Buddhism). But this idea is so beautifully ingrained in our culture and literature that we live in harmony with it despite its apparent disturbing nature. The complication with this approach is that the new educated class is less likely to believe in a heaven and therefore seems to have shifted the \u2018ultimate and inevitable truth\u2019 status to death. And yet we live on, perhaps with much lesser existential crisis prevalent than the west. It might be because we\u2019re behind them by a few decades. It also may be the case that thinking of life, particularly attachments, as a basic form of distraction and on top of it, accepting death as the destiny somehow works. But now that we\u2019re considering death as our truth, is it not counter-intuitive that this whole idea was intended to be a stabilizer? Perhaps, our core philosophy has transformed into something like this: given you have to die anyway and leave all your money and loved ones here, you should try to do something for which people remember you after you die. This idea is built on Indian philosophy but has an evident western influence; when you stop believing in heavens, you are compelled to attach \u201cobjective\u201d value to the \u201cworldly things\u201d. As I indicated earlier, the way I perceive the word \u201cobjective\u201d, there is no objective positive or negative value in life. Life is not inherently a blessing or a curse. So, should we all commit suicide? To this, an average simple-minded person might reply that why have so many f*cks about the question of life, and I\u2019m afraid he might be correct in pointing that out. Remember that \u2018we\u2019 are residing somewhere in our heads, and the whole concept of meaning is a product of our amazing brains. Purpose is a construct. It may just be to your brain to decide what it wants to prioritize: social bonds, money, religion, humanitarian stuff, pleasures, power, so-called objective truth, or simply living in the present. Sadly, if the answer for someone is that nature must have an intent for him to live, and there must be an external power or life must have an objective value or meaning, he may choose to bid farewell to the Earth. PS:- That\u2019s precisely why I like the idea behind existentialism. Instead of looking for an objective meaning, go find some random meaning (your society has already enlisted a few of them for you) and try to believe in those with all your heart. Even better, try a combo of hedonism and some meaning which align with typical human interests; this way, other humans will give you less trouble, and there\u2019s a high chance your life will be \u2018well\u2019 spent.
