Many countries found Marxism as an ideology useful, others opt for capitalism. I will suggest two of my books for someone in the West interested in contemporary philosophy - the one about the 9 types of questions, from simple questions asking for data or information like: is the sun shining outside? To more subtle ones concerning insights and understanding, then more complex ones that enable the making of judgments and even more complex ones that assist in the making of evaluations. PHILOSOPHY \u2013 Aims, Methods, Rationale In this meta-philosophical study I commence with an investigation of Wisdom. I then continue with an exploration of the institutionalization of the subject and the professionalization of those involved in it. This I contrast with original and creative philosophizing. In then sows that philosophizing resembles and attempts to do theorizing.

            "answer_text": "The best seems to be the work of St. Thomas Aquinas, who followed Aristotle in most things. Then there are the DIALOGUES of Plato. St. Augustine has many works that are both Philosophical and Theological. His most frequently referred to work is his CONFESSIONS, while his longest and most varied is his THE CITY OF GOD, which King Charlemagne had read to him as often as possible while he ate. This book is thought to be the real basis of Christendom! Since the word PHILOSOPHY comes from two Greek words meaning the love of wisdom, any work that searches out or declares the meaning of something is generally called philosophy. There are a huge number of authors, in the West especially, who have produced works of philosophy. However, few are useful. Why? Many authors merely react to previous author or have a double purpose. I think true philosophy communicates an account of REALITY that is REALISTIC and TRUE. Today you will find online a blogger who always tries to be truthful.

            "answer_text": "Not any in particular! Instead, we should see philosophy as the thin edge of science. Philosophy can be wrong and has been wrong on many things, but it sets the standard below which there is no science. I think the most important contribution of philosophy is to open new territories for investigation. Initially, it may be difficult to do any hard science on it, but just talking about it as rationally as we know to do it, and philosophy certainly does that, is a good way to prepare the ground for some science. Short of that, all we have is common sense and religion. Talking about a subject is the best way to get people interested and to get them to try and do something that will be good enough to make the philosophy of it obsolete. That being said, the closer to metaphysics we get, the less likely science will ever have anything to say about it, questions such as the \u201cnature\u201d of subjective experience. Because of this, philosophy will always have something to talk about. Whether it may be really useful may be itself a philosophical question. ",
