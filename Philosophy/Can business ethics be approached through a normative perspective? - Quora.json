            "answer_text": "Isn\u2019t this how it is usually done? A normative perspective is something that relies on a social definition of what is good or bad behavior, and what is most commonly considered proper behavior. Well, we consider lying to be bad. We consider not paying your bills to be bad. Businesses that engage in bad behavior are not trusted, because they don\u2019t hew to the same norms that other businesses do - they look for opportunities to take advantage of people. It is very difficult to conduct business if you aren\u2019t trusted. Observing norms builds trust. ",
