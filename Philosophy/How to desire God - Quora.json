            "answer_text": "I cannot. God is apparently, if we can believe his portraits, especially those on the roof of of the Sistine Chapel, a large, hairy, and very male personage, dressed partially in a curtain or a bedsheet, who is depicted trying to finger up a good looking naked man. I am also a largish, hairy, male personage, who while I am not the least bit homophobic, I am also not the least bit interested in fingering up young men, no matter how good looking. So no, I have no desire for God, nor can I have. Now maybe if he were she, that might be different. I will admit having the hots for some of the Greek, and the Roman gods, or even the Norse gods, although Valhalla does sound a bit too much like an eternal, and noisy, drunken brawl with Valkyries in iron bras whooping around, for it to be really relaxing. And since I don't do drugs, the Indian gods, the ones with elephants heads and all the arms are a bit over the top, too. No, if I ever desire a god, I think I might go with Venus, and a Mediterranean beach, with my old pal Bacchus bringing the libations. ",

So when you align your personality\u2019s mind with your soul\u2019s consciousness, you are: following the way of the Dharma (Hinduism)following the way of the Tao (Daosim)following the way of your passions (Bentham\u2019s consequentialism)\u2026 and in this way you are connecting to your Creator.

            "answer_text": "Why should you desire God? This is the first question. The answer is that humans are social animals with poor sense perception, subject to behaving through habits that work with the most efficiency and least effort. We learn from our mistakes and prefer the acceptance of crowd decisions to logic. Without understanding natural phenomena humans began to find reasons for spirits or gods to control natural events and creation and purpose for the universe. The desire is for understanding, conviction and control of natural forces. This is not based on logic or the examination of nature by scientific methods. It is the acceptance by trust, faith, and belief that supernatural images tale the form of deities. Science cannot offer certainty, only the probability of sense examination. Whe you desire certainty rather than uncertainty you must have faith. ",
