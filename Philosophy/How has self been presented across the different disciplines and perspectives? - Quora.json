            "answer_text": "If you look at Judaism, the self is the part which is the consciousness between the holy soul and animal body. Focusing on the Kingdom of the Holy will empower it. In Christianity, the overcoming of evil and choosing good is the self. In Islam, the Jihad is the conscious self is overcoming the body's desires of evil to reach spiritual perfection. In the Bahai Religion self is the choice of either being a healer or a torturer it's your focus which affects you in the skill you have been given. In Psychology Maslow calls, self-actualization the self. Freud called it the Ego is the self between the Super-Ego and Unconscious Abraham Hicks calls the self the part which can be connected to God or to the limits of the perception of this world. Ive learnt self is the focus you give in this world. Lots of luck with the journey. ",
