            "answer_text": "What a philosophical query! I would counter that question with a few anothers. How does a blind person describe \u201dbeauty\u201d, if he can't (physically) \u201csee\u201d? Can beauty be defined as an object, person, place, thought, condition, state of being, personality, etc.? And if so, would not one person \u201csee\u201d the subject in the same manner as another person? Just what does contitute the ability to \u201csee beauty\u201d? You are obviously asking MY personal opinion about said inquiry; as this is a very nebulus quote. Then my answer would have to be a resounding \u201cYES\u201d! Example: I don't think I'd appreciate it if I'd just given birth to the \u201cuglest\u201d human being ever seen, and ask other people if they think my baby is beautiful, and really, honestly be prepared for a truthful answer. \u201cNO!\u201d because my \u201creality\u201d/opinion is that MY baby is indeed the most beautiful being ever \u201cseen\u201d! AH-HA!!! See what I mean? Looking at it from that standpoint, I'm fairly certain you can get my meaning. IT'S ALL ABOUT PERCEPTION AND IS RELATIVE TRUTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL! If YOU think you see beauty in whatever capacity/circumstance; then it is (to YOU). (It is what it is!). Hopes answers your question. ",
