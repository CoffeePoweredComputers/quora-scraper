            "answer_text": "Time cannot exist without consciousness. It only exists in the human mind. More precisely, in conscious beings\u2019 minds. In accordance with the theory of relativity, time is interchangeable with space within the space-time continuum. In a way, time is only the fourth (or first) space dimension in that continuum. Our consciousness is moving steadily along that fourth axis of the space-time chart. This is actually giving us the impression that everything is changing. We are moving along that time axis and everything else around us seem to be moving as well. That seemingly steady translation of our conscious focus along that one space -time coordinate is deeply ingrained in our subconscious. Although there are many other dimensions and countless possible universes, this particular fourth-dimensional space-time continuum is static per se. Therefore, all events that \u201chappened\u201d in our \u201cpast,\u201d from the perspective \u201coutside\u201d of this space-time continuum, actually exist simultaneously. But there could exist many varieties of time itself. Imagine that there are beings whose conscious focus is moving in the opposite direction along the fourth coordinate of this 4D continuum. To them, the reality would also be perfectly credible, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be conscious at all. Although their reality would be completely different than ours, they would live their lives unaware of our \u201ctime\u201d and perhaps of our existence altogether. Moreover, there could exist beings whose conscious focus is moving steadily (or unsteadily?) along one of the other three coordinates of our space-time continuum. Their existence would probably be completely unrecognizable to our minds. Yet, their lives would be absolutely plausible to them, as they would find their ways of connecting different things or events within their consciousness. Actually, that would be completely natural to them. We can go even further on: the existence of entities whose \u201ctime\u201d is two-dimensional or multidimensional is also possible. Their conscious focus would be moving not along one coordinate only, but two or more. Theoretically, there could be infinite number of dimensions, which implies the possibility of infinite \u201ctypes\u201d of conscious minds. However, string theory (and M-theory as its subset) envisions existence of 10 or 11 dimensions in total, of which our familiar 4 space-time dimensions are fully \u201cdeveloped\u201d or infinite, and the rest are infinitesimally small. Yet, things are even more complicated than all of this. We are not only living in a \u201cblock universe\u201d which is static from the 4D perspective; quantum physics tells us that in every single moment of our conscious existence we are \u201ccollapsing the quantum wave function\u201d and choosing only one of the countless possible universes that lie ahead of us. So, we are not some passive experiencers of reality, we are actively choosing our reality ahead and making it real. Still, all those possible lines of time are real in a sense, we could say, as \u201cpotential realities.\u201d These potential realities are also part of the whole picture. Some other beings might be going along those potential timelines, but they are real to them, as our is potential to them. Not only that, there are countless potential timelines behind us, as possible past events that could lead us to this here-and-now reality. And we are aware of one timeline only, to which our memory is tied (except in some cases of the so-called \u201cfalse memories\u201d). Therefore, the whole picture is far more complex than to looking at \u201csimple\u201d 4D relativistic continuum. Nevertheless, although we are still far from a final \u201ctheory of everything,\u201d everything we have learned so far directs us toward a conclusion that the reality and consciousness within it are inseparable, both with potential to have endless manifestations. And consciousness plays a dynamic role in these manifestations \u2013 it actively chooses its path all the time. ",

            "answer_text": "So I'm no fancy professor and I don't have a PhD in some very strange but oddly cool field, but I do like to talk so I'll feed my input.  So it seems as though time does exist without consciousness. When no one is around, a tree will still fall and make noise, as Mark Schannon answered. But, at least the way I see it, time and consciousness are linked. So I would say that time is a physicality of the universe. It works the way it does, and we're still trying to figure out how it does what it does. Consciousness interprets the passage of this physicality.  We've all fallen asleep before. Do you feel every moment of those hopefully 8 hours a night? If you are a regular human, I would guess not. And if you do, I feel really sorry for you, it doesn't seem fun to lay consciously for 8 hours and not move. Time is passing, but you do not feel it, you do not sense it. So therefore I guess time would exist without consciousness, unless you still consider being asleep being conscious. But even then, if you are knocked out, you are not conscious, you are specifically unconscious, and time goes on around you. If you are going to the extreme of saying that even one conscious person affects the time across the universe, then I suppose there is no way we could ever or will ever know if time can exist without consciousness. But a different concept and an equally fascinating question: Can time exist without consciousness? Say everyone fell unconscious, or died. Without monitoring the universe, we would have no way of knowing that time stayed constant, moving linearly forward, until life or consciousness was  ushered back into the equation, and we began monitoring time again.  In conclusion, its a very hard question to answer and I certainly don't have the answer, but I enjoy talking, so I hope I at least didn't embarrass myself and was able to spark some more thought. Or maybe none of this made sense because I'm a tired highschooler and its last period.  ",

            "answer_text": "I had typed out a long explanation about how thinking is a function of the brain which requires time and the whole argument on what the true source of consciousness is, but I won't waste your time. Would your question had been an easier one to answer. If you subscribe to materialism, then everything which exists requires three things: matter, space, and time. A physical thing existing in a physical place for a tangible (maybe not by human standards - i.e. possibly very small) duration. Then, consciousness exists in the brain, it is the firing of neurons (basically electricity) and there is no consciousness without an amount of time for it to occur. At t = 0, consciousness = 0. If you believe in the soul as the source of that unique feeling of being \u201cyou\u201d out of all other possible beings in this vast universe, that the brain is a mere conduit for our senses with an otherworldly source, then I might suggest to you that consciousness might exist outside of the reality you and I experience every day. I won't claim you need to believe either explanation. ",

            "answer_text": "This is physics issue:  Time is a bizarre creature.  Directions in space are all equal; position in space offers no preferential box on which to stand and make judgments.  Time, on the other hand, has a direction, one that leads from the  low entropy (order) immediately after the Big Bang...to high entropy (disorder.)  According to Sean Carroll, in an excruciatingly difficult book for a non-physicist (moi), \"The arrow of time exists because the universe evolves in a certain way.\" Having struggled for years to understand how time can be the fourth dimension, Carroll and others offer models to demonstrate this concept.  After my second Jameson Irish Whiskey, his explanations begin to make sense.  But I disagree with Mr. Weinberg, above, that \"sensing, knowing, thinking, and judging are dimensions 5-8.\"   Come on, it's hard enough to get my head around 4 dimensions & some string theorists argue that there are 12 or 13 spatial dimensions, all but 3 of which have curled into little balls...whatever the hell that means.  But this isn't philosophy, it's physics. So, the short answer is that, yes, time, as a function of entropy, existed before human consciousness and it will endure the end of humanity.   Yes, and trees that falls in the forest when there's no people around do make a sound...as long as one defines sound correctly. O.k., let the battles begin, LOL. ",

How Special Relativity Works The problem of timekeeping is best highlighted by the expansion of railroads over North America in 19th century. There was a need of standardised time across the vast continent and synchronicity. Whereas Time itself is not absolute it seems here on Earth the construct of Time (as we use it) is manmade. Human beings have created highly sophisticated devices such as Quantum Level Clocks although this is an incredibly highly accurate measuring device. The Quantum Logic Clock Time is all subjective experiences (unique to each individual) although your own consciousness is \"quite literally a Time machine'. ",

Knuth\u2020 and Newshaw Bahreyn is a technical paper which offers an explanation of time as a cultural construct which emerges based on the need to represent a succession of events against a linear metric.  In their proposal, events seen by different observers are key physical factors which their mathematics seeks to relate.  Reading their material, it is hard to imagine time emerging without intelligent observers seeking to coordinate their observations.On a somewhat metaphysical note, accepting space-time as a given, all inanimate objects must be thought of as four dimensional space-time volumes.  Conscious observers define the present, past and future.  Inanimate objects have no sense of the present--they are space-time volumes. In that sense, the bifurcation of time into past and future demands a conscious presence.  It makes no sense without consciousness. ",

As Einstein famously wrote, \"People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\" This \"illusion\" that we feel ourselves existing in only one moment (the present moment) of this dimension and being moved through it would seem to be a property of consciousness. You may ask, but why do I feel that this particular moment is the present rather than any other moment. However, if you think about it, you at every moment in your conscious life would feel that that moment is the present (and could ask the same question, what's special about now), so there's really nothing special about now. Every moment feels like the present somewhere in time. (I should note that although Einstein's view is the prevailing one in physics, some physicist and philosophers of physics like Lee Smolin, Richard Muller, and Tim Maudlin do view the passage of time as real in physics).

Consider: In the absence of any awareness to quantify the passage of events, every state change occurs instantaneously as all intervals  collapse to nothing (it is only through awareness that events, even the most seemingly ephemeral,  can occur  at a limited rate enough to give rise to the Universe as a continuous whole -- past, present, and future). Hence time cannot exist without at least one  conscious entity to measure it. It is for this reason that I would go so far as to extrapolate that consciousness is thus an intrinsic feature of the Universe itself on some level that perhaps we still cannot observe directly. ",

We seem to be discussing the concept of 'Universal' time, which has the characteristic of a lifespan i.e. there is a beginning of time and there will be an end of time. Fairly recently physicists have been exploring the notion that the big bang was not a one-off event. So 'our' big bang might have been the umpteenth in a series of big bangs that are continuing to take place right now in far away area of space way beyond the boundaries of our observable universe.  So what of the 'time' between big bang events? Is there not an argument for a concept of (for want of a better term) 'super-universal' time? Time that just exists. No beginning , no end, no way of measuring. ",
