            "answer_text": "I happen to get very stressed when I\u2019m bored. Relaxing for me is one of the most stressful things I can do. For that reason, I try to keep myself as busy as possible. I\u2019m the type of guy who actually feels very guilty when I feel I have slept too long. For this reason I try to fill up my time with as much as possible. When I was younger this would usually be learning something new, reading a story I\u2019ve always wanted to read\u2026 something that would make my mind feel like I\u2019m accomplishing something. As I\u2019ve gotten older, I have noticed this is a problem because I never gave myself time to sit down and think about who I am or what I\u2019m doing. I was merely satisfied by filling my time with stuff but I didn\u2019t care to think about the stuff itself and if that was important to me. I have learned to, as Miamians say, eat shit. I limit my wasted time to be moments where I try to think about nothing. Clear my mind, wipe the slate clean, and figure out what I should be doing. I realized spending so much time being productive actually wasted a lot of time if those \u201cproductive\u201d things didn\u2019t actually bring me joy or benefit me in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Boredom is one of my biggest fears too. It is so common to see people happy to take \u201cearly retirement\u201d so that they can relax, travel, golf and have as much free time to do nothing as they want. This is good for the first few weeks. But then, golfing, traveling and doing nothing becomes incredibly boring. It is a fate worse than death. Having no responsibilities, no commitments and no challenges is one of the worst things that can happen to you. I am an entrepreneur and once I was complaining to a friend of mine who worked in a corporation how stressed out I was with so much work, clients demanding, too much preparation, etc., etc. She replied to me: \u201cHey, it is a lot better being stressed out with too much work, then having nothing to do. She was exactly right. Being bored means feeling useless, lifeless and disconnected. You might as well be a plant. It is good that you fear boredom. ",
