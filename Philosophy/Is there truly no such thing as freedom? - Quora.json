            "answer_text": "Freedom is a state of mind and it is we,the people who with their made up societal norms ,snatch it away. A bird flying freely in the sky,a lion roaring in the forest, a monkey climbing through trees etc experience the true freedom. For humans freedom has become a long lost dream as we replace our shackles from one from to the other. Somewhere we are under a foreign rule,someplace else we have an indigenous dictator,,then there are places where we are tied to our company\u2019s yearly targets or are imprisoned with thoughts of the next car that we should buy. Real freedom for me is doing what our mind wants us to do at that very moment. It can only be achieved if we do not care about the society\u2019s views of our action. I am not saying that whatever you do will always be right but i can assure you that this will make you feel truly free. ",
