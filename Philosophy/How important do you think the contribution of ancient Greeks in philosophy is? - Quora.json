            "answer_text": "Incalculably so. Just for starters they invented the idea of philosophy itself. So some might say without them it wouldn\u2019t exist as it does today, being led by Eastern thought instead. They pursued natural philosophy, the precursor to science, like Thales of Miletus or Aristotle, and more abstract ideals like Plato. They pioneered new ways to talk about knowledge and argue, like Socrates. Aristotle is responsible for creating a system of formal logic that we still largely use today. He also mused on the fundamentals of political philosophy along with Plato, examining themes of Justice, Virtue, who the best rulers were, what man\u2019s place in the natural world was. Because these early thinkers covered such fundamental questions, they remain relevant to modern readers. As an example, Plato\u2019s dissection of justice in the Republic will either be refreshingly thorough or laboriously long. Even if you disagree with his conclusions, it\u2019s still valuable to remind oneself of what it is we criticise or champion in an age where we assume we know so well what justice is that we either take it\u2019s importance for granted or dismiss its value in a relativistic world. People like Pythagoras and Euclid turned mathematics into its own field of study. Nearly every one had their own theories on the nature of reality. Thales thought everything was made up of water in various forms. Democritus thought it was made up of tiny invisible pieces called atoms (though not quite how we know them, the fundamental notion of them was in place). It\u2019s questions and thoughts like these that got people to investigate realms they previously hadn\u2019t thought existed. Why look beyond the human senses if you don\u2019t think they are limited? When Medieval Europe rediscovered Aristotle\u2019s works around the 12th century, he formed the basis of Christian natural theology for centuries. So in the most literal sense the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophy influenced the core of the world\u2019s most widespread set of ideals which would come to spread to the four corners of the earth. In an increasingly secular Europe, the fact that, in many people\u2019s lives, the Greek philosophers would outlive Christianity despite being half a millennium older than it, says something about how ingrained in the Western mind they are.

            "answer_text": "IT is not a question on how important is but a matter of existence. Let me make it more clear : Philosophy is a pure Greek word. What i am trying to say is that the Greekness of the word in its self shows, (said in a way that will satisfy the questioner), so it shows the importance. Philosophy is in a way discovered by the Greeks. I dare to say that the only philosophy that exists on this planet is the Greek. The rest is only comments on parts of the Greek philosophy as Goethe and Nitze have said. I know that many readers starts to wonder about the writers integrity and reliability, read further and be i can clarify my bestand way. To manage to develop philosophy then a very advanced tool is needed that could support an effort to philosophy as this prosess demands to be able to express all of its content in a form of language, either oral or written(\u2026.pluss symbolic). There are mainly two tools that could produce mainly philosophy the Greek language and the Sanskrit. Sanskrit language is not accurate a philosophical tool comparing to Greek. This tool is more suitable for religion and metaphysics. Philosophy is developed in Greek language because the Greek language is a powerful tool in its self, it is a present form the Gods to the humans(Greek mythology). It is atool in its self that is pure philosophic. Every single word that it is expressed in Greek has a meaning that needs many books to explain just one word! This is no happening with the rest of the languages that are called nominal as to differ from the Greek perspective. Fex take the word Ego, this word in reality means when the soul of a being is dilalectisize with its self. To understand this word then the words as: the soul, dialog and self have to be explained thoroughly. That will take many human lives before it can be possible to full fil an explanation of those terms.(at least in Greek) So what is the contribution of the Greek philosophy? With out the Greek Philosophy it would had not existed pure philosophy at all. So the contribution is manifested in helping to make visible to others all aspects, integrated as one, explaining Cosmos and its Creator. There many tries to imitate the Grek way on this area but the results are a mixture of theology, metaphysics and \u201cmasochistic dialectism\u201d (meaning man produces texts oral or written but there is no reliability and sequence in the texts). Fex \ud83d\ude01Love is the energy that moves the universe lies in the heart(Aristoteles) and is emitted by the good(Plato,Plotin) produced through a deep meditation(Sokrates) as the famous guru Fexampladanana showed before his death on the top of Olympus as a metaphysical(Aristoteles meaning that there two worlds existing) respect to the abstract gods . \ud83d\ude01 The result of the Greek philosophy is that all civilizations and cultures of the world have been adopting, new to them, Greek philosophical words that enriched their lives and spirit. Fex take the word technology as an example of a word that exists in all languages! I know, i know, you would never imagine that this Greek word is a philosophical one and not a practical one. Technology is a special philosophical word that is there just to show that technology is opposed to the philosophical/theological word of God. There three instances that kan produce or give birth on this world. The Gods, all their creations are called genesis, The nature, all its creations are called Physics and the Human beings that all their creations are called technology! Only this single word Technology word is explained in many hundred ancient books. (this is happening in an indirect way). All languages of the world contains/uses hundreds even thousands of Greek words as a compliment to their whole of native concepts and terms. (Only the English language it contains approx 37% of Greek words, Websters Dictionary 40 years old) \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00Greece is in an economic crisis for the time being for different reasons that in my opinion is not caused by the Greeks but from external factors. If every human would appreciate the Greek words that they use for free every day and would like to support Greece for its copyright with 0,000000000000001 Euro or Dollar for each word then Greece would be the richest country in the world as it is appropriate to a civilization that has offered so much to the rest.

It is a tragedy that many departments of philosophy in the 20th century decided that learning about the views of Nietzsche, Sartre, and Foucault were more important than learning about the Greeks, the actual creators of the discipline.
