            "answer_text": "This is logically impossible. It\u2019s the same as someone saying \u201calmost infinite.\u201d If something is eternal, truly eternal, then it has no beginning and no end. You couldn\u2019t get to a time before eternity to find an eternity there. Imagine it this way. You have a barrel with an infinite number of marbles in it. How long would it take you to get to the bottom of the barrel? You couldn\u2019t ever get to the bottom of it, so there couldn\u2019t be anything \u201cbeyond\u201d it. Do the same thing going the other way, and you\u2019ve got eternity. One more example. Imagine today, March 23, 2019, is 0 on a number line. The time before eternity would lie beyond the negatives on the number line. The time beyond eternity would lie beyond the positive on the number line. You couldn\u2019t ever get beyond either end, so no eternity before or after eternity. ",
