            "answer_text": "Don't get fooled by the lazy lumping of Heidegger into the general category of existentialists. It's not going to be the easiest thing in the world to open this denser-than-a-black-hole hunk of a book with nothing to aid you other than your native enthusiasm and mediocre pot. There needs to be some preparation involved.  But luckily, since this is an intellectual venture upon which you are embarking, the prerequisite prep work is just going to be some well-directed reading.  Background Heidegger was a philosopher concerned with ontology, which is the study of being, of what is. The reason he gets the term 'existentialist' tagged on to his name is because, in \"Being and Time\", he completely overhauls the prevailing paradigm of Aristotelian metaphysics which had acted as the unspoken assumption behind much of the Western world-view - this tradition, Heidegger terms as the 'metaphysics of presence'. This simply means that, in Heidegger's estimate, most Western philosophers had built their systems upon the assumption of some singular, stable point of timelessness ; whether this be the 'soul', or 'consciousness' (considered as a singular entity), or Brahman, or what have you.  What Heidegger counters to this, is the incorporation of temporality itself (not 'time' per se, but the structure of time) as an ontological phenomenon that is inseparable from human reality. (The \"Time\" in \"Being and Time\" is not just to give the whole thing a little swag) Sartre's \"Existence precedes essence\" is a crude, but accurate formulation of this central Heideggerian premise.  The tradition/Introduction So, now that we have the background out of the way, we can focus first on the tradition which Heidegger undermines in his text - the tradition which we simply know by the term 'philosophy'. (And this in fact, is one of Heidegger's more intriguing accomplishments - that he poses the legitimate question, is philosophy even really possible at all? Note that this is an insight that the 20th century ran with, most notably Derrida). We need to get acquainted with this tradition before we can get a handle on the \"de-construction\" of this tradition.  Will Durant's \"The Story of Philosophy\"  is a slightly dated, but fantastic introduction to the plethora of Western thinkers that comprise the philosophical tradition. It is sufficiently dense, without being suffocating ; It is a breeze to read, without it being dumbed-down. The man was a gifted writer, and he had a talent for exposition.  If you want a more modern take, without the distraction of personalities, then Simon Blackburn's \"Think\" is a treatment of philosophy itself and the issues which have been dealt with, poked and prodded over and over again. It's a surprisingly wide-ranging survey that does its job well viz introducing you to the areas and concerns of traditional philosophy.  If you enjoy your philosophical introductions tinged with a flavor of absurdist pathos and hand-wringing over the hopelessness of it all, then Thomas Nagel's \"What Does It All Mean\" is your new bae.  Right! Now you have a rough idea of what philosophy is, what it hopes to achieve, and how different individuals throughout history (the canonical philosophers) have gone about this task. It's time to go a little deeper.  Kant and phenomenology  Next up is Kant. If you read any of the books that I had already mentioned, than you would have run into his name a fair few times - and for good reason. Kant is the central figure of modern philosophy. By taking over David Hume's unholy skepticism and reworking pre-modern philosophy (that is to say, philosophy before his time) in the light of that skepticism, Kant accomplished a Copernican revolution in philosophy by showing that, rather than posing the question of how the subject is related to an object, a far more pertinent question would be how the object is constituted by the subject. In other words, Kant showed that it is human subjectivity, and the structures that make up such, that underlies both subject as well as object. It is the a priori structure of the mind, that squeezes reality into the shape in which we recognize and live it.  This is Kant's central insight and accomplishment. Phenomenology, as an intellectual discipline, owes its existence to it, and it is to this now that we turn.  (Note : You can, if you want to, peruse Kant's magnum opus \"The Critique of Pure Reason\" - but it is possibly the only book that rivals \"Being and Time\" in sheer convoluted density. My own opinion is that it's not strictly required, as long as you understand Kant's place in philosophy, and what the central insights are which gave him that place. If you can pick up some secondary literature, then well and good ; if not, this would give you a fair idea.) Phenomenology was a method of philosophical analysis that originated with Edmund Husserl, and consisted of rigorous analysis of the phenomena themselves. Phenomena is the Greek word for \"appearance\", and the immediate break with the prevailing philosophical tradition is obvious. Whereas the latter had, for its long history, been concerned with finding the 'truth' in some form or shape, Husserl's genius was to introduce the realization that perhaps there was no truth to be found behind the play of appearances that make up human living, and, in fact, philosophy's aim should be clarification rather than explanation.  Heidegger began his philosophical training as a phenomenologist under Husserl's guidance. What Husserl did not anticipate was that Heidegger would import the method of phenomenological analysis into ontology - which is why \"Being and Time\" is described as phenomenological ontology.  Anyways, some knowledge of phenomenology is de rigeur, if you want to follow what Heidegger is attempting to do in \"Being and Time\". Again, an IEP article will help you out, but you can also pick up a book by Robert Sokolowski called \"Introduction to Phenomenology\", which avoids the guff and gets straight to the (heh) point.  Nietzsche  Waheyyy, it's Nietzsche, Bietzsche!  On first glance, Heidegger and Nietzsche have almost nothing in common. Heidegger is ponderous, rigorous and excruciatingly thorough ; while Nietzsche is flamboyant, acerbic and untethered to any commonly accepted standard of rational argument. So why should you at least possess a modicum of understanding of him before you head into \"Being and Time\"?  Because, quite simply, despite all his flaws, Nietzsche was indeed a philosopher who had some very interesting things to say about the philosophical tradition. Both him and Heidegger were working towards the same ends, though of course the former had a head start of a few decades. Through Nietzsche's wit and biting sarcasm, the philosophical structure that had prevailed began tottering, and its eventual collapse would be completed by Heidegger. You need to have an intuitive understanding of Nietzsche, especially if you have certain pre-conceived notions of how philosophy is, what it does, and especially, what its 'supposed' to be - this will make Heidegger's radical metaphysics (or lack of one, depending on your terminology) more palatable, and, more importantly, understandable.  Nietzsche himself rivals some of the more traditional philosophers in the difficulty of entering into his thought - but for entirely different reasons. While he is a great writer, and often very funny, his writing is not really accessible because of the depth at which he is writing i.e. the inherent depth of the topics which he addresses - human morality, freedom, desire and so on.  So I would advise holding off on any of his main works for the time being, and pick up a lovely book entitled \"The Flame of Eternity\" by Michalski which claims to be a 're-interpretation' of Nietzsche's thought, but in my opinion, is really a profound exegesis of what Nietzsche is actually on about, removed from the messy context of his reputation, his sometimes impenetrable writing, and the philosophical context in which he often writes.  Guides/Secondary Literature/the book itself You are now ready to take on Heidegger directly. Well - not so fast. Partake of an appetizer of what you can expect by shopping around for some secondary literature that you can dip your toes in. (There's a mess of a metaphor) Of all the 'introductions' to Heidegger that I have encountered (and there are quite a lot) \"Heidegger : An Introduction\" by Richard Polt is by far the best, and the most often recommended. Polt not only explicates Heidegger's often difficult terminology but he prefaces all of this with a clear exposition of what exactly Heidegger is trying to do. This preface thus accounts to what amounts to a crash course in pre-Heideggerian philosophy prior to his effortless explication of Heidegger's method.  If you ignore every single book on this list, at least pick this one up. In fact, if you're seriously gung-ho, then it wouldn't be the worst possible thing for you to simply pick up this book and \"Being and Time\" and wing it from there ; though of course this depends on your capacity for on-the-fly research.  As for the book itself, there are two translations that are available on the market. The first, the Macquarrie+Robinson translation, is the most common and (by consensus) seems to be the most preferred. The second, a more modern translation by Joan Stambaugh, arguably removes some of the distortions present in the first translations but it doesn't seem to be displacing the Macquarrie+Robinson translation as the preferred version, which is what I have as well.  Now that you've come to the text itself, you can either choose to go it alone, or you can choose to use a 'guide' that is intended to be read alongside the main text. Some people will feel that they could greatly benefit from this, while others would wish to avoid the distraction. For what its' worth, I think a guide can help immensely in pinpointing where you are in Heidegger's argument and whether your understanding is more or less on the right track. The guide I had was \"A Commentary on Being and Time\" by Michael Gelven - which was clear, friendly and straightforward.   ;   And that's it! You're ready to head down the rabbit hole.  Some concluding advice on reading the text :  \"Being and Time\" is not a novel. and should not be approached like one. You will do plenty of flipping-back, plenty of note-taking, and plenty of cross-referencing.  Take notes, even if you think they're crappy. Nothing aids comprehension than it being an active process. Have fun! If you're interested in reading \"Being and Time\", then you're probably the type of person who gets pleasure from intellectual stimulation. Bewarned. The book will give you several mind-orgasms causing you to sputter your spray of ontological snippets all over your unsuspecting brethren.  Cheers!  ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you are philosophically lay, like me - Before reading any systemic philosophic treatise (be it Heidegger's Being and Time, Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, etc.), I suggest spending time with some contemporary commentary on the work. By contemporary commentary I mean recently published writing, the very aim of which is either (1) to explain that work in particular by simplifying its concepts or paraphrasing them in different terms or (2) to contextualize the philosopher and his thought in general, as a historical figure, within the intellectual currents of his time.  However, I think it's more important that the commentary does either one of these than that it be recent. For instance, Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve's reading of Hegel (see below), while published in 1980, excels in the first of these: it is an original reading of Hegelian dialectical materialism that simply makes Hegel more accessible. I urgently recommend it in general, before or after you read Heidegger; you will find that it does wonders for framing the linguistic and metaphysical push-and-shove that is the Western philosophic tradition. For Being and Time, I suggest you read Graham Harman's Heidegger Explained and Part 1 of Richard Rorty's Essays on Heidegger and Others. Harman's guide will both explain Being and Time and contextualize Heidegger, in the rudimentary and simplistic way that helped me move on to the primary stuff. It will also elaborate on his academic mentor-mentee relationship with Husserl and his departure from what he considered Husserl's incomplete phenomenology; see this direct quote from the Harman:   In short, Heidegger believes that phenomenology ignores his- tory far too much. This is true not only of shallow and superficial followers of phenomenology, but even of Husserl\u2019s own way of thinking. As Heidegger puts it, we will have radical and serious phenomenology only when people see that direct presence of the world is never possible, and that concealment belongs to the very nature of phenomena. Although Heidegger does not dwell on the point, this amounts to the blunt claim that Husserl is not yet doing \u201cradical and serious\u201d phenomenology. Developing his own insights with increasing vigor, Heidegger has more or less announced a hostile takeover of the phenomenological movement. Since Husserl and Heidegger continued to work closely together in Freiburg, Husserl surely must have gotten wind of some of these remarks. It is a credit to Husserl\u2019s generosity and easygoing tem- perament that Heidegger was never excommunicated from the movement, but simply drifted away from it. Harman then of course proceeds to discuss the ins-and-outs of Being and Time itself as well as Heidegger's prior and subsequent work. Richard Rorty, who I've increasingly developed an affinity for, not only explains Heidegger's thought but does so by synthesizing its relationship to other monumental Western thinkers - both Continental and Analytic, which is both exceedingly cool and informative. Again, this is the way I went about finally getting to Heidegger's Being and Time. I read it slowly and closely, with Harman and some other specific commentary alongside. I read the Rorty both before and after.  If you're looking for a simple list of concepts and/or a cheatsheet of brief conceptual lineage, I would say to you that the enterprise -- given what it purports to attempt to achieve -- is simply not amenable to such shrinkage. Too much (but more likely all) is lost in such reduction. As Hegel notes in his famous preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit:  It is customary to preface a work with an explanation of the author's aim, why he wrote the book, and the relationship in which he believes it to stand to other earlier or contemporary treatises on the same subject. In the case of philosophical work, however, such an explanation seems not only superfluous but, in view of the nature of the the subject-matter, even inappropriate and misleading. For whatever might appropriately be said about philosophy in a preface -- say a historical statement of the main drift and the point of view, the general content and results, a string of random assertions and assurances about truth -- none of this can be accepted as the way in which to expound philosophical truth. Moreover, because philosophy has its being essentially in the element of that universality which encloses the particular within it, the end or final result seems, in the case of philosophy more than in that of other sciences, to have absolutely expressed the complete fact itself in its very nature; contrasted with that the mere process of bringing it to light would seem, properly speaking, to have no essential significance.
