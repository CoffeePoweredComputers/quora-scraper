            "answer_text": "Ying Yang is about the dynamic balance. WE CALL IT TAMAS-RAJAS Yin and yang are natural forces which transform each other and are in perfect harmony. Harmony can never be stagnant . Lessening of Yin- always results in increase of Yang and vice versa One cannot exist without the other and they are dependent . No phenomenon in this universe is completely devoid of its opposite. They consume each other yet support each other. Whatever is in excess gets reduces, whatever is deficient gets replenished. Balance can never be permanent\u2014 Ying and Yang continuously devour each other \u2013 and life flows on. Absolute magic! ",

            "answer_text": "They describe the same pattern. Karma (action) is a law that tends to balance our actions through a cause-effect pattern. Action in this case include thoughts, words, and proper actions. Every action starts in the mind as a thought, and in Indian culture the mental plane (Chidakash) survive physical death and trigger the next birth in an endless cycle of birth-dead and rebirth. (Samsara) To highlight this cycle, in Indian culture Karma is represented by a chain of knots . It\u2019s not the same person who gets reborn, but rather the desires who live in Chidakash that need to be fulfilled through the newborn body. Yin-Yang describe the same dynamics of cause-effect with a different symbolism, that apply to other aspects of life. For instance in TCM the human\u2019s organs (Zang-Fu) are linked with Yin-Yang. Each Zang (functional) organ is paired with Fu (hollow) organ, and according to TCM organs extends beyond the western anatomy and physiology. ",

            "answer_text": "It's all about maintaining balance consciously. To our untrained perception, it's a world of duality. Yes and no, masculine and feminine, ida and pingala, heads and tails, yin and yang, and so on and so forth. To train your perception to its highest possibility is what Adhyatm is all about. So that you get that all is one. And not two, as it seems. Different forms and shapes of the same five elements, but they're all one. To get there, you need balance. For that balance, you need training. Doesnt matter if you use a guru for that training, or not. What matters is how far you are from the reality. Because that alone decides the nature of you karma. Karma is nothing but your doing. What you do, is your karma. Your life is your karma. And balance is an absolute necessity in shaping your karma. ",

Ying and yang are from Chinese philosophy and is about how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. Karma, on the other hand is intrinsic to Hindu Vedic philosophy and about righteous action in tune with your essential nature. ",
