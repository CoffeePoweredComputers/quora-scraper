            "answer_text": "Liberal arts programs typically focus on certain academic areas. For example, languages and linguistics are a field of liberal arts that teaches students to become interpreters, classical translators, and historical linguistics. On the other hand, literature is one of the most popular areas of the liberal arts. Therefore, students will obtain a degree in literature, such as American or British Literature, if they want to become a teacher. Liberal arts students can also concentrate on music, sculpture, fine arts and performing arts. Still, the unique field of philosophy is a liberal arts degree that students will pursue if they wish to work in higher education organizations. Social sciences are a major liberal arts academic area. They include history, sociology, geography, and political science. Finally, the liberal arts include religion and spirituality. ",
