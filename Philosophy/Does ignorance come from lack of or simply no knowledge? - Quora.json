            "answer_text": "Actually, I think most ignorance comes with attitude in people that have minds like steel traps that have rusted shut. Bill Nye is one example. He\u2019s made up his mind that he\u2019s right and you\u2019re wrong, and shows no sign of admitting any differently despite facts that others with an inkling of curiosity have found. That is true ignorance. Science is not immutable facts, it is accepted theory that could change with the next discovery. Once upon our past, most people believed the earth was a flat plane that stood at the center of the universe, and a minor god drove a chariot with the sun on it across the sky. No need for astrologists then. Quite a bit different than what we know now, right? Unless you\u2019re a member of the flat earth society, it makes so much more sense to have spherical planets around a central star called the sun. ",

            "answer_text": "Is most ignorance due to lack of learning or lack of intelligence? It\u2019s extreme lack of intelligence, which leads to a world view defined by fewer and fixed rules. We generally don\u2019t want our world views changed so the less intelligent will have this very rigid set of rules that are inadequate at modeling reality. As a result they will not be able to take in new information either because they can\u2019t comprehend it or refuse to accept that they\u2019re wrong. One sign of this are people who always believe there is clear division between a right and a wrong, or a this and that, and there is no in-between, and there never are exceptions. They most often commit the fallacy of false dichotomy. You will also see them frequently committing the fallacies of hasty generalization, argumentum ad hominem, post hoc ergo propter hoc, and argumentum ad verecundiam. Highly intelligent people are those quick to admit their world view is wrong and adjust their world views once presented with verified evidence. They are able to work with gigantic sets of rules where the rules can be replaced, where rules shift under conditions, where rules are not black-and-white, and can even handle situations where rules cannot be made at all. They can comprehend everything in the world as shades of gray when necessary. They can also accept that there can be a multitude of \u201cright answers\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's look at the word ignorance. It is quite obviously derived from the verb \"ignore\". Ignorance is not about how much knowledge you have, but how you treat your lack of knowledge. When an ignorant person encounters information that doesn't confirm what he already knows he will ignore it, instead of investigating it and comparing it to the information he already had. ",
