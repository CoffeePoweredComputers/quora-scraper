            "answer_text": "This question presupposes an answer to 2 questions. \"What is 'time'\"? And \"What is 'infinity'\"? Most of the answers thus far have tried to answer the first question at best, but mostly they have presupposed their answer to 'what is time?' to answer whether or not it has always existed. There are many, perhaps infinite, and at least an uncountable, number of possible accounts of time which make it infinite in more than one direction, including backwards. So far the answers have included our experience of time, the physics of time and the logic of time. The answer will show that there is or is not an intersection between our concepts of time and infinity in at least all these categories. One aspect of time which particularily interests me is density or continuity. If time is fluid or continuous, it is infinitely dense. If time is discreet and has a smallest measure, it is not continuous or infinitely dense. Supposing there is a continuity to reality in space and time, within any measure of time there is an infinite density. If there is an infinite density in any moment, there is also an infinite stretch forward or backwards. So if time is continuous, it is infinitely dense, both now, before and in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, time has always been. Time is a measurement of how long it takes to get something done. There was a whole period of time before solid matter was created , but time was measured in the spiritual realm. The physical realm was totally empty and there was no movement so there was nothing to measure. ... But time was there. ... Just nothing to measure. Once God established his laws into the infinite Emptiness, everything changed. Things started happening and movement was everywhere. Time was used to count the periods of time between each event recorded in the Bible. There were 6 period of time that God created the universe and life in. The KJV calls them days, but they are periods of time... A day is a period of time. ... Twenty four hours is a period of time but so is a billion years. ",

            "answer_text": "Defining time itself is a problem that has defied Science and Philosophy. We all have intuitive ideas of time and for everyday purposes they are good enough, but the Special Theory of Relativity proved once and for all that our intuition is wrong. The thing we call time is intricately related to space, but it plays by different rules and there is no single absolute reference time.  All that we have been able to say for sure is that the thing we call time has existed since the beginning of this universe. For all anyone knows it may have existed before that, but trying to reason about that yields infinite regress. http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Infinite_regress.  We are forever cut off from the period in the universe's evolution before light could form, roughly 380,000 years after the Big Bang(!). The only way we can ever \"know\" to a reasonable degree of confidence what came before  is if a theoretical physicist creates a theory that makes OTHER predictions that CAN be tested and whose falsification would invalidate other already experimentally verified theories. Even then... It's probably philosophy rather than physics. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it does not mean that. Time is the measurement of a particular aspect of a process. If, as many have hypothesized, there was once no space, i.e. everything was in the same place, there would have been no process to measure. Think of time as one thing (among many) that\u2019s different about being here as opposed to being \u201cover there\u201d. One of the ways we distinguish \u201chere\u201d from \u201cover there\u201d is the time it takes us to go from one to the other. If there is no \u201cover there\u201d, then there is no measurable difference between being here, and then being here some more. In other words, there is no \u201cthen\u201d, it\u2019s all already happening. ",

            "answer_text": "Time is an illusion that emerges from the way your memory works. Relativity theorists such as Einstein would say that what we perceive as time is just a 4th dimension of space, and both quantities are measured in meters. String theorists and other researchers of quantum gravity would say that even Einstein's spacetime continuum is an illusion that emerges from an even more fundamental reality. Also, there's a logical flaw in your question- you are asking at what points in time did time exist. That's like asking at what points in space does space exist. Both questions are incoherent- we can only ask at what point in space, time or spacetime does mass/energy exist. ",

I think a better question is, does it matter? We will never know if there is some observable called time independent of our observation. ",
