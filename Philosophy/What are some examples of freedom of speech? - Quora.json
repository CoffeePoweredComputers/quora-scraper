            "answer_text": "Freedom of speech is a human right. It is a right that every human is born with, no matter how many times tyrants and bullies try to take it away or oppress it. I can say whatever I want. You can say whatever you want. If I don\u2019t like what you say I can say I don\u2019t like what you said. Likewise, you can do the same. If you say something that libels or slanders me, or defames my character I can take you to court and demand you retract what you said about me, and perhaps demand huge amounts of money as compensation and to punish you for slandering me. The internet has made it possible to slander and libel people in epidemic proportions, but with no practical way to seek redress for the victims of such civil \u201coffenses\u201d. This problem should be solved. Perhaps the government should provide an internet court system to address this issue. Censorship is a crime and the People should not tolerate any form of censorship by the government, ever! Any form of censorship by the government should be treated as a capital crime [since the First Amendment forbids and thus criminalizes such actions by government] and government officials that attempt to oppress, restrict, ban or criminalize free speech [by passing illegal anti-free speech laws or otherwise] should be treated like criminals and traitors and removed from office immediately and perhaps executed for treason. There should be no exceptions! Censorship [by the state] has been banned and criminalized by law in America and any acts of censorship by the state should be severely punished. Censorship by corporations is a violation of corporate law and should not be tolerated. Corporations do not have human rights. Corporations that practice censorship, or any form of free speech oppression, should be held criminally accountable, lose their corporate charter, and the corporate officers should be severely punished. [i.e. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and other corporate owned social media, which are Public Domains as declared by the SCOTUS] All laws now on the books that oppress and restrict Free Speech, free expression, [Title 18 USC, for example] must be repealed immediately, and never allowed again, ever, in any form whatsoever! Government officials [legislators, Congress, presidents, etc.] that introduce, support, vote for, pass, or attempt to enforce such laws should be immediately removed from office and prosecuted for treason and crimes against humanity. No exceptions! So, these are a few of my thoughts on freedom of speech. I should point out that most of my exercisings of the right of free speech are monologues. You should keep this in mind if you feel the urge to argue any of my points as expressed here. Cheers. ",

You can call President Trump an \u201corange cheeto\u201d (that\u2019s popped up in my facebook feed a few times) You can advocate for Communism, if you haven\u2019t yet figured out that it doesn\u2019t work. Or even if you have, but want to advocate for it anyway. You can even put up a list of doctors who perform abortions, and cross of the names of the the ones who have been killed. (Yes, some soi disant \u201cpro-life\u201d advocates have done this.) You can say damn near anything you want, with a few exceptions: Incitement to imminent lawless action, when it is \"likely to incite or produce such action\"Incitement to suicide, if made with intent to cause the person to kill themselves. (At least in Massachusetts)Defamation: you can be sued for saying false and damaging things about a living person (including a corporation).Obscenity, which is very difficult to prove. See Miller v. California - WikipediaChild pornography: a visual depiction of an actual child under 18 performing sexual acts or lewdly exhibiting their genitals.Threats to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm on the President, VP (or whoever is next in line to succeed the President), or President- or VP-elect. Even saying, \u201cso-and-so should be killed\u201d will get you an unpleasant interview with the Secret Service, although AFAIK it isn\u2019t strictly speaking illegal.Infringing somebody else\u2019s copyright, trademark, service mark, or trade secret. This is a form of theft of somebody else\u2019s property.Fraud: saying untrue things to get somebody to buy, sell, or engage in some other transaction (e.g., sign a rental contract)False advertisingGag orders (order by a court not to speak about an ongoing case), and National Security Letters.",
