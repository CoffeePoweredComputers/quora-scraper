Many of us with disabled children would probably rob if we could heal it simply with money.I mentioned this in a response to another question recently- becoming a U.S. Marine is not something one can buy. The same could be said of other prestigious groups that aren't for sale.Genuine love. Don't get me wrong, it may seem like everyone loves moneybags. But they love the money and lifestyle, not the person usually.Money can't keep death away. It's coming no matter how much you got.Money can't absolve a person of evil deeds they do. Yes, it can help you avoid incarceration and fines. But the deeds cannot be undone and one's conscience knows it.",

Now you could probably obtain my physical person by monetary means (IE pay enough and someone out there may well be willing to kidnap me.) You would not however get me at my best, nor my willing cooperation. Those are things of value, and I can prove that because I get paid for my work, and they let me go when I\u2019m done. It has also been found by research that reliable information cannot be obtained from torture. If the work itself is interesting, ethical and so on you might convince me, but that would be a non-monetary enticement. There doesn\u2019t exist an amount of money that can convince me to do anything. I will always require non monetary enticements, and even then I\u2019m not going to do certain things because they are wrong. ",
