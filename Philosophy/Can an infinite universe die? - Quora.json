            "answer_text": "Let's start by defining infinite..  The word infinite does not suggest that it can't die only that it is endless in size.. Which we don't even know for sure because it's to large for us to even know how big it is.. From what we do know it is still expanding outward to this day and like a rubber band that has been stretched to its capacity one day it will go the other way eventually collapsing in on itself.. one might say causing the death of the universe.. From the prospective of an ant a human being might seem infinite.. Because we would seem to large to be measured or endless to their eyes yet we can die\u2026 I'm no expert on the matter, but the universe being infinite is a matter of perspective and in my opinion definitely does not mean that it doesn't have an expiration date .. However one thing you can be sure of is that if/when it does end our memory will be a distant echo in the ripple of time\u2026 and the end will be the problem to a new species on the evolutionary latter..
