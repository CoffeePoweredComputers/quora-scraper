            "answer_text": "Even without time travel it is true. I have a father, and a mother. My father and mother had a total of five children. Those children had a total of seven grandchildren. 5+7=12 My father and mother have a total of 12 people who never would have existed if they had never met. My father's father's father's father's father lived a really long time ago. About 125 to 150 years ago or so, I'm not really sure. However that man had a lot of descendants, that's the word we use to describe the people who never would have been born if you had never had sex. Anyway I want you to imagine your own father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father. This man would have lived about 1,850 to 2,220 years before you were born. Now imagine HIS father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father. Now here is a man who lived aout 3,700 to 4,440 years before you were born. Many people alive today are related to him. You may have heard of Y-chromosomal Adam, and Mitochondrial Eve. Y-chromosomal Adam is a man who lived so long ago, that every Human being alive today can look back and find this most recent common male ancestor. Likewise Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent common ancestor of all Humans. She is your mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's\u2026 All the way back to a point where there was a woman who was literally the ancestor of every Human being alive today. The suprising thing is the time gap between when these two people lived. Y-chromosomal Adam, is currently believed to have lived 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, Mitochondria Eve is currently believed to have lived 100,000 to 230,000 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a fascinating sociology, statistical, legal, and actuarial question The answer is easy though: NO or yes, depending on which definition you want to use. First of all, anyone who didn\u2019t have any surviving children, cross those off. You are not a direct descendant of theirs in any way. However, their brother had 12 children, and he is your great^n daddy, so this person is your great^n uncle/aunt. By this logic though, the slug you just found in your salad is also. And so are the salad leaves, just for a greater \u201cn\u201d What is not possible to determine is that n-generation number for everyone alive at that time. However, for someone with better grasp of statistics and current genetic research, they could say with some confidence, given two gene samples, \u201cThese two samples share a Last Common Ancestor n-generations ago.\u201d But that gives two possibilities Yes, 1400AD or today, you would be an nth-cousin (and grand-nth aunt, uncle, niece and/or nephew). You inbreeders!A very small fraction of any species might be a parasite which can recognise its own, and hides as members of that species, perfectly mimicking them, despite aeons of separate evolutionExcept that is not the way gene selection works. If you could work out a Y-number before any two intendant species would unavoidably noticeably differ, I reckon you are looking at Nobel-prize level work. ",
