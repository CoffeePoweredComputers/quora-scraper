            "answer_text": "Friends, First state It is observed in deep sleep. It is most lowest state and is able to sustain vital functions. It is common to all humans. Second state It is observed in an awake man. It is common to all humans and is higher than first one. This state allows physical body to move with purposeful and coordinated movement as well as psychic body/mental body to think in logical way. A man remains partially aware to his physical body and remains completely unaware to his psychic body owing to identification. First and second state are natural in their origin and a man is not expected to effort to attain them. Third state. It has to be attained by willed and deliberate conscious efforts and is seen rare amongst humans. In presence of this third state,a man remains completely aware to his physical body as well as his psychic body.There is no identification. Third state shows impermanent quality and it comes and goes. Fourth state. When third state becomes permanent it is known as fourth state. Thanks Q guru ",
