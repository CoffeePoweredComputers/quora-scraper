If you do not think anything, you can not visualize anything and there will be no philosophy. It does not take you away from any reality but from our convenience, comforts and well being. It might take you to reality but the reality is the worst thing to face. Therefore nobody goes there and remains in its comfort zone presuming it as reality. ",

            "answer_text": "According to me, yes, it does. But it doesn't mean one should not read philosophy. I mean, anyone should do what they like or want to. No? The thing is if you read philosophy or politics, or whatever, you should not embrace it as reality. At last, knowledge is not reality. It does help you build ladder, though. Reality is what you see, hear, feel, conclude, enjoy or live. :) Best wishes. ",
