            "answer_text": "\u201cwho made the simulation?\u201d First, assuming the premise suggested in the question to be true then the maker would be a universe development system. You will notice I am ignoring the WHO made the universe since there\u2019s no indication in the question at all that a WHO is required causally for the premise to be accurate. You now would still have no idea whether that system is an automated natural one, or a conscious and sentient one. Either way the universe would not be a \u2018simulation\u2019. Not when you know of only one and you are inside it. So humans can make ice, or water freezing on a frosty night naturally makes ice. The maker is called a \u2018water temperature reduction system\u2019 . Whether its a person or a natural process. Both may have other properties, and you can describe the difference for a natural water freezing process and someone making ice. But if you cannot do that for a maker of universes you are stuck with a generic description and almost no properties. This question actually \u2018begs the question twice! Once in the original premise and then adding WHO rather than WHAT at the end. Even if this universe simulation entity made a billion universes, that does not imply that its a WHO! IT is a simulation in the question, and simulations are usually designed by machines these days. Are machines now a WHO? Syn3.0 is a synthetic organism, its parent is in fact a computer system where it was stored as data before being sown together using enzymes and printed out. Is this computer system a who? Begging the question in a question is a rather odd way to ask a question. The same is true if we assume the premise in the question to NOT be true. If its a natural process that made this universe, then its still not a \u2018simulation\u2019 becasue as we all know, there is at the moment only one universe we know of. As far as I can see it makes no difference who or what made it, tagging the word \u2018simulation\u2019 to it doesn\u2019t aid in describing it. Simulation would mean you know what a real universe is, and you can classify another one as being a copy or a knock off, or some sort of facsimile. So since there is a universe then what is the actual difference between a simulated one and a non simulated one? Remember there\u2019s only one, and you have no comparison! As far as the cause of it simulated or not, whatever, you still have no idea what the actual properties of the cause itself are, other than one property, which is that it gives rise to universes. However what you can do is try to replicate the process and then classify the person making the universe or the process of universe making. Alternatively you might observe a natural universe being born and classify that too. But if you only have one universe, then the word \u2018simulation\u2019 means absolutely nothing. Unfortunately according to Heisenberg by carrying out a successful emulation of this universe you increase the percentage change of this one being a simulation by your actions. You can never have ALL of the data you need, but when you have certain data and its invariant data or represents an invariant principle, then the probability of this universe being a simulation would increase. The same for example could be said of the previously mentioned current developments in synthetic life. Are they simulated organisms? Or are they \u2018real\u2019 organisms. Well both exist in the universe and have more or less the same properties (although only three current species of living things have a website built into them and are signed by their creators.) But are these genomic experiments in making life \u2018simulated\u2019 living things or are they \u2018not simulated\u2019 . Whas the difference? And who made them? Craig Venter and his team of hundreds of scientists, or a known process, or both? And that\u2019s WITH other living things to compare to! Anyway whatever substrate, whatever form, and whatever process a universe would be a universe. It doesn\u2019t help you to classify the \u2018maker\u2019 and add properties to it, not unless you have access to the maker and can draw empirical data from that access that might help you to differentiate. I ought to know having made a few universes. Semper In Lucem Solaria. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if this reality is a simulation then there is a good chance that we are the result of a previous simulation. Once a simulation is created then this simulation could spawn another simulation ad infinitum. there are basically 3 odds to calculate; Let's say, the simulation ran 999,999,999 times Base reality = 1/1,000,000,000 First simulated reality = 1/1,000,000,000 Every simulated reality there after = 999,999,998/1,000,000,000 This gives us a 99.9999998% chance that we live in a simulation. Providing that the simulation only happened a trillions times. It is more likely that the simulations would, themselves, spawn other simulations growing exponentially the number is more likely to be tending towards infinity. Therefore increasing the odds we are living in a simulation even more so. I\u2019d say it's safe to say that we do in fact live in a simulation. So to answer your question, who made the simulation? It may be an inherent mechanism of a simulation to birth the next simulation. It could seen as a \u201cnatural\u201d phenomenon. ",
