            "answer_text": "Henry Kissinger was the most visible (and perhaps notorious) practitioner of political realism. This approach accepts that there is evil in the world, and western, democratic governments can\u2019t change much of it. But they can work with less than pristine regimes to further their own interests. He advocated for D\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union, and he was instrumental in getting Nixon to recognize China. He supported close ties with generally repressive regimes like those in Saudi Arabia and South Vietnam. Those tactics, in the long run, worked pretty well. We can\u2019t know whether they were the best tactics, because alternate history is merely conjecture. The best quote that captures the sentiment wasn\u2019t issued by Kissinger, but rather by Franklin D Roosevelt, speaking of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza: \u201cHe may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.\u201d ",
