            "answer_text": "You present a lot of variables in that one question. For one, are you discussing someone who is wealthy and doesn\u2019t need to worry about gaining any more money? That answer would be never. People never stop worrying, at some level, about finances because at any time they could lose what they have. No matter how unreasonable it may seem to them and the rest of the world, the stuff could dwindle, or disappear all at once, along with everything it bought. Being penniless must be a horrible, mental, if not subconscious state of mind for those who seem to have it all. For another, are you asking - when is enough, enough? Depends on the person, what they want to do if they have more, because - as everyone knows - there\u2019s always more to acquire even if you don\u2019t need whatever it is. Kind of like a George Carlin routine where he tells how you need a bigger house to hold all your stuff, and then that house also becomes too small because you got more stuff, and so on and so on. Great lesson, George. To me, the question of when is enough is irrelevant. Even if a wealthy person learns not to grasp for himself/herself, there\u2019s also the rest of the world, a huge percentage living in poverty, starvation, suffering, including all living things. \u201cEnough\u201d then stops being a personal problem, even if you realize you really do have enough for yourself and family alone; the entire world is a family, all sentient beings struggling toward the same goal - to be happy and not suffer. Your \u201cextra\u201d money could help them or their organizations toward that goal. You could even begin foundations of your own, such as Bill Gates did, and countless other rich people. Therefore, there is never enough if you realize the world as one being; but there could be enough if you learn not to grasp for or desire material objects, experiences, and so on that go beyond your means. At that point, enough is food, shelter, and love. That\u2019s enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Someone once asked John Rockefeller how much money was enough. His reply? \"Just a little bit more.\"You're on a fool's errand. If you're truly greedy, no amount of money will ever satisfy you. I would urge you to please reconsider your priorities: \"Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.\" And (Jesus) told them a parable, saying, \"The land of a rich man was very productive. And he began reasoning to himself, saying, 'What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?'\"Then he said, 'This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, \"Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry.\" \"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you have prepared?'\u2026\"So is the man who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.\"\"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?\" ",
