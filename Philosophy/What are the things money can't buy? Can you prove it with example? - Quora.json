            "answer_text": "Love. You're less likely to find the real deal the more money you have. Just like being pretty. When you have no money, no looks, and someone genuinely loves you \u2014 you know it's true. But there's too many people looking for money and looking for looks. They lie and they're good at it. That's not love. And you might never know the difference no matter how much money you have. ",

            "answer_text": "Money can buy a nice pair of shoes, but it can't buy feet... Money can buy very delicious food but can\u2019t buy appetite. Money can buy a luxurious house but can't ensure peace in that house... Money can pay for great education but can't buy intelligence... Money can make you have a beautiful wife/handsome husband, but it can't buy faithfulness. Money can help you improve your life but can't buy you more time than what God wants to give you. Money can give you a great funeral, but it can't give you the eternal life. No matter who you are, no matter the color of your skin, no matter the millions or billions you have, if you have not accepted Jesus as your savior, you have a ticket to hell. If you die without Jesus, you will go straight to hell. Think about it today, think about it seriously. Would you like to be in the eternal fire or would you like to have eternal life, to live in peace, in joy forever on a new earth, a beautiful earth without pollution?
