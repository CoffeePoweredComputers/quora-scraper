            "answer_text": "Approaches are \u201cdifferent possible solutions or ways to understand how to solve the problem\u201d. For example, if you left your keys in your house, walked out, slammed the door shut, and realized that you\u2019ve lock yourself out, one approach may be to break a window, climb in and unlock the door. Another approach is to phone a lock-smith, a third approach is to phone a friend/spouse/child/landlord that holds a spare key. Another approach may be to fetch the ladder from the back of the house, climb up to the upstairs window that is open and get in that way. Which of those approaches you choose first, second and third (assuming first didn\u2019t succeed) of course depends on how urgently you need to get back in and several other factors. A similar thing would be to consider the different ways to attach two pieces of metal together: welding, using bolts, rivets or maybe even glue. Again, which is \u201cright\u201d depends on precisely what you are trying to achieve. Welding is a poor choice if you want to take it apart again - in that case, bolts are better. Bolts may be a poor choice if you can\u2019t \u201coverlap\u201d the two pieces (or two square sections butting up against each other with no overlap - difficult to put a bolt through if the two pieces don\u2019t cross over. Glue (usually called \u201cadhesive\u201d in this sort of situation, but they are closely related) is not unheard of for attaching metal to other bits of metal. I have a bicycle made from aluminium, and held together with adhesive. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the problem. I\u2019d say the best way is to think critically and understand the problem. You have to know what the problem is and then brainstorm and try different solutions. There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying through trial and error. Different problems require different approaches but the basics are the same. You have to understand what the problem is and then you try to come up with solutions. ",
