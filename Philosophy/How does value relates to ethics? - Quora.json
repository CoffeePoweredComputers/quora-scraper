            "answer_text": "Very good question. Different theories give different answers here but there are some recurrencies. The main point here is that a value is always an abstract concept which can motivate a human in their lives, or which gives an answer to the Socratic question \u2018how should I/one live?\u2019. Nearly any abstract concept can be construed as a value as long as they \u2018guide behaviour\u2019 or \u2018abstractly motivate\u2019 some people. Time can\u2019t be a value because one cannot live life according to the value of time. That\u2019s meaningless. Timeliness is a value because one can easily be motivated to live timely. But that\u2019s mainly it when you\u2019re looking for theoretical definitions. To understand how vague the notion of a value is you could look at lists of values ( List of Values - Steve Pavlina ) or how the wiki on the subject tries to describe it ( Value (ethics) - Wikipedia ) - a necessary but ridiculously vague outline. I once read an interesting philosophical article from a woman who tried to define the concept more clearly by looking at the functional use of the concept. She concluded that you can do 4 different things with a value: Appreciating, Expressing, Respecting/Honouring, and Promoting/Creating. An example: Let\u2019s say your on holiday on your own touring Europe. One day you start to feel lonely and you remember your best friend at home. You order a delightfully complex and tasty Belgian beer and you start writing a letter to him. First you\u2019re just explaining that you\u2019re fine and that he shouldn\u2019t worry, but as you write and drink you begin explaining how much he means to you and how glad you are to have him in your life. At the end of your letter, the guy next to you casually remarks that you are drinking the same angelic Belgian beer as him. You understand he wants to chat and - feeling lonely and finding him rather charming and interesting - you go along with it. You end up drinking more Belgian beer (really, we\u2019ve got like hundreds of different beers here!) at his home and really enjoying his company. You promise to keep in touch. Here, you went full circle on the value of friendship. First you started appreciating the friendship you\u2019ve got back home, then you started writing, respecting the value of friendship (in that you respected the rule that you shouldn\u2019t let friends worry needlessy about you). Next you started expressing your friendship in the letter. Finally, at the bar you created friendship (in the sense of making a new friend) and promoted friendship (in the sense of bringing more friendships into the world). It\u2019s very difficult to evade the functions of values by the way. In trying to get through all these functions of friendship in one example, I accidentely referred to many other instances of it as well: Touring Europe will normally entail expressing Openness and Self-searching. Appreciating a good beer is a form of appreciating beauty and at the same time expressing Good Taste. You appreciated your bro at the bar in his Charm and \u2018Interestingness\u2019, and then went on expressing that appreciation by small talking to him, while at the same time respecting the rules of small talk. Etcetera. Back to the main question then. Ethics (moral philosophy) entails many different normative theories (theories that tell what is valuable and how life should be liven, whether personally, socially, and/or societally/culturally). Consequentialist theories will put the emphasis on promoting some values. Being a good person means changing to world for the better. Utilitarians are consequentialists who go as far as saying that the only thing of (intrinsic) value is Happiness. So here a good person is the one who brings as much Happiness in the world as he possibly can (his own happiness regarding as only 1 instance of it). Kantianism/Deontology focusses on respecting values. A more inhibitory and rule-like interpretation. For Kant the consequences (cf. promoting a value) NEVER matter, the only thing which matters is whether or not you\u2019re following an internal moral rule or principle (maxim) and whether or not this rule is true. It\u2019s worth noting though that Kant viewed his entire ethics as a form of respecting and/or expressing Rationality. Aristotle and Virtue ethics focusses a lot more on expressing values by enhancing the virtues inside yourself. For Aristotle it\u2019s not that important to understand and follow the rules of friendship or to bring friendship to the world. The most important thing here is to become a good friend yourself. And the way to do so? Practice by living a friendly life\u2026 yeah, he\u2019s not my favourite either. To round up: a value is an abstract concept that motivates life and functions in 4 possible ways (appreciation, expression, respect, and promotion). Normative ethical theories will use values in two ways: they state which values are important and which are not and they say how these values should function in your life - whether you should express value X and promote value Y or whether to appreciate value Y and respect value Z, etcetera. Hope this answers your question. Sorry if this thing is rather long. ",

            "answer_text": "In the most general sense of the word, values are concepts each individual considers important in their life. In this sense, value is merely a commodity that does not necessarily have an ethical component - the love of money, for instance, can be thought of as a personal value. However, when values are held to a moral or ethical standard, there is a clear shift toward the use of that commodity (value) for good ends - as defined by a religion or ethical system. ",
