            "answer_text": "We are so often quick to label others as evil, but are they really?  Or are we confusing evil behavior with evil identity? I think we are. Yes, there is evil behavior.  But no one (sane) believes that he is committing an evil act.  Even Hitler was trying to make the world a better place.  Yes, he was twisted in his thinking.  But inside his head, he thought he was doing good. And that for me is a very important factor for someone to \"be\" evil.  They must know that their act is evil TO THEM, and they must still do the act.  Otherwise it's just a difference of opinion. For example, pro-lifers believe that abortion is evil.  They think doctors that perform the abortions are evil.  But those doctors truly think that they are helping women in need.  Likewise abortion advocates believe groups of people praying outside planned parenthood clinics are evil because they think these people want to suppress women's rights. But these pro-lifers are only trying to save babies. See?  It all comes down to perspective. Most people have reasons for doing the things they do, even so-called evil people.  But if an evil act is simply self-serving, is the person evil?  No.  He is simply doing what he believes is best for achieving his goals. That's not evil, even if the act seems evil. Everyone (sane) wants to do good.  I believe the goal of goodness is inherent in every (sane) person.  The way in which we define goodness changes. The evil of an act is defined by the people who did NOT commit the act.  But for someone to \"be evil\" they must define an act as evil and still do it.  I don't mean that they think OTHER PEOPLE will call them evil.  I mean THEY think the act is evil.  I mean they think that they should not do it.  I mean the act serves no purpose except to spread evil. No one (sane) will do it. That is why I think no one (sane) is evil.  Sociopaths, psychopaths, and deranged people though\u2026  In the words of Alfred Pennyworth \"Some men just want to watch the world burn.\" But they are insane, not evil. One has to KNOW that one is doing evil and to possess the capability to avoid it to BE evil as opposed to just be DOING evil. If someone lacks the free will* to choose good over evil, then how can you label them as BEING evil?  Does a sociopath, psychopath, or deranged individual possess the necessary free will to rebuke evil?  No.  I don't think so.  They are little better than robots acting out their programming*.  That means that these people are insane, not evil. There is a difference between DOING evil and BEING evil. *[And by the way, this lack of free will is why I consider the effect on free will to be a way to measure the morality of an act.  If your actions set someone else on a course towards doing evil acts\u2026 if your actions messed them up so bad that they lost their free will, then YOUR actions were immoral.  That's how I define immorality.] ",

Calling the cops Pigs. Some of these guys turned their lives around and actually did good and great things. Some went to prison, probably for life. They killed innocent people. Those three cops that murdered Mr. Floyd were evil. there\u2019s no other word to describe them. They were cops and they had sworn an oath to Protect and to Serve. They didn\u2019t do that. But even with our anger still burning hot, I urge you all not to judge all the cops by the actions and deeds of these men. We\u2019re better than that. To attack the cops and try and do them harm makes us no better than those who killed Mr. Floyd. I want real justice for Mr. Floyd too, but not at the cost of more innocent lives, and not at the cost of my soul. We can\u2019t allow the violence to keep escalating, nor can we allow the hate to keep growing out of control. I defend victims no matter what their skin tone is, I\u2019ve always felt that was what the good guys do. That ensures they are never mistook for being evil. Being silent is just as bad as turning tail and running away. I\u2019m speaking on the behalf of my father who was a cop for 30 years, I\u2019m also speaking for the cops I knew personally. They were the good guys, true good guys when it came to helping those they had sworn to protect and to serve. There are countless other good cops out there and even though I don\u2019t know them, or their faces I also speak for them. I also speak for the victims of abuse from the bad cops. When cops break the law, there is no justice, there is only survival. There is then true evil to be faced. We the people must unite and fight together to be a force that is more powerful than the bad gu ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Ultimately the act of committing something evil boils down to your inability to feel empathy towards other people. If you don't possess the required circuitry for feeling other's pain, you are more likely to do something that would be in your self interest but harmful to others. Professor Kevin Dutton explaines the difference between a psychopath and a normal person in terms of how they respond to the Trolley problem.The trolley problem is basically a series of ethical dilemmas where the results of actions are substantially equivalent, namely, the death of 5 vs 1 people.But the response we typically give is different for each scenario. For instance, here are two situations:1)  Let's say a trolley is hurtling down a track and is sure to mow down 5 people. You, the protagonist, have access to a switch that will save them if you flick it. However if you do flick it, another man on a different track is going to die. What do you do?In this case, the decision making is done by the Prefrontal cortex region of the brain, which is otherwise responsible for logical and rational thinking. Most people, psychopathic or otherwise, have no trouble in turning the switch, because even though the thought of killing someone isn't particularly nice, in utilitarian terms the choice is obvious. The brain perhaps takes the one guy to be collateral damage in the overall scheme of things. 2)   Here's the second scenario. In this case there's no switch to be flicked, but you are standing on top of a foot overbridge along with a bulky person. You can heave the fat guy over, and his bulk would be enough to stop the trolley. This would kill the unfortunate bystander, but the ultimate result would still be same i.e. 5 people saved for the cost of one.Now in this scenario, most people have trouble in agreeing to do the deed. This is because here we encounter something called Empathy, the feeling of being able to feel what someone else is feeling.This happens because in this case the amygdala, the region associated with emotional responses gets involved. So it's no longer a rational choice for the brain.And this is where psychopaths come into picture. They would have no trouble in chucking the unfortunate soul over. If one were to scan their brain for activity during this test, the amygdala would record no or little activity. ",

            "answer_text": "If there is good, there is evil - is there not? But then again, who are we to say what is evil and what is good? Are we perfect enough to say what others can be defined to be?  As John Locke said, when we are all born, we are born with a \"tabula rasa\" or \"blank slate\". Given that, no one is born with immoral ideas pinned in their mind. Rather we develop our ideas, develop our morals, our values from the experiences we have from society. Therefore, we cannot blame someone for being so-called \"evil\". Why? Because they are not. They are a product of society. Their actions have all been a result of their experiences within society.  And that again leads to our question of what is \"evil\". What is \"good\"? Who are we to label people as \"good\" and \"evil\"? Who among us is normal enough, perfect enough, good enough to say that the other person is evil or good? Society creates a frame - some sort of definition. So when we say that something is evil or good, it is not us who is saying that. It is not us who is defining that. Rather, it is society that frames a person as such and we, somewhat docile creatures, accept it.  So the short answer. Are some people evil. No. Why? Because we are in no position to define them as such.  Update: Recently, I came across this article - \u2018Dark patch\u2019 visible in brain scans of killers and rapists, neurologist claims Now I am reconsidering my stance. Perhaps people are born evil....  ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe in good or evil. There are merely karmic instruments. Some violate our perceptions of what that means, or our own personal identity through their violence, which is always regrettable; and yet remains karmic in nature. The problem of evil isn\u2019t really a problem when you see it from a larger perspective than a selfish one. If I\u2019m overly identified with my race, or my family or my neighborhood or whatever; I\u2019ll perceive my suffering in these contexts, regardless of who appears to be responsible for that. Leave God out of it. It\u2019s just karma, like everything else in the dualistic trap we\u2019re all in, and trying to get out of also. Karma is both the problem and the solution to the problem. Being responsible for yourself is important. Here is what Kahlil Gibran says on this subject, which I heartily agree with: On Crime & Punishment Then one of the judges of the city stood forth and said, \"Speak to us of Crime and Punishment.\" And he answered saying: It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind, That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself. And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed. Like the ocean is your god-self; It remains for ever undefiled. And like the ether it lifts but the winged. Even like the sun is your god-self; It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent. But your god-self does not dwell alone in your being. Much in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man, But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening. And of the man in you would I now speak. For it is he and not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist, that knows crime and the punishment of crime. Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world. But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you, So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also. And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all. Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self. You are the way and the wayfarers. And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone. Ay, and he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone. And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts: The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder, And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed. The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked, And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon. Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured, And still more often the condemned is the burden-bearer for the guiltless and unblamed. You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked; For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together. And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also. If any of you would bring judgment the unfaithful wife, Let him also weight the heart of her husband in scales, and measure his soul with measurements. And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offended. And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the ax unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots; And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad, the fruitful and the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth. And you judges who would be just, What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh yet is a thief in spirit? What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit? And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver and an oppressor, Yet who also is aggrieved and outraged? And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds? Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve? Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guilty. Unbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake and gaze upon themselves. And you who would understand justice, how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of light? Only then shall you know that the erect and the fallen are but one man standing in twilight between the night of his pigmy-self and the day of his god-self, And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation. On Laws Then a lawyer said, \"But what of our Laws, master?\" And he answered: You delight in laying down laws, Yet you delight more in breaking them. Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter. But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore, And when you destroy them, the ocean laughs with you. Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent. But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers, But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness? What of the cripple who hates dancers? What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things? What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless? And of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters law-breakers? What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun? They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws. And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows? And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth? But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you? You who travel with the wind, what weathervane shall direct your course? What man's law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man's prison door? What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man's iron chains? And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man's path? People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing? On Good & Evil And one of the elders of the city said, \"Speak to us of Good and Evil.\" And he answered: Of the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil. For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst? Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it thirsts, it drinks even of dead waters. You are good when you are one with yourself. Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil. For a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house. And a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom. You are good when you strive to give of yourself. Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself. For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast. Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, \"Be like me, ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance.\" For to the fruit giving is a need, as receiving is a need to the root. You are good when you are fully awake in your speech, Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose. And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue. You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps. Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping. Even those who limp go not backward. But you who are strong and swift, see that you do not limp before the lame, deeming it kindness. You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good, You are only loitering and sluggard. Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles. In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: and that longing is in all of you. But in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the sea, carrying the secrets of the hillsides and the songs of the forest. And in others it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles and bends and lingers before it reaches the shore. But let not him who longs much say to him who longs little, \"Wherefore are you slow and halting?\" For the truly good ask not the naked, \"Where is your garment?\" nor the houseless, \"What has befallen your house?\" ",

            "answer_text": "I don't quite agree with Matt Johnson's equation of evil with sadism.  To me, evil means adhering to a moral principle that others (or god/s if you're inclined that way) would find abhorrent.  Hurting someone carelessly or for sheer fun is IMO amoral - i.e. lacking morals - and probably sociopathic but not quite the same as evil.  Evil would be feeling a moral duty to hurt others, even if it's difficult and there's no pleasure in it.  Note also that people might perform evil acts without actually being evil for the sake of self-preservation or because they believe some other moral principle (e.g. loyalty/obedience) takes priority. Based on that I'd say yes, some people are evil.  There are definitely people who feel morally obliged to hurt or even kill others.  They're in the history books as mass murderers, or in the headlines as serial killers.  There are people who feel morally obliged to steal or lie; these are lesser kinds of evil, but still evil and not mere weakness or amorality.  There are many other examples involving many other kinds of beliefs, though Anon's point about moral relativity is important as we go down the list from \"thou shalt not kill\" to less universal moral standards.  Certain religious leaders have believed that they had a moral duty to impregnate their female followers.  Most would find such a belief abhorrent and therefore consider such people evil, but in a few cultures that belief might not seem bad at all. No matter how you define morality, the world is full not only of people who have weak morals but of those who are actually evil.  Fortunately, there are also many who are good. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, hell yes! Unlike most of the answers here which center on psychopathic persons and behaviors, I tend to get real simple-minded about evil: actions which harm others are evil. Treating people as if they are things is evil. Using others for personal advantage is evil.  It isn't all about intent or empathy or desire -- there's a component of results to be factored in: on a scale of one to ten, there are ninety nine shades of evil and good (\"that's a joke, son.\")  The task before us is to at least try not to use others for our own benefit alone, nor cause them harm in the process.  Practical example from medicine: \"First, do no harm.\" How often is that precept used to justify taking no action? Sure, anyone in the USA can crawl into the ER and get treatment. They'll walk or wheel out in a stable condition if they're lucky, but if the came in with a treatable chronic condition like cancer they're unlikely to get treatment, because doing no harm also means \"you can do nothing and get away with it.\" The evil lies in having the power to do something for another's benefit but withholding it.  Another example: \"It's better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.\" Better for whom? Certainly not whomever one must beg for forgiveness; if there's no harm there's nothing to forgive. Doing something without permission is evil in that it's a selfish expedient and often used to justify behaviors that are completely self-serving.  As of this moment, I'm inclined to think that only completely innocent harmful acts are not evil. Maybe I'm just getting older and even more cynical? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes is the short answer. The issue is a little more complex than that, however. This case does touch upon the age old debate of is it nature or nurture, as if people are evil then they could be born that way, but sometimes it is the environment that they are brought up in as well. Evil is also a very complex topic as well. What one person considers evil could be another person a correct action. A good example of this is ISIS. They think that they are correct and they are fighting the great evil of the west. We think differently. Please do not think for one second that I am suggesting that they are right, I mealy am showing the difference of opinion. That being said, there is a clear cut areas that we can all agree on. No one can make an argument that the holocaust was correct, no one can make an argument that the bombing in Cambodia was right, no one can make an argument that the infecting of black men in 1920's with syphilis was right. These things were evil. Again the conversation get more interesting with a couple of different facts. When the Nazis high command was given a psychology test, they found that they were all very psychology healthy. They all had certain circumstances which changed their ethics and their morals. People change dependant upon where they are and what the people they are with are doing. As a result a perfectly health person can have their morality changed to the point where they can do the most atrocious acts that have ever been committed because of the situation that they are in. Are certain people born evil? We can never know. Whilst there are psychopaths and sociopaths who are capable of horrific acts, are they evil is another matter. Whilst they can do evil acts, is this a case of bad upbringing or an encouragement of their natural biology and physiology? We will never really know. People can do amazingly horrific acts which are evil. The mechanism on how this works is another matter. ",

            "answer_text": "I feel that the word itself doesn\u2019t exist in humanity. Nothing in this world can be truly evil, including humans. Thinking about it, every living thing is justifying themselves to be doing something good, no one can just be thinking malice on another. Even the worst people there ever were thought they were doing the right thing as people, for how can people answer the question for themselves as to who they are if all they have done was malice on another without their own justification on the matter. Animals in their way aren\u2019t truly evil all throughout, even though it may be straying away from the question, they aren\u2019t doing anything with conscious action of their doing of it. Animals do not justify themselves or think rationally so it is obvious they couldn\u2019t comprehend good and evil as concepts, only survival. Evil things live for evil\u2019s spread, not just committing it on occasion. There aren\u2019t such people because all people want to do good for something or someone greater than themselves. So, no one can justify with themselves that evil is good. Moreover, humanity as well, being so unable to be evil, always at some point gives to another. Picture Hitler, he hated the Jews, but gave his all to the German people and his country, not to justify his cause in anyway in the stretch of the imagination, but he along with all will eventually give to another, so thus will do something good.

            "answer_text": "Q. Are there evil people? \u00b7 -According to evolution, all the life in earth were arise from simple DNA. First it started as a single cell as a unicellular organism and later evolved into complex multicellular organism. All those organisms are related and evolved by the simple DNA instruction. Charles Darwin was the first to formulate a scientific argument for the theory of evolution by means of natural selection.  -So DNA is the life of organism. No DNA, no life.   -When DNA makes a human being, mind spontaneously occur in that human and it permanently disappear when that living being dies. \u00b7 -Today\u2019s society thinking is that during their lifetimes, some people become good and some people become bad due to genetics (nature) or influenced by environment (nurture). Bad actions of bad people are not due to their fault and good actions of good people are not due to their effort either. - - -From the view of Theravada Buddhism,. -Human beings are not blank slate at birth, according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism. Some people are born good regardless of their good or bad environment or good or bad behaviors of their parents. Some people are born bad regardless of their good or bad environment or good or bad behaviors of their parents, too. -That does not mean their good or bad behaviors, attitudes are fixed since birth. They can change from good to bad or bad to good during their lifetime. During the growing period from childhood to adulthood, they can become good or bad (especially bad if environment encourages) according to influence of environment (parents, teachers, surrounding people, etc). -But it is easier to change from good to bad than bad to good. It takes more effort to change from bad to good than vice versa. It takes much effort to keep on having good behaviors. It is easy to keep on having bad behaviors. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, personality is learned as it was acquired from previous lifetime (his/her repeated actions at that life). In one person's life, his/her actions, which he/she repeatedly does, become his/her habits, behaviors, and then become personality. -According to the philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, Gotama Buddha emphasized more on the morality rather than any other thing as a person's destiny. - Not doing the bad things, doing the good things, keeping one\u2019s mind purely- these are the Buddha\u2019s teaching. Gotama Buddha- References 1. There are these three types of sons & daughters existing in the world.

            "answer_text": "I think it's most useful to get really precise in the language. To my mind evil is simply Sadism. It's taking pleasure in causing suffering. This is distinct from someone causing suffering for other reasons, which I would argue causes most of the suffering in this world. After all, every time I sit down and eat meat, the product of another organism's suffering is right there in front of me. So the questions that come to mind then are: 1) How many people are Sadists? and 2) How many people let their Sadism become a dominant force in their life? I would tend to say that most people are Sadists to some way or another, perhaps everybody is. If you've ever said \"I told you so\", I'm looking at you. Clearly though saying \"I told you so\" is a pretty minor thing. Most people then really don't let evil become a major driving force in their life. Those that do let it I think could quite reasonably be called evil first and foremost. Everyone else, calling them \"evil\" because they at times do some evil is essentially gross hyperbole. Note as I say all this, I'm not saying that as long as it's not \"evil\", then everything's okay. The fact that you do not take pleasure in the pain you cause does not give you license to induce pain all around you, it's just that we should be using another word for that:  Selfishness. ",

            "answer_text": "Evil is an abstract concept that is a way of defining the polar opposite of an objective morality. So in a sense there is no evil people only people that have been judged as having only or close to only negative traits when compared to what is socially acceptable. The concepts of good and evil will always be changing. They can vary depending upon individual situations, culture and location. A simple example is being gay in some places this is a very negative trait others it isn\u2019t. There are still some myths about the subject and thus someone might associate gay with immoral and thus an evil individual. Other cases are more universally accepted such as serial killers. The desire to protect ourselves creates this type of individual to be associated with evil. Most likely this will not change over time however even this idea is brought about by what is considered to be socially acceptable. So as you can see evil doesn\u2019t exist as an entity of itself but is determined by society to mean undesirable person. ",

People have yet to agree on a set of universal rules, so the terms are of little use to us here. Sam Harris suggests that a fair amount of what we consider to be moral behavior comes from our being social animals. Behaviors that harm the group, like incest, murder and cannibalism have become encoded as unacceptable or at least undesirable. There are people born with a reduced ability to empathize with others, probably due to an abnormal configuration in the connections between forebrain and deeper regions, possibly in the insular cortex. This reduction in function can result in antisocial even sociopathic behavior. To most beliefs systems, this would appear as evil. Others are born with or acquire mental conditions, like paranoia, that can lead to behaviors most would call evil. ",

In real life, \"evil\" is used so no one will question what comes next.  Real people have different and/or flawed beliefs and motivations, or mental illness. How often did George W Bush and Osama Bin Laden (or insert several nations) call each other evil? Neither side ran around attracting support by advertising their evilness. If someone labels someone or something IRL as \"evil\" they're either being manipulated or trying to manipulate others. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no absolute \"good\" or \"evil\". What is \"good\" for one is \"evil\" for someone else, or for some other situation. For me this dichotomy is too simplistic. There is no black and white, just infinite shades of grey (and no I'm not referring to that book!). Examples to make you think: 1) A psychopath kills many ppl. However in his own mind, he had to do it and there was no way for him to not do it. He could not escape his urge which comes from some fault in his brain. Is he good or evil? 2) Now consider that all of his victims were criminals (eg: Dexter). Is he good or evil? Why would this change? 3) Now consider this psychopath is killing Nazis in the 2nd world war (eg: Inglourious Basterds) and he is a highly decorated soldier - nobody calls him a psychopath, but clinically he is. Is he good or evil? Are his actions good or evil? 4) Genghis Khan killed millions of ppl. However his actions helped cool the planet probably buying some time for the rest of the civilisation (Was Genghis Khan history's greenest conqueror?). Were his actions good or evil? ",

Let me explain you with an example: Do we teach a child to lie, and do we teach him to fight, and do we teach him to abuse, they learn that from their own. Why?? Because people are born evil, just imagine, if an infant have a might of 18 years guy but having mind of an infant; what he will do with his parents, if they not fulfill their demand? He will kill his own parents, because he just want to fulfill his desire at any cost..!!! ",

Even being a horror film director Jorge couldn't watch all of it, I think that says it all. I personally feel sick and I want to puke just by reading the wikiedia page. And I think if will ever will be near these maniacs I will actually may have an uncontrollable urge to murder them as quick as possible. Honestly I am light-headed even thinking about that. THE most horrible thing in the modern history. Academy maniacs - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia If you will take EVEN A SLIGHT effort to read this (I really REALLY advise last 3, as they are in Russia and Ukraine, hence you have probably never heard of them) There will be goosebumps all over your body I can guarantee that.
