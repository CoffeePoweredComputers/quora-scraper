            "answer_text": "This theory, if its to deny any meaning of text seems absurd.  Here are four critiques: 1) First, it contravenes our most basic experience of movies and reading literature.  We all come away with thematic understandings of meaning. 2) Its self-refuting.  If its to mean that all meaning is subjective, then the meaning of the theory should likewise have the same problem. 3) If language is to be meaningful, authorship has to be meaningful on some level. 4) This destroys \"wrongness\" in interpretation, which undermines truth and grading and any notion of academic evaluation.
