            "answer_text": "I have given up trying to explain why consciousness is not an emergent property and why emergence is incoherent when applied to consciousness, so this answer is only for readers who already understand that the eliminativist/materialist account of consciousness fails. This means that you understand that awareness cannot be something that physical objects do, or a quality that they have (panpsychism), or even that mind and matter are two parts of the same coin (dual aspect monism), but that all forms and functions, physical or logical, can only exist within a context of what might be called pansensitivity, or sensation-that-makes-sense. This is not to say that human consciousness is the center of the universe and that all phenomena must make sense to us, but that all phenomena must be present in some modality of detection and interaction. This can be understood rationally with no need of any empirical testing. All that is required is for us to play out the null hypothesis: If there is no possibility of any detection or interaction with phenomenon X, then phenomenon X is indiscernible from nothing at all. The OP then, asking how human consciousness works, should be broken down into two separate parts: 1) How does awareness in general work?2) How does human consciousness differ from awareness in general? 1) In consideration of the above, the 'how' of awareness becomes a metaphysical issue - it could be said even a meta-ontological issue. If awareness-in-general (or use my term pansensitivity) is the most primitive prerequisite for all phenomena in all possible universes, then we must retrain ourselves to stop looking for more primitive phenomena which compose awareness.  I think that we can say awareness is sensory-motive in nature. That is, there is a quality of passive perceiving and active participating which cannot be rationally done without. Even an atom or subatomic particle requires a context where its identity is made coherent in some way, where its presence is detected or can be inferred from some detection of its effects. In the absence of such a detection, again, there is no difference between such a particle and nothing at all. There is no context from which to derive that difference.  That doesn't mean solipsism - it doesn't mean that particles don't exist unless we see them, but it does mean that the concept of 'existence' is incompatible with the existence of our own consciousness unless it is identical to detection/participation in some modality or context.  We need not posit a universal mind or God (although there is nothing that I am proposing which rules that out), only that existence itself in the absence of all perception is fantastically implausible given that 100% of what we know of the universe comes to us exclusively through perception. If the universe doesn't need perception, then there would be no rational explanation for why some parts of the universe could evolve such a redundant and irrational feature to depend upon exclusively. From this sensory-motive awareness-in-general, we can develop a hypothesis about how it divides and multiplies itself into different perceived forms and participatory functions. This entails performing a kind of Copernican inversion on our early 21st century* worldview, turning the outside (<matter>mass>energy>entropy>space) in, and the inside (pansense>sense<motive>significance>time) out. I don't expect anyone to really understand that right away...it has taken me several years to put it together in those terms, but hopefully the general idea of the role that symmetry plays comes through. Suffice it to say, I think that how awareness works is that it plays with variations on itself using separation and reconnection on many levels at once. It's very much like the view that has been a part of Eastern philosophy and Western mysticism for centuries, but with the important difference of plugging directly into modern models of physics and information.  As far as information goes, the sensory-motive primitive can be plugged into the medium-signal relation. Physics gives us a lot of these kinds of conjugates: surface-depth, electro-magnetism, space-time, mass-energy, etc, but when we are working with information and semiotics, we lose the concrete reality of sensation and substitute automatic, ideal abstractions of theoretical mechanics. Computer science and math do not concern themselves with how one number is able to add itself to another, only that there is a reliable result. Physics does focus on how phenomena interact, but not what those interactions actually are or what it is that is actually doing the interacting. The Medium-Signal RelationIn a simple case of communication, two people might hold a string tight on opposite sides of a room and pull on the string once to indicate 'yes/true/1' and twice for 'no/false/0'. In this case the string pulling, along with the tactile sensitivity of each person to detect the state of the string with their hands would be the medium. We can argue that behind that sensitivity is a lot of other cellular and molecular interaction, but that only pushes the medium down into the microphysical level of description. Even at the bottom, we still need some quantum-atomic sensitivity for any kind of basis of interaction to emerge (or diverge). The combination of string pulling and any schema which is applied to the interpretation of those pulls would be the signal or sign. Many if not most people confuse 'signals' with the physical conditions (string pulling, neurons 'firing', semiconductors polarizing, etc), but a better understanding is that the signal is a semiotic interpretation; a conscious consideration of changing conditions within a sensory-motive medium. Another metaphor that I like is brightness vs contrast. Brightness is the medium - if you have zero brightness there is nothing to see. Light, brightness, and the ability to see are, in the absolute sense, the same thing: a condition of awareness. Contrast stands in here for information or signal, which is a second-order relation of brightness and darkness. If you have no brightness, contrast doesn't help, but if you do have brightness, then contrast allows many degrees of brightness and frequencies of its absorption to be presented simultaneously.  2) The difference between awareness in general and human consciousness is the incredible degree of elaboration, and the specific experiences which have shaped Homo sapiens. The degree of elaboration I'm referring to would be the number of steps from raw pansensitivity to particular subjective sense vs objectively distanced sense (matter-space), to organic molecules, to cells, to tissues, organs, animals, and vertebrates. The corresponding consciousness of such an elaborate chain of continuous world-crafting seems likely to be be appropriately rich and deep aesthetically. The base level sense and motive is enhanced by orders of magnitude to a heart wrenching, visceral level of participation. I propose that the specific experiences which have shaped us individually and as a species lend our human consciousness its particular qualities. We share many qualities with other species - perhaps tender emotions with mammals, coarse emotions with reptiles, playful trickery with primates, etc. It's all sourced in real experience over hundreds of millions of years. It is, in my view, very much like our individual psychology is shaped by our experience, and our families and societies are shaped by their histories. This is what makes human consciousness human, and this is why an AI cannot simulate who we are. A computer may copy the signals from the medium of our communications, or from the medium of neuroscience, but without the medium of the totality of human experience going all the way back to before the first life form, it will only be a kind of doll - an imitation of who we are cobbled together from what our brains are and how they behave.  *really legacy 20th century ",

            "answer_text": "It depends who you ask. If you ask a neuroscientist they would probably say that consciousness is generated by the brain. Brain activity, specifically the firing of neurons, is the phenomenon  most correlated with consciousness that we know. It seems clear to many neuroscientists that our experience of objects, thoughts and actions, the detailed structure of each of these, is identical to the sequential firing of various groups of neurons. This seems reasonable except for one aspect of experience; equally important to the structure and dynamics (what it is), is the fact that we have an experience of it all. The unique correlation of one phenomenon with another, in this case neural firing with the contents of consciousness, may indicate an identity, but it gives no explanation for the awareness of those contents. What I am talking about is the thing about the color red that you will never explain to a blind man, no matter how long you want to take. The subjective quality of consciousness is explained by neuroscience in terms of self reference. Each brain state, potential quale, must be presented to, or available to, (here the theory gets a bit fuzzy) some form or structure (presumably more neural activity) representing or instantiating the self and then... a miracle happens and there is awareness of the presented potential quale. Some scientists who aren't so keen on miracles realise that the dominant materialist explanation of consciousness can't come up with a better explanation than this, there will never be a way to explain the subjective nature of experience in terms of mechanism, neural firing, other than saying that they are identical. So what they say is that this subjective quality of experience is actually illusory, just something produced by the self-referent information processing of the brain, the neural firing correlated with the contents of consciousness (which as noted above gives no explanation of the nature of subjective experience). Essentially, you aren't really conscious, you just think you are. The problem with this theory (apart from the obvious), is two-fold: Firstly, the fact that awareness is possible without any phenomenal experience (ie. experience of objects or thoughts). Not only is representation (self or not) not necessary for awareness, but these experiences of pure awareness are actually the most intense and clear experiences of awareness possible. All phenomenal experience occurs within awareness but awareness can occur without the experience of discrete phenomena. Thus, awareness is not produced by the interactions of representations of these phenomena. Secondly, the theory is materialist in the sense that it assumes all phenomena are explained solely in terms of the dynamics of material components, discrete entities that exist in an external, independent  (of the subject) world of time and space. These entities of matter are what is real and the reality of subjective experience that may or may not be generated by them is up for debate. However, such a view of reality has been obsolete for nearly a century. We now know that the nature of matter as discrete particles is inextricably dependent on the experience, or observation, of those particles and their effects. If matter is not observed it has no material properties; no mass, no specific spatial location, no effect on any other matter. Instead what exists when unobserved is only an interacting superposition of possibilities, possible future experiences of particulate matter when it is observed. What characterizes a piece of matter, the essence of what it is, is nothing more than how it consistently interacts with other matter - it's properties. This relational definition leaves no room for intrinsically existing \"stuff\". The stuff is just inferred, inferred from ongoing consistent interactions between bits of stuff and between stuff and an observer. The interactions are real. The stuff and the observers are all inferred, with only a relative reality, defining each other in each experience, everything constrained to fit into a story about material objects whizzing around within the fundamental axiomatic dimensions of time and space. Instead they are only the fundamental axioms of our cognized experience. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn't! :) I'm (half) joking. The reason I say that human consciousness doesn't \"work\" is because no one can define it in a scientific way, and further, we cannot say why it might be useful for humans and other animals. Philosophers have the concept of a philosophical zombie  \u2014 a being that looks and acts just like a normal human being, but doesn't have consciousness. How would anyone be able to tell from the outside? And if it is logically conceivable that such a being could exist, then perhaps consciousness isn't really doing any \"work\". Of course I am aware that the question is really about how consciousness arises from biological matter. Since we can't define consciousness scientifically, we are not really able to \"pin it down\" in a laboratory. So all we can really say is that consciousness somehow seems to emerge from neural activity, and that it has to do with subjective experience, self-awareness, attention, and the concept of  a mental space.  I would go so far as to say that no neuroscientist ever really studies 'consciousness' in the sense that the word is used by philosophers and the general public. What we study is objectively observable behavior: this includes cognition, attention, awareness, movement and perception. But none of these observables are synonymous with subjective consciousness. At best we make indirect inferences about subjective experience based on observations. And we link these inferences with neuroscience and philosophy to create speculative stories about consciousness. These stories are fun and I highly recommend playing around with them, but we have to realize that consciousness is one of those concepts that we may never have a handle on. Over the past few years I've answered a surprising number of questions about consciousness. Here are a few that might be illuminating:  What is the currently best scientific answer to the psycho-physical (body-mind) question?Does modern science know how human consciousness has developed?What is the evolutionary reason for having consciousness?Is consciousness computation or a dynamic pattern of \"something\" (energy, matter) flowing? (Some of my own speculation here!)What's the correlation between complexity and consciousness?How can we measure human consciousness?Is consciousness an illusion?Could you have two independent consciousness(es) if you split a brain in half?How can understanding consciousness and the brain change the future of humanity?Can consciousness be separated from body-awareness?",

            "answer_text": "Quoting the last line in a Science article from late last year October 2017 \u201cWhat is consciousness, and could machines have it?\u201d Although centuries of philosophical dualism have led us to consider consciousness as unreducible to physical interactions, the empirical evidence is compatible with the possibility that consciousness arises from nothing more than specific computations. Perhaps the premise of the article, \u201ccould machines be conscious?\u201d necessarily forces the examination of what is consciousness from a computational perspective, cleverly skirting the philosophical debate. While we are still quite far from answering \u201chow human consciousness works ?\u201d even from a computational perspective, the article throws some light on this question (again from a computational perspective) by breaking conscousness down into two types of information processing computations in order to highlight what is missing in current machines despite their successes (accuracy) in tasks involving perception, classification, and translation - tasks that were until recently beyond the reach of machines.Breaking human consciousness down into these two types of information processing also enables us to think of how they may inspire novel machine architectures that are conscious.From the perspective of machine learning community, however, which continues to draw inspiration from how our brains work, the approach so far is not to emulate these information processing systems but selectively choose certain aspects of conscious processing \u201cas priors\u201d into machine learning architecture.A recent example of that is the choice of a consciousness prior by Yoshua Bengio into existing machine learning models so they can hopefully perform causal reasoning and planning.So what are the two types of information processing computations that is collectively called consciousness? Global availability C1 (very closely related to attention) . This seems to be a boring coinage, but it captures a key notion of consciousness. Our brain is organized into specialized subsystems for efficient processing, but this also poses a challenge - it leads to a diversity of probabilistic interpretations. So the brain needs to choose among the various possibilities and decide on a single course of action.For example, a thirsty elephant needs to determine the location of the nearest water hole and move towards it. Such decision making requires an architecture for efficient pooling over all available sources of sensory information, choosing the best option, sticking to that option over time, and coordinating all internal and external processes towards the achievement of that goal. In summary integrating all available evidence to converge towards a goal, is faced by any animal or autonomous system and corresponds to the first definition of consciousness : global availabilityThis form of consciousness is present in humans and animals (to varying degrees)Self-monitoring C2. While C1 consciousness reflects capacity to access external information, self-monitoring is the ability to reflexively represent oneself. Error detection is an example of self-monitoring and even one year old infants know they made a wrong choice in perceptual decision tasks.These two types of information processing are largely considered complementary/orthogonal dimensions of consciousness.Any information processing in our brains that does not fall into these two categories falls into a third bucket/category C0 and is called unconscious processing. This category is where the bulk of our intelligence lies. Interestingly the processing done by all currently successful machine learning models fall into this category of information processing in the brain (needless to say that does not imply intelligence is largely emulated in machines).So it is the C1 and C2 types of processing that current machines lack and need to have in order to become conscious.The choice of incorporating a conscious prior into current models as proposed by Yoshua Bengio accomplishes in part the C1 deficiency of current machine learning models (though it does not address C2)Also, from a machine learning perspective, the representations of experiences gathered through sensory input are largely high dimensional distributed representations - all tasks performed by current machine learning models are on these representations. It remains to be seen what is the nature of those representations upon which unconscious processing operates on. A claim Yoshua makes in his work, is our conscious processing must be on low dimensional representations - such a constraint imposed facilitates the generation of a low dimensional representation assisted by an attention mechanism over the high dimensional distributed representation that serves as the substrate. It remains to be seen if there is such an analogue in our brains.We do have evidence that experiences are transferred from the hippocampus to the cortical areas during sleep, along with selective erasures of the hippocampus, presumably like a scratch pad being erased for future use. However it is not known if this consolidation of experiences into the cortical areas is an abstraction of the sensory experiences like the low dimensional representations being studied as candidates for reasoning and planning in machines.

            "answer_text": "Suppose there are five elements A, B, C, D and E. Now suppose the compound of these five elements makes up human consciousness. Every human have this compound of five elements which is why their consciousness works like human consciousness. If any of these five elements is missing or not working then it will cause human consciousness to not work properly. Properties of these elements are such that A and B have opposite properties, like say A is explosive and B is extinguisher. C is similar to A and D is similar to B. E is like a booster of all of these. Increase in strength of A diminish the strength of B and vice versa. In the same way any change in strength of any of these elements causes changes in other four in some ways. Now suppose all of these five elements share the job of consciousness. Each one of these control some activities, talents, behavior, organs and so on. For example, suppose A have more control of activity of speech, talent of articulation, behavior of lying and organ of mouth, but have less control of organ eyes which is more controlled by B and eyes still speaking truth which is behavior controlled by B, and his talent is straightforward. In this way different things are shared by all these five elements. Now suppose there are 10 individual humans. Each having all these five elements of consciousness and their consciousness is working properly. But all of these individual are different from each other such that no two are exactly same, though can be similar. How it can be so when all the individuals have all five elements in working condition? It is because these five elements are in different concentration in each of the individuals. The concentration of elements depends upon the teachings, experience, situation, biological factors of the individuals and these factors cause these elements to strengthen or diminish or change in the course of time. If A is more powerful in five individuals but different degrees, while other five have more powerful B, then any idea given to all of them will cause five individuals with more powerful A to get angry, while the same idea will cause other five with more powerful B to laugh. So, though the mixture of the elements is same in every individual, the different concentration of each elements can cause different reaction with different intensity. For example if explosive element is in more concentration in mixture then the fire will cause explosion, but if concentration of extinguisher element is more in the mixture then the fire will get extinguished. This explains the perception that how different individual perceive any idea or incident differently even though they are all human and their brain constitutes the same things. One of the important quality of consciousness is attention to different activities simultaneously. I explain this similarly as above. Imagine you are driving the car and disccusing about some serious issue with the person beside you. You are doing the talking, driving, watching road and having attention to your own bodily condition of tiredness, heat, drowsiness etc., all at the same time. So here, A is controlling the speech, B keeping eyes on road, C driving the car, D watching your own bodily conditions, and E boosting the attention of all four. One phenomena related to consciousness is feeling of observer. If I am thinking, who is observing me thinking. There is faint feeling that someone within our mind observing us doing things we do. Who is that observer? So here, if B is thinking then A is observing him thinking. If A is doing something physical, then B is observing him doing. If A and B discussing then C, D and E observing. So, in one way or the other, one is observing the other and we have the feeling of observer within our mind. When we say we are doing, thinking, observing, it's not we but mind is doing all this. We are just choosing what we want to do and with what idea we want to go. Explaining thinking, intuition, introspection etc. is tricky and need more posts or simply a book. One thing about understanding consciousness is that don't take it as the work of one mind but several minds within mind. If one mind can be conscious why can't there be several conscious minds within mind? Considering human consciousness as the work of one mind makes it very difficult to understand. But when you split mind in several different mind (through observation) doing different tasks then understanding consciousness becomes lot easier, and it's because actually this is the case. In one of the examples above I said mouth telling lies while eyes telling truth. Who is the one telling the truth, if mind telling lies? Mind doing two absolutely opposite tasks at the same time? Well I don't think so. Eyes never tell lies. If one mind control both speech and eyes then eyes must tell lies also. So there is a good reason to think of several conscious minds within mind. I hope you a get little explanation of how does human consciousness work. ",

            "answer_text": "A Study of Consciousness Jamshed R Bilimoria Premise: Consciousness is the pure subject. It is the internal witness. It is our true self. This is because it looks \u2018out\u2019 to all our mental and sensory inputs.They are a part of the object. Yet, as we are aware from daily experience, consciousness is aware of itself. It is self evident. It does not need the intellect to know itself.In deep-sleep, where there is an absence of intellect, we are able to be aware of the \u2018nothingness\u2019 of deep-sleep. The basic flaw in todays Scientific thinking is clumping our mental faculties (thoughts in our brain) along with that which is aware/conscious of them, as one and the same entity. In fact, they are separate entities. Consciousness can experience thoughts as the object and therefore has to be different. As Consciousnesses origin is closer than our brain, all our attempts to capture it in the world, including other peoples or species consciousness, will be futile. We are looking at the wrong side of the telescope. The only way to \u2018experience\u2019 pure Consciousness is to look within. This is beyond Realism. That is why the hard problem is nowhere near solved. Scientist have to step aside. Because it is internal, it can only be known in its entirety by a logical process popularly known as Advaita Vedanta. It is a study, using the scientific temperament, of how to experience Nascent Consciousness. Witness: Your thoughts may be different from another but the experience of pure \u201cI know\u2019 is the same in all. It is the pure \u2018aware-ing\u2019 factor in all species. The equipment\u2019s of perception-emotion-thought vary from species to species. The 3 states of consciousness- waking-dream-deep sleep, the 3 states of mind-conscious-sub conscious- unconscious are nothing but consciousness contacting different modes of mind. Identity: Consciousness is separate from the equipment\u2019s and modes of mind. It is the pure awareness factor, the pure \u2018I am\u2019. I am aware-of the tree. I am aware-of love. I am aware-of this thought. The fact that perception-emotion-thought, waking-dream-deepsleep, conscious-sub conscious-unconscious, can be recognised as the \u2018object\u2019 of experience (you are aware of the darkness of the unconscious and deep sleep) indicates that the true \u2018I am\u2019 (Pure Consciousness) is you core. Your real Self. Absolute Objectivity: Your real Self is Consciousness and not this personality. The body/brain is matter/energy - temporary, ephemeral, finite, limited. What witnesses it is your real Self, Consciousness. It objectively, coldly, looks at time, space and matter through thought and perception. You can never die. Pure Consciousness can never die. Only matter/energy can change form (\u2018die\u2019). Something cannot disappear into nothing. And something cannot come out of nothing. All energy is permanent. The first Law of Thermodynamics. Consciousness can also be termed pure Energy. Self: Consciousness is not matter/energy. Consciousness is not thought or brainwaves. It is the witness of the outcome of brainwaves. It watches the intellect, thought, feelings, impulses, and perceptions. Consciousness is the closest we can get to our Self. In fact, we can\u2019t get any closer because it is the real subject. It is the first person in us. It looks out at everything. Everything else is exterior to it. Infinite: You think, who witnesses the thoughts? Who is aware of the thoughts? Conditioned Consciousness. Consciousness conditioned by the electro-chemistry of our brain. (It stands alone as primary awareness, Pure Consciousness. Our true nature.) Thoughts whiz by like a film. Who watches that film? Another thought! Then, you are guilty of infinite progression. To give yourself the benefit of doubt, at the end of the day, Consciousness is aware of even that infinite thought because it is the awareness principle in thought. The same can be said about all our other mental faculties\u2014emotions, impulses, whims, fancies, dreams, fantasies, drives, passions. To emphasise, what is that entity which is aware of all the outcomes of the brains activities? It is the awareness principle per se. Pure Consciousness, pure awareness. The \u2018I am\u2019 that stands alone. \u2018I am\u2019 \u2018thinking.\u2019 \u2018I am\u2019 \u2018sad.\u2019 \u2018I am\u2019 \u2018fretful.\u2019 \u2018I am\u2019 \u2018in love.\u2019 At the level of perception, the same Consciousness works. The eyes see the colour and form of a flower. But without Consciousness to be aware of the colour and form, the flower would not be perceived. Similarly, you hear the sound of a symphony through your ears. But without pure Consciousness, the sound would not be heard. Fundamental: As soon as you see the flower, you say \u2018I see a flower\u2019 or \u2018I am\u2019 \u2018seeing a flower\u2019 or \u2018I am\u2019 \u2018hearing a symphony.\u2019 This Consciousness is what we unconsciously equate with ourselves all through our lives. \u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I feel,\u2019 \u2018I say,\u2019 \u2018I smell\u2019 are all directly pointing at our Consciousness, though we may not be aware of it. We presume we are indicating our mind, but we are not. Awareness is aware of thought. Awareness is aware of feeling. Awareness is aware of speech. Awareness is aware of smell. It is the Eye of the eye. The Ear of the ear. Non-material: Pure Consciousness is subjective thought ad infinitum - \u201cI know\u201d \u201cI know that I know\u201d \u201cI know that I know that I know\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026.Pure Consciousness is the pure aware-ing factor which is infinite. Unlike breaks in thought, space-time etc. there are no breaks in consciousness. It is one infinite whole and everything is encompassed in it including space-time, any other dimensions or universes, thought, emotions, perceptions, actions, all the laws of physics. This is because it is not composed of matter/energy. It is the observer of matter/energy and therefore has to be something other.Matter/energy cannot experience itself. Can a spoon witness a spoon? It is fundamental. Consciousness is God, states Advaita Vedanta. We have to distinguish between Pure Consciousness and Conditioned Consciousness. Self-Absorbed: Pure Consciousness is awareness per se. Consciousness on its own. The aware-ing factor. It has no limitations. It has no boundaries. It is eternal and infinite. It is not aware \u2018of\u2019 anything. It is just only awareness. It is not energy/matter. Vedanta declares it as God. It existed before the Big Bang and Multi-Universes and is the common factor in all Universes because it doesn\u2019t acknowledge anything other than itself and is the only non-material aspect in the universe. It is blind to conditioned consciousness. Just as a mirror reflects infinite objects but can't see any of them. When It contacts energy/matter in any form- thought, emotion, perception, impulse, intuition etc. it becomes conditioned Consciousness. Pure Consciousness becomes \u2018conscious of\u2019\u2026..thoughts, emotions, intuition, perceptions, sensations etc. Its point of contact in humans is in the electrochemistry in the brain. That\u2019s when Pure Consciousness becomes conditioned. Of course, the conditioning factor and point varies from species to species. Unchanging: This personality, the physical body as well as the mind, whether you take it as an independent entity or the brain, is always in a flux of change. Subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, enter and exit the brain at various frequencies. How can these unequal factors be equal to one and the same \u2018I?\u2019 Also, our life, our day, is a cycle of three different states or worlds. The wake-er is not equal to the dreamer, is not equal to the deep sleeper. Yet we claim these three personalities as \u2018I.\u2019 The unconscious mind, as in deep sleep and swoon, is the seed of the conscious mind. This is proven by the ballet dancer or the astronaut being the same before and after deep sleep. They don\u2019t change going through this nothingness. That means that during deep sleep (unconscious) they were in their non-manifested or seed state.Consciousness is aware of the \u2018nothingness\u2019 of deep-sleep. We report that we had a \u2018sound\u2019 or \u2018deep\u2019 sleep. Who is aware of the nothingness of deep-sleep? Real: Similarly, it is aware of the dreamer going through the experience of the dream world. The dream world seems as real to the dream personality as the waking world seems to our personality. That is why Vedanta claims, that as we cant prove that the dream state is any more real than the waking state, and we know the dream is merely made of our imagination (thought stuff), it is then logical to presume this world is nothing but a dream. Identical in All: Actually, from Pure Consciousnesses standpoint there is no real contact point between Pure Consciousness and energy-matter, because Pure Consciousness, by definition is Identical in all that experience It. Therefore Fundamental, One, Whole, Infinite, Eternal. Conditioned Consciousness, which witnesses the workings of the mind, just appears to be, like a mirage in a desert or a sound or sight heard or seen by the mentally ill. The world is therefore only an appearance, a dream, and not real. Hindu and Buddhist philosophies call it \u2018Maya\u2019 (Illusion). The only reality in this or any universe or before the universes were formed is Pure Consciousness. God. You and I and everyone and everything is, in reality, only that Pure Consciousness. And your physical and mental personality and the world, is a result of Conditioned Consciousness, which is an illusion and a delusion. Being: \u2018I\u2019 has to be independent of the matrix of perceptions, emotions, and thoughts. We say \u2018I think.\u2019 Then we say \u2018I feel.\u2019 Simultaneously, we say \u2018I see,\u2019 \u2018I hear.\u2019 Now, the thinker is not the feeler, is not the seer, is not the hearer. How can so many unequal factors be equal to one and the same \u2018I?\u2019Those who claim that \u2018I\u2019 is an amalgam of all these factors should restudy mathematics. Do we have many identities? Even in multiple personalities, the thoughts etc. differ but the experience of awareness/identity remains as one. Unless you believe that a singular entity called \u2018I\u2019 is comprised of more than one being, it is impossible to claim that \u2018I\u2019 is an amalgam of so many mental, emotional, and perceptive inputs without realizing that pure Consciousness, which absorbs all these exterior energies, is the real \u2018I.\u2019 Neutral: The most difficult aspect of Consciousness to appreciate is that it is neutral. It is only the intellect (brain), which is the object of experience, which differentiates, judges.God is neither good nor bad nor does She take sides. She is the silent Witness. He, she, or it, because it is above gender, is the empowering force of nature. Take away conditioned consciousness from a being and it will certainly not be empowered to think, feel, perceive, act. It is the source of all energy.The fountainhead of all energy is within. Consciousness is that which breathes life into the mind and propels the physical body. It is the bio in the biological. Energizer: By extension, It gave vitality and energy for the Big Bang to explode, for electrons and gamma rays to dance, for birds to twit, for Pavarotti to sing. This is because it is fundamental energy and non-material as proved above.It gave power to Christ and Buddha to walk the earth, but it also gave power to Hitler and Genghis Khan. The same power that backs the noblest of deeds backs the most sordid of crimes. It by itself remains neutral. It is like electricity and petrol, they empower but they have no say in the actual working of the gadgets and vehicles. That depends on the quality of the equipment. The Creator and Governor of the Laws of the Universe: It is beyond the realms of time, space, and causation. It is beyond the 4 fields of the Universe. It is beyond energy, force, and matter. It is beyond laws. It is the fundamental substratum. The primordial Energy. By reflex, because it is infinite and sentient, the calculator and sustain-er, of the very laws that govern everything. Omnipresent: It is the substratum of space. It is that which space is built on. We cannot be conscious of space without the original witness in us. As space is expanding, what is the medium it is moving on? It has to be subtler than space. That is an aspect of Consciousness. Eternal: Time is also built on the substratum of Consciousness. Time flows through the medium of Pure Consciousness. Without consciousness we would not be able to witness time. Also, thought travels faster than the speed of light. Because time is subjective, a unit of experience.An hour seems like five minutes to two lovers. It seems like an eternity to someone sitting on a hot stove. It is therefore unborn and deathless. Only matter/energy can have a \u2018birth\u2019 and \u2018death\u2019. Can change form. The time and space you experience in dreams are completely different from the waking state. You may have spent a day in your dream but on waking up, it was only five minutes. You walk through a huge desert in your dream but on waking up, you realize it was only a figment of your mind. Beyond Cause and Effect: It is true that at the subatomic level nature does not obey the laws of cause and effect. It is based on probabilities. Quantum mechanics studies these probabilities. That only proves the plasticity and dream-like characteristics of this world. But as soon as the laws reach the perceptual level, the level which conditioned Consciousness associates with, it springs into cause and effect most concretely. An apple seed produces an apple tree; it doesn\u2019t probably produce a mango tree. Cats produce kittens; they don\u2019t probably produce puppies. Newton\u2019s laws of cause and effect work effectively for making buildings and bridges. Superunknown: The drop from a universal oneness to diversity can never be explained by science no matter how complicated the equipment or how powerful the intellect. Because the cause is not involved. So, there will be a lot of vagueness and liquidity the more and more scientists probe. But once the dust settles, the laws of cause and effect arise to the level of Consciousness. Cause and effect, and even probability, can be affected only by matter/energy. Some entity which is non-material cannot have these properties. It\u2019s the same with the independent mind (the brain is merely a conduit between Consciousness and our body - a man is reported to have only brain fluids but he behaved normally); how it sprung into being was certainly not through a process of cause and effect. But having sprung into existence, it now obeys the laws of cause and effect. The same with time and space. Even though physicists have found them relative today, at our level of Consciousness, they are not. So, we can still with confidence stick to the old concept that the apparent fundamentals of the world are time, space, matter and causation. All Powerful: Physics also claims that the universe started at a point of infinite density called the Big Bang. And it exploded to create the universe. Apart from absolutely ignoring Consciousness, they even ignore the fact of the substratum. What was that point of infinite density \u2018resting\u2019 on? Nothing? But that nothing had the power to produce the Big Bang! Also, consciousness is eternal. Immanent: Scientists have broken and rebroken elementary particles to infinitesimal sizes and still find no end in sight. Yet that is immaterial. However minute a particle is, it is still an entity with properties. Take away the properties and will there be nothing left? No. There will still be a substratum that energies them. What does Plank-length rest on? What is its substratum that binds one unit to the other? The pure thing in itself. Consciousness. Scientists have not been able to crack the problem of the universe because their direction has been external. Undivided: Consciousness cannot be divided. It is the common experience of everyone. Like, relatively, space cannot be divided. You may claim that the space that occupies a room is different from the outside space, but it is not so. Because the walls that divide the room from the outside space are composed of the same space. Similarly, Pure Consciousness appears separate, conditioned Consciousness, when it is in contact with different intellects, like the sun\u2019s reflection seems multiple in different images when reflected off different mirrors. But there is only one sun. Blind to the Universe: Consciousness being all-pervading has nothing other than itself to experience. Only matter/energy can be divided. It has no holes, black or otherwise. It is truly all-pervading taken in its most literal sense. It also has no organs of sense. It has no eyes, ears, skin, tongue, nose. It has no body of feeling, and it transcends the intellect. Thus, it can be logically inferred that Pure Consciousness is blind, dumb, and mute to the Universe. This would come as a shock to all seekers who swear by personal experience to the contrary. God does work in their lives. There is a communication with God possible. All that can be said is that they are delusional. Beyond Good and Evil: All religions believe in an omnipresent, all-pervading God. Yet, paradoxically, to solve the problem of evil and the heinousness of certain acts of man, they have introduced the concept of an opposing force to God, the Devil. If there is a Devil, he limits God\u2019s power and his all-pervasiveness. Clearly, these two ideas are contradictory. If there is clarity of thinking, they have to either abandon their stand on God\u2019s omnipresence and omnipotence or the concept of an opposing force, the Devil. But without the concept of a Devil, their theology of a good God would crack. God (Pure Consciousness) is beyond this world. He transcends it. As Schopenhauer put it, he is \u2018beyond good and evil.\u2019 Absolute Contentment: Consciousness in its pure and Godly form has no connection with this world. It exists in its pure and nascent state in a completely different plane which is totally self-sufficient, self-contained, self-absorbed, and self-pleased. It needs nothing other than its own majesty. All beings intents and desires are only an attempt to regain the state of Pure Consciousness. Transcendent: The creation of this world, the empowerment of nature and activities, like conditioned Consciousness, are all functions of aspects of manifestations of Pure Consciousness/God. They are not functions of God in her pure form. In her pure form, she is not the creator of laws, the empoweree, the witness. She stands detached, alone. Self-Evolution: Consciousness can only be \u2018experienced\u2019 or \u2018realized\u2019 internally. In Vedanta, it is claimed that, initially, Pure Consciousness \u2018acts\u2019 as a dispassionate witness. Then, when a man evolves, it acts as a permit-er, an encourager, a fulfiller, an enjoyer. And finally, he merges with God himself. So, even though God is active by reflex, in the absolute sense She is neutral. _______________________________________________________________________________ Conclusion: Consciousness is our true identity, non-material, and the fundamental force/field of the universe and beyond. It is both immanent and transcendent. The game of life is to \u2018regain\u2019 our true nature/identity. This can be only be achieved by studying consciousness internally. Finally, we achieve our union with Godhead, which is the same in all. ___________________________________________ ",

            "answer_text": "If you look up the definition of consciousness, you may come across these definitions or something very similar:  the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings  the awareness or perception of something by a person  the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world We know that the human brain has about 100 billion cells that can each have up to tens of thousands of connections to other brain cells. That works out to at least 100 trillion connections and the capacity for ten to a hundred times that much. Maybe we could describe human consciousness as the rough average of the highest instances of signals that fire between neurons per microsecond. The highest instances of electrical and chemical signals reinforce each other and are the ones that are able to cross the threshold of consciousness and emerge as our perceptions of reality and thought patterns. The signals contrary to the majority are canceled out and either aren't noticed or barely noticed. Signals from our sensory systems and neurons that store fragments of our memories combine together to produce consciousness millions of times or more per second. In particular, the fragments of memories combine together to form our intuitions, the feelings we get when we have to assess situations without inference or the use of reason.   Maybe the neurons that are most accustomed to communicating with each transmit the strongest signals which consistently emerge as our subsequent perceptions of the world around us. This \"chunking\" or concatenation of neurons comprise more complex physical representations of memories.   Additionally, our preconceived notions could consistently determine the data we choose to observe from our external environment creating a feedback loop. We tend to observe what we're most familiar with and what we're most familiar with is what we're most likely to aim to observe.   ",

            "answer_text": "Human beings are not at the center of the consciousness universe.Consciousness is not a miraculous event. It is incremental evolution.It is no different than awareness, and necessarily involves awareness of self.Features of human awareness differ in extent from other organisms, possibly also in technology, but not in character.Intelligence is an operational quality that has nothing much to do with this topic.Please watch this video of Richard Dawkins demonstrating the evolution of eyesight, and remember that you are discussing exactly the same type of biological phenomenon. Too many whacky theories out there are inventing \"minimum neuron count\" hypotheses to prop up anthropocentric unbiological nonsense.  The biological purpose of consciousness is awareness and autonomy of control, so that an organism can predate instead of having food come to it. The evolutionary changes that develop richer qualities of awareness are not sudden or miraculous. They do however coevolve with other features of the organism. Dawkins does not go into the utility of vision, except to say that it allows an organism to avoid a predator more effectively. The avoidance strategies against predation also involve forming large groups, rapid reproduction cycles, multiple offspring, camouflage, burrowing, armour, chemicals, rapid reflexes, size strength, shape, and so on. Environmental alertness is required, and autonomous control which must by definition incorporate a primitive sense of self. Within any hierarchical control system there are necessary degrees of freedom that must be integrated, or the organism would be essentially ungoverned and random. But in an arms race the predators also benefit, and the ability to feed more effectively also drives changes. This growing self awareness and autonomy also climbs mount improbable, but not independently. It is strongly coupled to the biological needs of the organism. A runaway demand in processing power creates unsustainable energy demands on the organism. Humans for example are characterised as apex energy consumers. Vision in particular then opens the floodgates of change, more sophisticated swimming technologies, jaws, wider ranging organisms, changes to the speed of nerves, better oxygen uptake, and so on, and in humans, sophisticated language communication. Squid for example developed multiple hearts, and bigger nerves, whereas vertebrates were limited by bony skulls and vertebrae so had to develop myelination technology. Visual processing leads to all the necessary physical elements in the brain responsible for the incremental emergence of language in humans, but it also takes social development and high energy food strategies to sustain a large brain. I could detail the steps just as Hawkins does for the eye. Take bats and cetaceans, these intelligent creatures have sonar systems, not as primary organs of evolution, but as adaptations. Vision drove their capacity to become mobile, and mobility demands heightened differentiation in the environment, and heightened autonomy to manage increased degrees of freedom, ie choice for self. Brain power simply develops incrementally in such a way as to support biological innovations. There is no sudden switching on of the light. If an organism were not aware of its environment and itself in that environment, it would be a plant. ",

Just as with cellular automata,  Individual minds are shaped 1) by evolution which has resulted in various areas of the brain taking on specialized roles and 2) by culture which gives rise to personality traits and role models the mind seeks to emulate. With 100 billion neurons, the brain is the host for a large number of computing processes which run in parallel.  There are many examples of systems consisting of collections of fairly simple elements, all of which follow the same rules; which, when working in parallel, produce striking results. John Bailey's answer to What does it mean to say X is an emergent property of Y? Global workspace The architecture comprises a set of parallel specialist processes and a global workspace (Fig. 1). The parallel specialists compete (and sometimes co-operate) in a bid to win access to the global workspace. When one or more of them is successful in this bid, it gets to deposit a message in the global workspace, which is then broadcast back to the whole cohort of parallel specialists. So the overall pattern of information flow is one of alternation between broadcast and competition, resulting in a serial procession of workspace contents, the outcome of selecting among and integrating the results of many parallel computations.

            "answer_text": "Human consciousness initially works from awareness of our self. This happens around 3 years old. The confusion also begins as our parents and friends begin to condition us. One of the big problems that many people are currently facing is the sexual conditioning that they received at young ages from pedophiles and dysfunctional parents. The government systems have known about pedophilia and have hidden it from the public. The police and courts also hide it. The power of sexual energy within our consciousness becomes very strong when we have secrets about what happened to us. We take the blame rather than giving it to the perpetrators and the institutions know this will happen. As we develop in consciousness, we also try and work out the imbalance of our feelings that come up now and again when memories of what happened to us are triggered. Consciousness is the only form of travel that does not need matter. We have the ability to expand our awareness into the solar system and still retain our identity. Consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe. There is rock consciousness and places like \u201cUluru\u201d have it. Indigenous people are aware of it. Consciousness is the carrier of intelligent energy. 2020 is a good year to become aware of your own unique consciousness. From this perspective you will become aware of how your own consciousness works with different experiences. You may react with fear or respond with bravery. You may be selfish and care only about yourself or you may want to be of service to others. There are many different attributes which are all valid. Only you can choose the path of consciousness development that you want to follow. ",

            "answer_text": "Brain activity, though it's complex and mysterious. Similarly, the best explanation for weather is the activity of the air. It's not controversial to say that weather is some combination of air, water, sunlight and terrain, though the number  of interactions defeats us. We feel zero temptation to propose additional, invisible and massless parts. Large numbers of people have been conditioned since childhood to perceive the world (call it material, natural, physical, etc.) as dirty, low, sinful, emotionless, or soulless. Indeed, the first word gives it away: we are made of dirt, and that makes us 'dirty' or foul. To them all that is good and interesting needs to be 'not of the world' for a reason never justified. Instead, these victims turn upon us and insist that we have to explain how dirt could not be low, emotionless, soulless, etc. The brainwashing has given them the wrong default position.  Similarly, many creationists have been conditioned to define 'nothing' as 'that which needs a god so as to be something', or 'non-life' as 'that which needs a god so as to be alive', and then they argue stupidly with physicists and biologists who actually have serious definitions of 'nothing' and 'not alive'.  People conditioned in this way find it almost impossible to realize that dirt doesn't have all the negativity they've been told about, that they've riddled it with assumptions. They've defined it as 'lacking consciousness', as 'mere matter', as 'that which needs magic so as to be conscious', and so they start at their conclusion.  Consciousness has inadequate scientific explanation, as does cancer or weather or the economy, but those inadequate explanations are not grounds for magic because those systems are assumed to be 'materialist' systems that are just really complicated. In the case of consciousness their argumentation is circular, and they single out consciousness from all the other unsolved problems because they already believe that it is not material.  But you can't compare one unavailable answer against another unavailable answer. It would require paradoxical knowledge to know that system is 'hard' or 'beyond science'. If I was clairvoyant, and knew all that science would know in the future, I would still not know the answers to 'hard' problems. I could still not tell the difference between problems with no answers and problems with answers that could be resolved by superhuman science; the invisible and the non-existent would never be separate. The person claiming to know that a problem is 'hard' needs to know more than can be known by definition. You can't know that you can't ever know ... even if you're right, you're wrong! ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest answer is that nobody is quite sure how consciousness works, but that there\u2019s quite a bit of inferential evidence indicating how it is that people (and other animals) are conscious. We cannot be epistemologically certain how consciousness works because of the Hard Problem of Consciousness. This basically states that understanding the physical workings of a thinking system cannot, in principle, tell you why it is conscious because you cannot bridge the gap between the physical processes of a brain and the subjective experience of that brain\u2019s owner. Indeed, the very notion that a brain has an owner illustrates the conundrum. That said, scientists and philosophers have sussed out quite a bit about how consciousness works. To understand how consciousness works, we first have to have a definition of what consciousness is. As suggested by Thomas Nagel in his seminal paper, What is it Like to Be a Bat?, a conscious entity is one that experiences subjective states - one that it is \u201clike something\u201d to be. That is, it\u2019s like something to be conscious and like nothing to lack consciousness. Thus, it\u2019s like something to be a whale or a gibbon, as these are conscious creatures, but not like anything to be a bowl of petunias or a rock, since these are incapable of intelligible experience. While consciousness generally involves an awareness of the surrounding world, this need not be the case - in altered states of consciousness, such as an immersive psychedelic experience or a vivid dream, one\u2019s subjective experiences might have little to do with happenings in the world. In summary, consciousness is the presence of a subject, any subject, to experience things. By all accounts, consciousness appears to be generated by our brains. While many people claim to have had out-of-body and other unexplainable experiences that would give us cause to question (for instance, neurosurgeon Eben Alexander, who wrote a book on his near-death experience), these experiences are not generally convincing because there are no confirmed examples of conscious experience in the absence of concomitant brain activity (see Michael Shermer\u2019s rebuttal to Alexander). The brain is crucial - the destruction of brain tissue can lead to impairments in consciousness or even a persistent vegetative state that cannot be overcome. The most important brain area for the generation of consciousness is the cerebral cortex, the wrinkly envelope of brain tissue that covers the outside of your brain. There\u2019s no singular area in the cortex responsible for consciousness. Indeed, it is the action and interaction of many cortical areas that\u2019s thought to be responsible. This is why epileptic patients often lose consciousness during seizures, even though their brains are exceptionally active, and why you go to sleep at night. The cerebral cortex requires tonic (steady) activation to maintain consciousness. This is provided by a deep brain structure called the reticular formation. The reticular formation projects throughout the brain, including to the cortex, where it provides excitatory input in the form of the neurotransmitters, glutamate, acetylcholine, and histamine. This is why antihistamines that cross the blood-brain barrier make you sleepy, and why the destruction of these activating centers generally leads to an irreversible coma state. Another important brain area for the generation of consciousness is the claustrum, a small tissue layer beneath parts of the cortex. Research by various groups has implicated the claustrum in coordinating communications to and within the cortex. Researchers lead by Mohamad Koubeissi at George Washington University found that disrupting this communication via electrical stimulation would reversibly impair consciousness. This is despite the fact that the claustrum itself doesn\u2019t appear to have a crucial role for sensory, memory, or motor processing. The importance of tonic activity (via the reticular formation) and synchronicity (via the claustrum) provides valuable clues about how consciousness may come about. One explanation of recent interest is the self-organizing principles of neural networks and a phenomenon called self-organized criticality. According to this theory, brain centers rest in a default \u201cnoisy\u201d state that is somewhat disorganized. This is a sort of stand-by state for initiating decisions, actions, etc. The nature of these brain centers is such that when they receive enough activating input, they will change phases and lock into a different, more syncronized firing pattern. Any given brain network can have many different firing patterns and modes of synchronization. The disruption of these organizing processes explains why seizures and claustrum insterference can cause a loss of consciousness, and our sense of consciousness may itself arise out of the interacting synchronization and desynchronization of thousands of sub-networks within the brain. My suspicion is that our sense of subjective experience represents the resolution of indeterminate \u201cnoisy\u201d states of brain activity into discrete, patterned states as we experience things - that is, our sense of experience relies upon active transition of complex brain states in and out of different modes of activity. But this is still very much a theoretical science and, as I admitted at the beginning of this post, nobody really knows. At least not yet. ",

            "answer_text": "As non-human consciousness. It observes. It watches operate its own conceptual pyramid. It is both integrated to it and has a relative independence. That is, if a stroke removes a part of brain function, without touching the Integrator network of consciousness, this function disappears from the contents of consciousness, without changing the conscious sensation itself. The disappearance of a function is even more invisible that it is itself the result of a high integration. Easier to get into account the paralysis of a finger than the mental representation of a whole arm. Easier to be aware of a hole in his visual field than the loss of identifying faces. This phenomenon is easily explained by the theory of the \u00abStratium\u00bb, self-organized mental pyramid. It's stacking of successive integration levels, each bringing together neurons dealing with the same information complexity. The micro-concepts, represented by specific configurations of these neurons, become somewhat more elaborate concepts, level after level. The stability of the whole is ensured by a relative independence of each level, relative because they are subject to a retro-control of the overlying levels. Consciousness is the top of this pyramid. It joined together the most sophisticated integrations of various mental functions. It is literally constituted by this fusion. That is, if a part is missing, there is no additional analysis center to account. Need to learn the underlying centers the existence of lack, and start again the coordination of all. The conscious retro-control, at the top of the scale, is indeed the most decision-maker and may, through attention, improve the efficiency of the processes underlying it. However the relative independence of the subconscious floors, necessary to the stability of the psyche, make them also reluctant to rapid changes. More intermediate organizational levels ? More the retro-control conscious action is difficult. Thus it is easier to improve his forehand in tennis than to erase the consequences of an Oedipal conflict. Integration of the locomotor apparatus is less stratified than the conceptual universe forming personality. By observing its own conscious operation, everyone can perceive the difference between this superior integration and the underlying processes. That's what Daniel Kahneman described with two-speed of thought: firstly the intuitive thinking, heuristic, which offers to the consciousness faster decisions, ready-made; second, thoughtful thinking, laborious, sequential, charged to create or improve a decision for which no intuition is suggested or has demonstrated its relevance. Intuition is the intelligence \"librarian\" of the mind, easy of use, stored in the subconscious pyramid. Thoughtful thinking is the manufacture on demand, more expensive in time and mental resources, of a \"custom\" thought for the unusual situation; it is the role of conscious attention. In the book \u00abDiversium[1]\u00bb, where the concept of stratification is extended to our social organization, I explain that consciences do not derogate from the principle: they also have a relative independence, so that I have a lot of difficulty to circulate this design ;-)) Footnotes[1] Diversium, Theory of Ever and Everything",

            "answer_text": "The questions asks how consciousness works. Many people do not know how to answer that question, and oddly, a lot of those people hasten to click on the 'WriteAnswer' button to describe in detail how they are unable to think of an answer. Personally, I use the 'Pass' button when I don't have an answer, but clearly those are the people that do not want the question to be answered. Chalmers is devoting his career trying to discourage people from answering this question. I suggest we keep our wits about us and take the available facts on board ignoring the incessant hype from the mystery mongers. Remember that the secret of life was a seemingly impenetrable mystery at one time. It was not clear how to define life, but biologists just kept plugging away until the crucial mechanisms were uncovered (DNA being the most salient example). Now we know how life works even though it can sometimes still be difficult to define. So, keeping our wits about us, the answer is rather obvious : consciousness works by integrating the knowledge produced by subconscious brain processes. Remember, Chalmers has declared that the subconscious generation of knowledge is \"easy\". Indeed, for billions of years natural selection has been producing a diversity of subconscious ways to identify and assign properties to objects, to track objects, to classify objects and to use that knowledge to direct intelligent behaviors in the absence of awareness. [math]c = m \\cdot e^{2}[/math]The above formula describes how consciousness [math]c[/math] works by projecting properties onto objects in the external world. You can't find sweetness out in the world by examining the molecules of honey. Sweetness is in the mind. Babies are not intrinsically cute, the cuteness is generated by a human brain and projected out onto the baby. Daniel Dennett has described this mechanism in detail. 1) You hear giggling in the adjacent room2) walking into the adjacent room, you expect to see a baby3) all of the sensory input matches your expectations 4) the absence of a disconfirmation signal confirms the expectations5) simultaneoulsy with 2) you expect to feel the urge to cuddle the baby6) the confirmation of this second order expectation [math]e^{2}[/math] projects the property of cuteness onto the baby Note1: A feeling is itself a non-disconfirmed-expectation and since you have expectations about what you yourself will feel in various situations we have second order expectations [math]e^{2}[/math] (and even third and fourth order and so on [math]e^{n}[/math]). [math]c = m \\cdot e^{2}[/math]Note2: The [math]m[/math] symbol stands for the unconscious model [math]m[/math] of the external world (or mind as described in Antonio Damasios latest book, as a collection of unconscious \"images\": smells, sounds or seen objects) So, sensory input generates an internal model [math]m[/math] of the external world which in turn generates n-order expectations [math]e^{2}[/math] about the future, the confirmation of which generates conscious experience [math]c[/math]. So, there you have the mechanism that Chalmers and many others have been lamenting will be so unimaginably difficult to find. I doubt that my hasty explanation here has been sufficiently clear, but Dennet's full explanation is quite easy to understand. ",

Interdisciplinarity:  We have to intergrate all facts (from all perspectives)e.g. Our brain is made up of about 75 percentwater. This means something: if you know about resonance, crystal radios or transistors and the geometry of water molecules (liquid cristals)... but most biologist untill now did not know.And most physistist did not know about Mikrotubulus... but the biologist did know : but the biologist did not know what a very good physicist would know (if he saw a microtubulus):  very high example for holo-fractal architecture !(... most biologist and physisist do not know about samadhi... )Our work now is about cohering (simplifying, unifying) the languages from those different \"perspectives\":the words: symmetry, vacuum, fractality are already unifying \"different\" sciences (physics and biology) into one (cohering the languages) Symmetry is part of the language of nature.From the molecular level on up: Many animals and plants exploit symmetrical shapes as a way of standing out against the chaos of their landscape. This brain (matter) is perhaps the very best example for holo-fractal architecture of nature.

We have self awareness that tells us we have consciousness. \u2018I think, therefore, I am\u2019 is a famous reflection of this but what can science tell us about consciousness. Science can tell us that consciousness appears to arise from brain activity; neural messaging, synapse sparking etc, coordinated to allow humans to understand their circumstances, their moment in time. But is their a simpler explanation? I believe there is and it comes from recognising what Heideggar said nearly a hundred years ago, that all of life was contingent on the three aspects of time, the past, present and future. By understanding that by \u2018aspects\u2019, Heideggar meant dimensions we can make sense of what it means to be conscious. If we imagine that the brain functions in the three dimensions of time we can identify them as follows: \u2018real\u2019 time working of the brain is the continuous monitoring of the senses in the present to give understanding. \u2018Unreal\u2019 time working equates to the past and is responsible for a persons accumulated data held as memory giving knowledge. \u2018Imaginary\u2019 time working of the brain, responsible for dreaming, collates information from the other two functions, uniting knowledge with understanding to arrive at wisdom, the decision making and planning stage. \u2018Imaginary\u2019 time working of the brain also gives us the ineffable traits, such as love, appreciation of the arts, discernment of the abstract etc. The action of all three aspects of time gives us consciousness. Take for example a man suddenly faced with a lion. Firstly his \u2018real\u2019 time working, monitoring his sense of sight, sees the lion. The \u2018unreal\u2019 working identifies the lion as a dangerous predator. The \u2018imaginary\u2019 time component assesses the information and provides a solution, fight or flight, all three aspects working in parallel for speed. Why hasn\u2019t science identified these workings amongst the neurons and synapses you may ask? Could it be because \u2018unreal\u2019 and \u2018imaginary\u2019 time workings are in negative or imaginary dimensions, undetected by devices constructed by man. For more detail I refer interested readers to my book, Spiritual Man: An Introduction to Negative Dimensions, Kevill Davies - Amazon.com or my series of short videos on you tube: The DAVIES Hypothesis - YouTube ",

            "answer_text": "Friends, Human consciousness works by it's own presence only.What works is human psychosomatic body and not consciousness,but it works only in presence of consciousness.Quality of work depends upon level of consciousness. Let's share: A.During physiological sleep,there is presence of low level of consciousness which results into vague & non-coordinated muscles movements without purpose.Sparing dreams,no psychological movements I.e.thinking,emotions are observed.Low level of consciousness doesn't allow you to be aware to yourself & surroundings. B.During day waking,in presence of average/routinary level of consciousness,our skeleto-muscular system works well coordinated with purpose.Psychological functions like logic,reasoning,emotions etc do work well.This average level of consciousness makes you be able to aware to your physical body but not to your psychic body I.e.your thoughts,emotions etc.Thus,this is called psychological sleep. C.If level of consciousness is raised to higher level of consciousness,newer nervous system functions get appeared like telepathy,clairvoyance etc,which were not able to perform,you become totally aware to your physical & psychic body. Thanks. Q guru ",

These six are classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, intellect (mental)-consciousness. This is called consciousness.\u201d - Gotama the Buddha The Buddha taught: the \u2018mind\u2019 is one of six sensory modalities - the sixth sense. When thoughts \u2018arise\u2019 in the mind they are registered - consciously. Thinking arises in relation to mental-consciousness. Thinking is not the same as: seeing, tasting, touching, smelling and, hearing.* \u201cIn this context, for instance, when an ear's receptive field (the proximal stimulus, more commonly known by Buddhists as a sense base, or sense organ) and sound (the distal stimulus, or sense object) are present, the associated (ear-related) consciousness arises. The arising of these three elements (dh\u0101tu) \u2013 e.g. ear, sound and ear-consciousness \u2013 lead to the percept, known as \"contact\" and in turn causes a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral \"feeling\" to arise. It is from such feeling that \"craving\" arises.\u201d - Wikipedia There is the delusion of a single-indivisible consciousness as a consequence of self-view - personality-belief.** There's ignorance of the way things are in truth. This begins to change when there's a seeing/feeling through self-delusion, self-view. Without jhanic-experience*** and, liberating insight, it's difficult to see beyond \u2018self-view\u2019 (sakkaya ditthi).  *The Analysis of the Six Sense Fields **Sakkaya-ditthi - Dhamma Wiki ***   Is it possible to achieve inner peace but not be constantly happy?

            "answer_text": "Wow you have 30 answers why add one more? Because I'd to reflect on what makes consciousness so uniquely difficult for science.  You see science is based on uniformity, we assume things behave under the same laws, say, here and there. Local environments might differ but, underlying it all, things behave essentially the same everywhere all the time. Example:  We can't measure electrons, calcium, Gravity, or photons, billions of light years away, but we can assume they are identical to those we measure in our labs. Then with this assumption we extrapolate and we get good predictions. This is the whole basis of both science and statistics, grab some samples (data) and what you conclude is safely extrapolated to the rest. Consciousness is the complete inverse of this. I know I am me, I know I am not any of the other \"you\"s out there in the Quora-sphere. Sadly I cannot devise an experiment to prove to you that I am conscious. I do not hypothesis that I am conscious. It is not a creed or a law. I know it at a far far deeper level than anything I know about science. Yet I am trapped. I can't \"pull out my sense of self\" and submit it to lab analysis. Why? Consciousness is nontransferable. In this sense it is mysteriously similar to quantum information which cannot be cloned. But we have no evidence for, and alot against, any role for quantum in resolving this riddle.  It may be that the nature of consciousness makes it intrinsically ineligible to be grasped using the confines of science. Time will tell. ",

            "answer_text": "As anyone can see, this question begs other metaphysical questions to even begin stuttering the foreword of a book... Even our \"common\" materialist scientific viewpoint is quite at a loss to think about thinking the question, and I just won't trust us cavemen of the XXIst century.  My usual stance is most concerned about handling consciousness for myself or my fellow humans. I need/want to run the machine, knowing I can't understand it better than my computer or my body.  But it seems I cannot navigate any \"soteriological\" i.e.liberation issues without a few guiding insights. And I guess it's high time to explicit my own assumptions about consciousness, and revise their implicit basis...  I won't do this here so I'll just give a few starters on the subject.  - So what do I think I know about my mind, so that I may use this knowledge to free myself from unwanted constraints? This is already consciousness questioning consciousness.  So the first thing I think I know is that awareness is a process of constant mirroring, or echoing. (Reflexivity is the usual word.)  I can intend to sustain this mirroring process on any \"feeling\" and that will loop my reactivities in a retroaction effect. I can intend this because awareness isn't linear, as many parallel events are doing their bidding on my awareness, which has some \"degree of freedom\". To get to the purpose of consciousness I'd refer directly to pleasure: the pleasure this organism gets from any sensation serves the purpose of maintaining and bettering my whole cohesion. And therefore it is also the purpose of awareness.  Also I'm questioning sentiency directly, leaving out the verbal realm,  by supposing the verbal realm is but a subset, or an epiphenomenon, of the very non-verbal basis of awareness: words are another kind of weaker or delayed retroaction. Qualities in my sentiency are akin to musical vibrations, interacting with all my other vibrations, by the millions, and my attention is its main coordinator, focusing on the highest cohesive qualities, it's priorities.  I'll rephrase myself and add that higher energy, in an organism, serves negentropy and entelechy, so the function of awareness is to strengthen this energy by retroactivating it, while pleasure is but the direct perception of a cohesive vibration - as per the feedbacks of the holon - that attracts awareness.  Perhaps all our coordinating faculties are not distinct devices but directly the meta responses to all this input. But in the case of awareness three factors make it an even more autonomous device, somehow isolating it from our holistic being:  It relates with the outer worldIt's relates with other members of a society. It also relates with words. And can say \"I\"...It's Minister of Foreign Affairs! I'll leave it at that. I'm trying to do a non-verbal semiotic; and most probably others have thought about that... It's all about connotations, resonances, etc.  Follow your bliss. ",

            "answer_text": "Very good question. I am not sure I can answer this in just a few paragraphs. What does it mean to be \"conscious\", first of all. I think we can agree that \"self-awareness\" is in that mix somewhere. Our brains construct the \"reality\" we take for granted during our waking \"conscious\" moments. Including consciousness itself.  Just like the color blue, the sound of a symphony orchestra, the smell of a pig, the pinch of your significant other, the resultant qualia are all constructs of your brain. So is the \"sense\" of consciousness. It's a useful framework to lead you to deal with your environment in such a way to maximize your chances for survival in a complex landscape, and to lead you to not only reproducing yourself, but ensuring your spawn also maximize their chances for survival and reproduction. That's it in a nutshell. The devil, as they say, are in the details. I do not see \"consciousness\" as big a mystery and many do. \"consciousness\" is what the brain does, and the nature of it is the result of emergence. I have a notion I call \"mirage concepts\". That is, concepts that seem to have substance until you get close enough to them to analyze them. Then it all disappears. I assert that consciousness itself falls strongly into that category. ",

            "answer_text": "How does one define self awareness? Could we be merely extensions of the source of consciousness from which we all originate? Are we merely separated from each other by our ego's as eastern philosophy would have us believe? Consciousness may always be intangible. It may never be fully explained and understood but it seems to be the most prominent feature of the universe from which all matter is manifested. The illusion is that science believes matter precedes consciousness but it seem strange to me that something can make itself from nothing and in the process create life. Would it not make more sense to say consciousness came first and created all material things? OR would we rather follow the illogical concept and believe it was the other way around? Once you can see that time never began, your whole way of thinking changes and herein lies the single big problem. Science can't figure out how there could be no beginning, but it will come eventually. Ask yourself this simple question, if there was a beginning, why did it not happen earlier, or earlier than that and so on and so on? ",

            "answer_text": "For humans consciousness is a complex sensation of perception, emotion, and memory overlapping in the same instant. The human brain processes sensation on multiple layers, and consciousness is a tapestry of all of these layers experienced at the same moment. At any one moment humans are experiencing color, sound, shapes, textures, depth, smell, and emotional cues related to mental health, social status, personal memory, and cultural identity. These various facets of consciousness are wired together through neural networking and synaptic memory and fed into the executive functions of the forebrain. But this model is only valid when you are awake. When you are sleeping consciousness is even more fragmented into deep memory consolidation and perception is limited to very brief snapshots where visual memory is stimulated. ",

            "answer_text": "I will put forth a radical theory: that consciousness arose because of, albeit primitive, purely natural, free will. This theory explains neatly the cognitive requirement for consciousness. Essentially, during the simian period monkeys felt \u2018put on the spot\u2019 to solve problems. The more conscious they were, the more they were able to react to the \u2018long-pause\u2019 moments, and the more they were able to solve problems. As tool-building (read reaction-time) developed, the utility of the will (read brainpower) evolved to reflect the new technical skills involved in tool-building (read social skills), as well as perhaps leadership functions, expert roles, and sex appeal (read additional brain functions). Every time the creature was put on the spot, new skills developed, and consciousness increased to reflect the brain functions associated with those skills and activities, such as tool-building. Reflect on how cats effortlessly catch mice. Humans are similar about their most functional characteristics. Humans can now \u2018predict\u2019 that there is someone to make the orange juice, and as they lift their glass, they begin to relax. The next step depends on the persons\u2019s set of talents. Maybe they will write a poem to stretch their mind, or maybe they will work on a math problem or have a meeting with someone, or play a computer game, or walk down the street thinking about something. Humans have learned to delegate responsibility because it was so much easier to think about, and it permits them to put themselves on the spot \u2014- have consciousness \u2014- without fear and danger, which is what they originally wanted.

            "answer_text": "Giancarlo Frigato, Degree in Biology, University of Ferrara (1984) Giancarlo Frigato, Degree in Biology, University of Ferrara (1984) In recent studies, through functional magnetic resonance, Dehaene, Tononi and other neuroscientists have identified the brain areas that are active only during conscious perception but not in simple unconscious perception. Other studies on \"hemineglect\" highlight the areas of the brain whose injury causes the loss of Consciousness but does not prevent the unconscious perception. These researches have as a result that specific areas of the Cerebral Cortex are the neural correlates of Consciousness. Instead, for example, the removal of the cerebellum damaged by trauma does not prevent the explication of Consciousness. The injury of the brain stem causes the loss of Consciousness but also prevents unconscious perception. Consciousness ensures that within the vast unconscious perception, information selected in a utilitarian way is quickly memorized. Such information, once present in the Memory, may be producing mental images that alone or together with conscious images from the external environment are used to reason (and to communicate with other subjects in the case of Man or the apes). Oakley and Halligan (2017) based on studies about hypnosis (eg, Schlegel et al., 2015, Lush et al., 2017), the divided brain (Gazzaniga, 1988), decision making (Libet et al., 1983 ) and neglect (eg, Driver and Mattingley, 1998; Frigato, 2014), have come to the conclusion that brain operations responsible for all our mental activities take place at the unconscious level. Activities that include perceptions, actions and emotions, but also reasoning, self-control and sense of self. Oakley and Halligan do not use the generic concept of \"Consciousness\", but they operate the very useful distinction between Personal Narrative (contents of Consciousness) and Personal Awareness (experience of Consciousness) emphasizing how the latter constantly accompany the first in parallel, without minimally influencing the mechanisms responsible for our mental abilities. On the other hand, the Personal Narrative \"serves the powerful evolutionary function of enabling individuals to communicate (external broadcast) the contents of internal broadcasting\" and its contents are deposited in the higher level Memoirs: Semantic, Episodic and Autobiographical. Reading this article helped me a lot in revisiting the theoretical work I have undertaken to try to identify the neural correlates of consciousness (Frigato, 2014). Something I haven't done in my analysis was making the distinction between Personal Narrative and Personal Awareness. Another distinction that can be made is that between simple automatic unconscious mechanisms and complex unconscious mechanisms (e.g., Gazzaniga, 1988; Moscovictch and Umilt\u00e0, 1991; Frigato, 2014). The first are not accompanied by the Personal Narrative and therefore not even by Personal Awareness, the latter instead yes. An example of automatic mechanism is to drive along a road well known to us, perhaps even overtaking, stopping at traffic lights, etc., and realizing only after a certain time, to have passed through it without remembering that we did it. There are therefore unconscious automatic behaviors which we cannot refer about and that we cannot memorize in the 3 higher level Memoirs. Instead the most important and complex unconscious experiences, being able to give rise to the Personal Narrative, can be deposited in the 3 Memoirs which are the source of mental images. In my opinion (Frigato, 2014) the images of the external environment and the mental images present in the Personal Narrative are used not only to exchange information with our neighbors (Oakley and Halligan, 2017), but also to be able to learn in a manner complex through reasoning. Therefore the Personal Narrative not only provides the great evolutionary advantage of being able to communicate with others, but also gives reasoning ability. It can therefore be assumed that up to fish and amphibians there are only automatic learning and memory mechanisms and, starting from the reptiles, a minimum capacity of reasoning appeared, which evolved in birds and mammals to reach the highest levels of efficiency in man (Bitermann and Mackintosh, 1969; Denton,2006). Through a review of the literature related to neglect, I hypothesized (Frigato, 2014) that the mechanism that produces the Personal Narrative is made of 8 + 8 large areas specularly present in the two cerebral hemispheres. They all work simultaneously in parallel as \"points of convergence\" between the 3 higher level Memories and other 8 + 8 brain areas specialized in perception and movement. The latter are responsible respectively for the recognition of a specific object, its position in space, the emotions it produces, the position of the body with respect to the object itself, the state of the body at the moment of perception and the 3 motor potentials related to that object. In the specific case of visual Personal Narrative (Frigato, 2014), the medial-superior temporal lobe work as a \u201cpoint of convergence\u201d and keep simultaneously active both the occipital and inferior temporal cortices responsible for visual perception and the precuneus-posterior cingulate, the seat of 3 Superior Memories. So, to obtain the Personal Narrative of external perception, in addition to the image that comes from the environment, the mirror memory corresponding to that image should be simultaneously activated and superimposed. Conversely when the Personal Narrative is arrived at through visual mental images that come from memory, the superior-medial temporal lobe simultaneously maintains active the neurons in the sensorial cortices (occipital and inferior temporal), which have been the source of external visual perception in the corresponding previous experiences. There would therefore be a continuous feedback and alternation between activation of the neurons responsible for perception and those responsible for memory. With mental images there would obviously be a predominance of precuneus memory, while during external perception the prevailing activities would be in the sensory cortices (Ganis et al., 2004; Mechelli et al., 2004). As already highlighted, Oakley and Halligan operate the very useful distinction between Personal Narrative and Personal Awareness. They say that after trying to explain the Personal Narrative, the \"New Hard Problem\" still remains to solve the identification of the neural mechanisms of Personal Awareness: \"How and why do neurophysiological activities produce the \"experience of consciousness\"?\"; (Chalmers, 1996). My theoretical work (Frigato, 2014) tries to explain the feeling of Personal Awareness with the fact that, in the production of Personal Narrative, are involved the 8 + 8 \"points of convergence\", the 3 Memories, and 8 + 8 sensory and motor areas. All these areas acting simultaneously and in parallel could create a wide \"psychophysical activation\" such as to produce Personal Awareness. For example, the images coming from the external environment or the mental images of a red sunset, of a green landscape, of human faces and so on, would create practically infinite different combinations of psychophysical sensations. Such as to explain how Personal Awareness varies at any moment and is absolutely private and personal. The presence of these almost infinite combinations would also explain why the problem of Personal Awareness appears as a \"Hard Problem\": the human brain usually reasons on at most 3-4 spatio-temporal dimensions and therefore finds hard to explain rationally such large and complicated combinations.

One is the \"easy\" question of how the brain produces behaviour and processes information. The other is the \"hard\" question of why we experience emotion along with this processing. Some argue that the second question doesn't really need answering at all and isn't puzzling; others (like me) argue that it is an important question. Of those who think it's important and valid, many think the answer has something to do with the complexity of the brain. Others think it may point to some fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of physical matter. There is widespread disagreement on even basic questions in this field, like whether a digital computer could experience emotion, whether ants or unborn humans experience emotion, and whether or not emotion can only be generated by the type of stuff the brain is made of, or could be generated by any suitable system. The trend in scientific opinion has generally shifted towards regarding consciousness as an emergent property of matter, but there is currently no real proof for any of many rival hypotheses. ",

The common form of consciousness that is referred to in the \u201cHard Problem\u201d or posited as an emergent property of the brain, complexity, or neural networks is kind of a cooperative aggregate that functions as a discrete entity in a quasi-physical reality (could be any entity from quark to universe) or non-physical reality such as dream states, mental projections or qualia. The phenomenon known as gravity is a function of the gregariousness of consciousness manifesting as mass. The larger the concentration of consciousness in a given location the more attractive it becomes to other concentrations of consciousness. In either energetic or massive terms. Of course there less gregarious forms of consciousness (families if you will) which resist the \u201cpull\u201d of the majority or those consciousnesses who express express themselves by rebelling and repulsing the aggregated whole or individuals who choose to bend the rules manifesting in and out of physical existence. Consciousness (especially here at Quora) is an ambiguous term and its nature is slippery \u2014 If one considers panpsychism (as do I) to be the best descriptor for the current state of explanation anent consciousness then the Everettian formulation is viable and the Hard Problem is obviated and we are all solipsists in superposition.

That means our fives senses have become alert. That means we can say that consciousness works through our senses. Now scientists have been trying to find the exact mechanism as to how does the neural network works that gives the exact mechanism of consciousness. We can find many definitions of consciousness on the internet but those just define the word and are nowhere close to explain the mechanism of the process. I could not fathom the depth of the answer your question demands but it intrigued me and provoked me to try and read about the actual mechanism of consciousness. :) Thanks for the A2A. ",

These MRI studies strongly suggest, that the subconscious creates every thought, idea, decision, and everything ever imagined. The important stuff is then passed up to conscious awareness. There is no evidence to suggest, that conscious thoughts have any influence on the thought creation process. There is no conscious mind, and no free will. Both are illusions. Every thought and action is derived from a combination of genes and environment (knowledge and experience). Conscious thoughts evolved from improved verbal communication. ",

As far as using our ridiculously incomplete scientific understanding of our Universe to explain the \"Hard\" Question of consciousness, we've got nothing, IMO. Nevertheless, based on past experience, it seems likely that future advances will enable progress on this question.  Think of our pathetic ignorance about the Hard Question as Employment Relief for Neuroscientists, Physicists and Philosophers.

My comprehension is that we each have a soul which is perfect but it cant know itself unless it can experience itself so it creates a vehicle, the person or personality to work through.But the personality is not fitted for the soul straight away. It is selfish, manipulative, greedy and thinks that it is the centre of the universe and so it goes on lifetime after lifetime living life to excess, making mistakes, gathering wisdom and finally coming to understand that there may be something more to life.This is when some form of meditation in an attempt to contact the inner Self or soul is tried. All this is a growth in awareness and consciousness. Wisdom is experience under scrutiny.The process goes on until you have complete Mastery of yourself and can learn nothing more on Earth. By this time you demonstrate you are divine, you demonstrate Oneness with all life, with everything and upon leaving Earth you continue your evolution.The Masters of Wisdom are humanity\u2019s demonstration of what is possible with discipline and consistent effort rightly applied.

So based on number one it seems every living thing is \"conscious\".... every single cell in any situation is aware of its surroundings.  So we could call this \"basic consciousness\", because this means even human cells are conscious?  Or not... just reading the dictionary :-)2.) Intersting wording.  \"The awareness of perception of something by a person\"...so here only humans can be conscious.  Further, they are aware of their own perceptions, so I would presume this means \"self aware\".3.) this seems to support 2, awareness not only of the world (\"ones surroundings, like 1) but also of the self... self aware? Luckily I just finished editing a book on this very topic (evolution).  Chapter 9 (anticipation & projected intentions), page 99: \"internal simulations and development of consciousness\"- paraphrase: \"Differing organisms have perceptive abilities of varying scope. All of life perceives information patterns from the environment, meaning that it recognizes them... or can \"hold them in mind\" and evaluate them based on what it already has internally.  The whole point of information and memory (knowledge) is to use it to project future outcomes. As life becomes more complex, it accumulates enough \"knowledge\" and contextual flexibility to permit holding more and longer patterns of information as knowledge in the mind.  It can then create more elaborate projections of future environments & events. Compared to an organisms that may have to actually physically act out every scenario to experience it and learn about it, the ability to project, and even experience, through mental simulation (see ch 9), avoiding any physical risk, would obviously be advantatgeous in evolution and a selectable trait. \"\"Simulated versions of the environment is a response the the demand for much more sophisticated interaction with living things, which are far more complex than non-living things, therefore increasing the demand for information related specialization. As more and more complex interactions are encountered, great processing power is needed. p.100: As a general framework for intelligence, any number of informational patterns or timelines may be held in mind in relation to one another, including etiology (sound, vibration, vision, etc.), relevance (to the current perceptive context), current intention at that moment, and so on.  As more and more\" knowledge\" (information patterns) is accumulated, more elaborate understanding of the environment accumulates and by definition (information = temporal patterns) predictions about the future develop more fully and accurately  {my note: the value of all information if to predict future events}.   \"Advanced projections about the future from more info being held in mind results in \"running scenarios\" in the mind, one moment after another... which results in the perception of a reference point, the organism, within the scenario.  As this type of mental activity began to evolve, what we think of as \"self awareness\" also began to emerge.\" Hope that helps ",

Most doctors and human biology scientists will be very aware of how to start or stop an animal or human consciousness when necessary. Most of the body is not actively involved in consciousness except to pass nerve cell configuration information on to the brain. When your arm hurts, that is in your brain. You can stop the pain signals from traveling to the brain either at the source or in the brain. The process is chemical. That is why the doctor can have you breath or drink chemicals that stop your consciousness. A hard blow to the head can disrupt consciousness as well. ",

Understand mathematics, scientific method and logic (which is how we are able to do pretty much anything), and then prove how those tools are incapable of \"understanding\" consciousness. I wrote a thesis about it. Then that thesis got turned into a book.

As a result of this, the size of your consciousness shrinks down to a minute loop. Fortunately you do fall out of that loop since the rate of consumption of neurotransmitters exceed the rate of supply. You then work very very hard to forget how human consciousness works, such that your consciousness can return to full/normal size. ",
