            "answer_text": "I think its a blessing as i have often thought about this over the years. I think someones ability to accept anything life throws at them be it suffering, lack of money, love is a thought process thats developed over time that i think takes practice but above all realisation, i am certainly not there yet. I say realisation because once you know that you are a soul in physical form and that everything happens for a reason that is to the betterment of your spiritual progress and that life on this earth in your current form is actually for a very short time in the grand scheme of things ( even low it doesn't Seem that way when your here living it) then suffering does get that bit easier to deal with, i also know this \u2026\u2026\u2026.. people who suffer on this earth yet still show love towards others while their going threw it reap the rewards when their soul goes back home massively this is what is meant by those who give to others they actually give to themselves. The ability to accept suffering is a blessing on so many levels i know that but i also know that personally at times when i am suffering greatly its extremely hard to do, extremely and its even harder to try stay positive and be kind and caring towards others while its happening so i think thats where the practice part comes into it and if your not good at commitment like me then thats a problem. But i have found something that helps the acceptance of suffering greatly and its this verse ( even lo I'm spiritual i reject religion as a form of control, this prayer does help ) DEAR HIGHER POWER GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE, THE COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN AND THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. Serenity is the acceptance of life's suffering, well thats what I believe anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read somewhere that pain is inevitable but suffering is optional. So, someone\u2019s ability to accept suffering depends upon what the situation is. I think if the situation is out of your control, then you should sit back and not worry about. You should be able to accept that this thing is out of my control so i should not focus on it. Talking about it being a blessing or a curse. Take it as a blessing because you are able to accept everything that happens to you and you move forward with it. Accept suffering when you know you cannot do anything else beside facing it. Being in denial delays your healing. Thanks. ",
