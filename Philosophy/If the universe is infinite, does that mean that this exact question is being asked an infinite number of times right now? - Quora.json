            "answer_text": "In short - Yes. If there is the smallest probability of the question being asked, which you have just proven, then by making the universe larger you make the probability larger as well. Whatever non zero probability multiplied by infinity will always result in infinity. Now if the universe is just our observable universe, in my opinion you are the only one asking the question at the moment of asking it. To get a rough estimate you need to calculate the probability of someone asking this question, then you need to get the probability of asking it in the same language and you need to define how short is right now. How many people have had this idea before you? 100? Now consider 5.52% of the world\u2019s population speaks English, so about 6 people have asked the same exact question until now. The known universe is truly huge: some 2x10^11 galaxies in our observable universe2x10^5 advanced civilizations per universe in my calculationsSo you get some 4x10^16 advanced civilizations. The probability of getting an independent civilization developing a language identical to English at least in what is used in that question is minimal even if we consider multiple languages per civilization. I truly cannot imagine how low the probability would be, but let\u2019s say 10^-10. So 4x10^6 * 6 = 2.4x10^7 times until now. The age of the universe is about 14x10^9 years. Is right now one second or Planck time 10^-43 seconds? Let\u2019s start with one second: 14x10^9 years x 3.15x10^7 seconds / year = 44x10^16 seconds. So this question would be asked 2.4x10^7 / 44x10^16 = 5.5x10^-12 times this second, or once every 5765 years. Planck time would just make matters much worse. Also if the universe is not infinite, but the time of it\u2019s existence is, it will be asked an infinite number of times ;) ",
