            "answer_text": "Now, allow me to list out 20 things wrong with homophobia: Disrespectful. You should respect other people\u2019s choices. Like, you respect cat lovers, why can\u2019t you respect same sex lovers?Unacceptance. Everyone is different. We accept people of all races, why can\u2019t we respect people of all sexual orientations?Unwilling to change. Well, voting used to be men\u2019s rights, but now everyone can vote. Things change. Marriage is no longer between a man and a women.Banning human rights. It is our right to get married just like you have your rights to vote for Donald Trump.It has nothing to do with you if you don\u2019t care. Just because gay people get married doesn\u2019t mean you have to get gay marriage too.Legalizing gay marriage does not mean that gays don\u2019t respect heterosexual marriage. Why can some people get married and some can\u2019t? It isn\u2019t logical.Mutual respect. We\u2019re not heterophobic. We accept and love heterosexual people too. Yet some of them are still homophobic.Homosexuals aren\u2019t interested in making other people gay, but homophobes are.People are born gay, but taught homophobia.We\u2019re not the minority. There are 1500+ species of animals that can be homosexual. However, only 1 species, otherwise known as humans, are homophobic.It is important for animals to be homosexual as they take care of the offsprings of heterosexual couples who have died.People all around the world are being bullied, abused, because of their homosexuality. You are hurting people. Stop.Homosexual people have a higher depression and attempted suicide rate which leads to self destruction. Sexual Orientation and Depression: Statistics and Where to Find HelpTeenagers who are homosexual have a higher suicide rate. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07481188708252171Parents have abandoned their own children because they are gay. I personally know a friend whose parents are threatening to kick her out.Teenagers are being humuliated by their parents and footage of the shaming can be easily found on the internet.Us who are still closeted live in constant fear of our homophobic parents. You have no idea what it feels like knowing our parents would hate us and hearing those homophobic comments they make.We are not just gays. We are also a million other cool things yet society overlooks them.Heterosexual should not be the default. Who said so, anyways? Why is it that we have to come out and be shamed and you don\u2019t?Your \u201cbeliefs\u201d are killing people, literally. In 10+ countries in the world, you get the death penalty for being homosexual.There, all from the brain of a 13 year old. It took me less than 20 minutes to write that. -Your Unicorn Friend ",

            "answer_text": "Everything is wrong with homophobia. It\u2019s discrimination on a person merely for their sexual orientation, which they have absolutely zero power over of unlike homophobes. A homophobic person makes the choice to disregard a human just because they feel like the way they are is superior. When they do this they make the choice to disregard who that person is, oppress this person, are hateful, disrespectful, dictate another person and worst of all become a bigot. A person is not based on that of their body, but the content of their character/soul(religious/non religious whatever makes you feel good). I don\u2019t care if someone is white, black, Hispanic, Colombian, Haitian, Japanese, what you look like, your nationality, what disabilities you have, rich/poor, male/female, old/young, popular/not popular, what language you speak, religious/non religious what you sexuality is, you gender expression/gender identity ",
