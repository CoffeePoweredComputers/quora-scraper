            "answer_text": "Life and death affects people profoundly, both in the positive and the negative, but it depends on the person affected and the proximity of someone being born or someone dying. For the life part, the other day I spoke to a parent. He said he had to give up quite some things because of this children, and did not come as a clear trade-off that gives back as much as you have given up (for example, less time for sports but more time for something else). He said this because what you get in return is not something solid, something you can properly grasp. It is more a feeling, that is hard to put into words, but you will know when you know. I have taken it to mean that once you have children of your own it will affect you in so many ways you are not conscious of. So the positive is of course this sense or feeling of having the offspring and the negative is the giving up of certain aspects (less time for hobbies, sports, freedom to do whatever you please, as now you have responsibilities towards the offspring) For the death part, interestingly enough it also have positive and negative consequences. Yes, people passing is a sad occurrence, which leads to a sense of loss. This sense of loss is, to a certain extent, will fade, the more time will pass, but every now and again that sense of having lost that person will pop up again, no matter how much time has passed. When important life events occur, you thoughts wonder to those you have lost, as you want to share those events with them. Or questions you have about whatever (something mundane such as washing or more intellectual such as the political development and rising tensions between country A and country B). But lets assume for a moment that someone lost their father or their mother at the age of twenty. That person will always have their memories of their parents from those twenty years. In their memory, their parents will not age beyond the point of their last memory of their parents being alive. So when this person has aged up to the point of fifty or so, they will still have a memory of their parents when they were twenty (and their parents perhaps being fifty years old). But people in their surrounding whose parents are still alive, will be older. This realization, that your own parents won\u2019t age I find an interesting train of thought, that leaves you ruminating at times (which is not a bad thing per se), wondering how they would be, if they had not died. On the positive side, it can also give you room, losing a certain limitation, or rethinking you\u2019re approach to life, leading to different choices and a better quality of life (of course the reverse might happen as well). If again we use the example of a parent passing away. Not always, but often there are conflicts within families. I think this is fairly normal and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. For some however, they feel a sort of obligation to explain their choices to their parents (even though they are adults) or feel hampered/limited by what their parents (might) think of their choices and subsequently do not make that choice. Or parents that flat out forbid certain choices. In the case a parent then has passed, it can also lead to (not withstanding the sense of loss, grief and everything that comes with losing a loved one) a sense of relief or opportunity (over time), because you don\u2019t have to explain your choices to that parent or have to worry about a disapproval from that parent. To conclude, both life and death have aspects that are positive and negative. Looking at it from a glass being half full, I would like to end with the clich\u00e9 that when one door closes, a window opens (and hey, clich\u00e9s are clich\u00e9s for a reason!) ",

If you ask if I\u2019m scared I guess I am. However, I want to have all my papers ready and have someone just to be there when the time comes for my children to be alerted of my passing. Those two things are my biggest concerns. ",
