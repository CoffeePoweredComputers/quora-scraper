            "answer_text": "The Bible does tell us that when the world gets to the state, \u201cas in the days of Noah\u201d - unspeakable wickedness, then the end is near, but the world has been very bad for a long time, but now they are calling evil good, and good evil - that's a critical sign. Another thing to consider is the passage in Matthew where the desciples ask Jesus what will be the signs of the end of the age: Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, \u201cTell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?\u201d And Jesus answered and said to them: \u201cTake heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, \u2018I am the Christ,\u2019 and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. \u201cThen they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name\u2019s sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. Matthew 24:3-\u202c14 NKJV He said christians will be hated. The Holy names of the Holy Trinity are the ONLY one's blasphemed by this world, no other religion is blasphemed like Christianity is. Also,there is less tolerance of Christianity, than any other religion, despite the fact that true Bible believing Christians are the most passive people on earth. The world hates God, Jesus and Christians, that is a sign that we are near the end. Earthquakes in diverse place means many, in different places, the earthquakes you hear about on the news are only a tiny fraction of whats really happening, just go to volcano watch or any seismic measuring website, and you'll be shocked, the world is experiencing between 80 and 100 earthquakes A DAY. Also we are deffinately experiencing more pestilences /plagues/diseases than ever before, we are already in the time Jesus described as The Beginning of Sorrows. Also, God says, \u201cIn the last days, I will pour out my spirit upon mankind and your young men and old men will have dreams and visions, and your daughters will prophesy. That seems to be happening. But remember, no man, nor angels nor anyone knows the time, only God knows. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, someday Jesus Christ will return. But not quite yet. Any preacher who claims that they know the date of Christ\u2019s return is misguided. They are basing this statement on personal opinion and conjecture, not on scripture. When one studies the Bible, its clear that a series of chronological events will take place leading up to Jesus\u2019 Second Coming. This day is also referred to as the Day of the Lord, First Resurrection and rapture. I would suggest reading and studying the Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ. In this book we read about details regarding the seven year end times. There is no way we are currently in the end times. We are not even close. The disciples thought they would experience the end times, but they were mistaken. When the events described in the seven seals start to happen, then we will know with certainty that we are in the end times. But none of these events have happened as yet. Many false churches have made claims and failed predictions of the timing of Jesus\u2019 return. But they were all wrong. There are so many examples of failed predictions that its surprising the people belonging to that congregation didn\u2019t just leave their church. REVELATION CHAPTER 1 KJV MATTHEW CHAPTER 1 KJV MARK CHAPTER 1 KJV LUKE CHAPTER 1 KJV JOHN CHAPTER 1 KJV Read the four gospels, Jesus talks about the end times to the disciples. You will get a better idea about end times by reading scripture rather than listening to a mistake preacher. Jesus saves. ",
