            "answer_text": "If the subject is art, then the perspectives on it, philosophical and otherwise, are countless. There are philosophies of art in general, what constitutes art, art\u2019s function in society, art\u2019s value in culture and in the context of an individual life. There are methodological approaches to criticism that engage with those larger philosophies. But there is no way to simply enumerate them all. ",
