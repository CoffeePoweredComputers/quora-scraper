Ever since Vasari and his \u2018renaissance\u2019, art \u2018historians\u2019 and \u2018critics\u2019 have been seduced into believing that \u2018art\u2019 can be divided into \u2018convenient boxes\u2019. And if you belong in a box that somehow gives value to the work; balderdash and poppycock! The wider the box . . . Some might \u2018label\u2019 Monet, Seurat, Sisley, Renoir even Degas as \u2018impressionists\u2019 but their styles are unique; as different as chalk and cheese. That alone belies their affinity to a \u2018movement\u2019. Maybe a sense of possibility but nowhere a box to be labeled. Was van Eyck \u2018Gothic\u2019, was D\u00fcrer \u2018renaissance\u2019, was Turner an \u2018impressionist\u2019, was Magritte a \u2018surrealist\u2019. You see, the boxes don\u2019t quite line up. Boxes seldom do. Art is art and boxes seldom provide clarity. ",
