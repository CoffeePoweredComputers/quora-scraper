            "answer_text": "An opinion is simply what a given individual (believes) is the truth or what is factual in the case of an event of some kind. As such, an opinion is usually not based on conclusive evidence or deductive logic but instead on an inclination or an intuition which brings the individual to a conclusion. An opinion can also be a deductive conclusion or a scientific conclusion based on irrefutable research that is done for the first time by the individual but has not yet been concurred upon by anyone else at the time the conclusion is drawn. An individual's opinion can also contain what is moral or ethical or the most expedient thing to do in particular situation according to that individuals belief. Now, an opinion can be the truth. An opinion can also be false. An individual can insist that their opinion is the truth and be either right or wrong. The secret is to obtain irrefutable evidence that an opinion is true. Then the caterpillar of thought, known as opinion, then transforms itself into the butterfly of truth. The interesting thing is that life has many experiences in which we have to depend on our opinions being true in order to function in the world. For example, we go into a restaurant and we order a meal and we assume that the restaurant waiter is not going to poison our food and kill us. We get in our automobiles and drive on freeways or Autobahns because we believe that we are in control of our destiny while behind the wheel and that we will reach our destination safely and carry on the day. Unfortunately this belief is only an opinion as is proven by the fact that in the past, in the United States, between 30000 and 40000 traffic deaths occur every year. Newton's laws of motion are irrefutable within approximation at speeds not approaching that of the free space speed of light. Experiments can be done to prove this fact. Experimenters can run tests of these laws until they are blue in the face, and they will get no other result. But if the body under motion approaches a velocity equal to that of light then Newton's laws are found to be at least inaccurate. Also, early mathematicians have created experiments in which even at low velocities some of Newton's Laws do not always hold. (I refer the reader to Wikipedia \u201cThe Three Body Problem\u201d). Here I come to the edge of my school room. Beyond my school room door are \u201copinions\u201d of existence involving things like Rene Descartes' \u201cI think therefore I exist\u201d, or \u201cbiocentric\u201d reality, or \u201cThe Brain in a Vat\u201d theory of existence, or cyber-quantum theories of existence, or the Copenhagen interpretation of existence, and many more philosophic and scientific opinions which I welcome references to. As a philosopher/engineering graduate, with only the license of a bachelors degree in engineering and a master's degree from a California State University, let me sum it up this way: As thinking entities in this universe, all we have are opinions which remain within the bounds of the mental and the discursive. When we start to depend upon these opinions to live our lives, we are compelled to label them as \u201ctruth\u201d until we have an experience which as caveat, falsifies in some way that truth, and we must modify our beliefs to create a new opinion about the matter. And as you can see, this entire essay I have just composed qualifies as such. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a philosophical question that even the great masses of humankind would love to have a firm answer to. It turns out to be not so easy to answer, especially given the divide between what has been inherited from British empiricism and Continental idealism (that\u2019s not the best term, but I\u2019ll use it). We practical American pragmatists (heirs to the British empiricists) want to say, first, there is what is. We like to have a solid measurement, though that\u2019s not always possible. Then, we like to say, secondly, what should be. This is your distinction between \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201copinion,\u201d and upon which all Law, that of man and/or God, is based in our human systems of thought. But there is a hidden riddle here that philosophically-minded folks need to pay attention to. What if, as so may have claimed, and now for which there is some solid biological and experimental evidence, there is no such thing as free will, or freedom to choose to do something other than that mandated by the inexorable march of cause and effect? What if we have evolved a sense of free will because it helps us to accept our established systems of human reward and punishment, based on our \u201cchoices\u201d or \u201coptions\u201d? That is the riddle. The only thing we can surmise is that denial of free choice seems to lead more often than not to apathy and/or poor choices. Humans are starved, genetically altered, their suffering ignored because, after all, they are nothing but masses of atoms and molecules? But inhumanity is not a necessary component of determinism, though sometimes it seems so. Marx was a historical, materialistic determinist, which meant that we are all on a train ride to a classless society, and while we can wave \u201chello\u201d to the should have been as it stands by watching us through the train windows, along the way, there is no way to change the course or speed of the train itself. Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, opt for a \u201cperspective\u201d that tells us, well, yes, we know there is not really any free will, but our society works better if we assume there is. That is pure hypocrisy, but he may be right. If we incorporate what should be into our moral, legal, ethical and practical sets of rules, and we reinforce the right behaviors and extinguish the wrong behaviors, it seems quite reasonable to lie to ourselves. Fortunately, there are people like the author of this Quora question who are not so willing to adopt an \u201canything that works is good\u201d perspective. If nothing else, humanity progresses by evolution of the mind as well as the heart, and so we are all condemned, by nature itself, to feel both curiosity about the truth and empathy for our fellows. We don\u2019t have to accept ourselves as bags of atoms and molecules, we can see the truth of what we are, predetermined or not. Bottom line (another great American idiom): If we can\u2019t change anything ahead of time, then what is is also what should be. Unless we should never talk about what should be, a suggestion that could easily have come from Wittgenstein. Call it fatalism or whatever you like. We have been harangued by our religious leaders for thousands of years that it is better not to fret over the future than to do the right thing, that is right there, in front of us. Do we have to interject the fiction of free choice in order to call that a good thing? I don\u2019t think so. And finally, let me leave you who would point to quantum indeterminism or quantum effects in nerve tubules in the brain as support for the hypothesis of human free will. Consider the Wheeler-Feynman equations for observations of wave-particle collapse phenomena that are transitive - that is, the (later) observation can be seen as the true particle position, but if we were in the future and then looking back, we would see the same collapse of the future wave function into a past particle in spacetime. This is called transitivity, and given that their equations do fit the data nicely (better than our stringy alternatives!), and are so logical, it is hard to argue that, from our own current position in spacetime, the future has not already happened. Most physicists require a past and a present, so they toss out Wheeler-Feynman without even considering its ramifications. But, what if absolute determinism means that all we have is a fuzzy midpoint at any point in time? ",

            "answer_text": "If you can believe that none of us has the right to declare we have found an ultimate truth, then the philosophy is easy. Ultimate truths are objective truths, unaffected by us. The things we believe are true are subjective truths, because we don't have perfect reasoning and change these beliefs as we find reasons. I wrestled with the truth idea a while and decided that what we believe to be true is what builds the reality within which each of us lives. That is a subjective reality. Those beliefs are ours alone, unless we share them with others who agree..  Each one of us determines our truth by what we believe is good. If it's good, it's true and our lives are affected by that truth-goodness.  I also came to understand that we cannot know if we have found an ultimate truth. We can only build our own world of truths (soul for the religious) and hope to come close to the ultimate truth.  Even though we can never know if we have found an ultimate truth, that should never deter us from continuing to search, because the goal is to get closer to ultimate truths. Putting it religiously, we are working toward finding the mind of God while knowing we can't get there.  It's very possible that the main reason we exist is to work at discovering absolute truths. I like to say that life is the universe trying to discover itself, so we are important in that quest.   The goal is to improve our reality, and that means sharing our good beliefs and letting others\u2019 good beliefs into our minds, so we can get different views and hopefully move slowly closer to absolute truths. Success in spreading our goodness depends on avoiding being self-righteous.   I believe that we all have an obligation to express our opinions on what we believe is good and be openminded to others\u2019 opinions. This way we can leverage the collective human mind and hopefully approach ultimate truths.  We tend to believe some scientific \u201cfacts\u201d as true. Those are probably very close to ultimate truths, but likely not perfectly there. Even our most treasured good beliefs will be shown to be at least somewhat inaccurate in the future.   Newton felt his laws of motion were absolutely true, but Einstein modified them. Someone will probably modify Einstein. So, we can't discern the truth. But we should keep at it by promoting our version of goodness and adjusting it as we hear from others.  As Shakespeare told us, \"there is nothing that is good or bad but thinking makes it so.\" By this, you have the option of seeing everything as good. If we see something as bad, it's because we have decided it's bad relative to our personal expectations.  Give power to positive opinions by expressing them. If you are unable to tell a good opinion, then that is a missed opportunity to move us all toward a better humanity.   Don't give power to negative opinions by avoiding expressing them. Negative opinions should be denied and not shared. Keep bad thoughts to yourself and try to erase them. I think of it as avoiding the four C\u2019s. Avoid Complaining, Criticizing, Condeming (blaming), and Commanding (giving orders).  Religiously, we are promoting evil when expressing opinions on badness. This can even be taken to mean doing the devil\u2019s work to overdramatize the idea.  Criticizing shares beliefs in badness instead of good beliefs. It goes backward on getting to better truths. People criticize to manipulate others and stand on their self-righteousness, demanding they have the ultimate truth.  Many heated arguments are centered around people having different definitions. Some people promote confusion by not defining the terms they use, so they can create confusing truisms and slogans. Spreading confusion is a technique used to control masses, a favorite of politicians and some church officials. If we are confused and don't understand then we tend to just follow.  Look for goodness in discussions with others, and don't assume they are using your definitions. Athiests hit on something good when rejecting the official personified God, and believers hit on something when they see there is goodness all around and that goodness is all powerful.  So, share your goodness, listen to others\u2019 goodness and realize you can't say you understand an ultimate truth, absolute truth, complete reality, ultimate goodness or the mind of God. ",

But, to do this, you first need to have a strong foundation in logic and reason to successfully use the Socratic method. This is where modern philosophy has failed, a true philosopher today needs to be skilled in mathematics and trained in the natural sciences, knowing the laws of nature. This is the path to be taken to expose opinions to uncover truth. For me, the true modern philosophers are the likes of Einstein, Nobelauriate Erwin Schrodinger, Dr. Ian Stevenson and Dr. Brian Weiss. These are scientists who have taken what they know to be true from their scientific background and questioned what seems to be false. This is from my book: Torn Between Two Worlds: Wisdom and Rhetoric ",

            "answer_text": "It can\u2019t. Philosophy has a whole range of choices of theories that can be used to guide one towards what they envision as a truth. But there are contradictory theories in Philosophy. When two people think about something they are both looking at, both see different things. Neither can tell who is more right. There is a problem with perception. Our mind puts meaning onto things rather than synthesizing objective meaning. Each society has different ideas of truth. Behind the veil I think there is an objective truth, but it is inaccessible. We deal with varying degrees of divergence from the truth. A \u201ctruth\u201d appears to be assumed by this question to be something that has evidence to back it up. But even theories, which all have evidence are not proven, and go through a succession of being replaced by new theories that appear to have a greater correspondence to truth. At the same time, different forms of knowing grasp different aspects of the universe. Science can tell us about the material aspects of the world, but not the immaterial. Others such as phenomenology and spirituality can tell us about immaterial aspects of the world. As people perceive differently, using philosophy to guide us to distinguish truth from opinion would leave us with many different opinions on what is true and untrue. But it helps to find philosophies that are more other-oriented rather than self-centered in thinking about life. This helps to find truth. A standard is needed. This can be found in religion. ",

Examine the requirements and execute. The result will either happen according to the promise or the requirements were wrong, poorly executed or the promise false. Be honest about it and prepared to change your life. The truth is not always what the majority thinks it is. Otherwise, there would be no philosophers. ",

The best tool for distinguishing truth from opinion is a firm commitment to the existence of objective truth, together with training in rhetoric, debate, history, and political science. Speculative philosophy is not a guide here, because in it the existence of objective truth is a question to be investigated, not an assumption that guides investigations. Again, the best guide in distinguishing truth from opinion is a commitment to objective truth, along with a scientific approach to human affairs. Use multiple sources, question everyone's motives, hear both sides fairly, do your numbers, and reason like a historian. ",

But it can help anyone to see what the evidence for opinions might be, and to suggest tests of its merits even if it can\u2019t perform those tests itself. Also, of course, philosophy can help us to better understand just what constitutes truth and opinion; these are topics with murky depths unplumbed by other lines of thought. ",

Formal logic can be used to discern whether a given opinion is logically valid, but it is also the basic principle on which computers operate, the processor (CPU) of a computer does nothing but logic operations. Such tools, provided by philosophy, can be used to critically examine an opinion and determine whether it is logical to have that opinion, based on the reasons provided. It is very important to remember, that an opinion does not have to be incorrect, just because it is based on faulty reasoning. What philosophy can't do is, to provide any definite answers about what is true or not, save for some very obvious truths, such as the famous \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d. ",

However, most of what we know must be true. We can put a robot on Mars and drive it around. We can build a car that drives itself in heavy traffic amazingly well, so our opinions must be more or less true. There is an objective would out there and these beliefs describe the world quite well. But any individual opinion I hold might be wrong. I know this because I have been wrong before. Truth is the position that inquiry would arrive at if carried on indefinitely, that which no evidence or argument will refute. ",

Early Wittgenstein held that opinioms are always nonsense. Russell, who i think suffered in his days to submitting to a need for empiricism, held that truth bore a relation to facts. I believe that truth in a grand sense is indeterminate and perpetually transient. Or, in another attempt I would say that, truth, while still indeterminate, is geometrical in nature and is unique to all things relative to the transient and fluxoral position in peacetime.
