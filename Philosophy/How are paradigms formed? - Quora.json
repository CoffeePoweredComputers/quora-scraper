            "answer_text": "In the nineteenth century, largely due to the works of Cesare Lombroso, it was believed that criminality is an inherited trait, which could be identifiable through some physical features\u2014such as a sloping forehead, unusually large ears, an asymmetric face, a protruded jaw, small, wandering eyes and other physicalities; criminals were also found by Lombroso to have more acute sight, have less sensibility to pain and touch. Lombroso\u2019s theory on female criminals was that female criminals are more cruel than men, had shorter height, prominent lower jaws, more wrinkles, smaller skulls, and more hair than \u201cnormal women\u201d. Criminals were also supposed to have \u201cexcessive tattoos\u201d. Lombroso\u2019s method to arrive at these conclusions were rigorous, clinical and very detailed. Cesare Lombroso\u2019s ideas took the world by storm and influenced American sociological thought for years. He\u2019s still called as the \u201cfather of criminology\u201d though I\u2019m not sure why, since his ideas were fantastically wrong, and many believe (you can count me in, among these \u201cmany\u201d) racially motivated. There were significant problems in his methodology, but those problems wouldn\u2019t appear as problems, if you agree to his reference belief systems or paradigm of thought.  A couple viewing the head of Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso preserved in a jar of formalin at an exhibition in Bologna, 1978. (Photo by Romano Cagnoni/Hulton Archive/Getty Images); Image Source Lombroso was influenced by Social Darwinism\u2014the fallacious reasoning of applying the theory of natural selection where the \u201cstrong\u201d survives and the \u201cweak\u201d are wiped out. How did Lombroso arrive at his conclusions which were revered at his time but are termed nothing but ludicrous today? By agreeing to assumptions of what counts as \u201ccriminality\u201d and whether or not is an inheritable trait, following which he studied cadavers of criminals and their cranial capacities and eyes, etc\u2014using effect to explain cause and not the other way round. It wasn\u2019t only Lombroso. Franz Joseph Gall also studied cranioscopy, in the hope of finding a typology of identifying criminality based on the size and shape of human skulls. Gall also went on to become a member of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Phrenology , or the study of measurement of the human skull, to find out how brain affects specific actions and functions of the human body, was a roaring success in the nineteenth century and people like Gall and Lombroso were potent flagbearers. Today, phrenology is known as pseudo-science. But back then, this paradigm was a roaring success because at that point in time, standards of what counts as \u201cscientific\u201d procedure and acceptable level of evidence and methodological validity, were in the process of being codified, and logic systems of cause and effect were being coloured by the logic of \u201cfunctionality\u201d\u2014that is, something has to exist because it must have a purpose for the greater good (or lack of it). These standards of \u201cacceptable knowledge\u201d and definitions of what counts are knowledge keep varying from age to age and place to place. Let\u2019s see some more examples of shifts in paradigm: A. Weekend and Weekdays:  The \u201cfact\u201d that Monday to Friday are weekdays, and that Saturday and Sunday are weekend, are based on a paradigm of organizing days of the week according to a Christian notion of organizing weekdays. So, when smartphone manufacturers make an alarm clock setting of repeating the morning alarm of 6 o clock to be set on \u201cweekdays\u201d, they are conforming to that Christian notion of weekdays. In a Jewish setting, Sunday is a weekday. Friday and Saturday form the weekend. This means that I can\u2019t set my phone alarm on my phone (which was bought from a non-Jewish setting), on the repeat mode for \u201cweekdays\u201d at 6 o\u2019clock; because if I do, it will wake me up on the \u201cweekend\u201d at 6 am; it won\u2019t wake me up on the \u201cweekday\u201d that is Sunday. B. The notion of homosexuality being an abnormality was based on a paradigm that holds the benchmark of human heterosexual love and sexual relationship as the only acceptable reference of sexuality, as delivered by the intellectual elites of a society, who also happen to come from religion, and define what is \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d.  Homosexuality in nature\u2014a natural phenomenon, defined as \u201cunnatural\u201d by humans based on their logic systems; Image Source: Homosexuality in Animal Kingdom - Documentary Therefore, homosexuality became an \u201cabnormality\u201d, something \u201cunnatural\u201d, and many homosexuals, throughout history were made to undergo physical tortures, or rapes, emotional and physical abuse and forced sexual abuses with heterosexuals, based on the interpretation that homosexuals are an aberration\u2014because they do not know the pleasures of the \u201cnormal\u201d, which is the heterosexual way of having a sexuality. They were looked upon as deviants\u2014the ones who should be controlled\u2014lest they pollute the minds of their \u201cnormal\u201d counterparts. The word \u201cstraight\u201d, denoting heterosexual, indicates the residual effect of the traditional paradigm on sexuality. The use and assumption behind what counts as \u201cnatural\u201d ignored: how \u201cnatural\u201d doesn\u2019t need to mean whether or not something should be predominant by numbers or have some functionality towards perpetuation of the society. These tacit assumptions and words, often guide the logical structure of coherence of thought, and have particular influence on sequencing of a paradigmatic thought. C. The belief that the earth was flat was a paradigm, which guided actions and methods in exploring the earth. People arrived at this conclusion because thats what they would be told, and because they couldn\u2019t conceptualize it otherwise. This paradigmatic thought existed because it couldn\u2019t be falsified by the technological and logical aids at that time. Paradigms are formed by practice, and tradition of what counts as \u201cknowledge\u201d . Paradigms are also formed as influenced by available methodology. Do you have a crush? On Quora? Yes? When you realize you have a crush on someone, you have a distinct level of understanding, aided by information given to you by the world around you, on the difference between a \u201ccrush\u201d and a \u201clove\u201d and just \u201cliking\u201d someone. You have distinct information and awareness on how to act around each one of these concepts. You know what to do and how to act, based on the paradigm of having a crush on Quora, as determined by rules and etiquette on Quora, your belief systems and your available time spent on the Internet.  Image Source However, if your crush is an entity outside Quora, it would be a different story. I have stories of pursuing crush which are entirely different from Googling and facebooking steps, because they belonged to an age where Internet existed in school labs, offices and cyber cafes and when smartphones were not born. Jargon-wise, paradigms are distinct and quite specific set or thought patterns that decide on concepts, methods, postulates, acceptable standards and underlying assumptions of a set of thought. There are specific epistemological and ontological bases of paradigms. In easy English, paradigm are ways by which you organize, and understand information to form particular knowledge systems. A paradigm is therefore, basically, a belief system, that colours or filters awareness on some aspect of reality. To understand how paradigms are formed, you need to trace back and question each assumption. How did each assumption or truism come into practice? Why are they taken to be true? What happens when you oppose those paradigmatic thought? If you\u2019re more interested, you should study Thomas Kuhn\u2019s, an American physicist, historian and philosopher\u2019s book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which is a fascinating and interesting study on paradigm shifts. And even Kuhn\u2019s ideas were not free from paradigmatic shifts and criticism. ",

Refreshingly, I think and hope that breaking this down into three areas is an important step forward in how we conceptualize how we create paradigms in the first place. How do we form personal paradigms? Changing our Goals/DreamsChanging our history/experienceChanging how we view and tell stories about that experienceHow do we form cultural paradigms in organizations? What counts as success? What makes a good employee? What does excellence look like? What does service look like? All three of the above, along with the way culture is built through practice, habit, communication, symbol, heros, leadership, and mission statements. How do we form academic disciplinary paradigms? What does good academic work look like? What does peer reviewed work look like\u2014in other words what is the criteria for good peer reviewed work? Formed largely by practice and peer review literature. But its also shaped by funding decisions, conferences, key publications in the field, and other influential decisions in the field. Admittedly, this is just a thumbnail sketch or overview. But I think I\u2019ve provided sufficient depth so that you know what we are talking about and so that you can reflect on these three categories as unique ways in which paradigms are formed and changed. I hope that helps unpack these three key areas of paradigm\u2014so that you can be a better critical thinker and problem solver in these areas. ",
