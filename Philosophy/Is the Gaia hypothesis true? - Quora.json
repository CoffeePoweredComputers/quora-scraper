            "answer_text": "The Gaia hypothesis - that the Earth acts as a self-regulating entity and can be thought of as a single superorganism - is a hypothesis that has shown its validity many times. The Gaia hypothesis was proposed by James Lovelock in stages, starting in 1965, and further developed in collaboration with Lynn Margulis. The Gaia hypothesis proposes that Earth maintains an environment friendly or conducive to life (a large biomass) via countless feedback loops involving both biological and geological processes. Geology and biology are very intertwined in Gaia. Daisyworld is an example of a model of a simple Gaia in operation. Competition between white and black daisies, in Daisyworld, maintains the surface temperature a planet within a narrow range, as its star brightens or dims.Gaia does not imply the Earth is conscious. The feedback mechanisms, as in Daisyworld, operate quite unconsciously, being natural geological and biological processes.The Sun has brightened over the course of geological history, yet the surface of the Earth has maintained a stable temprature, due to a complex interplay of our biology, water, humidity, cloud cover and CO2 concentrations. During the past, such as the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, when the Sun was cooler, the high levels of CO2 (3 x - 8 x the pre-industrial levels) kept the Earth warm. Now that the Sun is brighter the lower levels of CO2 are keeping the Earth cool.Venus and Mars, without life, have been rendered inhospitable to the future development of life. Their chemically stable atmospheres are signatures of dead lifeless planets. The Earth, by contrast, has an atmosphere containing unstable gases, such as oxygen and methane, which exist only because of life. This led Lovelock, at NASA in 1965, to propose that simple spectroscopic analysis of a planet's atmosphere as a test for the existence of planetary life - as a cheaper alternative to the expensive space probe expeditions favored by NASA. NASA reacted by sacking Lovelock.In contrast to Gaia there is the semi-humorous Medea hypothesis which proposes that the Earth is \u201ctrying\" to kill off its multicellular life and return the Earth to its anaerobic state, prior to the Oxygen Catastrophe.
