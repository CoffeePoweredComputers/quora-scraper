            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been working on the \u201cUnified Field Theory\u201d; one of the issues it addresses is the very question you posed, namely, whether time exists simultaneously at all points or not. Here is the answer (according to my version of the \u201cUnified Field Theory\u201d). Simultaneity in time depends upon establishing a \u201cunified field domain.\u201d This is established by consciousness, unity, and love. Note the importance of consciousness first. The reason for that is that consciousness is in the same dimension as both time and the quantum wave, namely the abstract, complex, metaphysical realm. The second factor is unity. This addresses the social realm or issue. When unity of heart in love is established among people, they form a unified domain, or a unified realm of collective consciousness, which then transcends the individual level and becomes a social unified field domain. This is important because the true reality of our world is not only material, not only inorganic, but becomes unified in the deepest sense when human beings in the social context become united in love. This is in fact \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven.\u201d In other words, true \u201csimultaneity\u201d and \u201cunity\u201d are not fully achieved until the actual Kingdom of Heaven is realized. That time has already begun now. The third element, love is necessary, because \u201cunity\u201d is not just achieved by consensus, agreement, financial or legal contract, social contract, constitution, law, government, military force, etc. Love is the essential core of the Kingdom of Heaven, and also the most essential unifying element in the Unified Field Theory. Namely, it\u2019s not merely a humanistic concept, but in fact is the essential force or foundation which causes the essential metaphysical and also quantum world to become one, and to attain \u201csimultaneity.\u201d Until now physics, quantum mechanics, and science in general has been \u201csterile\u201d, i.e., has been attempting to build the structure of all science, which is termed the \u201cUnified Field Theory\u201d (as a purely physical construct) and the \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d (based on sheerly conceptual or rational principles). However, the true Unified Field Theory can describe how and why the unified field domain can be established in a spatial realm, social realm, conceptual realm, and above all heartistic realm. As we know, with Einstein\u2019s Special Theory of Relativity, time and space, matter and energy are all determined by the photon, the speed of light, as the standard. This is true, within the physical realm, but not within the quantum realm where simultaneity has been established centered on unity, consciousness and love. As we already know, there seems to be some contradiction between quantum mechanics and relativity in the point of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201csimultaneity.\u201d In fact, Special Relativity forbids any material transport or communication faster than light. At the same time, it has already been amply experimentally established that the quantum wave in all its parts, however distantly separated are unified instantaneously. Now there is a special clause: This can never be used for communication (at least as far as we know at present). There seems to be a contradiction: Einstein\u2019s theory effectively defines \u201csimultaneity\u201d centered upon the light cone based on the speed of light. However, what if the two objects or people were to transmit to each other \u201csimultaneously\u201d? Then the definition of \u201csimultaneity\u201d would be broken or violated, and \u201csimultaneity\u201d collapses. Therefore, when the two points are in a prearranged agreement, \u201csimultaneity\u201d in the relativistic definition becomes meaningless. The Unified Field Theory solution to this is that, once partners or a community become fully united in agreement, in time definition, in consciousness and in love, then a true, perfect unified field domain is established within their realm. In this case, the physical-world, Einsteinian definition of \u201csimultaneity\u201d is superseded and the quantum realm or Kingdom of Heaven realm of true simultaneity is established among them. Astronomers are already using \u201cuniversal time\u201d standards (which are technically illegitimate until the actual Kingdom of Heaven is realized); this is a nod to that which is to come. In this definition, all parties participating in the unified domain of the Kingdom of Heaven (of true love, unity, and consciousness) come under one Unified Field Domain, and thus true heavenly simultaneity is established. This is how time will be unified in the Kingdom of Heaven. ",
