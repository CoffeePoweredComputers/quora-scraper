            "answer_text": "It's not about \"homosexual traits\". It's not like he speaks with a lisp or collects Liza Minelli records. The only trait that homosexuals share is having sex with other members of the same sex, and if Shakespeare wrote those scenes they ended up on the cutting room floor. Rather, it's about Iago's relationships with women and with men. Now, this is really tricky, because \"homosexuality\" as a separate category was treated very differently at the time, and Shakespeare practically never addressed it directly. (There's some stuff in Coriolanus that he clearly intended as sexual, but even there it's not really direct.)  Rather, it's a matter of interpreting Iago's interactions as if he were gay. The text is consistent with that; it's also consistent with his being heterosexual, asexual, or a furry. It's up to the actor and director to choose how it flavors each interaction with men and women. Is that why he and Emilia have no children? Is that why he's jealous of Othello? Or Cassio? Does he also want Desdemona? Is Roderigo totally subby, or what? All of these are valid choices; each one puts a different spin on each interaction he has. It's not in the text, but in the performance, that it really (ahem) comes out. ",

Instead I'll just say that since Iago is broadly considered to have little obvious motivation for investing himself so seriously in the downfall of Othello, it can be useful to the drama to provide an extra measure of motivation emerging from homosexual feelings.
