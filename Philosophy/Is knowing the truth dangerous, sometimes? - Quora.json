            "answer_text": "As you have, no doubt, noted there are many answers to this question.  I hope my answer wall directly address what you really wanted to know.  The truth is something people seeking understanding grow into over a period of years.  Much of what we do that is not part of the truth is deliberate although perhaps unconscious and designed to shield us from peers and from self-knowledge about our own weaknesses or difficult aspects of life.  Were you to encounter profound truth as an instant change of understanding you would no doubt be overwhelmed and devastated.   Standing in the truth has a good deal in common with being transparent so just as a small experiment imagine that you are suddenly in  the center of a large busy city and everything you are think, are,  and have ever done is easily observable by everyone who passes.  Your privacy, your rationalizations, and your thoughts are exposed to the entire world around you.  Most importantly, all of these are also exposed to you forcing you to face them all at once.   Without the capacity for deeper love understanding and forgiveness, especially self forgiveness, this could break a person. Thus comes the sentence; be careful what you ask for, you may get it.  Also knowing the truth compels you to make choices that can be difficult and costly. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, dangerous to the profits of some. an example is not having the answer to the questions: 1. Is there or not human fecal dust* in hospital wards? 2. Is it or not a threat for patients, as causing HA Infection? (99.000 deaths /yr and 1.600.000 cases only in USA). 3. Is there a way to prevent its forming? *\u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left AFTER wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known fatal HA INFECTIONS. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance. It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics. Why a comparison is not made between a hospital, where all the special measures to prevent human fecal dust forming are taken and those, where no special care is taken, as the usual practice is, regarding the HA infection rates, so a safe scientific decision to be made about fecal dust\u2019s role on causing HA infection. On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think, that there are very strong reasons that other interests, than public health protection, are guiding science research.\u201d ",
