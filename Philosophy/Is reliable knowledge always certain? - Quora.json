            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t need absolute, perfect, 100 percent certainty for knowledge to be rightly so-called. We must merely be justified in believing it according to pertinent, available, accepted evidence. We can have the knowledge of God to guide us in our daily lives, but this isn\u2019t perfect nor certain, but an act of faith. In other words, all knowledge has degrees of certitude and some areas require more faith to accept. Much of the knowledge of psychology, in my opinion, is poppycock! You can be a very learned man or a scholar and be full of it! Today, Postmodern scholars in academia will tell you that you can know nothing for certain! And they\u2019re sure! This is a self-refuting statement that tries to prove and contradict itself. In sum, all knowledge is based on faith and begins in an act of faith accepting some presupposition one cannot prove. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no absolute universal knowing. There are only situational, relative, temporary and/or subjective knowings. Some knowing is far broader in general belief/acceptance and some is very narrowly agreed upon. I know some people truly desire (need?) to believe in absolute scientific truth. Today, whether it\u2019s at the quantum physics level or astrophysics level (or anything in between) we realize how little we profoundly know and how much we assume we know/knew (theories that have yet to be proven incorrect). So there are only relative certainties\u2026situational, temporary and/or subjective. We might say that the mathematics that we humans defined, are by our defintion, certain. Whether math does or doesn\u2019t (and how) apply to the physical world, is less certain but for sure, math has given us tremendous insights and technologies. Hope this helps\u2026\u2026but remember, I\u2019m not certain about anything that I wrote above. :) :) ",
