I encourage you to use google next time because questions like this can be answered in less than a minute and is a lot more convenient for you. There are photographs of samurai in the 19th century.      Surprisingly a woman samurai too. I knew women did fight in Japan but this was still surprising.   Notice that we see mail armor in these photos too. It was in fact used in Japan despite what some might tell you. Though it was certainly rarer. ",
