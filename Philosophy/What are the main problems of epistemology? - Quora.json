            "answer_text": "The default way to lay out the main problems of epistemology is to crack open a history of philosophy and lay out the main problems that philosophers have been preoccupied with over the centuries, although \u201cthe main problems that philosophers have always tackled\u201d seems to change an awful lot based on what\u2019s popular right now. Some favorites include external world skepticism, where you ask how you know that there is a world outside of your own consciousness, that all of reality is not just your dream. And there are some nice little paradoxes, like the Aggrippan Trilemma: if you keep asking \u201cwhy\u201d over and over, you either go into an infinitely long chain of reasons where the last one is always unsupported, a circular argument, or you stop somewhere and declare something true by fiat. But I\u2019m not going to write a long encyclopedic essay detailing all of that. Instead, I\u2019ll say that, if I were to name one thing as the central problem of epistemology, it would be this: given that you are ultimately left with only your own judgment, how do you know that your judgment is correct? Think about it. Ultimately, only you can judge if one of your beliefs is true or not. And you can only do so with your own abilities. And only you can decide whether you believe your own abilities are trustworthy. Yeah, yeah, we get our beliefs from society and we\u2019re socialized to believe certain things, and I get that, and that\u2019s an important part of the puzzle, but as soon as you even say that, you\u2019ve made a judgment as an individual. And that\u2019s the central problem: how do you know what you know? Speaking of the social aspect of things, it bears mentioning that epistemology is, or can be, at least, a social activity. It can be a conversation between two people. In a conversation where neither person is willing to say that they doubt something, what is the result? What are the effects if one person says they doubt something, even though they really don\u2019t, or if they\u2019re not willing to say they doubt something, even though they really do? This last piece bears mentioning as long as we\u2019re on the social track, because it\u2019s a relevant problem in an age of mass media. The first step to approaching epistemology in a productive way is honesty, especially honesty with yourself. For example, one possible answer to the question of how you know that your judgment is correct is to say, \u201cThere is no way to know. I have no idea. I don\u2019t really know anything.\u201d But of course there are many responses, such as the self-refutation response: you know that you don\u2019t know anything? So you know at least one thing? But I think the most salient response is to simply ask yourself what you can honestly doubt. Wherever you are right now, ask yourself what some things are that you simply cannot make yourself doubt, and be totally honest about it. I find that I have trouble doubting that I am sitting in my big cushy armchair typing this, for example. Incidentally, when one is socially compelled to say things that one really does not believe, certain problems arise. But I\u2019ll leave you to reflect on that yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s only one: time and its perception. If time is continuous then all things exist in the same indivisible instant and therefore nothing is distinct from anything else. One cannot argue that an observation and its recall as memory are temporarily equivalent, unless all observations and their remembrance are imagined simultaneously. Put another way, \u201cthis\u201d is always \u201cthis\u201d - and you cannot have more than one \u2018this\u2019 without that not being the same thing. The present is always this moment now. If, on the other hand, Time is discrete then no two instances are comparable. A \u2018tic\u2019 is not a \u2018tock\u2019 in the same way that a pendulum is present on the left or right of an axis - not both or neither - so long as time progresses. Hence, if scenarios really can be separated in time then no two events are ever similar and no patterns can ever be perceived consistently - especially given that the mind of \u2018the perceiver\u2019 would be broken up into sequential, non-communicative pixels of relative relationships not relevant to any iterations of \u2018itself\u2019 in the same way that a flip-book produces the illusion of animation because the pictures are static on different pages. So, if you want to do something profound, play with one of these things and ask if any arguments of any kind follow - given that \u2018following\u2019 requires time. Is anything actually moving? How would you know? What are \u2018you\u2019. Note the plural?  Like tears in rain. It is raining, isn\u2019t it? ",
