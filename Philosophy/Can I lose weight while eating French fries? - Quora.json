            "answer_text": "Technically, it\u2019s possible, but you would have to be able to calculate your daily calorie needs, and ensure that the calories you consume for the day are less than the calories you will burn. Let\u2019s say I require 2000 calories per day and I want to lose 1 pound per week. I\u2019d need to eat 500 calories less than what I need for the day every day of this weight loss journey. That\u2019s only 1500 calories I get to eat per day. A medium sized fry at McDonald\u2019s (U.S.A. medium) is about 350 calories. I can eat that batch of fries and have 1150 calories for the rest of the food I eat that day. When people want to lose weight, they typically avoid foods like this because it\u2019s easy to overeat and you won\u2019t feel completely satisfied afterwards. If you want to avoid overeating after the fries, you can add a protein (chicken or tofu). So, eat a little protein when you\u2019re done and boom\u2014 you\u2019ve had your fries and now you feel satisfied until the next meal. So, yes. You can totally have fries and lose weight, just keep in mind that you\u2019ll want to eat protein with it. I don\u2019t recommend a burger or something like that for two reasons: the fries are already providing lots of carbs and fat. You just need to balance it with lean protein (like chicken breast, turkey, or lean beef). (Here\u2019s a BMR calculator BMR Calculator. After you calculate your BMR you can go here to determine your daily calorie needs: Harris Benedict Equation.) ",

            "answer_text": "Choose the right time during reducing weight, appropriately eat French fries are ok, but eat French fries long-term to be able to affect the effect that reduces weight necessarily. Fries: 100 grams of calories is 298 calories Most of the chips are carbohydrates, which is equivalent to the daily eating of rice, with twice as many calories as rice. Eating the same amount of chips is equivalent to eating two portions of rice, and the feeling of satiety is the same as rice. If reduce weight in want to eat really, can be in only when a  normal meal, serve as staple food appropriately to eat, in order to reduce the effect to reduce weight. Make the French fries completely as a meal to eat, not only will not lose weight but will also gain weight. I recommend natural weight loss and use weight loss beauty machine for losing weight, the result will be better and fast ",
