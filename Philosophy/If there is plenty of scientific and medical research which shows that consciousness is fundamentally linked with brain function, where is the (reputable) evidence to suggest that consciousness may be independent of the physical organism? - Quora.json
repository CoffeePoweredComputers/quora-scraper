            "answer_text": "If there is plenty of scientific and medical research which shows that consciousness is fundamentally linked with brain function, where is the (reputable) evidence to suggest that consciousness may be independent of the physical organism? Language is your enemy here. \u201cConsciousness\u201d has been described as a \u201cbasket term\u201d and an \u201cumbrella term\u201d because it is used by different people to refer to different things. There certainly is plenty of empirical evidence to show that consciousness is a brain function, provided that you stipulate a definition of consciousness that is consistent with a brain function. But all of that omits a use of the word to which Leibniz alluded in his analogy of the mill, and which has been a preoccupation of philosophers ever since because it is entirely non-empirical and so scientifically intractable. Thomas Nagel described it as the \u201cwhat it is like to be [me].\u201d Given that no scientific account can (even in principle) be given of consciousness on this use of the word, it is not possible to find empirical evidence for any hypotheses concerning the relationship between consciousness and the physical organism. There are only opinions and prejudices. The most intellectually honest course of action would be to lay all of these hypotheses on the table, investigate the problems they bring with them (since they all have problems), and refuse to reject or subscribe to any of them. The result of this course of action is that one has to acknowledge that some of these hypotheses are prejudicially rejected by many people, and really should remain on the table. This becomes a battle against the prejudices held by others, and it is never an easy task to convince people of their prejudices. They are inclined to defend their prejudices as they would their own children, right or wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "I will give you overwhelming evidence that consciousness is independent of the physical body. Here it is: I can say with a straight face and in all honesty and integrity that My Guru Mata Amratanandamayi Devi died by an act of Her own will and remained dead for 8 hours and then resurrected after 8 hours. There are eye witnesses to this great event living today in Her Ashram in Amritapuri, Kollam, Kerala. This is how it all happened. She was born to a family of fisher folks in Parayakadavu, Kollam District, Kerala, India. This is a small village in a small island that stretches about 14 KM in length and just about 300 yards in width. Unlike normal children, She did not cry at birth. She was nearly blue in complexion when She was born. She sat up in just about a few months and started walking around 6 months. She was seen meditating as a toddler. She would sing and dance in the name of God as a child. In simple terms, She is Divine. But being simple fisher folks Her parents did not understand Her. Her father in particular and Her oldest brother were dead set against Her for Her unusual practices. She started giving Darshan to men and women even as a teenager. Her Darshan meant hugging and kissing people with a motherly affection. This was unbearable for both Her father and older brother and one day while She was thus giving Darshan to men and women, Her father in a rage of anger prayed to God to please take away this weird child of his and give him a normal child as would befit a fisher folks family. Instantly Mata dropped dead. Her father did not expect this the least bit. He started moaning and crying to God to forgive him for his mistake and please resurrect his daughter. But it was too late. Mata remained dead for 8 hours. All the rituals associated with death were performed while Her father was ranting and raving. After 8 hours Mata Amritanandamayi Devi resurrected and She continues to give Darshan to millions and millions of people. By the Ashram\u2019s official estimate, She could have hugged 38 million people as of 3rd July, 2020. Mata Amritanandamyi Devi fully endorses Advaita Vedanta. There cannot be a better authority than Her. Indeed She knows what happens after death. If this is not incredible evidence then there can\u2019t be a better one. ",

            "answer_text": "Currently, the term consciousness means \u201cthe state of being characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, and thought\u201d. This definition is not formal and quantitative. Compare this type of definition with pre-Newton definitions of the terms Force and Energy. Newton gave laws of motion and gave formal definitions of the terms Force and Energy. Someone in future might develop laws of conscious actions and give a formal definition of the term consciousness, According to my current conjectural understanding, consciousness is a set of connections between various nodes in a physical organism. There is no distinct node that can be identified as consciousness.  Let us say that the physical organism consists of Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4. In the absence of consciousness, these nodes are disjoint, without any active connections between them. In the presence of consciousness, these nodes are interconnected, with active connections between them. Thus, consciousness is a set of these connections between the nodes of the physical organism.

            "answer_text": "There is little or no evidence, nor any fundamental understanding, regarding the nature of consciousness. Yes, it appears to be linked with brain function, but that is currently the only way of even beginning to study it. I am not sure what evidence you would regard as \u201creputable,\u201d but the phenomenon of the Near Death Experiences seems to provide the most direct answer. People who experience death in clinical situations not only describe aspects of the environment that they should be unable to access but also entry into higher levels of existence from which they are sent back, sometimes following a detailed discussion with entities on the other side. So they were conscious of something, whether or not you accept the truth of what they say, despite being technically brain dead. So who, or what, is conscious when their brains are totally inactive? That certainly shows that consciousness may, under some circumstances, operate independently of the physical organism. ",

            "answer_text": "There is probably no proof at all. The problem is that there nobody knows how consciousness exactly from from matter, chemical reactions, moving ions and electrons, firing neurons inside the brain. There is of course nothing else there one can say, it must \u201cemerge\u201d . But there is no good theory how that normally always mindless matter can bridge that gap and so there are so many ideas. In panpsychism, something like protoconsciousness is already there all along, like a fundamental property of matter like mass that is only well observable under certain conditions like in a brain. So somehow consciousness then still has to emerge from those tiny bits of protoconsciousness (= the combination problem) but the mechanism seems at least one step easier. I am no pro in this field but I answer because I think about this problem since childhood and I damaged a friendship during a discussion about this which I regret deeply. ",
