            "answer_text": "The 7-layer model of reality has been around a long time. The layers are sometimes referred to as planes, kingdoms and dimensions. They are often related to the seven chakras of the body. Typically, they are: Plane 1 - Mineral KingdomPlane 2 - Plant KingdomPlane 3 - Animal Kingdom (includes the human animal)Plane 4 - Astro (near-physical, perhaps the Psi Field)Plane 5 - Mental Plane 6 - SoulPlane 7 - God In the Implicit Cosmology I study, the layercake model is replaced with fields. In that, the physical universe, which represents the first three planes is considered the physical aspect of reality. Source, which would be the God Plane, represents the reality field and the source of organizing principles. Those are based on a collective understanding of the nature of Source. Source is not a Dive figure, but the intelligent core of reality. Immortal personality is in three parts. One is the core intelligence of an individual life field. A second is the perceptual/expression processes informed by Worldview. The third is conscious self as the \u201cI think I am this\u201d experiencer of Immortal Self. As can be seen in the diagram below from Your Immortal Self, the reality is a conceptual place. Our ability to experience aspects of it is limited by our ability to conceive of that aspect\u2019s character. To answer your question, the 7 densities of consciousness are an old cosmology based on the assumption that a person is in the body looking out. As the ancients understood, we know now that our human is just our avatar for this lifetime.  Below are two diagrams from the Handbook of Metaphysics that show how different systems of thought use the concept. The first is a composite of cosmologies. The second is based on the Cabala.   ",
