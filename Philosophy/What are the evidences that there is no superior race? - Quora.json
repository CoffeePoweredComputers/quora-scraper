            "answer_text": "Not so much \u201cevidences\u201d [sic] as simple logic. First, \u201crace\u201d does not exist as a scientific term. It is an UNscientific way for humans to try to fit everything and everybody into categories, preferably airtight, because that\u2019s how the human mind tends to work. So we grab on certain visible aspects of people, e.g., skin color, and concoct mythologies as to how they are somehow proof of general tendencies that we can group together and treat as if they were real. Which they are not. Second, \u201csuperior\u201d is an entirely subjective term, unless specified. Even if there were \u201craces\u201d - which there are not - one might be \u201csuperior\u201d on the average in running fast, but another might make music that I find more pleasing. One might be able - on the average - to solve mathematical problems, but another might prove far more adept at tracking deer through the forest. So which is \u201csuperior\u201d? Finally, you have reversed the burden of proof. You start with the assumption that there IS a \u201csuperior race\u201d and demand from us \u201cevidences\u201d to disprove it. But since you have not established that races exist, nor explained what you mean by \u201csuperior\u201d and how you would measure this \u201csuperiority\u201d objectively, your demand is empty. And very probably racist. ",

            "answer_text": "Line dancing. Moving on. Well, it\u2019s not evidence per se, but the ample evidence we should all have if we are wordly and have known a variety of people of diverse backgrounds is that an individual person can be highly intelligent, or very much the opposite, regardless of \u2018race\u2019. A person can be a gifted athlete, or very much the opposite, despite what \u2018race\u2019 they belong to. This is certainly true of moral and immoral behavior as well. So even if removing all cultural bias and disadvantages of background, if individuals of one broad racial background had an average IQ score (which can be a poor determinant of achievement in other areas anyway) a little higher than another or all other group\u2019s averages, it should not make any difference in how you treat or prejudge an INDIVIDUAL person.
