            "answer_text": "There's some disagreement today as to the scope of \"speculative fiction.\" Historically, it identified works of \"science fiction\", a genre whose remit has remained fairly consistent. But it's frequently used now to describe fiction that fails to fall within a number of more canonical genres, so exactly which works are grouped as \"speculative fiction\" usually depends on what other genres are presented as more logical alternatives (for example \"fantasy\", \"horror\", \"magic realism\", etc.) It also doesn't help that \"science fiction\" and \"speculative fiction\" are often both abbreviated \"SF\", so it's not always even clear which distinction we're trying to make! In the general case, I wouldn't call surrealism a \"speculative fiction\" genre, because surrealism is a genre in its own right, which predated \"speculative fiction\", and which encompasses the arts in general -- not just fiction. But if we don't permit ourselves \"surrealist fiction\" as a distinct literary category, then yes, it's fair to group such works within the genre \"speculative fiction.\" ",
