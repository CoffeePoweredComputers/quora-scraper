            "answer_text": "Actuality and potentiality are two rather large variables that set the fundamentals of our reality. If we were to imagine reality as our imagination interacting with a landscape of possibility, the landscape of possibility would be actuality. Then using our imagination, we can imagine how the current landscape would change under different events. The morphed landscape would be potentiality. Potentiality, or the possible future landscape, is a big, if not the biggest, variable we consider when regarding our present options for decision making. So this is how new physical laws are formed. Take the present landscape, set it under an imagined condition, press play and see what unfolds. If the idea is consistent and holds true, we have a new physical law. If you are deciding between going to Walmart or target, you will consider a bunch of variables. Lets say Walmart is closer and therefore would require less time to get what you need. You imagine the future in which you save time going to Walmart and therefore can resume our regular activities faster. This is an example of your imagination interacting with actuality, regarding potentiality, then deciding what present option to select. So in short, actuality and potentiality are fundamentals aspects to our reality and how we make decisions. Here is another interesting idea: using the potential of our future selves to bargain with our present selves in order to make our present selves choose some sort desired action. This is typically applied to when we try improve ourselves. ",
