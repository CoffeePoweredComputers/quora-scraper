            "answer_text": "I'm currently working as a Computer Science Intern, and we do a lot of researches about online coding websites. There are a lot of sites that provide great online coding classes for kids. But especially focusing on coding, there isn't a single one apart from WhiteHat Jr. I have done a lot of research on WhiteHat Jr, as one of my cousins was curious to join some online coding classes, during this pandemic. When I was asked to help him, I felt I should give all my research abilities a test and help him. At the same time, I even thought inclination towards this field will definitely help him after and during this ongoing situation. As per my point of view, WhiteHat Jr is genuine and purely sticking to its commitments. The testimonial I read about WhiteHat Jr on their website, Facebook Page, Instagram, etc. are all genuine. Working at Facebook has a little perk that I was able to contact the kid's parents. The kid is currently learning to code at WhiteHat Jr. To my astonishment, I was impressed with the review as well as the apps that a kid of mere age 9 created. When I talked with her ( Navya Jha ), she said \"Before I fell in love with the word 'WhiteHatJr', little did I know it would provide me the master key to code. Though I knew computers for a long time WhiteHat Jr helped me to know it's soul through engaging experiments\". She was really happy and was always looking forward to her classes. The classes are 1:1 between the student and teacher, thus, the child doesn't get conscious, the doubts get cleared as well as the clarity in teaching. After the phone call ended, I did a little more research and got to know that they even provide demo classes, to help you decide whether to enroll or not. WhiteHat Jr has divided the curriculum into 5 parts which are suitable for each age group- Beginners (Grade-1), Intermediate (Grade 2-3), Advance (4-6), Professional (Grade 7-9) and Applied Tech (Grade 10-12+). Thus, according to me, it's a great website and a must-try. I hope with my answer I was able to help you. ",

            "answer_text": "If scam had a synonym it would be white hat jr. The company which claims to provide coding classes to children by telling fancy shit. My cousin who got obsessed with computer found this shit on well everywhere . Maybe he is excited to get a job like white hat jr wolf gupta or maybe he got bored from firecrackers so this Diwali he decided to burn money and that is where white hat jr comes into play. Basically it is a new scam pulled by byjus after all you gotta recover some money after an all out cash deal which went into buying white hat jr.  I think they are waiting wolf gupta to be old enough to buy white hat jr and it is a acquisition which was taken to make profit in long run. So this app forces you to buy classes which are ridiculously expensive and Coursera and udemy even you tube has better content than it . It is a joke and is a pathetic copy of scratch an application developed by MIT which by the way is free to download. Or you could go to Learn computer science. Change the world. which offers an awesome experience . White hat jr is just a tool by byjus to lure gullible parents into their trap by making tall claims.  Looking at their advertisement which tells way more about their teacher selection criteria. Who wouldn't want such a cushy job ? And their certificate basically has probably the same value as a printed paper which is 20 inr tops. Look I am just being honest here coding requires a certain amount of practice and all white hat provides is basic knowledge and certain templates which you could find for free on you tube. I found it shocking that platforms like white hat are getting this much attention whereas real heroes like khan academy and Coursera are not getting its share due to cheap marketing gimmicks which are employed by certain overvalued edtech companies. White hat jr is overvalued like it's parent company byjus and it is not worth it. My advice is to burn your money like joker in dark knight than buying this course . ",

What are definitely fake, are the sales people trying to con you. This is the reason I did not pursue this company, rather joined a rival and both me & my child are very happy. Things the sales representative hid or did not inform for me to take a informed decision: Spoke for good 4\u20135 hours repeating the same things, omitted to mention rivals when asked.Kept pushing for the 200 hour course since that includes some trip to nasa or something, obviously thats the most expensive one.When I was about to give credit card details, I happened to ask how long will we have to finish the course, did he reluctantly inform the course needs to be finished in 1 year.That works out to minimum of 4 hours per week, which I guess for a 7 year old sounds, I don't know, a little bit too much.Kept selling \u201crobotics\u201d \u201cnasa\u201d \u201camazon\u201d as if any of those things will permeate throught to a 7 year old.In conclusion, I found this company extremely untrustworthy, for us this did not make sense. The rival, has coding packages according to age, this is working out since my child can have a introductory course, as well as only once a week to start, and take a specific course for scratch since for his age, this level of difficulty is enough, rather than \u201crobotics\u201d etc. LoL.

            "answer_text": "Short answer to your question \u2013 WhiteHat Jr. is legit. Genuine. Definitely not fake. This is actually a funny question for me because just like you, I was doubtful at first. So I\u2019m that kind of person who would look for free stuff on the Internet all the time since as many of us know, there\u2019s almost always a free version of something. I wasn\u2019t too keen on using WhiteHat Jr. for my kids even after the free trial sessions because I\u2019m just too frugal. So I looked up coding lessons on YouTube because learning through video is easier and more entertaining especially for the youngsters. Long story short \u2013 those free stuff just didn\u2019t work for my kids. Maybe for us adults, we\u2019d be more patient in looking for the right information we can use and the best places online to learn stuff. But with kids, it\u2019s really different. My kids would either get bored or complain that an hour-long video they just watched on YouTube ended up useless. There\u2019s also no way for them to ask follow up questions when they\u2019re just watching a video so they end up asking me and I seriously know nothing about coding. But since I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m a supportive parent especially since my kids expressed their interest in something that both of them like at the same time, and something that\u2019s probably useful for their future careers, I went ahead and bought them a course at WhiteHat Jr. Since it isn\u2019t exactly cheap, I did my research and compared it with other platforms, but it seemed like WhiteHat Jr. was truly the best option for my future coders!

I have experienced as WhiteHat Jr is a genuine platform but newcomers can have a check if it is fake or not at different steps like through checking the reviews, getting a demo sessions, history and studying refund terms and conditions very carefully. They have given you full liberty that if in any case, you felt that they are not delivering what they mean then parents can step back any time. They believe individualized teaching keep kids engaged better than teaching in groups as here teachers can look after kids with more focus which is not possible in group teaching. This will lead kids to learn logic, sequencing, structure, algorithmic thinking and creative expression which vest kids with measurable levels of improvement. Most influential highlights like 1:1 Live Video classes by sitting at home under surveillance of parents, Expert Teachers, 3 Classes/Week Recommended, flexible timings etc. can designate this platform as most suited for kids where at this early age they can view themselves as the builders of future, creators of games, apps and videos than consumers. It's common to handover books to kids and make them cram thoroughly but is it sufficient for their overall development obviously not limited knowledge, limit your area of thinking and experimenting, therefore, let your kids look out of the books and become visionaries, entrepreneurs and artists of the future. I am happy with a change in my thoughts which are different from the league to bring a positive change in my kids. ",

Few days back I also was in the same doubt if it is trusty worthy or not for my child. My family is from a background where no one knows what coding is ,so it was extremely difficult for me to give hands on something which we really don\u2019t know. So I thought to search on internet what people said about it .There were many good things ,but then too I was not so sure about Whitehat Jr. . So I thought of calling the customer service ,and they explained me the whole process properly ,which gave me a positive feeling to give a try to their demo lecture for my child.

            "answer_text": "When it comes to teaching coding to toddlers, its quite a task to convince the parents who are under the false impression that coding is something quite high-tech and the kids who are still stuck at basic arithmetic won\u2019t be able to cope up with it. This is where WhiteHat Jr. comes into play. My Nephew got enrolled at WhiteHat Jr. around 6-7 months back and after witnessing the tremendous amount of growth in him, I\u2019m sharing the experience my family had with WhiteHat Jr. As the world was shifting towards online classes and quarantine because of the pandemic, we were searching for a new hobby to keep him occupied at home. We came to know about WhiteHat Jr. through an Advertisement. The major part that intrigued us about this E-learning corporation was the part about teaching toddlers something that is generally taught to Grad students. We immediately booked a no-charge demo class and it was worth the time. The tutor had a one-to-one normal conversation with my nephew and then judging on the conversation, suggested the course which would be the best for him. He even explained it to us why he was referring this particular course and then shared every detail about the same to clear our doubts. My nephew then started with his one-to-one sessions and weekly assignments mixed with innovative badges and beautiful hats which made him enjoy the task even more. After around 7 months of learning with them, my nephew has shown a significant amount of increase in his creative skills as well as in his confidence. He got so indulged in these classes and assignments that he wants to take this as a career in the near future. The way WhiteHat Jr. started with basic commands like drag and drop the code or insert a picture really got the kids hooked onto what a simple line of code could do. He enjoys the weekly assignments so much that he ends up doing them in his free time now. With the whole world shifting towards technology, WhiteHat Jr. is making sure that the younger generation is well prepared to make the most out of it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Whitehat Jr. is an online coding learning platform for the kid that can help your kid to make a vision of learning programming, AI, Space-Tech, and other kinds of stuff. This platform is beneficial for me, and I haven't seen anything wrong. My kid attended both Beginner and Intermediate curriculums and completed with high motivation for further studies without harming his regular classwork. I saw some videos from the YouTube channel, read success stories, and went through the reviews on Facebook Page to know about Whitehat Jr. I was satisfied and directly enrolled for the Beginner curriculum. When Hridam (my son) started his 1st module of the Beginner course, I was worried because he was only seven years old. On the very first day, Hridam's instructor discussed some interesting things about computers, and Hridam tried to learn how to interact with computers though he was already familiar with those. In the first module, they did lots of exercises to learn commands, sequences, and understanding of algorithms. At the end of the module, Hridam started writing some simple programs. His instructor was friendly and well trained. She also suggested that I enroll in the Intermediate as soon as possible. One month later, Hridam started his Intermediate coding course and completed it in January, 2020. I got all the services as they promised. I regularly received messages and emails from Whitehat Jr. and took reviews and suggestions from me after completing each module of the Beginner and Intermediate curriculums. So, if your kid is curious and you want to build the career of your kid in the tech sector, then Whitehat Jr. can help your child be a tech expert and a creator of tomorrow. You can book a free trial class with them to know more. ",

            "answer_text": "To all those who are praising WhiteHat Jr. There are IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi computer science graduates who land a fresher job in Google with a package that is not even 1 Cr most of the times. And here there is an ad of an online enterprise that assures that a kid can earn 150 cr from google just by making some apps and websites. Any sane person wouldn't believe whatever WhiteHat Jr. is serving to indian parents. The next point being, even if you are remotely technical you might know that google, facebook and all these big IT gaints have a well defined recruitment process that tests your knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithmic questions. They almost never test your knowledge about an technology/framework to make an app/website. In short, white hat Jr. is teaching kids to integrate components and create an app that's all, which certainly is NOT CODING. Coding involves logical thinking and problem solving abilities and not knowledge of React Native or Flutter. White Hat Jr. is teaching kids technologies that are most probably going to be obselete by the time these kids get ready for a real job. As an example, java and .NET were pretty famous around 2013\u201314 now everyone is crazy about JavaScript Frameworks and Cloud Technologies. And yes please don't put the argument that this helps the kids in logical reasoning. Knowledge of making a simple app just by following instructions of some mentor isn't logical reasoning. And if so, why not make these kids compete on Codeforces or Topcoder against 7 year old Russian kids would be doing algorithmic problems, who are of course better than Indian kids. And yaa recently saw an advertisement for White Hat Jr. saying teachers required but coding skills are not necessary. That pretty much sums it up, the startup shows the teachers what steps they need to follow to make an app and the teacher intern shows it to students thus finally satisfying brown parent's hunger of \u201cmera beta sharma ji ke bete se better hai\u201d. PS : Agar Chintu 150 cr kama sakta hai to uska teacher 30k kyu kamata hai?? ",

            "answer_text": "These days so many online and offline platforms are introduced to create the world\u2019s next big tech platform. Since so many years coding was taught to kids as a professional program or course during high secondary education or at degree level but a new analysis of experts have shown that it is more beneficial to teach coding to kids at somewhere between the age of 6-14 years when creativity is elevating towards its peak. As parents, I am amazed at how come coding can be taught to kids when they are so small and not able to understand typical concepts of coding. It normally feels like breaking hard nuts whenever to involve them in school studies then will it be genuine to give them one more task to learn coding along with studies. When I interact with WhiteHat Jr. one amongst best online platforms, I found that they are emphasizing that learning to code will really be beneficial for kids with future concerns and also for their mental and physical development. But I was not able to understand their concern and concepts. But after thorough search and analysis of their conceptually and strategically designed curriculum and platform of teaching coding to kids so early, I found that they have very meticulously planned and implemented their idea to teach code as per different age groups to make it convenient for them to learn concepts and algorithms. IT Firms and groups are serving a future perspective to make them ready to create the next big tech platform. These platforms have designed something different by which kids will not feel like learning long chapters or watching hours videos to understand coding rather they have transformed old and dull concepts to learn coding in a fun, interesting, and interactive way. I literally found that these platforms are making positive efforts for future concerns of kids. ",

            "answer_text": "Coding to young toddlers is more often than not something most parents are a bit bothered about. They have this false impression that it will put too much of a burden on the small shoulders of their little kids. They usually confuse coding with some high-end coding language and how difficult it would be for the kid who is still stuck arithmetic mathematics. This is where WhiteHat Jr. comes into play. My brother got enrolled at WhiteHat Jr. around 3 months back and after witnessing the tremendous amount of growth in him, I\u2019m sharing the experience my family had with WhiteHat Jr. Since the pandemic was on the rise and the world was shifting towards a culture of social distancing as well online learning, we were searching for a new hobby or class to keep the 11-year old occupied. We came to know about WhiteHat Jr. through an acquaintance. The major part that intrigued us about the E-learning corporation was the part about teaching toddlers something that is generally taught to Grad students. We immediately booked a no-charge demo class and it was worth the time. The tutor had a one-to-one normal conversation with my brother and then judging on the conversation, suggested the course which would be the best for him. He even explained it to us why he was referring this particular course and then shared every detail about the same to clear our doubts. My brother then started with his one-to-one sessions and weekly assignments mixed with innovative badges and beautiful hats which made him enjoy the task even more. After 3 months of learning with them, I can see how much my brothers\u2019 creativity has increased and the confidence he has gained. He loves it so much that he is planning to take it up as a career and we believe starting at such an early age is definitely going to give him an edge over others. Instead of starting with high-tech coding languages, they taught him basic commands which were just drag and drop the code or a code to insert the picture or basic commands like these. These initial commands were just to spark the interest of coding in him and to make him more intrigued about the advanced versions. With the whole world shifting towards technology, WhiteHat Jr. is making sure that the younger generation is well prepared to make the most out of it.  ",

Working at Facebook has a little perk that I was able to contact the kid's parents. The kid is currently learning to code at WhiteHat Jr. To my astonishment, I was impressed with the review as well as the apps that a kid of mere age 9 created.  The teaching approach and adopted by WhiteHat Jr. makes their program different from all other websites that offer online classes or material on coding for kids and beginners.

            "answer_text": "Hello there! I am surprised by your question. I would like to elaborate more Coding and then I\u2019ll circle back to your question. How many of you have taken computer programming or Coding? I guess only a handful of them know to code. If you think you can\u2019t code, it\u2019s because you just haven\u2019t tried yet. Henry Ford said \u201cWhether you think you can or think you can\u2019t, you are Right\u201d You can start learning code from now on. You might think, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like or what if I\u2019m not good at it. No, never. Everything becomes possible if you start learning to code. Bryson Payne, a professor of computer science, said \u201cCoding is not the Goal. Coding is the Gateway. Why do we learn the subjects Maths, Science, English, Social, and so on? We are learning English, not to become just authors, but we learn it for communication. In the same way, we learn Math, not to become an accountant, but it helps solve problems, manage our financial property, and think logically. People who learn to code can become entrepreneurs, and innovators, who connect people in new ways using new platforms. Experts say as many as the job could disappear over the next 10 years due to optimization. But on the other hand, many new jobs are going to emerge with good-paying technology jobs. Do you want to become the survival of the fittest? Learn Coding which prevents illiteracy and unemployment. As Coding is the backbone of our modern technology, kids are the supporting pillars of our developing country. Kids love technology than they love their subjects in school. They love sitting in tabs, mobiles, and laptops for hours than they use it for their curriculum. If you trust your kids, empower them with coding skills. You can create wide opportunities for your kids. This would make you design games rather than sit back playing in PC. They can grasp concepts rapidly and it also increases their problem-solving capability. Now, circling back to your question. WhiteHat Jr. is a genuine and legitimate edtech. They are not fake. Experts from various professions have honored them for their innumerable efforts for inculcating creators and passionate learners from such a tender age. They have proved it.

They are Mission-Driven and not Money- Driven. The best example to highlight that they are not money-driven is, they are providing online classes which are completely free. Try out their free trial class and you\u2019ll get impressed. This edtech\u2019 s main idea is to mold creators, making them rule over the future tech world, rather than just consumers of technology.

Thinking this way, every company tries to impress their customers and no one would want to go against the flow. whitehat jr. is new to the market, but it is emerging to be one of the best EDtech platforms. It was bought by Byjus and has received backing from owl ventures and this in itself proves that whitehat jr. is indeed trustworthy. I think whitehat jr. is best because it is new to the market due to which it will care more about customer satisfaction. Unlike other Edtech platforms, whitehat jr. only focuses on offering coding courses to kids which can be one of the reasons behind its dynamic management. There are 7000 registered teachers, 2,500,000 registered students across the globe and 1,630,000 classes taken. These figures cannot be achieved by a random fake company. Whitehat jr. connects your child with active learners all over the globe. There are best teachers appointed through the 5 step selection process to ensure quality and joyful learning. Kids can learn the fundamentals of coding- logic, structure sequence and algorithmic thinking to develop creative products like animations and apps. They cover content like an introduction to coding along with animations and storytelling for the beginners i.e, from grade 1 to grade 2, so the kid could develop an interest in it and have playful learning. There is basic development, basic app development, UI/UX design, for the lower intermediate level for the kids from grade 4-6. For kids from grade 7-9, courses include python programming, data visualization, space tech data analysis, AI & Machine learning and API development. The difficulty level gets higher with the increasing grade levels. Kids in grade 10 and above can learn Python programming, data processing and visualization, a data structure with python, object-oriented programming, machine learning regression and hierarchical clustering. All the Edtech platforms with similar objectives have their different course structure, I recommend you visiting different websites and decide the best for you because the market is formed by the customers and is only for customers. The contact details are also provided on such websites, you can contact them and ask your doubts yourself. I hope this answer helped you. Happy search. ",

They spent so much money on advertising that they are slowly trying to fit themselves into our minds and are looking to influence us! You have seen their advertisements , from TV to YouTube they are everywhere\u2026 they promise to give world-class coding knowledge and any 6-year old child can make an app right? This is how they recruit their teachers :  Their advertisements are also fake , which business will invest in an app which teaches you drag and drop coding system? They hire teachers who have 0 coding experience.. now does that mean your app will get investors if you have learned coding from someone who themselves don't know coding? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 They are also comparing children aged 6 years with Elon Musk , Bill Gates , Sundar Pichai and it's all just a money-making business at the end of the day!  They do such false marketing by saying that coding is the future and this is the only thing that will help the children grow , they don't even care about anything else!  In short words\u2026 It's just another well planned scam which has pure intensions of just making money.. it takes so much dedication and knowledge to teach children and here they are hiring teachers who have no idea in coding! ~Shreyas Sahoo\u270d\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Well, WhiteHat Jr. is by far one of the most efficient providers of the needed knowledge in the field of coding. I got to know about WhiteHat Jr. through their advertisements around the time I was searching for websites that provided the services of teaching coding to young children. Me and my sister decided to enroll my niece into WhiteHat Jr. after taking a demo class provided by them. After taking a demo class we got a better idea about the teaching pattern of WhiteHat Jr. Well, while we were reading previews about WhiteHat Jr. , most of them spoke very highly of WhiteHat Jr. but I came across some negative views too that WhiteHat Jr. is a fake company and they are too ahead of the times and are endorsing child labor by teaching coding to young children etc. . These reviews made me doubt their capability and services. So, I started paying close attention to what was being taught to my niece. Well after observing their way of teaching I never found the company to be fake or promoters of child labor. They have been providing the best teaching in the field of coding and have surely made it a child\u2019s play. Being a computer programmer myself I do realize the importance of coding and I support WhiteHat Jr. in their mission of introducing children to the world of coding as the future to will be more advanced and AI driven and by introducing children to coding we are definitely making them ready to be the leaders of the AI driven world where many jobs will be taken down by AI. The way WhiteHat Jr. has been working towards this mission has impressed me. My niece is so happy with her course. It's like someone has given wings to her imagination. WhiteHat Jr\u2019s curriculum keeps the students interested and induces a spirit of learning more and inspires the children to create marvels out of their young minds. They have a 1:1 online live teaching session where one can interact with the teacher freely. My niece has started bringing new and fresh ideas to me and we have a good discussion about her ideas , seeing her develop her analytical thinking at such a young age renders me speechless each and every time. Seeing my niece learning new concepts and developing skills like algorithmic thinking and logical thinking I would say that WhiteHat Jr. is not a fake site at all and people who are apprehensive about their working should try them once just like we did.

The review is an honest opinion on WhiteHat based on the Trail class my nephew attended two months back. Two Months Later I stand by what I have written below. My nephew continues to enjoy using WhiteHat Jr and the classes. In fact she looks forward to attend these sessions. There have been occasions she has found the course tough and in that cases, we have sought the teachers help. Advice for Parents I often read in the comments about the marketing strategy of WhiteHat. I guess it\u2019s fair to say that every organisation has the right to market their product they want to unless they are misleading. My recommendation is to check if your kid is showing interest in the trail class and whether you liked how the format looks. Don\u2019t expect your kid to make any money or your kid to become a coding wizard. Coding takes time and this is the first step. Keep your expectations real. What is White Hat Jr 1. They are an Online learning platform that give 1:1 classes to kids. 2. They have 3 different type of courses that you can sign for. One for 1 class which can ignored, other is for 48 classes and the the last one is for 144 classes. 3. The course fee is based on per class. 48 classes courses , 144 classes . They conduct these classes on their own Coding platform which, so far ,my nephew has absolutely loved ",

Most of my relatives and even my own parents don\u2019t actually understand my profession. All they know is I build applications and websites for the company I work for. So when it comes to coding for kids, everyone thinks that it is next to impossible. How can a kid aged between 6 to 14 years do coding when they are struggling to understand subject like Maths. But let me tell you that coding is not a rocket science. It is an acquired skill and anyone who is dedicated enough to practice only for an hour a day can write code and build amazing apps and games for them and for others. Whitehat jr has a positive vision to teach coding to kids aged between 6 to 14 years of age.

            "answer_text": "I have gone through many coding websites in order to scout the best programs for the age group of 7-10 for my niece. While going through these websites I realized that not many are able to deliver the required knowledge that is actually needed. I came across WhiteHatJr. I found no curriculum as efficient as theirs. WhiteHatJr\u2019s curriculum is well-curated; they have implemented outstanding strategies in order to make the journey of learning to code for the blossoming young minds interesting and fun.  They have systematically organized the programs into the following categories: Beginner for class 1 Intermediate for classes 2-3 Advanced for classes 4-6 Professional for classes 7-9 Applied Tech for class 10 and above These divisions again have sub-categories that are bifurcated according to the level of advancement as per the interest of the student. WhiteHatJr., efficiently teaches the fundamentals of coding--logic, structure, sequence, and algorithmic thinking and equips kids with the right tools to generate creative outcomes. It helps the kids in developing their intellect at such a young age by edifying their reasoning ability and logical and algorithmic thinking. The education structure of WhiteHatJr. Keeps the students intrigued, inquisitive, and innovative with its rewarding trends and various interesting challenges like The Silicon Valley Challenge where the students get a chance to visit The Silicon Valley if they complete the challenge.

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr. is real. I\u2019ve personally experienced their work through the enrolment of my child. For my child, WhiteHat Jr. has worked wonders. He is really enjoying doing his projects and learning about coding with deep interest. To give you some ideas and context: WhiteHat Jr. has a comprehensive coursework curriculum. Sectioned into Beginner, Advanced, Intermediate, Professional and Applied Tech. The difficulty is based on the skill sets and age group of the student. The platform is exceptionally interactive. Starting from interactive lessons such as projects, games building and animations to personalized 1 on 1 lessons. I believe the variety of contents they offer enables my child to pick what he really enjoys and can grow on. The teachers are also very skilled and professional. From the very first class, it was evident that they are skilled and well trained to understand and help kids as young. The standout approach of WhiteHat Jr. that really sold me on their methods is the idea of providing the kids with the right set of tools and knowledge to make them prosper in the coming times of technological booming industries. With more and more institutes and systems going online, and with technology at the core of all future advancements you will notice WhiteHat\u2019s approach is directed to be ahead of the curve and prepare the kids for the same. Another aspect that I\u2019ve noticed only after my child was enrolled was his increase in social confidence and better school performance. You should avail their free trial to see if it suits your child\u2019s needs. Here are some good reads if you want to find out more from other parents and students who share similar experiences to mine.

            "answer_text": "Parents commence preparation for the future of their kids since when kids are at the age of 5-6 years.  As a mother of two kids, I believe that since from their childhood we keep on thinking that someday they will become doctors, engineers, scientists, businessmen, etc. I know that this is not a one-day project it\u2019s an investment of time, money, efforts, guidance, support for whole 16-17 years. We, parents want to keep them engage in activities which can develop their multi-tasking skills where they learn to break down a complex problem into simpler smaller problems, use abstractions to think about the problems, design algorithms to solve the problem and identify patterns within the problem in this highly evolving field of technology. By imbibing these skills in kids at a very young age, it will hopefully create the next generation of digital entrepreneurs or high-tech creators who can create apps and digital products that can make the world a great place.   Kids are getting knowledge about all other mandatory subjects at schools as per curriculum but knowledge about coding is getting taught at a limited level. Just to find out something which can help my kids to learn and become more skilled in coding I searched on YouTube while searching for my queries I got a chance to check overwhelming reviews of parents WhiteHat Jr. I was so much influenced by experiences of parents that for clarity I went through WhiteHat Jr. website and had a conversation at their helpdesk. They sort out my all confusion during conversation and ensure that if we will be dissatisfied by the teaching pattern or curriculum at any point then the paid amount will be refunded.   My son and daughter both move ahead with the beginner's program just one week ago and currently learning from scratch a great language and tool.  WhiteHat Jr. is an awesome genuine platform for kids to learn code with an individualized approach and mentors are always on pins and needles. ",

After seeing him spend his hours in vain just playing games on mobile i was very worried until White Hat ad flashed on my facebook and i started the research.  I got him signed up for the premium package with mind boggling features:- Silicon Valley Mentorship Program - Name itself is a clear indication of what`s in store .Yes! You got me right. The top performer gets to win a golden opportunity to visit SiIicon Valley California being an ALL EXPENSE PAID TRIP .CERTIFIED GAME OR APP DEVELOPER- For my brother who is just 7, i could never imagine any certification until he would give his boards in life. But this stunned me as he would be a CERTIFIED GAME/ APP DEVELOPER BY ALUMNI OF GOOGLE & DISCOVERY MR KARAN BAJAJ.1:1 LIVE CODING - Another feather to the cap! Since Faiz is never a person who can learn from recorded sessions, he gets distracted very easily. So getting him to learn coding in INDIA WITH LIVE 1:1 CLASS was a dream come true with WHITE HAT JR.The journey has begun and he is always looking forward to his next session. Its worth it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO PARENTS WHO WANT THIER CHILDREN`S DREAM TO COME TRUE! Regards, Waiza ",

My sister had a crazy interest in coding. She always wanted to learn to code but since there was no such platform in our town where she can extend her skills. During this pandemic, I have gone through many online edtech platforms. And among them, I found WhiteHat Jr much promising. I enrolled my sister under the intermediate curriculum. Now she is much more satisfied as she is in total love with their styles of teaching. Not only this there are few websites she learned to code and have made on her own. Seeing uttermost happiness on my sister's face I am really thankful for WhiteHat Jr for giving her proper guidance. They have an intact curriculum which is divided according to the grades of kids between 6\u201318 years, also well-qualified instructors who make the live session fun and guide the kids to apply their learnings practically. The subject range varies from the data structure, app and game development to machine learning and space technology. Not only this but kids also get excellent knowledge about Artificial Intelligence, data science with Python. As an experienced person of WhiteHat Jr learning\u2019s, I suggest that this is the best platform your kids can have for learning and enriching their coding skills. For further satisfaction of your\u2019s, you can now even book Free Demo Sessions and then avail for the full course. I hope this is helpful for you. Happy coding!! ",

Experiences of parents always support their kids to frame their future. Rather than being a part of the rat race, it\u2019s always been visualized by me for my son to be an all-rounder and stay connected with almost all trending spheres so that when it is the time to finalize about career then he must be able to take right decision. Age group of 6-14 years is the peak point to put on track IQ, logic and skills of kids for bright future. I never thought that I will get something really serious online which will help me to develop interest of my son in coding and logical thinking. Fortunately, I saw an advertisement of Whitehat Jr. on my Facebook account and immediately contacted them for demo session. After getting completely satisfied with all aspects of online teaching and feedback from my son Finally, I opt beginners\u2019 course for him from Whitehat Jr. one week ago.

What better way for our children to understand why and how the technology around them operates than by learning to code and speaking to the technology around them. Whitehatjr. is very much genuine and is one of the best online coding platforms for kids. The curriculum is designed to make them learn real-world tech problems and tackle their solutions. The classes are interactive and interesting so that the child can learn in a fun way without getting bored. Their ultimate goal is to empower the generation to become creators rather than consumers by providing them with the ability to code. Their ability to provide personalised attention to each and every child makes them stand out. Coding helps children to be able to visualize abstract concepts, lets them apply math to real-world situations and makes math fun and creative. Coding is present in many of today\u2019s STEM programs. Hope this helps you realise the authenticity of Whitehatjr. Good day! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I know about WhiteHat Jr and of course, it is genuine. My six-year-old daughter was always interested in coding and I was looking for an online coding platform for her to start learning how to code from scratch as this is the ideal age for a child to do so. In a city like New Delhi, there are so many training centers that teach coding for children for a duration of 30 days. Considering the COVID-19 situation across the world, I wasn\u2019t interested in enrolling her in a training center in the city. I spent about one month searching online coding platforms and after several reviews, conversations with others and the free trial, I was convinced with WhiteHat Jr. They provide five different types of curriculums, namely beginner, intermediate, advanced, professional and applied tech. My daughter has been enrolled in the beginner course, and trust me, she is having a lot of fun and is doing exceedingly well.  Teachers at WhiteHat Jr are very friendly, efficient, and highly qualified individuals who have been trained for this job. The 1:1 live session absolutely enlightens the atmosphere of the class. By the end of a course, your child would have created his/her own mobile application or a game, and would have learnt the basics in coding which will be very helpful for them in the future. Now that WhiteHat Jr has launched their official mobile application, it is very comfortable for my child to attend her class everyday. They have also partnered with Byju\u2019s, who acquired WhiteHat Jr for $300 million. Now, their curriculum will go up a notch higher than before, which is a great thing. WhiteHat Jr is already ready to gear up the youth to be industry ready a few years down the line. ",

            "answer_text": "I can assure you that WhiteHat Jr. is real, as my brother attends their online classes on coding. Before opting for their demo class, we searched for testimonials online and spoke to other people who had tried out their classes. Doing so only brought forth several excellent reviews and recommendations from fellow students and their parents. What appealed to people the most was the one-on-one interaction with expert faculty from IITs and other global institutions, and the ability to get doubts cleared instantaneously. They have a tailor-made curriculum for students, based on their age and existing knowledge of coding and programming. Even the activities are starkly different from what you would see in a textbook-approach; students learn by doing and skills are imparted through interactive activities like game developing, animations, and so on. This syllabus has piqued my interest too, and I find myself wishing I had these opportunities when I was also a student not so long ago. The teaching approach and pedagogy adopted by WhiteHat Jr. makes their program different from all other websites that offer online classes or material on coding for kids and beginners. They strengthen your child\u2019s foundations not only in computer programming and coding, but also mathematical and logical reasoning, creativity and innovation. These are highly-demanded skills in today\u2019s competitive world, and these classes would certainly give your child a headstart when it comes to schoolwork, if not anything else. If this does not convince you, I would highly recommend taking a tour of the website, browsing the internet and reliable news sites for information and user reviews, and signing up your child for a trial session with WhiteHat Jr. You have nothing to lose, and I have a strong feeling you won\u2019t regret it. I hope my answer helps you! ",

As I feel that coding is going to be need of tomorrow then why not to step ahead today for it. Coding is involved in the curriculum at many schools to keep kids in touch with initial concepts of coding into their foundation of education. Coding is not mere a language it helps to develop a competency level of kids for how to think and stay positive even after failures, problem-solving, power of resilience through unraveling the challenging exercises in coding. Learning to code is like learning a new language which will help in way future for them. But on the other hand, my mind is struggling that if I will involve my kids in learning to code so early, it could be awful for them which will not be terrible for their childhood. Just to have more clarification and clearance of doubts that is coding a skill that everyone needs or could find useful I want to have an overview of its positives and negatives. I met with IT experts of my kid's school authorities to discuss with them regarding more engagement of my kids in coding and will it be good for them or not then they guided that we are bound to teach coding to kids as per school curriculum but they are capable enough to learn and practice far more new and latest concept of coding than we think. She recommended me about Whitehat Jr. online platform for learning to code. After a deep study of WhiteHat Jr. website and conversation with the team till now I found it as a genuine platform for kids to learn code. I believe sometimes we underestimate the skills and competencies of our kids. ",

Honestly, It is the concern and doubt that enables us to choose the best and even the company to present themselves in a better way. Similarly, when it comes to WhiteHat Jr. there are many doubts regarding its working as it is a platform which has initiated an out of the box idea of making sure that the children of the present harness the natural creativity and shift their mindset from an early age - from being consumers to creators of technology. As a researcher in the field of programming, I have been observing WhiteHat Jr. since it was founded in 2018 and I am quite surprised to come across how well it is doing in this field. I have come across how the company provides an excellent curriculum specially designed by IIT and MIT alumni for age groups 6-14 years. It allows children to learn to program from teachers who are selected after a 5-step interview and provides you with one to one sessions, and its modules include lessons on algorithmic thinking, fundamentals of logic, sequence structure, and the basics of UI/UX. Eventually, children are encouraged to create an application, which under the guidance of the tutors\u2014also connected via the cloud, so they can work out of remote locations with an internet connection\u2014is further developed. They\u2019ve repeatedly received some incredible feedback from the parents on the quality of their teachers. I firmly believe, as my research and company\u2019s current results brilliantly suggest that WhiteHat Jr. is a company that can be trusted and will definitely emerge as one of the greatest EdTech in the upcoming years.

Recently, my niece Kavya completed her \"Advanced course\" from WhiteHat Jr, and she has an outstanding experience. WhiteHat Jr coding course is an absolutely unique course and kudos to the instructors! Kavya has developed a strong interest in coding after doing the WhiteHat Jr course. Her logical thinking is sharper than before and can now easily relate to structures and algorithms, and wants to create new real-world programs all by herself. It gives students the benefit of learning to code from their home, at their convenience.  So that in itself proves that this is a legit platform, WhiteHat Jr is a genuine platform for your kids to take advantage of learning coding at home at their own pace. Teaching the concepts of coding to the children is not a cup of tea. Only an expert who understands the thought process of a kid, and knows how to simplify the learning can make it possible. There are numerous testimonies online and on social platforms that prove and say that Whitehat jr does it best! Programming learning is a continuous process. Don't expect that a coding course will make your kid a programmer. Lots of practice, problem-solving, and sacrifice makes a programmer. Programming doesn't make your kid Einstein. They don't make them Bill Gates or Mark. For that, they need to learn Business!! ",

            "answer_text": "Coding is a technology that is bringing marvelous changes in this dynamic world. Patterns and curriculum have changed now and have been approaching kids and youth with latest and convenient concepts. The serious and dedicated passage has been followed by coding experts to prepare generation of today to become coding experts of tomorrow. Amongst offline and online platform, I found WhiteHat Jr. an online platform very well equipped with every advanced possible approach to best utilize creativity of kids. I don\u2019t believe that since from the beginning kids were used to grasping all subjects like English, maths, science, etc. in spite it must be an add on slowly to the very minimum education of the kids. Didn\u2019t they handle this change? they do and get familiar with all new stuff very soon. Whitehat Jr. online coding classes are designed genuinely by deep research by experts that at age of 6-14 years kids are at peak of their creativity level then why not to bestow this duration. Obviously, they are not going to become expert programmers or coders after completion of program as they are too young but yes, they can be familiar with it so that at an adult age they must not find it as something strange and new to learn. I myself had a demo session with experts of Whitehat Jr. and find it a genuine and perfect platform for kids to learn coding under supervision of experts where dedicated tutors are assigned for live sessions and guidance of kids. Time is precious and parents indeed expect to opt the best options for their kids which will be fruitful for their career and future. WhiteHat Jr online programs are structured in a way so that they can be customized as per the competence level of kids. ",

            "answer_text": "Being an IT engineer, I can clearly see the trends changing in technology with each passing day and the automation and globalization of every sector in several business corridors. There has been a tremendous shift from manpower to machines which has led to the demand of people with more applicational ability than technical skills. Now coming on to the question, I came across WhiteHat Jr. through a Youtube video 4 months ago and decided to take a look at what the site has to offer. I came across the fact that it is specially designed to teach coding to kids from 6 to 14 years of age, and I was pretty excited to have a deeper look at the website. The site offers special classes for children on a 1:1 interactive session with special mentors who provide them their insights and help them develop their skills in this field. After further researching the legitimacy of the page, I found that the kids are advised to join the courses on their current skills and develop it at a pretty interesting rate, which was amazing. Usually, websites drive the students to just get enrolled at the highest paying course and no emphasis is laid upon their applicational learning and implementation but at WhiteHat Jr. the aim is to rather empower the kids for a much bigger race in front of them and to allow them to implement their learnings with complete independence. Thus, I believe that it\u2019s a great initiative by the website and I feel that it is a genuine and amazing site for kids who are passionate and interested in coding and programming. ",

We sat through the free trial classes with: WhitehatJr: Live Online 1:1 Kids Coding ClassCoding Elements: Live Online 1:1 Coding for Kids | \ud83e\udd47 Coding Elements | USA FacultyCampK12: AR/VR, App DevQ-in-1: Kids Online Classes by IIT AIIMS Ola alumsI really liked Coding Elements. Besides the individual attention from teacher, we were assigned a dedicated counselor - Monika ma\u2019am. She really helped us think through and plan out the next 3\u20134 years. She guided us through all the best options - study abroad, job search in India, job search in USA, academic research, etc. When I tried to get this type of guidance from other companies, no one was willing to help. I have recommended Coding Elements to all parents in my network. My kid is currently doing Python and Javascript from Coding Elements and she enjoys it a lot. I am quite happy with my choice.  Another company (I won\u2019t name it) was trying to teach my kid Blockly/Thunkable which is quite basic. So it did not feel right. They gave her a certificate of Artificial Intelligence after attending just 1 hour free trial. It felt like cheating. I decided to abandon them. ",

I myself was having doubts about the platform when I was got to know about it as subjects of coding and computer science are usually taught in college but then I saw the platform and also inquired one or two kids learning from the platform and that rendered me speechless. These kids were not disappointed at all and were actually performing pretty well after learning coding from the platform. This was made possible by 1:1 learning sessions provided by coding professionals in this platform. Kids are encouraged to perform well in this platform and their doubts and pain points are cleared everytime. There are a lot of success stories of this platform with kids doing projects that are unthinkable even for adults. You however can decide for yourself after taking a free demo class provided by the platform. You won't be disappointed for sure.  ",

WhiteHat Jr. is an online learning platform that teaches young kids aging from 6\u201318 how to code and yes, they are 100% genuine. I have done my own part of the research for my nephew when he developed some interest in coding at the age of 12. Since my brother is an IT Engineer himself, he encouraged my nephew to take up his passion along with his primary education. Since he is in the 6th grade, his school does not provide very fine education in coding and is mostly generic to the whole class. So, I got introduced to WhiteHat Jr. when Byju\u2019s acquired the same for a whopping 300$ dollars. I read up their website and watched review videos of their students and how coding makes them stand atop in their class performance as well.  They have amazing learning opportunities like if you pass a few levels in the course, you will be able to create apps and games that will be available on the play store for millions of users to download. Isn't that great? A kid building apps that now only an undergraduate having a degree in technology can make through the traditional ways of learning, i.e, college. So, they are completely authentic and you can trust them. Hope this helps you. :) ",

My son was satisfied with the trial class, so he was enrolled in the \u201capp developer certificate\u201d course. His course includes basic concepts like loops and functions to advanced concepts like Artificial Intelligence and cloud databases. His teacher, Ms.Meenakshi, is very supportive and takes care of his mistakes, and encourages him on his achievements. Weekly assignments in the form of games and applications are very efficient in getting concepts clear. Whitehat jr. was recently acquired by Byju\u2019s and that adds to the trust.

So I conducted extensive research on their website and decided to enroll for a free demo class. The trial class was authentic and they did not ask any money for attending it. Also afterward I enrolled my daughter for their Professional curriculum and she is attending classes presently- 3 days a week.  Why did I opt for their curriculum? Some specific features are praise-worthy and I am being totally honest here. Some factors which made me trust this platform and purchase their courses are: Their 1:1 interaction methodology where the student will be receiving the entire attention of the teacherCurriculums are divided on the basis of grade in which the student is studying. This ensures that the course offered is appropriate for the student based on their age.High-quality teachers owing to their 99.9 percentile selection criteriaClass timings can be scheduled as per the convenience of the students and this is a major advantageThere is a refund policy if the class is canceled with a notice provided 24 hours in advanceHence, I would recommend you to enroll for a free trial class and check out for yourself whether this app is authentic or not! This will help you make a well-informed decision. ",

But the thing is no child should be asked or expected to learn coding , they are children, they should enjoy their childhood, they should play sports and do mischiefs and run around with their friends and not asked to learn coding. I would plead any one who is even thinking about spending money on joining them , just have a 1:1 Conversation with any Computer Engineer who does not work for them and I am pretty confindent they would not advice you to join ",

We shortlisted a few of them, Whitehat Jr. being one of them. I had seen a lot of ads of this company and decided to check out the course. My daughter took their trial session (which is for about 1 hour). What I felt missing was the teacher\u2019s ability to connect with the child on a human level. The class felt quite mechanical. We knew that we had to look elsewhere. We checked out some other platforms and after a long search, found one of them suitable for my child. We noticed that the teacher here was making a lot of effort in getting to know the child and connecting with her (This is very important when teaching a child any skill \u2013 be it coding or some other). This institute (Coding Elements) focuses on Social Emotional Learning principles and this is why we see such a big difference in their approach. I suggest you make an informed decision while choosing a platform for your child. ",

Coding is actually kind of a difficult subject, and you will have to work hard on understanding it. But if taken in your early years you can easily understand it, owing to the high learning coefficient and fast learning curve.  In this fast paced world, the greatest gap in education is considered to be the fact that less than 1% of the schools in India teach coding. And this is a big problem as the future demands people who are equipped well to face it. WhiteHat Jr. looked up these facts and jumped in to solve this problem. They are a company who take teaching coding to kids seriously. Their online coding classes is built upon a strong curriculum and structured lesson plans.

It is up to you to decide whether this is genuine or fake, but try out their free trial and take an informed decision. This is a wonderful platform, and it is one of the best ones out there. ",

To be short and precise we did not really like the service that we got from them They taught really basic computers and called it coding. We were very disappointed but yet thought of giving it another try. We then found another class that is Cedarwood afterschool. It has almost been 1 months that my niece is in that class now and we are really impressed with the amount of knowledge that she has got from Cedarwood and also she has developed a lot of interest in programming since then. I do not recommend White hat Jr if you are looking for a good class. Cedarwood instead is 10/10 Recommended, ",

The course curriculum is excellent as well. They have expert teachers and it founded by IIT/IIM alumnus. They have a divided course curriculum depending upon the age of the kids. To answer your question I would like to share with you a personal incident. I have a 1 y.o niece who was also very interested in the same and she was much keen on learning it already. So I did some research on whitehatjr. and decided to give it a shot. She took some classes and honestly she loved it. I had to search for the best platform because she is very young and needs a good curriculum and good tutors. Like all of us, I was sceptical at first but after actually looking at her attending the classes and being so interested in it, I asked her what was so good about it. She told me how the tutors are very amiable and they teach coding in the simplest manner. She also mentioned how they clear up all her doubts at once during the live sessions. She loved it and she can code plus create her apps and games now.  So, WhiteHatJr has a very smooth and understandable curriculum. It has 5 parts which are suitable for each age group- Beginners (Grade-1), Intermediate (Grade 2-3), Advance (4-6), Professional (Grade 7-9) and Applied Tech (Grade 10-12+). I would recommend you to take a look at it or go through a demo class. ",

Even the activities are starkly different from what you would see in a textbook-approach; students learn by doing and skills are imparted through interactive activities like game developing, animations, and so on.

            "answer_text": "Whitehat Jr is definitely genuine. Now I\u2019ve not been offered a hefty amount to say this. I\u2019m saying this from personal experience. My own daughter loves their interactive sessions. Their Instagram account is verified. They have a lot of media coverage also. Their stories have been covered by Forbes as well! There are so many children who\u2019ve built so many cool apps by learning how to code from Whitehat Jr. They\u2019ve recently been acquired by BYJU\u2019s which is known for providing highest quality of educational content in India. I\u2019d say it is definitely worth each and every penny spent. Also, if you\u2019re worried about fake then instead of trusting anything else just go to their verified Instagram account and only use the contact info that is given on that verified account to avoid fraud.

My son (10 years old) made a very big fuss for enroling into one of WhiteHat's Intermediate courses which I did (like I had a choice :P). At first, I thought that Aryan wanted to enroll for the course because all his friends must be doing it and he wanted to be a part of it. But WhiteHat Jr amazed me when I saw my son creating a mobile application to have an interactive session with his friends. I was like WOW! It was such a proud moment for us as parents, and I had a sense of relief that my son invested his time in the right place and made use of the opportunity he got. ",
