            "answer_text": "The concept of a \u2018self\u2019, that is, of an \u2018individual\u2019 is a notion of relatively recent times - approximately the era beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution and the Sturm and Drang movement in Germany. Sturm und Drang, \u2018stress and strain\u2019, the essential precursor of the Romantic Revolution that transformed the world with its notion of a dynamic subjectivity - modern individualism, that led to the development of the Romantic Movement in England and the Continent. The combination of these forces and the rejection of a revealed religion that had dominated Europe until the Seventeenth century and that had subordinated all other intellectual and cultural currents began its slow demise. Man had traditionally not presumed that he had any involvement in make his world, he had been made by the world and God. The world prior to the seventeenth century was seen as unchanging. A world ruled by church and monarch under God. The religious or medieval society was one in which the social, political and economic order seemed unchangeable, and the poor and the oppressed attributed their suffering either to fortuitous happenings \u2013 ill luck, bad health, unjust rulers \u2013 or to the will of God. The idea that suffering could be relieved, and happiness engineered, by men radically changing the social order belongs to the eighteenth century. The deeper and transformative potential of the idea brought into being by the Enlightenment: that human beings can radically alter their social conditions. And these circumstances led to a sense of alienation, of ressentiment*,that lay in the decline of the traditional community \u2013 the guilds, corporations and family \u2013 and the rise of the competitive marketplace and social-contractism, in which individuals pursued their self-interest at the expense of others. The awakened intellect, freed from the strictures of authority, was no longer willing to accept anything on faith, and, separating itself from the actual world, and immersing itself in itself, wished to derive everything from itself, to find the origin and basis of knowledge within itself. \u2018I think, therefore I am\u2019. Here is how the new philosophy began in the person of Descartes. Modern anthropocentrism, situating man in the universal scheme of things, opened up new modes of enquiry. \u2018Nature and nature\u2019s laws lay hid in night,\u2019 Alexander Pope exulted in 1730. \u2018God said \u201cLet Newton be!\u201d and all was light.\u2019 The new empirico-mathematical method seemed to offer a model for analysing everything in secular terms: ethics as well as politics and society, and religion itself. *Kant identified as \u2018longing\u2019, ressentiment, distinguished from desire by its paralyzing awareness of the incapacity ever to achieve the desired object. That is the mark of modern mans \u2018individual\u2018 self, his or her psychic state. Plato\u2019s world had no concept of a self, such is as mentioned above. It was a world just emerging from an age of mythological story telling, stories that encompassed the duties, obligations and cultural ethos of a passing age but that still remained the primary cultural binding force of Athens and the many other Greek city states. It was an age dominated by wars and internecine struggles. Its educated elite classes functioned on established traditional normative behaviours and values; primarily based on warfare and status, particularly the virtues of manliness; courage and family and adherence to the values of each city state and its gods. Man\u2019s place in the world was the the work of the gods who at best could be placated by sacrifices in order to gain good outcomes. Plato, through his theory of Forms, established a theoretical notion whereby all that is and was real lay in the pleroma, as ideal archetypes, and all the innumerable beings and entities on earth are but mere copies, duplicates, who while aspiring to the beautiful, the good, were forever destined to remain prisoners in the ever changing processual world of growth and decay here below. The notion of an individual as such, did not exist, except in the sense that each man strove to aspire to be the most courageous and disciplined. Socrates, began the notion of a \u2018self\u2019 as a civil virtue, that was able to question normative values and realise that most were just norms, established by tradition and habit and that numerous of these were counter productive to a well lived life. Hence his advice to \u201cKnow thyself\u201d Keep in mind Plato\u2019s world was still that of the traditional pre-existent worldview. His ideas, while still relevant and of interest, hardly touched the established order of the era. Both Socrates and Plato are perceived as being the instigators of reasoning, of thinking rationally about the world and man\u2019s place in it, rather than the then contemporary cultural mores and values based on myths of the past. The sense of a self was that of a citizen, a member of a city state with their civic responsibilities and membership of an elite class of either soldiers or government participants, who were primarily members of the senate, whose only other responsibilities were to accord sacrifices and service to the cities ruling god (or gods). Though their notions of morality differed vastly from modern times they sought to adhere to the the principles of manliness, of courage and of service to the city state, beyond that the notion of a self, of an individual was non-existent. In many respects they were like Shakespeare\u2019s Montagues and Capulets; clannish and in constant disputes over who should rule and thereby hold power. These troubles often led to assasinations and internecine civil strife, such that when they were not facing off from the Persians, Spartans or other City states, they competed for authority and power both in military and civil affairs. The notion of a being a \u2018hero\u2019 was a guiding virtue; a courageous leader either in warfare or in civic matters. These \u2018virtues\u2019 were relayed in story form; the tale of Achilles, and his ilk, told in the tales of Homer. These tales formed the basis of what it meant to be an ideal Greek man. They were the \u2018ideal\u2019 types that Plato transformed into the Ideal forms he located in the pleroma, somewhere among the stars above as perfect archetypes. Thus the Greek world was based on individual virtues and cultural inclusiveness; on the perception of each member being a player in a unique social class of elite male patriarchs, quite xenophobic and seperate in values from the lower classes; the hoi poloi. Family, State and the Gods were the focus of the sense of self. It is hard for us to even imagine what that must have been like. Even their notion of democracy, was elitist and exclusive. The senate and its members sought to maintain harmony and social order as varying parties constantly struggled for positions of power. Thus the \u2018self\u2019 of Plato\u2019s era had little in common with either medieval or the consumerist individualism of our generation and historic times.
