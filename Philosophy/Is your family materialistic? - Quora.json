            "answer_text": "Holy yes they are. My stepdad makes pretty good money as a boat captain. He has been with my mom since I was 1 and he has been like a father to me. Sorta. Unfortunately he makes too much money for me to be able to even get enough loans to go to college. After I graduated high school I started really saving every penny I could. I've been paying for everything except basic necessities since I was 13. I don't want to sound greedy and materialistic, but there is no reason a 13 year old should have to purchase his own clothes, tooth paste, soaps, and everything else I was forced to fund. Instead of helping me better my future my family is buying the latest gadgets, cars, toys, vintage pianos, $800 wooden giraffs, and more junk. They don't care about what happens to their kid as long as they look wealthy. After my first year out of high school I was able to save enough money to be able to pay for 3-4 years of college despite buying more than half of the food and groceries, cutting the grass, and doing all of the housekeeping. After talking to a school and being granted scholarships I told my mom. Less than a week later I was thrown out of the house. He knew by throwing me out I wouldn't be able to afford to go to school anymore. Plus, that's an extra few rolls of dip he can buy with what he will save in electricity and water! My parents drive nice cars, have a nice house, and have all of the latest technology. They go on multiple vacations a year, they eat out at expensive restaurants every night, and they go shopping nearly every weekend. Are they materialistic? Hell yeah they are. ",

            "answer_text": "My siblings and my mom are not very materialistic, but my dad and most of my extended family very much are. People are afforded respect in proportion to their wealth. Poor people are treated with disdain, while wealthy people are treated with a reverence approaching obsequiousness. There is nothing more contemptible and nauseating than the transformation of their attitude towards people who started out poor but ended up wealthy. The contrast between the way those people were once treated in their time of need and the adulation they are subjected to when they are rich is a spectacle to behold. I shake my head in disgust. But perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on my extended family. They are far from alone in this attitude. I, who focused my intellectual energies to the pursuit of a remunerative career, am also more materialistic than the average American. In many ways, the ability to look down on materialism is a sign of relative wealth. When the memory of real poverty is recent, when parents had to walk miles every morning in order to gather some potable water, when the clothes one wore were all hand-me-downs, and when one grew up in a society where meat was scarce and the poorest members were condemned to a life of menial labor, the drive to acquire material possessions will generally be higher than when one is born into a society where the vast majority of people have enough to eat. In my own case, I\u2019m more materialistic than my little sister (who moved to the US at age 8) and less materialistic than my dad. ",
