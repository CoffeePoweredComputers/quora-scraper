            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are the claims or beliefs of an antitheist?\u201d Well, I can only speak for myself, as there\u2019s no \u2018movement\u2019 or \u2018belief system\u2019 around \u2018antitheism\u2019 (otherwise this question wouldn\u2019t have to be asked ; ). In general, the \u2018antitheist\u2019 (as, rare cases aside, only \u2018theists\u2019 and their leaders see them as and call them that) understands that would-be-leader \u2018god\u2019 claims are but a psychological tool used, with indoctrination, to make other humans obey them (and reap all the benefits that come with that) with minimal effort. It\u2019s a step up in totalitarian-form evolution from using more physical threats\u2026 but theist leaders often use both. A \u2018because god-claim-threat\u2019 totalitarian system (aka \u2018theocracy\u2019) requires a stagnating, even backwards, unquestioning non-thought that resists anything, even good, not \u2018of\u2019 the system, and its leaders\u2019 interests are most always their own before any followers\u2019 (let alone any other human who \u2018dares\u2019 to not obey them)\u2026 and their separating their following from the rest of humanity (that they most always deem and profess \u2018inferior\u2019) creates even more divisiveness and evil. But it\u2019s ironic that, in developed countries, at least, that system depends on a thinking populace (and all it creates and produces) to support it. But this is not a \u2018claim\u2019 or a \u2018belief\u2019, it\u2019s demonstrable fact, as those who behave such (and oblige others to behave in unthinking ways) do all the demonstrating themselves.

            "answer_text": "An antitheist holds the positition that god-belief, and more specifically organised religion is a force for ill in the world. This position is not entirely without merit. Organised religions tend to be tribal in nature and often put themselves in opposition to other tribes. Historically, this has led to violence and intimidation. And once in a while genocide. The modern world is still aflicted with anti-semitism (and other forms of religious discrimination) misogyny and homophobia, which for many people can be justified by means of scripture. It\u2019s possible to also consider that the belief in supernatural deity is intrinsically harmful. Individuals beliving in an external source of justice, or who think there will be rewards and punishmens in a post mortem afterlife, may be less proactive in securing justice that those who think we have but one life, and that the only justice is that we make here on Earth. Enduring suffering because it is the will-of-god, is perhaps not the best way to end suffering. ",
