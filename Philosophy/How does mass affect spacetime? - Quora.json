            "answer_text": "First of all let's clarify that it is not only mass which curves spacetime, but energy in general. If by \"how\" you mean the precise mechanism by which energy density curves spacetime, the answer is simply we do not know. General Relativity postulates that this is the case but it does not provide insight as to the mechanism. Matter-energy residing in spacetime possesses a property called the stress energy tensor (which may or may not include momentum), which is what causes the response of spacetime we call \"curving\" or \"warping\". The higher the energy density, the more pronounced the curving of spacetime at that point. We can not really visualize the curving of 4D spacetime, not even that of 3D space, but roughly we can interpret it as a sort of contraction, as space being \"sucked in\" towards the point of high energy density, causing the trajectory of nearby passing objects to bend. The objects are moving along a straight path (more precisely a \"geodesic\" path i.e. the shortest possible path) but this path appears bent when seen from the outside. As for the time dimension, the curving or contraction manifests as time dilation i.e. clocks tick slower in the curved region of spacetime. ",
