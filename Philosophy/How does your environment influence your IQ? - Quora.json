            "answer_text": "\u201cDoes your environment impact your IQ?\u201d Your environment will impact your intelligence. Intelligence is something we develop throughout life. A bad environment can retard the development of your intelligence. A rich, supportive environment can stretch your development. IQ is related to intelligence, but not the same thing. The best way to avoid confusing them is to remember, \u201cIQ is a number you get from a test.\u201d And there are different tests. If you just take an online IQ test, the questions will be more or less familiar depending on your past environment. This will impact your IQ number. But Peter Flom is an expert on testing and he insists that it\u2019s not a proper IQ test unless it\u2019s administered in person, by a professional. And that professional should be able to change which test is used, how long you get for the test, and perhaps other aspects, to compensate for your environment. In this best case your number will be pretty representative of your intelligence, in spite of your environment. And it should be compare-able to other people\u2019s numbers, in spite of differences in environments. ",

            "answer_text": "The actual intelligence a person has is influenced by their environment. Eating habits, sleeping habits, absences or presences of certain stresses, all effect our ability to think. For those who believe I.Q. is just a number, and the day to day differences in a person\u2019s decision making ability based on environment, do not count, or they do count - it really depends on what a person thinks I.Q. means. Environmental issues do effect our intelligence, both positively and negatively. The necessity to have that cup of coffee in the morning is one example. Some people\u2019s brains need to be kick-started. ",

Also a bit classical music from early age, learning instrument from early age and trying to reason abstract statements might increase IQ a few points if applied early enough. But some critics assume it only helps to fulfill your potential already there. But if things impact your cognitive potential, it\u2019s these things. ",

Constantly surround yourself with intelligent people, and you will start to adapt and try to become like them to be up to their standards. Their positive habits will become yours. We are adaptable and social creatures, so our bodies will adapt to its surroundings to be fit in and survive. If we consistently surround ourselves with positive factors that increaee our intelligence, which is love, healthy eating habits and exercise, good-hearted, and intelligent people, then our bodies will simply adapt to be a part of that society.

Heritability rates vary between 0.50 and 0.80 or so, showing that genes are heavily involved in the development and maintenance of intellectual ability. What tjis means, however, is not that you should give up on lower-IQ individuals. If anything, what it means is that, the more involved genes are, the more important is that which happens in the environment in order to ensure effective learning. ",
