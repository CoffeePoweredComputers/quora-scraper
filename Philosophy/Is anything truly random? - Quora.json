            "answer_text": "The most used simple trial to explain randomness is a coin flip. A fair coin has equal chance of ending up head or tails, half probability. Lets assume I have a coin in my hand, which I am going to flip now. As long as you don\u2019t know anything about the coin, as I said, the chance remains half. Lets go through few cases and corresponding outcomes: Both sides of the coin has heads:You are not aware of that: for you the chance of getting head and tails is half, but for me I know it is always going to be head. Even if I toss it hundred times and it turns out to be head, you can compute non zero probability for tail in the next turn.You too know that it has both sides head: No wonder here.You know both sides are same: until the coin is tossed for the first time the probability remains half.The coin is made up of magnet and I am tossing it on a magnetic plane.Depends on the polarity of the magnetic plane and polarity of the head and tails side, the result will be decided.If we dig a little deep, the strength of the magnetic field of the plane Vs the weight and strength of the magnetic field in coin Vs gravity will decide the result.The coin is fair, I toss it and swiftly replace with another coin on ground: while you are expecting a fair chance, I decide what is the outcome.So, basically the number of variables involved and if they can be computed to the dot decides if an event is random or determined (or can be projected with some computed trajectory). Lets take another example, when you launch a space shuttle, you would compute the trajectory well in advance. It is expected to follow the path until some natural cause (unknown to you or unexpected) or some mistake in your calculation engineering goes wrong (unseen or unchecked). In which case, we are open for a randomness. Hence, randomness is something that exists as long as the causes of a particular effect is unknown or can not be computed very precisely. Now we can safely say that there is true randomness as long as there are unknown factors affects the outcome of an event. The universe is full of unknown things to us. We basically fight between deterministic and random universe. Even if we are living in a deterministic universe, until all the governing rules of this universe is well defined with a specialization of subject, we have sources to cause unpredictable events. That means, we have randomness. Did you ask for true randomness? that depends on what is true. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer that question you would have to understand the concept and definition of \u201ctruly random\u201d. The theoretical/mathematical premise of true randomness is when all your possible outcomes have the exact same probability of occurring. It would be impossible for man to replicate true randomness. Possible outcome distribution types or sequences are influenced and conditioned by an almost infinite group of factors and variables. If a abstract random generator is truly random to it's fullest extent than we would have to admit that there are no variables or external factors that are influencing and restricting the outcomes. That is why true \"randomness\" is a theoretical concept, because in a real physical world/scenario it would be incomprehensive that a generation of outcomes wouldn't have any restricting, conditional or influential elements or variables. It would be almost as being in a complete empty void. Only some sort of divinity or unknown force could achieve this. It should be said that the more the possible outcomes the further the expectations of achieving true randomness. Admitting that randomness is a relative concept and that it could be measured through the outcome frequency distribution type, than it\u2019s theoretical existence is evident. Even something that is truly random can not proven 100%. This happens because having multiple possible sequences and multiple possible outcome frequency distribution types, no single one of them can prove by itself being 100% random. ",
