            "answer_text": "Absolutely you can. The shareholder in my first law firm\u2019s undergrad degree was in philosophy. Philosophy would be great prep for law. You will have covered logic and logical fallacies: law is very much about logical reasoning. Also philosophy is great for honing one\u2019s thought processes - very important for law. When it comes down to it, law schools are less concerned about a candidate\u2019s undergraduate degree and are more concerned about his/her potential to succeed in their programs. So they look at candidate\u2019s entire presentation before deciding whom to admit or reject. ",

            "answer_text": "Can I go to law school and become a lawyer with a philosophy degree? Sure! Why not? There is no specific undergraduate major required for admission to law school. Although some colleges offer \u201cpre-law\u201d courses, that is simply a \u201cmix\u201d of various courses that the college\u2019s administrators decided might be helpful with the concepts and thought processes needed for understanding and practicing the law. But that\u2019s like buying a box of pancake mix, instead of building your own pancake batter from scratch, containing the ingredients YOU want in it. People go into law from all kinds of different backgrounds. If something about practicing law appeals to you, go for it! ",

I think what\u2019s much more important is that the major is demanding, requiring lots of analytical reading, composition, and participation. It should necessitate careful time management and be recognized as a high quality program. And ideally the student will have handled all these demands, reflected by grades, recommendations, and work product. That\u2019s going to show law school readiness, regardless of whether the major is math, philosophy, art history, French literature, or biochemistry. ",
