            "answer_text": "Hobbes wrote about science; Locke wrote about property. Beyond that, Locke agrees with Hobbes in almost every significant way. Any subtle changes Locke made to Hobbes were drawn from a religious perspective, but his ideas were never followed through with and sometimes he would just say the opposite. In some ways, Locke only pretends to differ from Hobbes. I wouldn't call it a difference, but Locke does seek to make the government more operational and writes a lot about legislative power and how it functions. He also writes about an independent judiciary as an aspect of executive power - trying to pull jurisprudence away from the power of the executive. Locke writes about all these things more distinctly than Hobbes did and tried to outline, practically, the branches of government, including checks and balances (even tolerance) and then commercialized it. On most other things, they are pretty similar. ",
