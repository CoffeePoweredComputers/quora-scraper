            "answer_text": "One of the most notable superstitious beliefs was perhaps Alchemy which, along with the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, has left an indelible mark on science. Alchemy is defined as is a way of studying and experimenting with matter that includes elements of chemistry, philosophy, and spirituality. Alchemy is a medieval philosophy and early form of chemistry whose aims were the transmutation of base metals into gold, the discovery of a cure for all diseases, and the preparation of a potion that gives eternal youth. The imagined substance capable of turning other metals into gold was called the Philosophers\u2019 Stone. (Source: Dictionary.com) Alchemy is an ancient practice shrouded in mystery and secrecy. Its practitioners mainly sought to turn lead into gold, a quest that has captured the imaginations of people for thousands of years. However, the goals of alchemy went far beyond simply creating some golden nuggets. Alchemy was rooted in a complex spiritual worldview in which everything around us contains a sort of universal spirit, and metals were believed not only to be alive but also to grow inside the Earth. When a base, or common, metal such as lead was found, it was thought to simply be a spiritually and physically immature form of higher metals such as gold. To the alchemists, metals were not the unique substances that populate the Periodic Table, but instead the same thing in different stages of development or refinement on their way to spiritual perfection. (Source: Radford, Benjamin (2016). What is Alchemy? LiveScience. March 24.) Today, alchemy might be an insult to science, but back in the day, it was the ultimate reality. Alchemy comes from Arabic \u2018al\u2019 meaning \u2018the\u2019 and Greek \u2018kimiya\u2019, meaning \u2018transmutation of metals\u2019. It also has Greco-Egyptian origins, chemeia. Alchemy is the precursor of metallurgy. To understand the importance of alchemy, we have to go back even further in time. In terms of tool making technology, man would use rocks to make tools. Then, he found out that he could extract the metals out of those rocks to make even better and more durable tools and more effective weapons that set the stage for domination over those who did not have access to the technology. Then, he discovered that adding tin to copper yielded to bronze, an even harder alloy. When it comes to tool making technology, man went from stone, to iron and bronze. In the process, metallurgists thought they could eventually master metal transmutation and take it to an even higher level by transforming any metal into gold. Those who engaged in such endeavor were called alchemists, and the activity was called alchemy. What was interesting about alchemy and made future generations associate with superstition was the fact that the alchemist was a VIP and his job was lucrative because most alchemists worked for kings and men of power. Therefore, they had to keep their work secret from the general public. To do so, they attributed special codes to the processes of their activities, which they shared among themselves. But, as a rule of thumb, when a secret is known by more than one person, it ceases to be a secret. Thereafter, their work would be discovered, but could not be understand by the public in a scientific way. For example, alchemists would use the word King for Gold, Queen for Silver, Father and Mother for Sulfur and Mercury respectively, and so on. So, a complete process would look like a story or a poem, which was thought to be a magical formula to recite in order to produce gold or any other precious metals. Since alchemists themselves sought to change natural elements for their own benefits, alchemy was called natural magic. However, the distortion of their work by untrained individual will give a supernatural character to the activity. So, from natural magic, alchemy will become supernatural magic.

            "answer_text": "From my perspective, Alchemy leads to Chemistry. Though the attempts for alchemists to synthesize gold from cheaper materials, especially from Mercury, led to failure, they observed plenty of reactions between these materials. For instance, they found that Mercury (Silver liquid) can be turned into Mercury Oxide (Red solid) when treated with Oxygen (Colorless gas). They also find that there are gas emitted when metals like Iron was treated by acid like acetic acid (A composition of vinegar). We can say that alchemy is the incipient stage of chemistry, but it is mixed with philosophy, theology and several other subjects. To make a conclusion, despite fact that the phenomenon they noticed are often the same as clinical reactions we observed now, the aim of alchemists are quite different from that for chemists at present.
