            "answer_text": "Yes he was also he was so handsome peace be upon him. I would like to mention some of this description which was written and told by his friends : One of the features of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that are mentioned in the ancient books is that between his shoulders was the Seal of Prophethood. he had beauty in his morals and how he was look like. Muhammad peace be upon him was of a height a little above the average. He was of sturdy build with long muscular limbs and tapering fingers. The hair of his head was long and thick with some waves in them. His forehead was large and prominent, his eyelashes were long and thick, his nose was sloping, his mouth was somewhat large and his teeth were well set. His cheeks were spare and he had a pleasant smile. His eyes were large and black with a touch of brown. His beard was thick and at the time of his death, he had seventeen gray hairs in it. He had a thin line of fine hair over his neck and chest. He was white and fair of complexion and altogether was so handsome that Abu Bakr composed this couplet on him: \"as there is no darkness in the moonlit night so is Mustafa, the well-wisher, bright.\" His gait was firm and he walked so fast that others found it difficult to keep pace with him. His face was genial but at times, when he was deep in thought, there there were long periods of silence, yet he always kept himself busy with something. He did not speak unnecessarily and what he said was always to the point and without any padding. At times he would make his meaning clear by slowly repeating what he had said. His laugh was mostly a smile. He kept his feelings under firm control - when annoyed, he would turn aside or keep silent, when pleased he would lower his eyes (Shamail Tirmizi). \"By the grace of Allah, you are gentle towards the people; if you had been stern and ill-tempered, they would have dispersed from round about you\" (translation of Qur'an 3:159) About himself the prophet (pbuh) said \"Allah has sent me as an apostle so that I may demonstrate perfection of character, refinement of manners and loftiness of deportment.\" (Malik, Mawatta; Ahmed, Musnad; Mishkat) By nature he was gentle and kind hearted, always inclined to be gracious and to overlook the faults of others. Politeness and courtesy, compassion and tenderness, simplicity and humility, sympathy and sincerity were some of the keynotes of his character. In the cause of right and justice he could be resolute and severe but more often than not, his severity was tempered with generosity. He had charming manners which won him the affection of his followers and secured their devotion. Though virtual king of Arabia and an apostle of Allah, he never assumed an air of superiority. Not that he had to conceal any such vein by practice and artifice: with fear of Allah, sincere humility was ingrained in his heart. He used to say, \"I am a Prophet of Allah but I do not know what will be my end.\" (Bukhari, Sahih Bukhari, Chapter \"Al-Janaiz\") In one of his sermons calculated to instill the fear of Allah and the day of reckoning in the hearts of men, he said, \"O people of Quraish be prepared for the hereafter, I cannot save you from the punishment of Allah; O Bani Abd Manaf, I cannot save you from Allah; O Abbas, son of Abdul Mutalib, I cannot protect you either; O Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, even you I cannot save.\"(Sahahin) He used to pray, \"O Allah! I am but a man. If I hurt any one in any manner, then forgive me and do not punish me.\" (Ahmed, Musnad, Vol. 6 pg. 103) He always received people with courtesy and showed respect to older people and stated: \"To honor an old man is to show respect to Allah.\" He would not deny courtesy even to wicked persons. It is stated that a person came to his house and asked permission for admission. The prophet (pbuh) remarked that he was not a good person but might be admitted. When he came in and while he remained in the house, he was shown full courtesy. When he left Aiysha (ra) said, \"You did not think well of this man, but you treated him so well.\" The prophet (pbuh) replied, \"He is a bad person in the sight of Allah who does not behave courteously and people shun his company bacause of his bad manners.\" (Bukhari, Sahih Bukhari) He was always the first to greet another and would not withdraw his hand from a handshake till the other man withdrew his. If one wanted to say something in his ears, he would not turn away till one had finished (Abu Dawud, Tirmizi). He did not like people to get up for him and used to say, \"Let him who likes people to stand up in his honour, he should seek a place in hell.\" (Abu Dawud, Kitabul Adab, Muhammadi Press, Delhi). He would himself, however, stand up when any dignitary came to him. He had stood up to receive the wet nurse who had reared him in infancy and had spread his own sheet for her. His foster brother was given similar treatment. He avoided sitting at a prominent place in a gathering, so much so that people coming in had difficulty in spotting him and had to ask which was the Prophet (pbuh). (Abu Dawud Kitabul Atama). He used to visit the poorest of ailing persons and exhorted all muslims to do likewise (Bukhari, Sahih Bukhari, Chapter \"Attendance on ailing persons\"). He would sit with the humblest of persons saying that righteousness alone was the criterion of one's superiority over another. He invariably invited people be they slaves, servants or the poorest believers, to partake with him of his scanty meals (Tirmizi, Sunan Tirmizi). Whenever he visited a person he would first greet him and then take his permission to enter the house. He advised the people to follow this etiquette and not to get annoyed if anyone declined to give permission, for it was quite likely the person concerned was busy otherwise and did not mean any disrespect (Ibid). There was no type of household work too low for him. Aiysha (ra) has stated, \"He always joined in household work and would at times mend his clothes, repair his shoes and sweep the floor. He would milk, tether, and feed his animals and do the household shopping.\" (Qazi Iyaz: Shifa; Bukhari, Sahih Bukhari, Chapter: Adab). ",
