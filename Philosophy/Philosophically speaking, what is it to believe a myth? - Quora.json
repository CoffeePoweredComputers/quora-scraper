            "answer_text": "Humans don\u2019t just think in rational or logical terms. They don\u2019t just use scientific or reasonable definitions for thought or ideas. Applying scientific or Literal based terms of reality onto Myths, yields up disbelief. Many terms, like Historical, Literal, Objective, and Real are biased towards scientific measurements, shareable knowledge or experience, and eye-witness accounting, but are not really exclusive to those means of \u2018proof.\u2019 Looking at Myth in scientific terms is inappropriate. A myth can be a partial description of a real occurrence, place, or action, but what is generally considered more important in myths is the Human Action or Response to the situation. They are generally meant to teach a human something. That something might be about origins, how to deal with evil, how to deal with semi-evil, how to get intot he habit of planting crops at the right time, how to connect to the environs and prosper. There are many social lessons to learn from Myths, as well as serious psychological ones. One of my favorite examples is the Orpheus myth wherein Orpheus, the greatest musician (and hence story teller/ teacher of knowledge) loses his beloved wife. He travels down into Hades to confront the King of Death, and sings the most beautiful song of the love he and his wife had. Hades is moved and grants Orpheus a boon. He says, you can take your wife with you back to the living, but as you walk back out of my realm, you cannot ever turn around and look back. If you do, she will be lost forever. Orpheus is overjoyed, and they immediately set out, he in front, his wife\u2019s spirit walking behind him. As they walk, they talk, and Orpheus is glad for the first time since before his wife died. They walk and walk, for the realm of Hades is large, but as they come closer to the gates, Orpheus is suddenly struck by a sense of doubt. Is she really with him? Can this be real? And he turns to look, and as he does, she is lost to him forever. To a modern mind, it makes no sense. Indeed, to the old Greeks, they knew how our mundane mind would want to think, is this real? Is she really there? And she is not, but on a different level, she can always be there, and will always be there, if Orpheus hadn\u2019t broken the spell by demanding that she be within the literal, scientific or rational world as well. This is a deeper psychology than science can fathom. All the above was to address the idea of Belief. What is it to believe? What you base your Belief in, colors how you will read myths and legends. I prefer to look instead to the reasons for a story to be told. What lessons are being shared? What ideas that are or were important to the Human to learn? That is the purpose of Myth, as I see it.
