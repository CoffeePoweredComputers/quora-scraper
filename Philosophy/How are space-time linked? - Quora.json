            "answer_text": "They are not. Space is space and time is time. The spacetime connection is the product of two things: Einstein decided to dress the 17th Century Empirical Law of Gravitation discovered by Sir Isaac Newton with a geodesics paradigm. The geodesics paradigm exists in a 4D Spacetime. So, spacetime is an artifact of the paradigm.The other linchpin of spacetime is the actual dependence of forces upon ABSOLUTE VELOCITY. Absolute velocity only matter for velocities close to the speed of light, which is an absolute limit. The intrinsic force dependence upon ABSOLUTE VELOCITY is homologous to using Absolute Velocity Force independent formulation and time dilation, contraction, frame dragging etc.So, spacetime is a contrivance created by Einstein\u2019s (and everyone else) to derive the Laws of Nature from first principles. Without that knowledge one cannot realize that there is something called Absolute Velocity or a preferential frame of reference. I know that I am saying things that Einstein would frown upon..:) Well, I frown upon General Relativity and provide evidence that it is flawed and cannot describe the Universe:  I know that I am like David facing a Goliath (the dead Einstein since one can never speak evil of the dead\u2026:) and the Sheeple Scientists..:)  Because of that I only speak when I have the arguments in my favor: Marco Pereira's answer to How would anyone defend general relativity from Marco Pereira's HU challenge? and when I do it, I do a complete job. Here is my argument kicking L-CDM to the curb: Marco Pereira's answer to What is the status (as of 2019) of the search for dark matter? You can figure it out if I am right or not just by looking at the number of scientists who come to defend Einstein and L-CDM: ZERO..>:) ",

Einstein had realized in 1905, that space and time, are intimately connected with each other. ... Thus one can think of space and time together, as a four-dimensional entity, called space-time. ",
