            "answer_text": "We are cautioned against argument that insists on our personal opinions. The belief in our own rightness that makes others wrong can lead us into fighting, and not only fighting the kaafiruwn, but also each other. The presentation of fact may be called \u201clies,\u201d and warning against arrogance can be dismissed with contempt. There is a common misunderstanding of the preservation of the Qur\u2019an, a belief that has not been carefully investigated, that simply does not hold up when examined with care, and that is not only in \u201cpreservation\u201d but in something called \u201cperfect preservation,\u201d which, if not defined creates mischief, where we may attach something true as a \u201clie,\u201d which is kufr. We are not rescued from the Fire by exposing the errors or even the lies of others, and the behavior of the kaafiriyn is descibed for us not to condemn them, but to warn us against behaviors like that, which lead to doom if Allah does not forgive. Because the issue came up at a masjid, and because I happened to have a copy of two different \u201creadings\u201d of the Book, and a copy of the Taskhent mushhaaf, I prepared a document that showed actual variations. Just fact, verifiable. I was then prohibited by the imaam from talking to anyone at the masjid. When another member recited the Qur\u2019an to him, he shouted angrily \u201cNo!\u201d Thus his strong belief in his own rightness led him straight into blatant kufr. To the question here, the question proposes the the idea of \u201cperfect preservation\u201d but that is not defined; nevertheless it implies that There was a single text.We have that text, and any variation is not authentic.We have agreement on that.Critics of Islam, sometimes reacting to Muslim polemic over Biblical texts, use fact to counterattack, tempting us to attack fact as \u201clies.\u201d However the problem with these facts on point is not the facts themselves but with how they are interpreted. First, some fact. That such and such a hadith exists is fact; in general, strong hadith exist in variations that share common elements, so we look for common elements. There are many ahadith that refer to \u201cseven ahruf\u201d often translated as \u201cdialects,\u201d but it literally means \u201cletters,\u201d and at the time of the Prophet, saws, the recitation marks, including vowels, had not been invented. The \u201creadings,\u201d then, include variations in vowels, which can affect meaning. This can be complicated by the use of \u201cseven\u201d in Arabic to mean \u201dmany.\u201d Sahih al-Bukhari Book of Virtues of the Qur'an Hadith 514 \u2014 Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab: I heard Hisham bin Hakim reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle and I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited in several different ways which Allah's Apostle had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, \"Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?\" He replied, \"Allah's Apostle taught it to me.\" I said, \"You have told a lie, for Allah's Apostle has taught it to me in a different way from yours.\" So I dragged him to Allah's Apostle and said (to Allah's Apostle), \"I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven't taught me!\" On that Allah's Apostle \ufdfa said, \"Release him, (O 'Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!\" Then he recited in the same way as I heard him reciting. Then Allah's Apostle \ufdfa said, \"It was revealed in this way,\" and added, \"Recite, O 'Umar!\" I recited it as he had taught me. Allah's Apostle then said, \"It was revealed in this way. This Qur'an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you (or read as much of it as may be easy for you).\" This is such a remarkable story. \u2018Umar, ra, is \u201ctelling one on himself.\u201d This shows his anger at what he believed was wrong, to the extent that he accused Hisham of lying.This translates \u201cahruf\u201d as \u201cdifferent ways.\u201d There is a problem with the common interpretation as \u201cdialects,\u201d as of seven tribes. \u2018Umar and Hisham were both Qurayshi.Another related story: Hadith Ahruf: Quran revealed in seven readings, do not argue it | Daily Hadith Online \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645\u064a Abu Juhaym reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \u201cThe Quran is recited in seven ways. Do not argue over the Quran, for arguing over the Quran is an act of unbelief.\u201d This is a comprehensive review of the issue of Ahruf: Understanding Seven Ahruf \u20131 (the weaker explanations) Understanding Seven Ahruf \u20132 (Best Explanation) Some other facts (from my memory): A single mus-haaf was collected by the order of Abu Bakr, ra, based on suhuwf (written pieces) and memory. This was likely using the Qurayshi dialect.This was reviewed under the order of \u2018Uthmaan, ra and the two verses at the end of Sura 9 were added.Copies were made of this mus-haaf and distributed. As manual copies, it is likely that there would be occasional errors, such as might escape notice.I have seen at least one variation between the most popular reading Hafs, which many Muslims today believe is the only Qur\u2019an, and Warsh, popular in North Africa (but not Egypt), where a different word is used. The change in meaning is minor or nonexistent.I have seen at least on letter variation between the Tashkent mus-haaf and the accepted texts, where there is siyn in place of Sad.\u201cPerfect\u201d is a strong word, not allowing any deviation at all.What we have is, from the history and the lack of major controversy among the early Muslims, an authentic text to be used for the purpose intended, which is to remind us of our relationship with Reality. Given the facts, it is not surprising that one may be able to find many variant texts, but it is irrelevant. The level of variation is trivial compared to that in other ancient texts, but the Qur\u2019an and our prophet did not attack what was extant and followed of the Torah and Gospels, and the letters of Paul are what they, themselves, purported to be. It is not for us to judge those who seek the pleasure of God through another system. God will guide them as he wills, and anger and arrogance on our part will not guide anyone. Disrespect for the books sacred to others was forbidden, but some of us like to argue and make others wrong, which is distinct from warning against evil and inspiring with good. Avoiding these these tendencies of the reactive mind is the jihad fiy n-nafs. a -uwdhu billahi min ash-shayTaani r-rajiym wa llahu a^lam ",

            "answer_text": "In this world ? That is hilarious. May be you don't know the difference between a version and a TRANSLATION. Go and check out the meaning of these words in your dictionary. The Qur'an is only ONE version and we have more than 30 million Muslims young and old, men and women, young kids of 6 years to 12 years, old great great grand Pa's and great great grand Mama's who cannot even remember the names of their grand sons , reeling out the Qur'an so effortlessly. If you tried to recite the Qur'an infront of anyone of them and made a mistake or even a mere mispronounciation of even a SINGLE word, they will immediately pounce on you in an effort to CORRECT you without even thinking of it. Therefore anyone who told you such a wild LIE is being insincere and does not know the origin of how the Qur'an descended from heaven to an illiterate prophet. Did God not promised to protect the Qur'an from all discrepancies by HIMSELF ? That is the result ! There is a challenge thrown by the Qur'an to ALL mankind and the Jinn, in chapter 4 verse 82 of the Qur'an, where the Qur'an ITSELF challenged humanity to find a single mistake in it if they can. We have heard of many people who had tried even during the time of the prophet when literature and poetry were at their zenith, but they failed woefully. The Qur'an is not a book written by man which usually starts like a story book with \u201conce upon a time\u201d scenarios or A,B,C and ends with Z.. .No sir, the Qur'an is not human created. The Qur'an came down to the prophet like a crossword puzzle. A chapter which started many years ago in Mecca will be completed after about 5 other new chapters have already been completed in Medina. This includes even verses. A typical crossword puzzle style. Can anyone be able to replicate such a miracle ? That's why you find out that you can open ANY chapter of the Qur'an and read it as if you are reading the FIRST page of any human book written by a human being. The miracle of the written and inimitable Qur'an alone is so vast that i can't answer that on Quora. Please and please BANISH such thought of more than a single \u201cversion\u201d of the Qur'an existing from your thought. It can NEVER happen ! Cheers ",

Quran is The Word of Allah and is preserved by Allah.A singer made up of mud sings a song and is preserved in different forms; on paper, CDs, internet and other devices and tools that even we don\u2019t know all of their names. Any of his follower can play it even after passing away of that singer made of mud.What do you think? Allah, Who has created this boasting man and is Living for ever will be unable to preserve His Word? Even thinking such is shameful.I said there are more than a million different versions of Quran. You will find these in different shapes, sizes, color, designs , translations in different languages by lovers of this Bounty of Allah. Even some are in different fonts, some with dots, some without dots and symbols, etc. \u007fBut the text is the same, the words never change, number of Surahs and their order is never changed.Critics forget that Quran is the only book on the surface of earth that has memorized from cover to cover by millions of believers in every era for last 1500 years. The number of these people is continuously growing with every passing year. These people put their memorized work for assessment and check every year to more than one billion Muslims who are allowed to point out even a minor mistake.The claim of 26 or any other number of Quran is a non-sense created by those who don\u2019t know what is Quran? Who is its Protector? How its protection has been made sure? They even never read Quran, then how they can point out any difference accurately?If anyone claims that there are many versions with difference of words they should present it in this forum to be examined by members.Just making false claims is nothing but display of ill-mentality.

            "answer_text": "The Quran appears to be of different versions not because the words are different but because the markings to aid pronunciation are different. Take a look at the following examples that are claimed to be different versions of the Quran:  The word said to be different is actually written the following way in the original Quran: \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 What you see above are not from the original Quran but are copies of the Quran with markings added. Even if there are small differences in these versions of the Quran with markings, it does not change the original Quran that has no markings. We need to be clear about this. Notice that there are no lines above or below the letters. Then, in order to make it easier for non-Arabic speakers, lines have been added by people to show how to pronounce the word. But does \u201cbig\u201d and \u201ca lot of\u201d make a difference in understanding this verse? Of course not! But the original Quran remains the same - without lines above or below. An Arabic speaker will confirm this for whoever is in doubt. Here is a second example that is claimed to show differences:  The word in the original Quran is: \u0642\u062a\u0644 Again, in the original Quran there are no markings above or below. So it can be read either as Qatal or Qatil, and both would be correct - there are prophets who have fought or killed (such as Moses and David) and there are prophets who have been killed. The word \u0642\u062a\u0644 can mean kill, killing or was killed. So as you can see, the Quran remains the same. There is only one version. No word or letter has been changed. What has changed are markings that are added to later copies of the same Quran, to make reading easier for non-Arabic speakers. ",

            "answer_text": "The Quran was revealed in seven different \u201cahruf.\u201d This is reported in a well-known Sahih hadith: Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"Gabriel recited the Qur'an to me in one way (one Harf). Then I requested him (to read it in another way), and continued asking him to recite it in other ways, and he recited it in several ways till he ultimately recited it in seven different ways (seven Ahruf).\" (Sahih al-Bukhari) So, the existence of these variants is not due to a lack of preservation but due to a good preservation of what the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) actually taught. Today, we have 10 major qiraat (recitations) of the Quran. The question arises that 10 is larger than 7, so where did the the three more come from. The answer is that the qiraat aren\u2019t the Ahruf. The qiraat are, instead, combinations of different Ahruf. For example, one qiraa can be half of Harf 1 and half of Harf 2. Through this combination, we have 10 major qiraat from the original 7 Ahruf. This combination is completely permissible because all the 7 Ahruf are equally valid as the Quran. Each of the 10 qiraat and their reciters had two major students who passed on mostly the same except they may have differed the Harf they chose for particular words in some places. So, in a sense, you can have 10x2=20 different ways of writing the Quran with all of them being completely valid. You can find all 20 on the internet here in audio form and in the \u201c\u0645\u0635\u0627\u062d\u0641\u201d tab at the bottom of the page here in written form. It\u2019s nothing hidden. As for the claimed number of \u201c26,\u201d I have no doubt some deception is going on. Either they have the same exact qiraat but with different colors on the cover, or they\u2019re just deceiving the viewers (and perhaps themselves as well) by counting the same Quran as different. For example, near the end of the linked video, they count both the supposed \u201c1924 Cairo Edition\u201d and \u201cHafs \u2018an Aasim\u201d as two of their \u201cversions.\u201d However, the \u201c1924 Cairo Edition\u201d is just a publication of the qiraat of Hafs \u2018an Aasim! Why would you count them differently? The publishers of Cairo only decided the specifics of how to write and and organize the text, and they did not change the text itself from Hafs \u2018an Aasim. That is the kind of deceit (or confusion) you are dealing with in that video. These people have no idea what they are talking about. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you might have gotten a little confused. There is no 26 different Quraans. Quraan is one has not changed since the beginning of Islam. There is a different between versions and translations. Quraan has many translations to help foreign learners but remains in it's Arabic original version and hasn't changed over the years. For example, the bible was mainly written in Hebrew with few chapters written in Archaic Hebrew, then the New testament was in Greek and then into English, Arabic and other languages. See how many times it changed? This translation journey over centuries must have created minor differences in meaning between the very original bible and the bible you have now. But this is not the case with Quraan. It has not been completely translated in another language and then translation again based on the translated version of the original book. And if you mean the Qira'at (Recitations) there are 10 Readings (7 fixed and 3 completions for the seven) of Quran WITHOUT any differences in meaning. The scientists only differ with linguistic, lexical, phonetic, morphological and syntactical forms. And these readings techniques varied only because of different dialects as Islam grew in the world. Hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "There's a very simple explanation for this, that Jay Smith will certainly not tell you. The Quran is in 7th century Arabic. The 26 translations Jay Smith dramatizes over are simply translations from the original 7th century Arabic to modern 21st century arabic, by various translators. It's similar to how we have numerous translations of Shakespeare's work. Shakespeare's work is in English, but it's in old english. One can buy countless study guides that translate his words into modern English so we can understand. There are also translations into different Arabic dialects. We can consider this even with English as well. There's subtle differences between UK English, American english, Australian English, South African English etc. ",
