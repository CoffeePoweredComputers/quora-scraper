            "answer_text": "The question for me: Did Aristotle knew of his pupil, Alexander\u2019s anomaly of homosextuality? This remains a matter of conjecture\u2014but irresistible to speculate about nevertheless. So if he did then in my view he is in no uncertain terms to claim that he is virtuous, and his The Nicomachean Ethics which is a book about virtue disqualifies Aristotle\u2019s claim, and thus to the astonishing disgust and dismay of many, Aristotle\u2019s book is a manifestation of hypocrisy and double standard, that is IF (and no fact begins with IF), repeat, IF Aristotle knew about the abnormality of Alexander, condoned it, and did compromise the ethical principles concerning good and bad behavior in men. On the other hand, if Aristotle did not know of the anti-nature attributes and characteristics of Alexander, then by all means he is a virtuous person and his The Nicomachean Ethics is a complete and carefully written book. for this reason, among others, it has often been held to be Aristotle\u2019s greatest work. The Ethics is a book about virtue\u2014about good and bad people, and about good and bad actions. \u201cvirtue\u201d is not a popular word today, but the idea it names, and the problems to which it points, are inescapable. Can we simply avoid asking ourselves whether, in this situation or in that, we are doing the right or the wrong thing? And however blind we may be to ourselves, we are all prone to judge others and to declare that so-and-so is a good person, and someone else is a bad one. Of course, we recognize, too, a combination of good and bad in most people, and wonder how to increase the good and decrease the bad in ourselves. Aristotle is a great help to us, provided as I specifically and categorically pointed above, and it is primarily for this reason that The Nicomachean Ethics is such a valuable book. He begins by saying, simply\u2014and sensibly\u2014that virtue is a habit: an habitual disposition, as he calls it, to choose rightly rather than wrongly. The good and the bad, the right and the wrong among actions, of course, not things. One can be a judge of wines, or investments, and still be a thoroughly bad person. A good person, Aristotle says, is a person who does good things, and not just once or twice but all or at least most of the time. How to become virtuous, if we are not so already? Well there are rules that can be followed, and Aristotle devotes many pages to them. Mostly they have to do with choosing the mean between two extremes of action. Courage, for example, is a virtue; to lack courage is to be cowardly, and that is one extreme; but to have too much courage, to be rash, is also a mistake, and the habitually rash person is not admired (although he is probably more admired than a coward). Similarly with prudence and temperance: there are extremes of each, and virtue lies in the middle way. In another sense, Aristotle reminds us, there is no such thing as being too prudent, too temperate, too courageous. When we realize that to be courageous is to choose\u2014habitually, not just once or twice\u2014as a courageous man chooses, but that is never rashly or in a cowardly way, then we comprehend that we cannot be too courageous, although we may be less than we would like to be. And so with all the other moral virtues. But there lies a great problem, says Aristotle, moral choices are not made in a vacuum; every situation is almost infinitely complicated, with consequences that reach out to touch the lives of many other persons, now and in the future. So complex, indeed, is every choice we face, that we must almost conclude that each choice is unique. The argument is circular, Aristotle admits: although it is true that good actions are ones that are performed by good people, it is equally true that good people are those who perform good actions. So it was in Athens 2,500 years ago, and so it is today. ",
