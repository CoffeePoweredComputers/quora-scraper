            "answer_text": "Is all logic ultimately circular? No, but according to the Anglo-Austrian philospher Ludwig Wittgenstein it is ultimately tautological. The difference? Circular reasoning goes like this: Memphis is in Tennessee, therefore Memphis is in Tennessee. Or like a young friend of mine said when I told him they had found water on the moon, \u201cBut they can\u2019t find water on the moon because there\u2019s no water on the moon!\u201d Circular reasoning is a violation of the rules of logic and reasoning, because the conclusion of an argument cannot be used as a premise of the argument. A tautology is different. In a tautology, the predicate restates the subject, but is in different wording. \u201cAll bachelors are unmarried men\u201d is a tautology. We learn nothing new after the \u201care\u201d. If I had written, \u201cAll bachelors are rich\u201d, that is not a tautology. The idea of \u201crich\u201d is not contained in \u201cbachelor\u201d, but \u201cunmarried man\u201d is. All math problems are tautologies. The answer is contained in the problem: 2+3=5. \u201c2+3\u201d and \u201c5\u201d are equivalent. \u201c5\u201d merely restates \u201c2+3\u201d. It doesn\u2019t tell you anything new. \u201cAll dogs have tails. Fido is a dog. Therefore Fido has a tail.\u201d This is a tautology. The information \u201cFido has a tail\u201d is already contained in the two premises. This is why, I think, Wittgenstein said all logic is ultimately tautological. But it is definitely not circular.

            "answer_text": "Definitions are ultimately circular. Set Theory is a form of logic that can be used to construct classical logic, without which, the concept of Modus Ponens would never be defined, which is the very description for subset in set theory. Bring Category Theory in, and you add to the \u201cprimordial goop\u201d from which modern logic constructs itself. Alone, axiomatically, logic suffers no circulatory with other systems, but instead requires invariants that must be assumed to use. These definitions for primitive notions are indeed circular, without some notion to construct them. Somewhere, something must be understood as a primitive concept. In that since, you must understand primitive concepts intuitively, and in concert. ",
