            "answer_text": "What is ethics and integrity? That is something which in Catholic Schools were taught by some of the religious principles which were interpreted by the \u201cTen Commandments.\u201d Those laws were meant to be understood and implemented in everyone\u2019s home. It\u2019s hard to realize not all schools were taught ethics and integrity. I do believe when teachers in public schools were discussing certain figures of authority such as Lewis and Clark or George Washington our First President - those principles of ethics and integrity came to be discussed because these were men of integrity and how they dealt with situations which they had to be of strong convictions.

I\u2019m dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It\u2019s the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they\u2019re going to do something incredibly\u2026 stupid\u201d Jack is integral but not ethical. ",
