            "answer_text": "Race 3 is a mere show-reel for Salman Khan fans. Poorly directed, with a ridiculous plot and sub-par acting, this is a new low for the superstar. Rating: 1/5.  Race 3Director - Remo D\u2019SouzaCast - Salman Khan, Bobby Deol, Jacqueline Fernandez, Anil Kapoor, Saqib Saleem, Daisy ShahRating - 1/5 During one of the many forced fist fights in Race 3, Salman Khan is getting the better of his opponents when he is hit by a rod. He smirks, turns towards the camera and punches the enemy in face as if he is punishing the man for not recognising the Bhai of Bollywood. The camera doesn\u2019t cut to the rod, which, I am sure, is broken in half by now. Such is Salman\u2019s unparalleled rage and such is the vision of director Remo D\u2019Souza. Race 3 is everything film students are taught not to do, but then what do they know? From the first scene in which Anil Kapoor blows up a gang member with the help of a pen bomb to Salman coming to the rescue of his family in a base-jump suit, Race 3 unabashedly targets the fans. There isn\u2019t any pretension of logical filmmaking or sound screenplay. It seems Race 3 categorically wants the non-Salman fans to mind their own business. Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor), a runaway criminal from a village near Allahabad, has built an empire in Al-Shifa Island in the Middle East, which was bought by his elder brother for difficult days. Sikander alias Sikku (Salman Khan) is Shamsher\u2019s stepson who runs his illegal arms\u2019 business. Sanjana (Daisy Shah) and Suraj (Saqib Saleem) are Shamsher\u2019s other kids. There is an intra-family rivalry going on among all of them for the control of business and assets. But they don\u2019t know \u2018iss khel ka asli Sikander kaun hai (who is the real boss of this game)\u2019. You have seen the trailer, right? Let\u2019s get back to the race, I mean the story, which starts, speeds up and finishes with black SUVs, airborne fighters and a barrage of bullets. Consider this example: Sanjana, the cool-headed MMA champ, and Suraj, a mostly screaming psychotic gangster who likes to break beer bottles on his own head, are trapped in the den of an adversary. Shamsher isn\u2019t worried about his children because \u201cSikander tak message pahuch chukka hai (The message has reached Sikander).\u201d You know what that means? This means the killing of more than 10 dozen weapon-wielding trained bodyguards and a song thrown in between. The icing on the cake is Saqib\u2019s reaction to his rescue, \u201cWhat the hell bro!\u201d Exactly, what the hell! No wonder, Salman introduces himself as, \u201cMy name is Sikander, Sikander Singh.\u201d He is James Bond with tonnes of extra confidence. Before I forget, he is Oxford-educated as well. Dialogues in the film play on a different level altogether. Just when you thought nothing could surpass \u2018My business is my business, none of your business,\u2019 Daisy Shah comes up with another gem: \u2018Isko dil nahi Dell khol ke dikhao (Don\u2019t open your heart, switch on your Dell laptop)\u2019.  Lamborghini, Ferrari, Bentley -- you name it and D\u2019Souza will blow it up for you. He is so obsessed with blasts in the film that he doesn\u2019t mind blasting a tree if he doesn\u2019t find anything else. Not that Race and Race 2 were classics, but Race 3 has taken things too far. Remo D\u2019Souza\u2019s idea of a dysfunctional family is far more juvenile than Abbas-Mustan\u2019s. Then there are shirtless people, undercover agents with outrageously simple plans and a twist that does more harm than help. By the end of it, Race 3 turns so bad that you can\u2019t help but laugh nervously. Let me simplify it for you: A bad guy, who was initially presented as the most powerful person on the planet, challenges Sikander in dual. After being punched for a couple of times, he is lying in the pool of blood. Sikander, meanwhile, is taking care of other business. The fallen guy says something from behind a big black car. Of course, Sikander doesn\u2019t like it, so what does he do? He simply pushes the car and it crushes the previously powerful guy. So simple. Gloss and glam are expected to mask an appalling film, but it\u2019s really difficult to sit through 160-minutes of terribly bad filmmaking. Even Tom Struthers\u2019 (Tiger Zinda Hai, Dunkirk) action choreography is dull. As for the rest of the cast is concerned, I feel for Bobby Deol and Jacqueline Fernandez Race 3 is a mere show-reel for Salman Khan fans. Celebrating Eid at home is likely to entertain you more.
