            "answer_text": "Radioactive decay is undetermined, uncaused, truly random according to our best physical theories, so undetermined events do occur. However, quantum level events such as this average out at large scales and our actions are determined. If our actions were not determined we would be unable to function and we would die. I don\u2019t think people who ask questions like this realise what \u201cdetermined\u201d and \u201cundetermined\u201d mean. ",

            "answer_text": "We can make decisions and act accordingly. Our actions are not all mere spinal reflexes caused by past events. We do things for a purpose, for a better future instead. We are able to consider multiple possible future scenarios and choose which way we want the world to go. There is nothing deterministic in reality. Instead, there is a lot of randomness and uncertainty. ",
