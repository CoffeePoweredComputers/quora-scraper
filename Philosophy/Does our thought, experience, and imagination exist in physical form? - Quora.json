            "answer_text": "Does our thought, experience, and imagination exist in physical form? I will respond with another question, and let you decide. Does the alleged physicality of the world exist only in our thought, as a result of our experience? In the end this is a key metaphysical point, and one that cannot be given a \u2018true\u2019 answer. This is important. This is where we step off what can be proven, and on to a matter of metaphysical choice - almost like a religious choice. The Realists believe - or act as if they believed\u2026that the \u2018real\u2019 nature of Life, the Universe and Everything is physical, and because they assume that, their model of thought, experience, and imagination has to be that it is an emergent property of underlying physical processes. In the same way that the behaviour of a computer program is \u2018just electrons in silicon\u2019. Without the physical computer, the program will not run.. However this is not the only school of metaphysics on offer. Throughout history we have had the Idealists - broadly speaking\u2019 those who hold that Life, the Universe, and Everything is in fact at its heart, Mind - the Universe is just one huge thought - possibly God\u2019s thought at that. Or our own thought. Now of course if we are really clever - or God is really clever - at thinking, then this is completely indistinguishable, in a Matrix sort of way, from a real, physical world. So why would we bother with this unnecessarily complex way of thinking about the world? Occam and all that..Well the answer is that Realism has problems. More so since we hit quantum reality. Of course so too does Idealism but there is, to quote Ouspensky, a Third Way - a mixture of both, so to speak, and that is the \u2018transcendental idealism\u2019 of the German philosophers. Principally Kant and Shopenhauer. Their position is that whilst we cannot deny the r\u00f4le of the human mind in interpreting its experience and creating a world-view, it is excessive to say that it is the only agency involved. Kant uses the idea of \u2018things in themselves\u2019 as distinct from \u2018things in our perception\u2019 . Schopenhauer corrects this to \u2018the one thing in itself\u2019 - since as he points out, applying Kant\u2019s logic that until we have applied the mental construct of Number to the world, it does not and cannot consist of separate objects. The world is one vast complex Mysterious Thing (Shopenhauer\u2019s Will). What this does is to add a new dimension to metaphysics. Instead of it\u2019s \u2018all mind, and physicality is just a thought\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s all matter and thinking is just physical\u2019 we now have an (un?)holy trinity, of the world as we understand it to be, being, so to speak, (and I am using modern language here rather than the language available to Kant) the intersection of two orthogonal dimensions. What do I mean by this? Let us posit two realms, neither of which has any impact on the other. We are already familiar with this in terms of science as the principle of the \u2018detached observer\u2019 where thinking about something physical does not alter what it becomes or how it behaves. I.e. magic does not work. This is in fact the primary problem with pure Idealism, that thinking does not affect the physical world\u2026but anyway, we have our two realms that are independent but when we apply one to the other, what emerges from thinking about whatever the world really is, we get a worldview (Weltaunschung) That is, a picture (a) mind has, of a reality it can never know directly, and this picture is in fact the \u2018physical world\u2019 that we take for real. In short, reality is Out There Somewhere, but we cannot comprehend it, unless we reify it - that is we turn it into things, separated from each other in space and time, but linked together also by natural forces and causality. Now this view - and it\u2019s my own take on Kant, and probably will be criticised- this moves things, space, time, natural forces and laws, and causality out of the physical world, into the other dimension of mind. They are not part of the \u2018real world\u2019 but part of the way in which we apprehend it. As Korzybski points out, \u201cthe map, is not the territory\u201d. That is: the physical world that we take for real, is not the real thing, it is a map of the real thing. And things, space, time, natural forces and laws, and causality are how we draw the map, not \u2018in the territory\u2026of the real thing\u2019. This is a view that I have elucidated at some length because it seems to me it may be a more useful view that Realism when applied especially to Quantum physics. Here quantum, reality is so to speak, \u2018the thing in itself\u2019 and all the \u2018things \u2018 of classical Physics - Matter-Energy, Space-Time, Natural Law and Causality - are inventions that helped us develop a picture, where science could be done, but have now gone past their sell by date as absolute qualities of the world, rather than just our way of understanding it. In this model, thinking and experience are quite distinct from the physical world. What you have to understand, is that all the things are just ways of thinking about thinking so to speak. Notions. The world is what it is. Whether what we experience in normal consciousness is the way it really is, or our particular way of interpreting it, is in the end a matter of choice whose truth content is indecidable. However that doesn\u2019t leave us entirely without the ability to make a value judgement. In terms of science we can ask the questions as of any scientific hypothesis - does it lead to a more useful picture, always acknowledging that all theories are in fact pictures\u2026whose truth content is indecidable. Karl Popper made that point clearly. We can only disprove scientific hypotheses, never prove them correct. The sun has always risen every day, but that is never a guarantee that it will tomorrow. All science is about reliable pictures. So in the end the mind/matter debate resolves ot to a question of truth, but to a question of the choice of particular metaphysical model you adopt, and how useful or not that model is in construction of scientific - or indeed religious - theories. In the latter context it has been noted how similar Schopenhauer\u2019s conclusions are to those of Eastern mysticism. His \u2018representation\u2019 is the \u2018Maya\u2019 of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy. \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 consists in understanding that it is just a model, not reality itself, and therefore subject to human failings.

            "answer_text": "\u2026 does our thought, experience, and imagination exist in physical form? \u2026 yes. \u2026 all thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and experiences have their own discrete physical realities within which they are always real and always manifest as physical forms. all of the physical forms that you perceive are really artifacts of your mind and your emotional and cognitive habits. your body is a set of bio-feedback mechanisms that intensify your mind\u2019s powers to perceive and manipulate information by re-processing information from its senses. your body is an artifact of your mind that behaves like a lens to focus your awareness. anything you can imagine becomes another artifact of your mind. your mental artifacts are collected into universes; you own many universes that are all artifacts of your mind. you exist as yourself in all of these universes simultaneously because your mind always transcends space-time. \u2026 space and time are really just ways to process information; they are cognitive tools whose realities only exist in context with whatever you imagine. this does not mean that the people you meet on the street are less real than yourself, although many people may mistakenly come to that conclusion with sometimes dire or unpleasant consequences. all people\u2019s minds work alike, even if they cannot agree upon how their minds work if they try to discuss the inner workings of their minds with other people. the necessary language with which to competently discuss the inner workings of people\u2019s minds is still emerging; languages must evolve much more before people will be able to communicate their thoughts about their thoughts with any consistent agreement or clarity. however, there are tricks to help access the necessary words and then help encourage their emergence to evolve. \u2026 for one thing, and back to the heart of your question, these words we are typing now already existed before we typed them. we listened to you reading these words to help us write them. we watched these words appearing before your eyes on your screen; we could see their general structure and then improve upon it as we worked. nifty trick, eh? \u2026 these words then became physical artifacts as we typed them by becoming patterns of electron states in magnetic storage disks or by becoming patterns of pits on laser discs, or by becoming patterns of electrons in solid-state memory, etc\u2026 and who knows? some sweet soul might even print these words on paper! the point is, when we channel a message like this we can hear it being silently spoken aloud in the minds of the people who read it. this message already existed in many physical states before we ever wrote it. we just listen to it in other people\u2019s minds and then try to give it words with our own mind like a musician playing harmony in a band when they don\u2019t know the melody. when we get in the desired harmonic groove then the words just seem to flow out of our fingertips as if by magic. every thought, every idea pertains to a specific reality because all physical realities are the by-products or artifacts of the people who imagine them. you can give birth to entire civilizations with your mind like every other great artist who has ever imagined other worlds or re-imagined familiar worlds in unfamiliar ways. namaste \u2026 the realities you perceive are real to you alone; this is true for everyone. however, consensus realities help you to shape your perceptions of your personal realities so that your own unique realities appear to be virtually identical with the realities of other people when you try to compare or contrast them. consensus realities enable personal realities to be inter-operable. consensus realities are artifacts of collective consciousness; consensus realities are formed whenever two or more people examine or interact with the same thing. whatever that thing may be, it always pre-existed in their minds before becoming an artifact that might be shared. \u2026 in essence, you are a steward for all of your universes and for all of the people, places, plants, and animals in your universes because you own their physical representations of themselves in your universes. what you do not own are the minds with which other people and other beings may communicate with you. you can only own your personal interpretations of their efforts to communicate; your interpretations will always be partly mistaken until you can learn to identify and clear out your personal biases as an interpreter of shared experiences or events. \u2026 as a steward you owe your respect to everyone and everything in your worlds. you will have to make painful decisions, who should live, who should die. in some people\u2019s universes you may be slaughtered outright, you may be deemed unwelcome, you may be forbidden to return upon punishment of death. even a deity may be banished by its own creations, by its own people. \u2026 you may make such decisions about whom to murder or banish for life in your own universes, but if you break your own local social conventions you may not escape punishment for your actions. all social consequences remain real, even if you only imagine them, because social consequences are the only things of true value. if you fail to behave in a civil manner then civilization will fail you. reality is really just a game that we must all learn to play fairly or else no one will get to win; when everyone plays fairly, then everyone wins. namaste \u2026 -enjoy! love, the grigs\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Dictionaries can help: physical of or relating to the body, as distinguished from the mind or spiritMaybe thought, subjective experience and imagination are somehow physical, but we certainly haven\u2019t the evidence for that yet. What we can reasonably say is that a brain\u2014and so the body\u2014is most plausibly absolutely necessary to have any thought, subjective experience and a capacity of imagination, but this is not quite saying that these things are physical. Still, even if they are not physical, that does not logically imply that they are not of the same nature as physical things. Sometimes, the right thing to do is to admit that we don\u2019t know, and in this case that we may never know. Well, it does not matter a bit. We don\u2019t actually need to know to survive and prosper in this physical world. ",
