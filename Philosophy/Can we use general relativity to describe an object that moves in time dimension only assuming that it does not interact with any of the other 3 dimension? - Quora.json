            "answer_text": "No, General Relativity is all about the geometry of space & time which makes a space-time metric in which all the reference frame and observations are taken in respect with space and time both because there aren't different.  The every object which as a mass will bend space-time curvature so there cannot be a some object that move with respect of only time. But psychological you can take a example of sleeping in which you don't moves with regards if space but times will fly off always. But don't take it seriously even this is also wrong\ud83d\ude09 because you stills bend the curvature\ud83d\ude29, Hehe! ",

            "answer_text": "Regardless of the properties of the Universe you inhabit, your motion through space and time cannot be treated separately from one another; you need them both, together, to describe your reality. Minkowski took a giant leap forward when he realized, mathematically, that moving through time behaves exactly as moving through space does, except with two additional multiplicative factors: c, the speed of light in a vacuum, and i, the imaginary number \u221a(-1).

            "answer_text": "It is not possible. If it is an \u2018object\u2019 then it is made of matter, and has mass, and so occupies space. In which case it interacts with the spatial dimensions. Furthermore, moving only in \u2018time\u2019 is not possible because everything in the universe is in motion through spacetime. Nothing in the universe is at \u2018absolute\u2019 rest. ",

            "answer_text": "General relativity is motion in spacetime, not just time. Space does not exist without time. One cannot formulate Einstein's field equations in just temporal form, where the Einstein tensor G has only the time index, and the energy-momentum tensor T is also temporal. Such equation has no dynamics, since motion involves mass and intersects spatial axes. So, this is not possible. ",
