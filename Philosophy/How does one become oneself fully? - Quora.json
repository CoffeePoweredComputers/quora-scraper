            "answer_text": "Not sure if this answer will make sense and if the philosophy of evolution and devolution makes sense when walking the \u201cjourney of becoming oneself fully!\u2019 So here goes, anyway! We live in a World of Delusion: This, our mortal world is a world of delusion and ignorance because of which beings lack discretion and engage in desire-ridden actions triggered through and made possible through the Muladhara Chakra (where we are 'unconscious' to Truth); and Swadhisthana Chakra (where we are subconsciously greedy.) The Law of Karma (Law of Cause and Effect) therefore bind us to the cycle of births and deaths, causing us human suffering. To enter the Spiritual Path, we all enter the Path of Knowledge to experience deep integrity and a changed life style. After we have lived a changed lifestyle of first niyama and then yama: niyama are observances of positive duties or observances in life; yama are recommended activities and habits for healthy living, spiritual enlightenment and liberated state of existence.Together they define Hinduism as a \"Way of Life\" through righteous conduct of morality and ethics. We understand we have passed through levels of unconscious (Muladhara) and subconscious (Swadhisthana.) Our consciousness now reaches the third level, at the Manipura Chakra. At the Manipura Chakra more than of half the journey towards 'realisation of Truth' is complete. Arrival here is an important stage on the spiritual path because Consciousness unfolds in the Manipura Chakra. It is now time to meet with a realized Master or Guru who arrives from nowhere 'through the Power of Thoughts.' The indwelling feminine presence of the Divine in the Jewish tradition, Navadurga's Nine goddess manifestations, and Teresa of Avila, in the Christian tradition: illuminate a radiant path to the center of our own being to be oneself; and show us the way to carry that light into the shadowed world. https://www.thoughtco.com.
