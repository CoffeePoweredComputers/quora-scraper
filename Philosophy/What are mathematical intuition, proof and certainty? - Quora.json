            "answer_text": "Certainty is almost never absolute, although in mathematics it\u2019s possible to come close. Relative certainty is the likelihood of something being close to 100%. Proof can be either informal proof or formal proof. Informally, proof is evidence and reasoning that provides certainty of something. A formal proof is an argument that follows a set of rules that in principle could be checked mechanically. It establishes that its conclusions can be reached while following the given rules. Intuition is an umbrella term for the mental processes that generates a perception that something is likely to be true. (People use it to mean something more specific sometimes.) It is possible to say that a person has an intuition when they also have a proof; mathematicians often refer to the \u201cintuition behind a proof\u201d. The intuition serves to grease the wheels of your understanding of the proof as it were. The intuitive stories that accompany mathematical proofs are important to the development of mathematics. If you have a proof, though, and you say only that you have an intuition that the result proven is true, it would be a little like saying you \u201chope\u201d you can get a sandwich for lunch, when you already have your sandwich. It might be correct, but it will seem odd. So if someone mentions only an intuition and not a proof, it tends to imply that it\u2019s merely an intuition without an accompanying demonstration. Intuitions sometimes come in the form of a \u201cheuristic\u201d, which is a kind of approximation to the truth. The prime numbers for example are not random, but they are a little bit like they are random. There are some results which seem intuitive because for them to be false, the primes would have to behave in an unusual non-random way. For example, the Goldbach conjecture says that each even number greater than 2 is a sum of two primes. We can check that this is true for small even numbers. It seems intuitive that it is true, and we have a heuristic as to how many different ways that an even number can be written as a sum of two primes. It is not just that each even number greater than 2 is a sum of two primes, but that they can be written as a sum of two primes in an increasing number of different ways as the number increases. ",
