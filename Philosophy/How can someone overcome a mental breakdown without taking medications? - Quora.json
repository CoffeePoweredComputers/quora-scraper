            "answer_text": "People with mental problems usually feel uncomfortable with themselves and are looking to understand themselves better, accept themselves and stop isolating themselves. There are many practices you can engage in for free to understand yourself better, learn to accept yourself and create more satisfying relationships. These are practices which means the more regularly you do them, the more benefit you will gain. Here are a few: Tell your story to people willing to listen either in story telling gatherings or support groups or meet-upsTell your story to a free therapist who may or may not provide guidance or advice. It's hard to find free therapy, but it does exist.Meditate regularly and observe your mind as it thinks. Learn to notice what it does and use that information to start thinking in a more focused way.Engage in creative activities and learn to notice what your mind seems interested in.Study your past and write about it. Look for patterns that keep occurring to this day.Seek out groups or situations where people follow guidelines designed to make it safe to reveal your vulnerabilities. These include keeping everything confidential, non-judgment, equal time for everyone, acceptance of all kinds of people.Do fun things regularly. These will help you relax and be more accepting of yourself.Stay away from situations where people are critical of others or judge anyone in any way.Only do things with others where you enjoy what you are doing. Avoid situations where the only activity is talking about yourself to one other person. Those situations put a lot of pressure on people to act differently from normal, whereas when you enjoy what you are doing, you act more like yourself. Others also act like themselves and that is a better way to find out about a person.",

            "answer_text": "Please forgive the directness, but I think you deserve the truth as I see it. You would deal with a mental illness without medication or a psychologist the same way you would deal with a heart condition with no medication or professional assistance. The body has a control center and that is our brain it\u2019s an organ. Logically - it requires care and I would take the leap and say it probably requires more help than the rest of the body because it is our control center. Best of blessings - I understand where you are coming from I am not a big fan of psychopharmacology either. If you have trouble with resources you might go to county mental health. ",

            "answer_text": "The breakdown is most likely not caused by EPDS (Expensive Pharmaceutical Deficiency Syndrome), therefore, there\u2019s no obvious need for medication. And the cause of the breakdown is most likely in the domain of the narrative\u2026 a crisis of meaning or loss on the level of narrative. This breakdown can likely be resolved in the domain of language. In the Modern West, science is king, and science today is scientific materialism\u2026 in which a fundamental assumption taken for granted is, \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it in a lab, it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d This means you and I are frisky dirt, and any intervention issuing forth from that context will be physical. Brain is king, and mind is an epiphenomenon\u2026 this is why you even ask your question. It comes from the Modern World. Consider you are a house with four rooms (a more understandable model than the biopsychosocial model presented in med school): PhysicalMentalEmotionalSpiritualA psychograph is an assessment of your level along each of these lines of development\u2026 from superior to average to sick.. and let that inform your plan. Medication is a fraction of the physical room, along with sleep, diet, exercise, aromatherapy, acupuncture, massage, etc\u2026 Let me know if this broader perspective reveals anything and empowers you in your search for wholeness and completion.

You might get help by talking to a trusted friend? It may be \u201ctalking therapies\u201d or a psychologist would help. If by \u201cMental Breakdown\u201d you mean a loss of function, such as you are unable to work, not attending to personal hygiene, losing weight, not sleeping then you need medical help. It is possible but unlikely you will be assisted by \u201ctalking therapies\u201d but in general when you cease to function you need the help of a doctor (not a psychologist). ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the cause of the mental breakdown. You can have a mental breakdown in your life without being mentally ill BUT if you have an illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar, medication is not negotiable. You will need to find healthy outlets for your emotions. This can be anything from exercise to a hobby or group class. Therapy can help you overcome this as well so I highly recommend it. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes it is not possible to overcome an actual break down without medical assistance and medication due to the fact the that the neural network can be disturbed beyond repair without a boost. The natural spark between neurons must take place for the body to heal from a mental breakdown and there is no shame connected to this process. If the body is healthy and can heal on its own, it would be unusual to have a complete mental break. ",
