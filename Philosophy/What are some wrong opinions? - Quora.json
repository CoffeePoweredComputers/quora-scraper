The Earth is Flat Point of Fact: Simple triangulation can prove that is wrong. We never visited the Moon. Point of Fact: Reflections from mirrors left there. Vaccines cause Autism Point of Fact: The two are not interlinked - one being a dosed biochemical and the other being a genetic abnormality. (Had they been acting on the same area - which they don\u2019t - they would have produce Autism in the next generation. (See Thalidomide) The Theory of Evoloution / Relativity isn\u2019t fact due to it\u2019s name. Point of Fact: Theories are scientifically proven scenarios that take all known facts and provide the closest accuracy trained scientists can provide. With Relativity and Evoloution, the only way they could be wrong is that an outlier could be found which doesn\u2019t fit the Theory - and even then, you would simply add a minor adjustment (as with Dark Matter / Feathered Dinosaurs) to strengthen the Theory. God Does/Doesn\u2019t Exist. Point of Fact: There is as much evidence that God exists as there is that God doesn\u2019t. This is not an opinion, but a belief. Beliefs can be true regardless of facts - so neither is a wrong opinion - but neither is a fact either. We simply do not have the ability to prove/disprove the existence. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t believe these - just that hard facts disprove most of them - and you would have to disprove these simple facts to have it accepted. Facts are scientifically proven scenarios that can be tested by individuals outside the scientific . Thanos was right. Point of Fact: Thanos killed more than half - destroying his own ideal. It was only the snap that killed half. The problems that he was espousing were caused by the exponential increase of life versus resources. His soloution was an arithmetic one. For Thanos to be right, he would have to use the Infinity Gauntlet every time the population doubled again, so he could never rest. ",

            "answer_text": "I would really like to tell you that wrong opinions are anything that comes out of Hillary Clinton\u2019s mouth that hasn\u2019t already been shown to be simply a lie. Unfortunately, opinions really cannot be right or wrong. If I were to say that the Earth was flat, that would not be an opinion, that would be factually flawed; it would be wrong. If I were to say that Earth is a miserable place to live, that would be an opinion. An opinion is an expression of one\u2019s feeling on a particular topic, different from fact. Opinions really can\u2019t be wrong by definition. ",
