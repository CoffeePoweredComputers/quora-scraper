            "answer_text": "To follow God we must crucify the old and carry the new. Meaning we are forgiven for sins but that doesn't give us the free pass to keep slapping God in the face with purposeful sin. Sexual immorality is a sin like any other sin and to follow God one must repent and refrain from acting on such sin. If one claims to be a Christian but their sins never improve or their life never conforms to the will of God, then they are a false believer and destined to hell just as any other non repentant sinner.
