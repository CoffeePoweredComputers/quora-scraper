            "answer_text": "Question: Is life what we make or live in fate? God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God has enabled people to choose their own destinations. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. The Muslim scholars who teach that the fate of people had been determined before they were born and before they had any chance to do good or bad are mistaken; they ignore the basic Qur\u2019an verses like 4:147, 4:152, 6:48, 6:54, 17:15, 45:15,43:72, 16:35, 19:63, 19:76, 20:112, 34:50, 37:39, 39:41, 39:70, 40:17, 47:17, 55:60, 56:24, and 18:107 The verses teach that God does not predestine people\u2019s fate but gives them the choice either to obey and do good deeds or to rebel and do evil deeds; there is no punishment for those who choose to obey and to thank God. The Muslim scholars who teach that Islam is the only true religion are mistaken; they have been ordered to believe in what has been revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets as taught in Qur\u2019an verses 3:84, 4:136, 4:152 and 42:13 Prophets did not teach predestination. Jesus did not teach predestination or predetermination. The only exceptions are the teachings of Paul who was not educated by Jesus and who taught the distorted teachings of predestination, original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law. The teachings of predestination were taught by Paul in Romans 8 , Ephesians 1, and 1 Corinthians 2:7 The distorted teachings of predestination and election of Augustine and Calvin are not based on the teachings of Jesus but are based on the wrong teachings of Paul. Jesus did not teach that a man is justified according to God\u2019s plan or by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses. Bad scholars do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and teach the attractive ones \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy with such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11. Most Christians do not follow the strict teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018We have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9 Most Christians do not follow the strict teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most Christians believe that Jesus\u2019 death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. But Jesus, like all other prophets, taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. No sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Matthew 25:31-45, Luke 15:11-32, and Luke 6:36-37 https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-say-and-feel-about-Jesus-Christ-and-his-atonement/answer/Sabri-Shahin The wrong teachings about predestination, original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law were taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus. How can you validate my claims? The best advice is to ask God to guide us to the truth. The door is open for everyone to experience divine intervention The wise and merciful father keeps his door open for his children God has more wisdom and mercy than any wise merciful father People can communicate with God at any time Prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have urged us to ask God and taught that God answers the prayers of the obedient believer. Example verses are: Psalm 107:28-30, Psalm 18:6, Psalm 145:18, 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 58:9 Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Luke 6:27-28, James 4:2, Qur\u2019an 2:186, Qur\u2019an 40:60 Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. I have spent years wondering about what the purpose of life is. I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. I had some doubts about the teachings of a certain teacher, I have prayed to God to guide me to the truth I saw in a very clear dream that teacher in a form of a criminal prisoner, has committed evil, waiting for his trial. In another dream I saw a wolf hiding after attacking sheep; I understood that message as the bad teacher who try to mislead people by the bad teachings as Jesus explained in Matthew 7:15-20 \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d. I also remembered the Parable of the Weeds in which Jesus warned us about the enemy who insert false teachings into the scripture in Matthew 13:24-43 \u2018an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat\u2019 Pray and ask God to guide you about the teacher who claims that God does not exist; you will see him in a bad image Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who teaches that Jesus is God Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who claims that God tests us in this life and will reward us according to our obedience and good deeds Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who taught original sin, atonement, salvation not based on obedience but taught free salvation by a savior to die for our sins Again, do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. Isaiah 58:9 \u2018Then you will call, and God will answer. you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Yes! It\u2019s a little of both. First you determine how you live will unfold and the major experiences you want to have so that you can achieve the spiritual growth and learning that you and your Higher Self want to have. Once you are in the physical body, you tend to forget this simply because you do have free will and can \u201cplay\u201d with your plan and even change it. If it seems too ambitious, for example, you might not want to experience certain elements of an event, or even avoid it altogether, However, the consequences it you most likely will see the same issue come up many times until you \u201ctake the bull by the horns\u201d as they say and complete the action. It is more complicated than we would like. It is best to become the observer of events in your life so that you can see the events for what they really are - opportunities to grow and learn. It\u2019s really like a game you wanted to play - but a very challenging game, with incredible rewards (Spiritual Growth). You have the free will to move ahead at whatever speed you want. ",
