            "answer_text": "A real number is computable if there exists an algorithm that can approximate this real number to any degree of precision. Equivalently, but maybe more intuitively, if there is an algorithm such that if you run it long enough, you can obtain any digit in its decimal expansion. A standard example is [math]\\pi[/math]. See Senia Sheydvasser's answer to How did we first know that pi is computable? Did we know that pi is computable before finding a formula for getting the nth digit, if the definition of computability is the ability to get the nth digit? Surprisingly, almost no real numbers are computable, despite the fact that almost all numbers you ever work with are. ",
