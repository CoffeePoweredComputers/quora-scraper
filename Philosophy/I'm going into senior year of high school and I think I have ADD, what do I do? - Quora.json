            "answer_text": "Go get diagnosed. It may take some effort at your age due to your peers\u2019 interest in ADD medications for study aids, so I suggest starting with a therapist, as someone who spends time talking to and observing you will be better able to make a respected diagnosis. Enlist teachers, collect old report cards; what are your parents\u2019 thoughts? My ADD was easy to track through elementary and middle school report cards because each teacher wrote a paragraph as well as assigned a number grade. Write your own diagnosis with supporting evidence to present to skeptics. Watch \u201cYou, Me and ADD\u201d for some ideas of the questions and what would be considered evidence. For instance, I was and had written evidence of: lack of impulse control, trouble getting started on assignments, smart but never prepared, lack of awareness of my classmates\u2019 wishes, talkative, difficulty modulating my volume (I had to practice whispering), sensitivity to noise and scratchy things (no zippers, seams, lace, labels, tight clothes, etc., thank you very much), and funny as all get out (I don\u2019t know if all class wits have ADD; I was just needing a \u2018win\u2019). I turned the train\u2026, well not around, but least on a better course, in my junior year so I was able to go to a good college (a student on a notable improvement course is a very attractive candidate). Part of my improvement was hormones and part was that reality always refocused my energy especially when I was working on what I wanted to do and going to college was definitely what I wanted. Do not despair if you are facing a less-than-stellar outcome to high school! You are still sooo young, even if you do have ADD, with your awareness, your future\u2019s so bright you oughta wear shades! ",

            "answer_text": "Talk with the school counselor at the next opportunity. In the meantime, some things to get you started: Read through the DSM V diagnostic criteria for ADD/ADHD. Symptoms and Diagnosis of ADHD | CDC Go through the information there, and make a list WITH EXAMPLES of what symptoms you believe you have. The more in-depth you can be, the better. Then go through how these symptoms affect your life and ability to do a variety of things. Some key things to focus on would be school, and work if you have a job, as well as basic care tasks such as showering or sleeping. Next go through all the things you do to help you manage those symptoms, and how effective you think they are (you can use a scale from 1\u201310, or just mark it as \u201ceffective,\u201d or \u201cineffective\" and WHY you marked it that way). Talk with your parents, try to get their support in seeking a diagnosis. Bring the information you've compiled above to your meeting with the school counselor. Try to present it as objectively as possible. Request assistance for next steps. If the counselor tries to brush this off, inform them that you are not asking for a specific diagnosis, but that these issues are affecting your quality of life and you are concerned that without it being addressed, you'll struggle more later. Getting a diagnosis as a teen is difficult. So be prepared to have to advocate for your own treatment. Parental support in this matter is EXTREMELY helpful. ",
