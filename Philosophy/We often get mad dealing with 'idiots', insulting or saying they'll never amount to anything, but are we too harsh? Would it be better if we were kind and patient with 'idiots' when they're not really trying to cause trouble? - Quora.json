Sort.of the same as 'idiot' or 'yokel'. One means someone who is an idiot because they don't know any better - an innocent idiot. The other means's someone who knows better but chooses to be an idiot - a malicious idiot. Obviously one of those deserves to be treated with kindness and educated. The other maybe isn't worth bothering with. ",

I\u2019m referring to the stuff you find on Facebook and Twitter - bombastic, bullying bullshit from people who are too dumb to know they\u2019re dumb. patience, courtesy and respect are virtues not known to these people and it\u2019s futile therefore putting it out there for them. by all means give it a go - kind and patient can do no wrong. But i figure that if my getting into a verbal stoush with one of these excites a flicker of intellectual fire in them then I\u2019ve maybe done more good than \u2018patient\u2019 or \u2018kind\u2019 could. To your question then: yes*. (* excluding bombastic, bullying nobheads) ",
