            "answer_text": "The answer is yes. And in fact, who has not found the meaning of human existence in this world? The importance of this question lies in, the type of answer found. Have you found the true meaning of human existence?  True meaning of human existence is - yes, you do exist. This life is achieved after a great penance, as the Hindu mythologies suggest. Once you are in the form of human, you have to live the life and do your duties. In Gita, Sri Krishna says: \"Jatasya hi dhruvo mritu dhruvam janmamritasya ca| Tasmadapariharyearthe na twam shochitumarhasi ||\" If you are born, you will die; it rests as the fact universal. However, in between, you have the inevitable discharge of humane duties that you have to comply with.  As human beings, we must lead this life happily and always help others. Don't think more about the paradoxes; if you keep thinking, you will miss the life!  ",
