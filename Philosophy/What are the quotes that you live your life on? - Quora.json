            "answer_text": "Not quotes, but poems. Two poems that I live my life on.  When I as a kid, my very religious mother taught me several slokas and I used to pray God by chanting them. When I was able to think for myself, I decided that chanting slokas was not the right way to pray. At that age, only marks mattered to me and I used to pray asking for better marks and more leisure hours at school to play. Then came a stage when I started exploring myself and identifying my affiliations. When it came to religion, I was lost. I knew, I was not an atheist, but I had issues in identifying myself as a theist. Finally, I settled down to believe that I am somewhere between a believer and an agnostic. I would just close my eyes for a few minutes and pretend to pray. When I started to earn for myself, I understood that neither marks nor money or other material comforts mattered in life . I was confused. I was wary of hurting people. I did not know to establish boundaries. I was an emotional mess. I did not know what to pray for. I used to mumble a feeble prayer for the well being of near and dear ones. Then, one day, I stumbled across this prayer in the internet. I was dumbfounded. Something in me lit up. It was my eureka moment, the moment of enlightenment. I found a sudden clarity and purpose in my actions, which fortunately is sustained until now. I do not succumb to any confusions now. These days, I offer a silent prayer to God to bless me with the emotional maturity and clarity to handle things in a better manner, even if they do not turn out the way, I intend them to be. Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting to you, The Serenity Prayer  Image source: Pinterest The Serenity Prayer is the common name for a prayer written by the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr (1892\u20131971). The best-known form is: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference. Niebuhr, who first wrote the prayer for a sermon at Heath Evangelical Union Church in Heath, Massachusetts, used it widely in sermons as early as 1934 and first published it in 1951 in a magazine column. The prayer spread both through Niebuhr's sermons and church groups in the 1930s and 1940s and was later adopted and popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step programs. Source - Wikipedia  The next one is the ever famous \u201cStopping by woods on a snowy evening\u201d The last four lines of this fantastic poem keeps me going when ever I am physically or emotionally tired and lose the urge to continue. These lines motivate me to check as many items as possible in my bucket list before I finally go to sleep. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. -Robert Frost ",
