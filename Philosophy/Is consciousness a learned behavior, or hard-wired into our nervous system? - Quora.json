            "answer_text": "There's a theory in social psychology that consciousness exists to train our \"skills\", which then operate automatically.   Social psychologists have much evidence that the vast majority of things that we do are done automatically and non-consciously.  For example, there are studies that show that explanations for actions are rationalizations (not actually explanations at all), and that we do not have control over our stereotype beliefs (see the Implicit Association Test at Harvard). If you believe--as many top social psychologists do--that most of the time we operate automatically/non-consciously, then the question arises: what is consciousness for? And so one theory is that consciousness exists to train our non-conscious minds so that we can more efficiently operate.  This is called \"skills training\" by some, because it's a bit like training for a sport--you have to focus for the first little while, but then muscle memory takes over and you're better if you don't think about it. So, to get back to the question, under this theory, consciousness is a biological state that we have in order to train our non-conscious minds so that we can be more efficient. ",

            "answer_text": "The principle parts of consciousness come, usually, intact. I am confident that an organism in utero experiences consciousness of nutritiomal necessity and supplication, growing pains associated with neurological and endocrinological development, and pain and fear in a sympathetic sense. Subsequently, we have to learn to adjust to perception and sensation in the world and this, probably, forms the basis for most people's understanding of consciousness. Little children are said to have very short attention spans. In my observation, they haven't yet grown one, or they haven't yet learned to articulate their sense for periods of time. From there our minds compoundingly develop antisymmetrically and omnigressively amidst chaos and constant change. I'm confident that all organisms are borne with some consciousness but it would take an insightful person to notice and a pervert to peer into it. Repeatedly, asked what the greatest invention of man was Einstein said \u201ccompounding interest.\u201d I don't know that I answered your question as posited, but I hope so. ",
