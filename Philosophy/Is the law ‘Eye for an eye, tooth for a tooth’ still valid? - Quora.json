            "answer_text": "Yes - but your question intimates that you do not understand the actual meaning of the phrase. Jewish law has its own rabbinical courts where issues such as who is responsible for causing a bodily injury may be judged. Very orthodox Jews would rather go there than to a civil court. The phrase HAS TO BE INTERPRETED as the Judaic religion interprets it ie if someone causes damage to a person's eye then that person is compensated by the offending party FINANCIALLY as adjudged by that rabbinical court; similarly for a tooth - you knocked out someones tooth > then you are now responsible to pay for his dental treatment to replace that tooth. There can be NO further bodily injury inflicted to compensate! ",
