            "answer_text": "In Avengers: Infinity War, Iron Man mentioned that Thanos has been in his head for the past 6 years. What does he mean? Let\u2019s take a look at Iron Man 6 years ago (Marvel\u2019s The Avengers(2012)) It started off normal. Iron Man fighting normal people (Rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agents), but then he faces gods and aliens.  Near the end of the battle, this is what he did:  He carried a nuke (Alone) on his back into where? The enemy territory, in space, a location not known to any human. His suit was malfunctioning, he was in a near-death situation, and what did he see?  An army of the aliens he just fought, ready to attack, and it looked like there was no end to it. This incident heavily affected Tony. A few months later, near Christmas 2012 (The movie was released in 2013), Tony Stark, the Invincible Iron Man has developed PTSD because of the incident in space.   His fear and anxiety, seeing an army more powerful than what Earth has to fight back changed the way Tony behave. He has become *slightly* mentally unstable. His \u2018hobby\u2019 since that incident was creating multiple, unique Iron Man armors (35 to be exact; Total at the time was 42, minus the previous 7 armors he has built before 2012). He normally spends most of his time working to protect the people he cares. Eventually, at the end of Iron Man 3, he destroyed all his armors, and it seemed like Pepper has \u2018cured\u2019 his anxiety attacks. But it didn\u2019t stop. In 2015, during the Age of Ultron incident, Scarlet Witch makes Tony see a hallucination of the event of 2012, but even worse.  Tony gets a closer look at the army going through the portal, heading for Earth. But that\u2019s not all. He sees his friends, The Avengers, dead. (I don\u2019t know about Hawkeye though. It looks like he\u2019s just sitting around. Can a dead person sit upright?). What\u2019s even worse is that Tony survives all this, when he could\u2019ve \u2018done more\u2019. So he does something like Christmas 2012, except worse.  He takes Loki\u2019s Scepter, containing the Mind Stone, and creates Ultron. A sentient killing machine that was originally meant to combat any invading aliens in the future. Ultron was supposed to be the Bouncer of Earth, meant to knock back any threats. But his idea failed and he created one of the world\u2019s greatest threat. This left a bad mark on Tony\u2019s history. During the movie, The Avengers got pretty mad at Tony. Thor got pissed and choked him. Cap was arguing with Tony at Clint\u2019s farm and fought him when creating Vision. Banner was a reluctant lab partner in creating Vision, and when the Battle of Sokovia ended, he did more foolish things and this happened:  The government saw the destructive capabilities of The Avengers and created the Sokovia Accords. This split the team apart. Tony, feeling immense regret and sorrow after creating Ultron chose to sign the accords. He was blinded by his failure and regret, it caused him to go against his friend Steve.  Their fight severed their relationship. Although Cap was ready to reconcile, Tony was reluctant. In the end, during the Infinity War, they lost against Thanos(Who has been stuck in his head for 6 years) because they weren\u2019t together. according to the Russo Brothers.  So in short, after being traumatized due to seeing the threat from the mastermind behind the Battle of New York (Thanos), he made bad and reckless decisions, and his life has been going downhill ever since. Every wrong turn, bad decision, things he would regret, it\u2019s all because of his fear of Thanos. \u201cMy only curse is you\u201d. He has PTSD, he became a workaholic, he created Ultron, which lead to the Accords, which lead to The Avengers splitting apart. ",

            "answer_text": "Avengers Infinity War is set in 2018 (the year it was released). This makes six years ago 2012. What happened in 2012? The events of Avengers Assemble. The events of the first Avengers movie turned Tony\u2019s world on its head. Prior to Avengers Assemble, Tony\u2019s only fights had been with generic terrorists, and armoured foes wearing rip-off Iron Man suits. Sure, Iron Monger and Whiplash were tough battles, but nothing he wasn\u2019t able to outthink. He was able to beat them largely on his own (Pepper, War Machine and Black Widow helped, but they were Tony\u2019s wins). He knew about Captain America, and he knew about The Hulk, but they were both very human, biological, scientific creations, things he could easily rationalise and understand with his own knowledge. Suddenly, a couple of gods turn up, and one of them is backed by an army of aliens and wielding a couple of Infinity Stones. First, Tony has to accept that gods (or near god-like beings of immense power) exist. Score one against his perception of reality. Second, Tony has to accept that aliens exist. I\u2019m sure he believed in aliens, but to see an army of them suddenly pour into New York City, and then have to fight those aliens, is something else entirely. Score two against his perception of reality. Thirdly, he comes into contact with two Infinity Stones. One of them is powerful enough to rip open the very fabric of space and create a portal to the other side of the universe, and the other is able to bend men's minds to its will with a simple tap on the chest. Both items of vastly more power than Tony has ever encountered before. Score three against his perception of reality. And then he flies a nuke through a wormhole and nearly dies. We see him reeling from the events of Avengers Assemble in Iron Man 3, where he\u2019s clearly suffering from PTSD. Nearly dying will do that to you. He\u2019s shaken, he knows he\u2019s suddenly not in control of anywhere near as much of the world as he thought he was. He starts making suit after suit after suit in an effort to protect himself, and then the Mandarin comes and blows it all up. After Iron Man 3, I think Tony is fairly confident in his own safety and security, and confident within himself, but he knows that if an alien army invades Earth once, it can do so again, and he goes into overdrive to protect the Earth. This is what leads him to create Ultron. He knows the Avengers can\u2019t be everywhere all the time, and that they\u2019ll all eventually die or leave or move on. He can\u2019t leave Earth undefended, and so he creates Ultron. The ultimate weapon, humanity\u2019s most valiant defender. And then Ultron turns on him. More people die, and this time it\u2019s directly on him. He tried to protect the world and ended up hurting it more. Then the Sokovia Accords happen. Tony sees another chance to ensure Earth\u2019s protection, by signing onto a law he thinks will save lives. Instead, the Avengers are splintered, and Cap ends up beating the crap out of him. So, when Tony says that Thanos has been in his head for six years, he doesn\u2019t literally mean Thanos, he means the concept of Thanos, the idea of him. The idea of an otherworldly, overpowering, hypothetical threat. Tony\u2019s been trying to fight this threat before he even knew what it was, and now it\u2019s finally arrived. His worst fears have been realised, and all his attempts to prepare for it have failed. ",
