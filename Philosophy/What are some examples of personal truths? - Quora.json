            "answer_text": "I\u2019m probably the wrong person to ask this question. I don\u2019t believe there is such a ;thing as a \u201cpersonal truth\u201d. The truth is the truth. If something is personal and capable of interpretation, it is subjective, and therefore not a \u201ctruth\u201d. Nobody\u2019s beliefs are absolute. A person\u2019s desires vary from day to day. Love can die. Loyalties can break and re-form. The way a person looks at the world can completely change due to trauma or experience. If \u201cmy truth\u201d and \u201cthe truth\u201d differ, then there is something wrong with \u201cmy truth\u201d. I am seeing \u201ctruth\u201d filtered through my desires and fears. This is not to say that a person cannot hold personal ideals, likes, dislikes, and even taboos. But these are not \u201ctruths\u201d. They are choices I make based on natural inclination, upbringing, education, leaning, and experience. They are not absolutes, or anything another person has to share or even respect. I might be psychotic or a sociopath, or simply stupid. I might be narcissistic and selfish. I might think that I am doing and thinking what is right, but so did the most evil people in history. If I choose a faith or philosophy, that is a shared belief system that I choose to adopt and make personal. But the system is not \u201cthe truth\u201d, simply things that a group of people choose to adopt and follow. The fact that there will always be other conflicting groups and ideas proves that what I hold dear is not \u201cthe truth\u201d or even \u201cmy truth\u201d. It is just my opinion. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but that belief is not a \u201ctruth\u201d either. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, personal truths cannot be just likes and dislikes, it has to be something more serious and lasting, based on two things: experience and long reflection; something that becomes like a second nature, not likely to be abandoned or changed for something else. These truths derive from, and are entrenched in, one's character. Hence a disposition to act in a certain way in given circumstances. Personal truths, thus, are another name for virtues, and if we are talking about truths, we are then considering something positive, as actuality or aim. Examples? Nobility is prior to enjoyment and is unconcerned with reputation (others' approval). No reward to be expected without some previous sacrifice, such as effort and perseverance (be ready to post-pone enjoyment/rewards). Better to give than to receive. Avoid laziness... ",
