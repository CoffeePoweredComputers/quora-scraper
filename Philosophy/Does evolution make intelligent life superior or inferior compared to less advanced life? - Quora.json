            "answer_text": "\u201cDoes evolution make intelligent life superior or inferior compared to less advanced life?\u201d Neither. Superior is that which is adept and survives, inferior is that which is not. Evolution is a passive consequence. It occurs when surviving individuals mate, mixing their DNA. The driver of Evolution is Natural Selection, and Natural Selection always favours advantage within an environment. There is no benefit to sea sponges being able to do algebra, or recite Pi to 70 decimal places. In fact, intelligence where it does not contribute to survival, is a huge liability, remembering that the human brain consumes 30% of our energy intake.  The attributes that make an individual more adept within their environment are what lead to survival rather than death. Thus these are the attributes in the DNA of those who produce the next generation. ",

            "answer_text": "Does evolution make intelligent life superior or inferior compared to less advanced life? No. Atheism does not make intelligence superior or inferior to non-intelligence. There is no such thing as more or less advanced in evolution. Evolution started with the earliest organisms and species have all evolved the same amount. There is no end goal to atheism. There are no values to evolution. If you are more likely to pass your genes on to another generation then your genes are more likely to survive. That is the be all and end all. ",
