            "answer_text": "To most, if not all people. Examples Killing animals \u201cThat is how it has always been\u201d aka a strong feeling of \u201cThis is what I am used to\u201d + \u201cthe majority won\u00b4t judge me\u201d. Harming others for social acceptance or because you were told to do it: \u201cThey made me do it!!!\u201d Homophobia/sexism/incestophobia (\u201cfetishphobia\u201d too): \u201cI find it gross, therefore it is wrong.\u201d. This one also goes for racism sometimes. \u201cI want women to be this way, therefore they should be\u201d. Revenge (even though some people deserve it): \u201cThat crocodile killed my friend by instinct, therefore I\u00b4m gonna shoot it by selfishness.\u201d. Standing up for friends and family, even if it\u00b4s wrong: \u201cI love my little brother, so please don\u00b4t hurt him, even though he shared a naked picture of your sister\u201d. Emotions are, what a lot of people base their religions on, even if they don\u00b4t have proof of that religion. For many of them, it would take years for them to stop believing in it, because it is such a strong feeling (which also makes the religion kinda worthless, since you accept it to be true no matter what). Movie examples: In Dexter, when Debra doesn\u00b4t want Dexter to go to jail, so she kills the woman accusing him. Iron Man trying to kill Bucky, even though he was controlled by Hydra. The scene in \u201cPassengers\u201d, where Chris Pratt wakes up Jeniffer Lawrence because he needs someone to be with. Quill in Infinity War. Do I need to remind you? Walter White in Breaking bad: \u201cI did it to protect my family, bla bla bla.\u201d Other examples: \u201cThat person has been ACCUSED of harming a child/man/woman, so he/she MUST have done it.\u201d \u201cI was bullied as a child, so now I am going to be a bully too.\u201d or \u201cI have horrible parents, so I am gonna find a victim in school to treat the same way my parents treat me\u201d \u201cI cheated on my girlfriend and even though she will never find out, I will still tell her, because I feel guilty. Maybe I even break up with her because I feel so bad\u201d. lol Fuck You The truth:  \u2026 Oh, and the: \u201cAt least I admit to be an asshole\u201d. Being conscious of it just makes you a bigger asshole ",

            "answer_text": "As feelings are a considerate aspect of the human condition, of our reality, I would emphatically say yes. The caveat, however, is a strong one: feelings, an instinctive actuation for the most part, are entirely subjective. (Please no cartesian objections\u2026). They themselves are as subject to moral/ethical evaluation as any other human activity. They are not always good; they can be learned reactions to any stimuli, good or evil. Feel good about your professional adversary\u2019s downfall? Likely immoral. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Moral judgement is the product of one's feelings, experience, alongside knowledge about the situation. Let us take an example of being compassionate\u2014 one of the qualities of a morally good person. How can you have such a quality without having feelings for others\u2019 misfortunes? I guess emotion intelligence ( empathy) is the key to an objective moral judgment. ",
