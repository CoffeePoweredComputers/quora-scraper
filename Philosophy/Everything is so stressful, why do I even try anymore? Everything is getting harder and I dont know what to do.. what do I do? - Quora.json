You have to feel the crappy feelings, the hole in your chest. You have to scream and cry and fight just to make it thru to the next second. We are suppose to feel those feelings because without those feelings how could you truly know what Joy feels like? You have to take the good with the bad and just deal any way you can. The bad times never last and neither do the good. I think the test is how well you can fight thru the terrible times. No one im this life has it easy and you are definitely not alone in feeling the way you do. Just hang on and fight. Find whatever joy you can and focus on that. Watch videos of kittens or just emerse yourself in a video game or hobby. Meditate, find your joy. When you can't, scream and cry then wake up and try again. Good luck. Stay you through it all. Better times will come eventually. ",
