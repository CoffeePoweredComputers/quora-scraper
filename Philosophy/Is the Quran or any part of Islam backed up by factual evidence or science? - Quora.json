            "answer_text": "A. Quran & the Scientists 1.Dr Gerald C Goeringer, Course Director & Associates Professor of Medical Embryology at the Dept of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington DC USA: \u201cIn relatively few ayahs (Quranic verses) is contained a rather comprehensive description of human development from the time of commingling of the gametes through organogenesis. No such distinct and complete record of human development, such as classification, terminology, and description, existed previously. \u201d 2. Dr. William W Hay, well-known Marine Scientist. A Professor of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA. Formerly Dean of Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami, Florida, USA: \u201cI find it very interesting that this sort of information is in the ancient scriptures of the Holy Quran, and I have no way of knowing where they would come from, but I think it is extremely interesting that they are there and that this work is going on to discover it, the meaning of some of the passages.\u201d\u000bAnd when he was asked about the source of the Quran, he replied: \u201cWell, I would think it must be the divine being.\u201d 3. Dr. T. V. N. Persaud is Professor of Anatomy, Professor of Pediatrics and Child Health, and Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. There, he was the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy for 16 years. He is well-known in his field. He is the author or editor of 22 textbooks and has published over 180 scientific papers. In 1991, he received the most distinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada, the J.C.B. Grant Award from the Canadian Association of Anatomists: \u201c...Muhammad .. could not read, didn\u2019t know to write. - You have someone illiterate making profound pronouncements - amazingly accurate about scientific nature. [so] many accuracies - I have no difficulty in my mind that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements.\u201d 4. Dr. E. Marshall Johnson is Professor Emeritus of Anatomy and Developmental Biology at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. There, for 22 years he was Professor of Anatomy, the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy, and the Director of the Daniel Baugh Institute. He was also the President of the Teratology Society. He has authored more than 200 publications: \"The Quran describes not only the development of external form, but emphasizes also the internal stages, the stages inside the embryo, of its creation and development, emphasizing major events recognized by contemporary science.\u201c \u201cI see no evidence for the fact to refute the concept that this individual, Muhammad, had to be developing this information from some place. So I see nothing here in conflict with the concept that divine intervention was involved in what he was able to write.\u201d 5. Professor Alfred Kroner who is one of the world's most famous geologists. He is a Professor of Geology and the Chairman of the Department of Geology at the Institute of Geosciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany: \"Thinking about many of these questions and thinking where Muhammad came from, he was after all a Bedouin. I think it is almost impossible that he could have known about things like the common origin of the universe, because scientists have only found out within the last few years with very complicated and advanced technological methods that this is the case.\" 6. Professor Keith L. Moore is a professor emeritus in the division of anatomy (department of surgery), former Chair of anatomy and associate dean for Basic Medical Sciences (Faculty of Medicine) at the University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He has also worked at the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He is most known for his textbooks on the subjects of anatomy and human embryology: \"It has been a great pleasure for me to help clarify statements in the Quran about human development. It is clear to me that these statements must have come to Muhammad from God, or Allah, because most of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later. This proves to me that Muhammad must have been a messenger of God or Allah\". 7. Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson is the Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA. Formerly, he was Professor of Ob-Gyn and the Chairman of the Department of Ob-Gyn at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. He was also the President of the American Fertility Society. He has received many awards, including the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology Public Recognition Award in 1992: [ every one of you, all components of your creation are collected together in your mother\u2019s womb by forty days...]\u000b[If forty-two nights have passed over the embryo, God sends an angel to it, who shapes it and creates its hearing, vision, skin, flesh, and bones....]\u000bHe studied these two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad extensively, noting that the first forty days constitute a clearly distinguishable stage of embryo-genesis. He was particularly impressed by the absolute precision and accuracy of those sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him). \u201cIt follows, I think, that not only there is no conflict between genetics and religion but, in fact, religion can guide science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scientific approaches, that there exist statements in the Quran shown centuries later to be valid, which support knowledge in the Quran having been derived from God.\u201d 8. Dr. Yoshihide Kozai is Professor Emeritus at Tokyo University, Hongo, Tokyo, Japan, and was the Director of the National Astronomical Observatory, Mitaka, Tokyo: \u201cI am very much impressed by finding true astronomical facts in [the] Quran, and for us the modern astronomers have been studying very small pieces of the universe. We\u2019ve concentrated our efforts for understanding of [a] very small part. Because by using telescopes, we can see only very few parts [of] the sky without thinking [about the] whole universe. So, by reading [the] Quran and by answering to the questions, I think I can find my future way for investigation of the universe.\u201d 9. Professor Tejatat Tejasen is the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy at Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Previously, he was the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the same university: \u201cDuring the last three years, I became interested in the Quran.... From my study and what I have learned from this conference, I believe that everything that has been recorded in the Quran fourteen hundred years ago must be the truth, that can be proved by the scientific means. Since the Prophet Muhammad could neither read nor write, Muhammad must be a messenger who relayed this truth, which was revealed to him as an enlightenment by the one who is eligible [as the] creator. This creator must be God. Therefore, I think this is the time to say La ilaha illa Allah, there is no god to worship except Allah (God), Muhammadur rasoolu Allah, Muhammad is Messenger (Prophet) of Allah (God).\u201d (He took his syahadah and become Muslim) 10. Professor Durja Rao of Marine Geology teaching at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia: \"It is difficult to imagine that this type of knowledge was existing at that time, around 1400 years back. May be some of the things they have simple idea about, but to describe those things in great detail is very difficult. So this is definitely not simple human knowledge. A normal human being cannot explain this phenomenon in that much detail. So, I thought the information must have come from a supernatural source.\" 11. Professor Siaveda of Marine Geology, Japan: \"I think it seems to me very, very mysterious, almost unbelievable. I really think if what you have said is true, the book is really a very remarkable book, I agree.\" 12. Dr Maurice Bucaille born in 1920, former chief of the Surgical Clinic, University of Paris, has for a long time deeply interested in the correspondences between the teachings of the Holy Scriptures and modern secular knowledge: \"...our knowledge of these disciplines is such, that it is impossible to explain how a text produced at the time of the Qur'an could have contained ideas that have only been discovered in modern times.\u201c\u000b\"The above observation makes the hypothesis advanced by those who see Muhammad as the author of the Qur'an untenable. How could a man, from being illiterate, become the most important author, in terms of literary merits, in the whole of Arabic literature?\u000bHow could he then pronounce truths of a scientific nature that no other human-being could possibly have developed at that time, and all this without once making the slightest error in his pronouncement on the subject?\" B. Quran & Science Space is expandingIt is We who have constructed the heaven with might, and verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it. Az-Zariyat(51):47 [The size of the universe has long been in question, but it was not until 1929 when Edwin Hubble, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, proposed that the universe was expanding] 2. Law on Planetary motion: It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They swim along, each in an orbit.Al Anbiya (21):33 By the sky full of paths and orbits. Az-Zariyat (51):47 [German mathematician, astronomer and astrologer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) is attributed with correctly identifying planetary motion. His laws of planetary motionconcluded that planets move in almost-circular shaped orbits called ellipses. He published these laws in 1609 and 1619] 3. Protective capabilities of the skies: We made the sky a preserved and protected roof yet still they turn away from Our Signs..Al Anbiya (21):32 [The protective capabilities of the sky were only discovered in the 19th century] 4. Continental Drifts You will see the mountains you reckoned to be solid going past like clouds. Al Naml (27:88) [The theory of continental drift was proposed by Alfred Wegener, a meteorologist, in 1915. He suggested that the world was originally composed of a single land mass or continent, and that the continents then separated and moved very slowly apart, forming the 7 continents today, and still in motion. The theory of plate tectonics which was developed from continental drift supports this idea and provides evidence of how the plates of the Earth move] 5. General Theory of Relativity A day with your Lord is equivalent to a thousand years in the way you count: Al Hajj (22):47 He directs the whole affair from heaven to earth. Then it will again ascend to Him on a Day whose length is a thousand years by the way you measure: As Sajadah (32):5 [German-born physicist Albert Einstein formulated the general theory of relativity in 1915. This theory is a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. According to general relativity processes close to a massive body run more slowly than those farther away, an effect known as gravitational time dilation. Gravity has a direct effect on time. Although this theory was not formulated until the early 1900s] 6. Universe is created from nothing At the beginning there is ALLAH and nothing else is with Him.Translation of Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol. 9, 381 (1987) To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: When He decreeth a matter, He saith to it: \"Be,\" and it is: Al Baqarah (2):117 [The sensitive sensors on board the COBE space satellite which was launched by NASA in 1992, captured evidentiary remnants of the Big Bang. This discovery served as evidence for the Big Bang, which is the scientific explanation of the fact that the universe was created from nothing.] 7. Heaven cyclical systems By Heaven with its cyclical systems. Al Tarik(86):11 [The troposphere, 13 to 15 kilometers above the Earth, enables water vapor rising from the surface of the Earth to be condensed and turn back as rain.The ozone layer, at an altitude of 25 kilometers, reflects harmful radiation and ultraviolet light coming from space and turns both back into space.The ionosphere, reflects radio waves broadcast from the Earth back down to different parts of the world, just like a passive communications satellite, and thus makes wireless communication, radio, and television broadcasting possible over long distances.The magnetosphere layer turns the harmful radioactive particles emitted by the Sun and other stars back into space before they reach the Earth.The fact that this property of the atmosphere's layers, that was only demonstrated in the recent past was announced centuries ago in the Qur'an] 8. Vital role of mountains: Have We not made the earth as a bed and the mountains its pegs?.Az Zumar(39):5 We placed firmly embedded mountains on the earth, so it would not move under them\u2026Al Anbiya (21):31 [This vital role of mountains, that was discovered by modern geology and seismic research. Briefly, we may liken mountains to nails that keep pieces of wood together.] 9. Iron are sent down from the skies: Iron did not form on the Earth, but was carried from exploding stars in space via meteors, and was \"sent down to earth\", in exactly the same way as stated in the Quran Al Hadid (57):25:\u201cAnd We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people\u201d 10. Everything created in pairs Glory be to Him Who created all the pairs. An Nab (78):8 [\u201cevery particle has its antiparticle of opposite charge\u2026 \u2026and the uncertainty relation tells us that pair creation and pair annihilation happen in the vacuum at all times, in all places\u201d : British scientist Paul Dirac, who proposed that matter is created in pairs, was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1933.] 11.Equal amount goes up, equal amount goes down It is He who sends down water in due measure from the sky: An Naba (78):8 [This measured quantity in rain has again been discovered by modern research. It is estimated that in one second, approximately 16 million tons of water evaporates from the Earth. This figure amounts to 513 trillion tons of water in one year. This number is equal to the amount of rain that falls on the Earth in a year. This means that water continuously circulates in a balanced cycle, in a \"measure\". Life on Earth depends on this water cycle. Even if people used all the available technology in the world, they would not be able to reproduce this cycle artificially.Even a minor deviation in this equilibrium would very soon give rise to a major ecological imbalance that would bring about the end of life on Earth. Yet, this never happens, and rain keeps falling every year in exactly the same quantity just as revealed in the Qur'an.] 12. How rain is formed It is God Who sends the winds which stir up clouds which He spreads about the sky however He wills. He forms them into dark clumps and you see the rain come pouring out from the middle of them: At Rum 30:48 [How rain forms remained a great mystery for a long time. Only after weather radar was invented was it possible to discover the stages by which rain is formed.According to this, the formation of rain takes place in three stages. First, the \"raw material\" of rain rises up into the air with the wind. Later, clouds are formed, and finally raindrops. 13. Fecundating wind We send the fecundating winds, then cause water to descend from the sky, therewith providing you with water in abundance. Al Hijr (15):22 [On the surface of oceans and seas, countless air bubbles form because of the water's foaming action. The moment these bubbles burst, thousands of tiny particles, with a diameter of just one hundredth of a millimeter, are thrown up into the air. These particles, known as \"aerosols\", mix with dust carried from the land by the wind, and are carried to the upper layers of the atmosphere. These particles carried to higher altitudes by winds come into contact with water vapour up there. Water vapour condenses around these particles and turns into water droplets. These water droplets first come together and form clouds, and then fall to the Earth in the form of rain as seen, winds \"fecundate\" the water vapour floating in the air with the particles they carry from the sea, and eventually help the formation of rain clouds.If winds did not possess this property, water droplets in the upper atmosphere would never form, and there would be no such thing as rain.The most important point here is that this critical role of the wind in the formation of rain was stated centuries ago in a verse of the Qur'an, at a time when people knew very little about natural phenomena] 14. The 2 seas & a barrier He has let loose the two seas, converging together, with a barrier between them they do not break through. Ar Rahman (55):19 [This property of the seas, that they come together yet do not mingle with one another at all, has only very recently been discovered by oceanographers. Because of the physical force called \"surface tension\", the waters of neighboring seas do not mix. Caused by the difference in the density of their waters, surface tension prevents them from mingling with one another, just as if a thin wall were between them.The interesting side to this is that during a period when people had no knowledge of physics, surface tension, or oceanography] 15. Darkness of the seas Or (the unbelievers' state) are like the darkness of a fathomless sea which is covered by waves above which are waves above which are clouds, layers of darkness, one upon the other. If he puts out his hand, he can scarcely see it. An Nur (24):40 [The darkness in deep seas and oceans is found around a depth of 200 meters and below. At this depth, there is almost no light. Below a depth of 1000 meters there is no light at all. Scientists have only recently been able to discover these detailed pieces of information about seas. However, the statement of \"darkness in a deep sea\" was used in Sura Nur 1,400 years ago. ] 16. The Forelock No indeed! If he does not stop, We will grab him by the forelock, a lying, sinful forelock. Al Alaq (96):15-16 [The expression \"the lying, sinful forelock\" in the above verse is most interesting. Research carried out in recent years revealed that the prefrontal area, which is responsible for the management of particular functions of the brain, lies in the frontal part of the skull. Scientists only discovered the functions of this area, which the Qur'an pointed out 1,400 years ago, in the last 60 years. If we look inside the skull at the front of the head, we will find the frontal area of the cerebrum. A book entitled Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology, which includes the results of the latest research on the functions of this area, says:The motivation and the foresight to plan and initiate movements occur in the anterior portion of the frontal lobes, the prefrontal area. This is a region of association cortex\u2026In relation to its involvement in motivation, the prefrontal area is also thought to be the functional center for aggression\u2026] 17. The Semen Was he not once a drop of ejected semen? Al Qiyamah (75):36-37 He made his progeny from an extract of discarded fluid: As Sajadah (32):7-8 We created man from a mingled drop to test him,..Al Insan (76):2 [As we have seen, the Qur'an informs us that man is made not from the entire semen, but only a small part of it. That the particular emphasis in this statement announces a fact only discovered by modern science is evidence that the statement is divine in origin.] 18. Genetic accuracy He has created both sexes, male and female from a drop of semen which has been ejected: An Najm (53):45-46 [In the Qur'an, it is said that masculinity or femininity are created out of \"a drop of semen which has been ejected\". However, until fairly recently, it was believed that a baby's sex was determined by the mother's cells. Science only discovered this information given in the Qur'an in the 20th century. This and many other similar details about the creation of man were stated in the Qur'an centuries ago.The developing disciplines of genetics and molecular biology have scientifically validated the accuracy of this information given by the Qur'an. It is now understood that sex is determined by the sperm cells from the male, and that the female has no role in this process.] 19. The Embryo (We) then formed the drop into a clot and formed the clot into a lump and formed the lump into bones and clothed the bones in flesh; and then brought him into being as another creature. Al Mukminun (23):14 [Embryology is the branch of science that studies the development of the embryo in the mother's womb. Until very recently, embryologists assumed that the bones and muscles in an embryo developed at the same time. For this reason, for a long time, some people claimed that these verses conflicted with science. Yet, advanced microscopic research conducted by virtue of new technological developments has revealed that the revelation of the Qur'an is word for word correct. These observations at the microscopic level showed that the development inside the mother's womb takes place in just the way it is described in the verses. First, the cartilage tissue of the embryo ossifies. Then muscular cells that are selected from amongst the tissue around the bones come together and wrap around the bones.During the seventh week, the skeleton begins to spread throughout the body and the bones take their familiar shapes. At the end of the seventh week and during the eighth week the muscles take their positions around the bone forms.] 20. The Cling Recite: In the name of your Lord Who created man from alaq: Al Alaq (96):2 [When the sperm of the male unites with the ovum of the female, the essence of the baby to be born is formed. This single cell, known as a \"zygote\" in biology, will instantly start to reproduce by dividing, and eventually become a \"piece of flesh\" called an embryo. This of course can only be seen by human beings with the aid of a microscope. The embryo, however, does not spend its developmental period in a void. It clings to the uterus just like roots that are firmly fixed to the earth by their tendrils. Through this bond, the embryo can obtain the substances essential to its development from the mother's body. Here, at this point, a very significant miracle of the Qur'an is revealed. While referring to the embryo developing in the mother's womb, God uses the word \"alaq\" in the Qur'an. The word is literally used to describe leeches that cling to a body to suck blood. This formation has been discovered by modern embryology.] 21. Mother's milk His mother bore him by bearing strain upon strain, and his weaning was in two years: Luqman (31):14 [Mother's milk is an unmatched mixture that is created by God as both an excellent food-source for the newborn baby, and a substance that increases its resistance to diseases. Even artificial baby food produced by today's technology cannot substitute for this miraculous source of nutrition. Every day, a new benefit of mother's milk to the baby is discovered. One of the facts that science has discovered about mother's milk is that suckling up to two years after birth is very beneficial. God gives us this important information, which was discovered by science only very recently, with the verse \"\u2026his weaning was in two years..\" 14 centuries ago.] 22. Fingerprint Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones? Nay, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers. Al Qiyamah (75):3-4 [The emphasis on fingerprints has a very special meaning. This is because everyone's fingerprint is unique to himself. Every person who is alive or who has ever lived in this world has a set of unique fingerprints.That is why fingerprints are accepted as a very important proof of identity, exclusive to their owner, and are used for this purpose around the world.But what is important is that this feature of fingerprints was only discovered in the late 19th century. Before then, people regarded fingerprints as ordinary curves without any specific importance or meaning. However in the Qur'an, God points to the fingertips, which did not attract anyone's attention at that time, and calls our attention to their importance-an importance that was only finally understood in our day.] ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent example,, the miracles of POLLINATION the Qur'an \u201cstates\u201d 36:36 quran,, Exalted is He who created all pairs - from what the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know. The mystery of all sex runs through all creation in Men, animals life and plant kingdom, the above verse is specially significant refers to Allah creating pairs in All things including the plants and thus mentioning the process of pollination History Of Pollination Studies. The German physician and botanist Rudolf Jakob Camerarius (1665 -1771) is credited with the first empirical demonstration that plants reproduce sexually. Camerarius discovered the roles of the different parts of a flower in seed production. Pollination or process or plant reproduction occurs when the male germ cell reaches the stigma , the female reproductive part of the same species plant. This verses are revealed to prophet Muhammad early 6th century while the oldest quran manuscript dates back as early as 6th century is in Birmingham University and has all the verses found the Qur'an in our hands \ufeffPlant pornography The English physician Nehemiah Grew first proposed a sexual theory of plant reproduction in 1684, and the ensuing debate eventually caught the attention of British satirists. \"Once the wags got ahold of it, their almost pornographic descriptions of what goes on in flowers outraged pious people and polarized the debate even further,\" said Lincoln Taiz. It took the careful observations and insights of German botanist Wilhelm Hofmeister, published in 1851, to resolve the controversy by showing that sexual reproduction is a universal feature of plant life cycles, from mosses and ferns to flowering plants. The clues were there all along. The practice of artificially pollinating date palms began in the Bronze Age, yet the sexual role of pollen went unrecognized for millennia. The story told in Flora Unveiled is a remarkable example of how strongly cultural biases can influence our perceptions, impede scientific advances, and delay the acceptance of new discoveries. \"That something as basic as sex in plants could have remained hidden for so long, and then opposed when it finally was described, shows just how powerful cultural biases can be,\" said Lincoln Taiz. The process of pollination and belief that plants are created in pairs of a male and female is further re-iterated in another verse in the Qur'an that states Qur'an 20:53,, He Who has, made for you the earth like a carpet spread out; has enabled you to go about therein by roads (and channels); and has sent down water from the sky.\" With it have We produced diverse pairs of plants each separate from the others. This makes is Islam the only religion predates modern Scientific discoveries . ",
