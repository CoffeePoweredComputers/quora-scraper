The real marketing and sales will come only from hands-on marketing/sales with the consumer. You can read a lot about how to wind a motor of a system. The real knowledge will come from the winding of the motor self. You can learn a lot about blogging from the books and the people but real practical knowledge will come from blogging only. You can watch as many videos to learn how to create a youtube video. The real knowledge will come from creating, recording and uploading a youtube video. Do let me know if this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The primary output from a human is action (that does include speaking). There are lots of physical skills out there which you can only learn by doing and practicing. Speaking personally I never aquired sufficient site reading skills to be a musician. Nor am I able to dance. These are skills and they have high currency in the social world. My practical DIY skills however are good - it has taken me many years but I get real satisfaction from making things (particularly carpentry) All these abilities have been derived by practice - Hebbian learning hones your ability to control tools and limbs. This is still knowledge. It is often of value \u2026usually of more value than learning about complex ideas, which, perhaps, few have any interst in. Some roles require honed actions which become skills (Musician, dancer, joiner, mechanic etc and some are more cerebral and they may need more symbolic knowledge to be profficient , but neither side should claim the knowledge high ground - I value my ability to cut timber in a straight and accurate manner with a hand saw , and i can do programing and maths \u2026 they are equal skills in my mind. The inportance is that they are knowledge and knowledge lasts and is useful. ",
