            "answer_text": "Deontological ethics, the action is right or wrong in and of itself regardless of the consequences. So if you help a person (it can be yourself) and they benefited, then that\u2019s good.If you help a person and made their situation worse, then it\u2019s still good.If you are mean to someone and their situation worsens, then that\u2019s bad.If you\u2019re mean to someone and their situation improves, then it\u2019s still bad.Here are four real life examples, each corresponding to the four above. When a firefighter saves someone from a burning buildingWhen a pharmacist sells thalidomide for morning sickness, not knowing that the active ingredient was mixed alongside with mirrored versions of itself that resulted in birth defects.When a school shooter shoots up his schoolWhen a prankster uses a tooth pick to cut up a banana while it was still unpeeled, gives it to someone who peels carefully and who likes sliced bananas.Another way of looking at it is that the action is right or wrong regardless of the virtue or lack of. Say you had a positive motive and you wanted to help someone and you helped someone, then the action is good.Say you had bad ulterior motives and you helped someone, then the action is still good.Say you had a bad motive and you did something harmful to someone, then the action is wrong.Say you had positive motive and you did something harmful because you believe it was \u201cfor the greater good,\u201d then the action is still wrong.Here are four real life examples, each corresponding to the four above. A charity worker who joined in order to help others.A person who donates money to many small businesses that provide good services, but struggle financially due to lack of publicity. However, this person is a criminal and did it in order to launder money.A thief who stole something to spite someone.A propagandist making propaganda to promote good ideals, but is of course going about it in all the wrong ways.",

            "answer_text": "Any time we carry out some duty or principle, more-or-less without regard to outcomes, we are adopting a broadly deontological approach. Consider for example the right to vote. In a democracy, voting is considered a right. But what about people who live in isolated communities? It costs money to set up voting booths, and if you\u2019re just thinking about outcomes, an argument could be made that their votes don\u2019t matter. No government ever got elected because a handful of people in small communities voted for them. So why let them vote? It would make more sense, from an outcomes point of view, just to tell them \u201cyou don\u2019t matter,\u201d and spend the time & money on something more useful. But we don\u2019t do that. We think of voting as a RIGHT, and so government has a duty to make sure everyone has the chance to vote. That\u2019s deontology in action. A different kind of example would be the absolute prohibition on child labour under international treaties. Under such a treaty, you\u2019re not supposed to give a 12-year old living in a rural area in an impoverished country a job picking cotton because that\u2019s said to violate her rights. Of course, the result may be very bad: she could starve, or end up in prostitution instead. But from a deontological point of view, that might be thought to be your duty. (I think that\u2019s a bad argument, but it\u2019s an example of the deontological style of reasoning.) ",
