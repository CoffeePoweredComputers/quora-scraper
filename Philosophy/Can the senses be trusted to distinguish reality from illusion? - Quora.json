            "answer_text": "No one really knows. The best answer is \u201cit depends.\u201d In many cases they can, and in many they can\u2019t. This is an ancient philosophical question that goes right back to Plato\u2019s Cave and beyond. All spiritual practices address this question in one way or another. Love is a good place to start thinking about this seriously. Is love \u201creal\u201d? Can you trust \u201cthe senses\u201d? Is there any other way to perceive love? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve learned to tell how important love is for me and how easy it is to perceive\u2014and I highly recommend others do as well. Might want to start with Michael Pollan\u2019s very important new book How To Change You\u2019re Mind. Also, see my other answers, I love addressing this question but don\u2019t want to repeat myself. Daniel Quinn\u2019s books such as Ishmael are all excellent answers to this question (and the deepest I know of). Waking up from apparent reality is a very, very tricky business. An Ayahuasca trip or some experimentation with mushrooms can really help clarity one's sense of what is true and really matters. Even microdosing little microchips of schroom can have a deeply clarifying and wisening\u2014not to mention calming\u2014effect. Conversely, approaching things from a pure-science mentality, Chomsky\u2019s Newton talk is the most rigid and rational conception of the limits of knowledge that I know of. It\u2019s a bit tough to get into though, I\u2019ve been studying that talk alone for several years, but it\u2019s been well worth it. And then my Aya trip taught me that, having mastered that kind of thinking, I don\u2019t really find it all that important anymore. Convenient to say though now that I take it for granted. Intuitional/creative knowledge is much more useful than scientific knowledge, especially if one doesn\u2019t mistake it for scientific knowledge (enjoy your beliefs and let them serve you without needing them to be empirically demonstrable to anyone but you and in any other way than that they\u2019re useful. You can say this sentence to any doubters: The essence of empiricism and evolution is that something is apparent and that it works. In those senses my belief in X has been very adaptive for me). You can believe in your beliefs without believing that they\u2019re \u201cscientific.\u201d And you can honestly pity those who are incapable of perceiving anything outside of what little is understood scientifically. At the end of the day understanding via \u201cyour senses\u201d is all you have. This is by definition: all you have is your various faculties for making sense of the world. The best answer to the question I can think of is: You have no choice, you\u2019re doing it every day. Even your skepticism is a sense you will never know exactly how much to trust, but trust it you must. Your senses, your reason and your skepticism of them are all you\u2019ve got. Well, that and those of others. Trust of course plays a key role here. Weighing in the perceptions, reasoning, and skepticism of others both historical and contemporary, some lovers and some enemies but most in between, adds so much additional complexity to all of this that I simply have nothing more to say. I hope this leaves you as fascinated by the topic as I am. :)  Ps: Alan Watts may be a bit silly and nonsensical but his work is actually very useful at addressing these questions neither too rigidly nor too loosely.

            "answer_text": "A2A It is not the senses\u2019 job to distinguish reality from illusion. What sense do is register impulses. The impulses are then passed onto the brain which decides what it is that the senses registered. This is then picked up by the mind which decides the meaning and value and importance and relevance and whatever else, of what\u2019s been registered. The senses register, the brain interprets, the mind evaluates, defines and judges. Some \u201cillusions\u201d happen in the brain. For various reasons the brain can mistakenly translate what\u2019s been registered. For the most part, illusions are created by the mind and are otherwise known as meanings, ideas, beliefs, concepts. For the most part the mind can\u2019t be trusted to recognize the illusions it itself creates. As far as the mind knows, what it creates is what it sees. It\u2019s the reality. It happens sometimes, not often, that the brain is so nimble and developed and that the mind is so present that it can see itself. It can recognize itself and it\u2019s own workings. Or \u2026 something can recognize the mind and it\u2019s workings. One can recognize one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s workings. One can become fully aware of one\u2019s mind. In this place of full awareness one can see clearly the illusions mind spins, and one can see clearly the reality behind those illusions. This state of awareness is commonly known as enlightenment.

            "answer_text": "There is a problem that has to be clear first in relation to your question. The problem consists of language. The Words. Because the senses in a human do only hear, see and smell and taste and touch what is \u201cknown\u201d and focus on it, understand it as thought, and therefor humans see, hear and smell and therefor interpret according to how they have been taught to understand in regard to what they distinguish. I will give you the example from science. Most persons really think that they do actually have the full capacity to completely grasp all that is taught within physics, or they completely grasp what I Kant wrote at a first glance. But that is not the case at all. We are in fact born with different capacities for understanding, abilities to understand and grasp reality - therefor we trust. We trust those that are knowledgeable within different fields and their accounts on these. And learn to invision things as they explain these more or less - we have a certain idea in regard. In other words - not everyone is a skilled shoemaker - but we understand more or less the ways shoes are made. So, we interpret (based on a certain knowledge we have in regard) what we perceive from reality - the way we were taught to. ",

            "answer_text": "We humans are easily deceived, hence the graphic and natural illusions that may trick us (rabbit/witch illusion, Escher illusions. Stick in water; seemingly bent) among many others, we often misread scary sounds in the dark, etc. Despite this situation we manage quite well in our everyday lives, occasionally being deceived, but in the main we are aware of our error, or in the case of graphic illusions, we must accept that this is simply how the mind/brain works, how it has evolved to keep us alive in potentially dangerous environments . To maintain constant awareness of potential dangers (predators), we have evolved to be cautious and to take things, initially, at face value; originally it was the difference between life or death. It was better to read things and situations literally, thus on seeing a stick seemingly bent in water, judging it as seeming to be real, till we learn that the very same stick, out of water, is in fact straight. We evolved to diminish risks by assuming that it is better to take care in most situations rather taking a chance. This probably resulted from recognising potential risk situations and avoiding them where possible. Originally, to be careless, just once, meant being a predators dinner. We humans evolved and passed these behaviours on to future generations, today we recognise the result of these evolutionary behaviours as the \u2018fight or flight\u2019 reaction. Because we can be rational creatures occasionally, we have learnt and remember that many illusions are just that. But some, like the \u2018fight or flight reaction\u2019 are deeply embedded in our psyche and at a visceral level. So while we are prone to making the occasional error due to illusions, in the main, our senses serve us well. Our inherent capacities that have evolved over millions of years, like the \u2018blink\u2019 reaction enable us to implicitly avoid most dangerous situations (protecting our eyes), but we can still be, occasionally tricked via our sense. Much of our behaviour is inherent. We are able to act on implicit knowledge not processed at the conscious level; hence we can run fast over uneven ground without having to think or reflect on our activity. Our sense of up rightedness, of the effect of gravity on our physical movements, are as it were \u201cbuilt in\u201d at a subconscious level enabling to move gracefully at various speeds. We occasionally make a mistake, but learning and memory mean we can deal with most contingencies, though occasional errors occur. We humans learn to contend with the illusions and vissitudes of life. They are simply part of the world we live in. Mostly we make our way through the world relatively safely, situations do occur that trick us and we either catch ourselves in time and avoid a mishap, or we misread the situation and pay the consequences.

We could be 3 people in the same room and the third could say \u201cWhat lovely weather we're having today\". You could hear him cursing your mom and I could hear him singing \u201cGod save The Queen\u201d. Also, this third one could look like a very beautiful woman to you and like an ugly af one to me. So no, the 5 senses can't be trusted at all. There's only one sense you can trust, the sixth: The voice of God inside your head, the feeling in your heart of what is right and what isn't. The outside and all your other senses will do everything they can to prove your inner voice and your gut feeling wrong, but they are never wrong. That's the one thing the system can't mess with. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. In the senses are inculcated four defects - to be imperfect, to be deluded, to cheat, and to commit mistakes. So, the senses alone cannot give us a correct perception of reality. To understand reality, we must learn from the right authority. It\u2019s like anything else in the world, we want to understand, we approach a teacher. Of course, now a days, there are no universities offering courses in reality, still, the principle is valid - ff you want to understand mathematics, you study mathematics under an authorized, certified teacher. Similarly, to understand reality, we have to approach a certified teacher. It\u2019s a curious thing, when it comes to technology and science, people are willing to study it, to learn how it works, but when it comes to religion, and the spiritual aspects of life, all of the sudden people forget the scientific approach. Now it\u2019s a free for all, and anyone can assert him or herself as a teacher of reality. Real religion, however, is a science that can be tried and tested like any other science. Still, very few people are ready to get scientific about religion. Very few people want to actually know God. That\u2019s predicted in the Puranas. King Pariksit says: In this material world there are as many living entities as atoms. Among these living entities, a very few are human beings, and among them, few are interested in following religious principles. O best of the brahmanas, Sukadeva Gosvami, out of many persons who follow religious principles, only a few desire liberation from the material world. Among many thousands who desire liberation, one may actually achieve liberation, giving up material attachment to society, friendship, love, country, home, wife and children. And among many thousands of such liberated persons, one who can understand the true meaning of liberation is very rare. O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Narayana, or Krsna. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.\u2014Srimad Bhagavatam 6.14.3-5  ",

Sense + some theories can help to discover errors and illusion, but it can never bring any certainty that we are in front of a reality, except the reality of our consciousness. Ancient philosophy argues (rather convincingly) in that direction, notably through the Dream Argument. The mechanist hypothesis in cognitive science + computer science (mathematical logic, arithmetic) proves this. Of course (?), we can\u2019t *prove* the Mechanist hypothesis, but there too, we might be able to refute it. For example, if the laws of Newton were the correct fundamental laws of physics, Mechanism would be refuted. But with quantum mechanics, we might get confirmations of the most weird aspect of the Mechanist theory, where eventually the physical reality is shown to emerge from relation between the partial computable number relation and the non computable. With Mechanism, the illusions are the \u201creal\u201d things, and they obey precise mathematical laws allowing testing. ",

If you\u2019re watching a fata morgana (a mirage) through binoculars, these will not tell you that it is a fata morgana. But your brain will. Besides, why does it matter if what you see is not real, if it helps you overcome an obstacle? For instance, you\u2019re in danger, and you see \u201csomeone\u201d scaring the attackers away. Later you figure out that what you saw was just an illusion. But what difference does it make whether it was real or not, given the fact that your problem was solved? The lesson that we are supposed to learn in a situation like that is not to argue over the reality of your vision, but to just become aware of the fact that there is always a solution to every problem, be the solution explainable or not.

The discovery of quantum physics has told us there exists another mode of perception, and that mode EVERYONE has access to, not just the scientists. The senses can be educated to increase their perception, literally perceiving more detail each time it is tested, If a person is not educated to the occurrence of \u2018illusions \u2018 their na\u00efvet\u00e9 can be harmful or deceiving. Quantum physics has already told us. We are created by subatomic particles traveling at, or near the speed of light. This INTERIOR state is comprehensible, and the sacred scriptures have all been telling us about it for thousands of years now. Unfortunately, the very material scientists who claim to know ALL there is to knowabout the quantum, are NOT listening to any of the philosophy being created. If we cannot trust our own senses, who or what is outside of us to trust?? The quantum is the bedrock of existence, and has the divine capacity to KNOW what we need BEFORE we ask for it. For 100 years now, the experiments have been verifying this \u2018bizarre\u2019 behavior. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no illusion anywhere, unless you think what you see upon television, mobile, cinema etc is. If you want to be voluntarily skeptic, you can find drama and performing arts too illusory. What about the conversation with relatives and friends? Yes, by that count, this one also will pass as an illusion. So, what is your \u201cillusion\u201d? Is it the inability to differentiate the layers of reality? Maybe, yes. The solution lies firstly in knowing that \u201creality\u201d has many \u201clayers\u201d. And then, you shall have to look through the layers one by one. The key to the successive layers of reality could be with the preceding layers. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s a perceptional world. It\u2019s a real world. Illusion is a personal failure in being unable to transcend the layers of reality methodically. You have underestimated reality and over estimated illusion. The former is labyrinthine; the latter is a void. ",

The famous example of rope being taken as snake in life is a brilliant summing up of this factor in being. All our objective relativity that is being sensed and is being turned into knowledge is an illusion. To grasp this point, son daughter, house , car etc etc , all these are sensed by us i.e they form this sense of relativity of the form as son, daughter , a car , a house etc etc. Whereas all forms are literally formed other than our own form . This process of sensing is a perpetual process and that MISINTERPRETED PERCEPTION has to be sensed, its an open eyed and intellectual meditation in and during life , and perhaps the only real meditation to bring any results . Well , nothing more can be said ;Matter and spirit are twin born and this has to be understood logically first and then this logic has to be trusted in seeking the reality from illusion. ",

The eyes register light bouncing off a pixilated screen and we perceive images of people etc. It's just a play of the light and, our eyes don't pick up the finer detail. You must have seen pictures of 'optical' (eye-door) illusions? All our senses can play a part in giving rise to misperceptions and misunderstandings. ",

From that can you see that there is an illusion going on, in that all that the world offers are temporal stimulus. And that the reality is, that all of it is a waste of time. Except to have all of us chasing after happiness. Not realizing all of it is temporal. Then comes the big question. What is eternal happiness and how does one get it? Can it be contentment?
