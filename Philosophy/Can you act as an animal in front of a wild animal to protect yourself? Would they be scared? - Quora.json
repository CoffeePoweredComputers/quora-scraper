            "answer_text": "It depends on which animal you act like, right? If you are being threatened by a bear, acting like a salmon would be a very bad choice. As far as we know, other species don\u2019t classify other species the same way we do. They are a lot more concerned with behaviour. If you make a lot of noise and make yourself look bigger when threatened by a predator, they may decide to leave you alone, not because they mistake you for a non-human, but because you look like you\u2019ll be more trouble than you\u2019re worth. On the other hand, if you turn and run away, you\u2019re acting like prey, and they\u2019re more likley to chase. Animal agression isn\u2019t always predation, however. When a rattlesnake coils and rattles, she\u2019s saying, \u201cleave me alone or you\u2019ll regret it\u201d. Back away slowly, to the point where she feels safe to turn her attention from you, and she\u2019ll leave. The most serious encounter I\u2019ve ever had with a non-human was a male elk during rutting season. There was nothing I could do to convince him that I was not interested in his women. He chased me several times around my car, before I was able to jump inside and slam the door. He snorted like he\u2019d proved which of us were more manly (and he was certainly correct) and swaggered off with his harem. (For the record, I did nothing to provoke this. He brought his harem into my campsight uninvited, and I didn\u2019t even check them out.) What is needed in encounters with other species is an understanding of why they are showing threatening behaviour, and knowing what is the most appropriate behaviour to respond to the threat. ",

            "answer_text": "The scariest possible thing you can be to a wild animal\u2014is yourself. A human. We are the most terrifying being they could encounter. Most wild animals are very aware of this and try to avoid humans at all costs. So act like a human. Stand tall, talk calmly to them, and let them see your front-facing (predator\u2019s) eyes (just don\u2019t stare them in the eye; that is usually seen as aggressive and wanting to fight). I\u2019m not sure what you mean by acting like an animal\u2014maybe growling or getting down on all fours? None of the options I can think of are a good idea, regardless, and would be more likely to entice them to attack. ",

            "answer_text": "You can, but knowing what you're facing will tell you whether or not it would work. Some animals would be intimidated, hesitate, run away. Don't try that on a polar bear, or gorilla, or hippo, just to name a few more well known examples. How you react is determined by what you're facing. A tactic that may work on a black bear may not work on a grizzly bear. All of the tactics for black bears and grizzly are a bad idea for polar bears. A tactic that may scare off a lion may only aggitate a leopard or jaguar for another example. This applies with omnivorous and herbivorous animals as well. What may spook a deer or elk will only piss off a moose ",
