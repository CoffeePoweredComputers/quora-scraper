            "answer_text": "In one sense, it had lots, all contradictory. Modernists of various schools were always publishing manifestos, statements of intent or lengthy essays laying out, often in ways that now seem to us slightly overblown and a bit silly, exactly how they thought one ought to approach the business of art. But the reason they were doing that is that modernists in general believed that art needed to be done in the furtherance of some kind of single unifying vision, and that if you had the right vision, you could use it to uncover fundamental truths about humanity and in some cases to create deep and lasting revolutions in human thought and action. Art, for modernists, could not be divorced from the whole of human experience \u2013 it needed to be engaged at the heart of psychology, sociology, technology and politics. We\u2019ve lost that, alas. It had its flaws (\u2018humanity\u2019 did, for many of these artists, mean \u2018white, male, upper middle class humanity\u2019) and its darknesses (some of those \u2018unifying visions\u2019 were quite openly aligned to fascism), but the post-modernist backlash has has left us in a place where art is barely taken seriously at all \u2013 it\u2019s an entertaining \u2018garnish\u2019 for the elite.
