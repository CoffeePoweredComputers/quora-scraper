            "answer_text": "Change it anyway. Many current theories hold that the past appears to be real, and locked in place because its probabilities have already collapsed into one state on our current timeline because we have already experienced (observed) them. Glimpses of the future may indeed be a reality on the current timeline we\u2019re experiencing, but with each choice and decision we make, we solidify new events and create new timelines. This comes from the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum theory. It\u2019s messy in many regards, but eliminates the possibilities of many of the paradoxes involved with time and time travel. So my recommendation is to make choices that will prevent any future calamities you may see, and put yourself on a new timeline that avoids them. ",
