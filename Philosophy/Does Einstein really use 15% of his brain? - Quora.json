            "answer_text": "No. Whoever came up with this assertion, on the other hand, probably was using 14% of their brain. Look, the brain constitutes only 2% of a person's mass but uses up 20% of its energy. It's expensive, metabolically speaking. Tradeoffs are endemic in biology; anything that isn't carrying its own weight will be eliminated \u2014 organs no longer in use will be stunted by evolution (think of vestigial organs like the appendix, or vestigial reflexes like stress-related goosebumps), and even within a single lifetime unused muscles and bones start weakening or get scavenged for resources (as astronauts find out the hard way). In the animal kingdom, shrews cyclically shrink their brains and skulls by 15% in winter to conserve energy. If Einstein didn't use 86% of his brain, all of that deadweight would've been scavenged by the rest of his body for resources. It would most likely look like Charlie Gordon's regression in the second half of Flowers for Algernon. ",
