            "answer_text": "A huge number of people (including me!) have philosophical ideas that few pay attention to. I think there are several routes to gaining more exposure. One is to write a book, e.g. a Kindle book, which anyone can write and upload. But for many people to actually read it, it will have to be on a topic that really interests people and will have to be engagingly written and carefully titled. You could go the academic route, get a degree and a Ph.D. and try to become a philosophy professor. Or you could go the Internet route, create a website, make YouTube videos or a podcast and commit yourself to putting those ideas out there over an extended period of time, gradually building up an audience. Stefan Molyneux has done this, for instance. Out of the things that I've tried myself, my podcast has probably been the most successful so far, gaining a few thousand views with around ten episodes. So not very successful, but OK for a niche topic and not much effort. If you can also make tutorials on a related topic, that could really get you heard on a large scale. But they have to be tutorials on something people are looking for tutorials about, and it will have to connect closely to your philosophical ideas if you want some of those people to move on to consuming your ideas.
