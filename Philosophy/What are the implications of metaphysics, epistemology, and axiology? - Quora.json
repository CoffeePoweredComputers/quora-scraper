            "answer_text": "I have always been fascinated with the first two concepts in your question \u2014 metaphysics and epistemology. But I am merely a layman. To start with, you must be able to look into a deeper definition, or a more profound meaning of the idea of \u201cGod\u201d. It is a realm (or dimension) of \u201cGodness\u201d, or Godhood, and not God as a kind of personification or \u201cextension\u201d of our own \u201chuman-ness\u201d, ideas, and conceptions. This domain of Godness is in fact not that of the everyday notion of a larger \u201cheavenly entity\u201d, or \u201cpowerhouse\u201d, or supernatural force, or Being that controls and rules the heavens and the universe. (which are images and metaphors we have been imprinted with since childhood) If you\u2019re ready to understand the existence of Godness beyond all the objectified metaphorical images that have been mentally inputted in our lives so far, then you will find the following discussion useful. And secondly, have we stood back far enough to take a deeper look at some profound perspectives on the hidden ways which religion has long evolved through personifying and objectifying non-explainable and non-tangible \u201cfundamental reality\u201d through descriptions and the languaging of human socio-cultural events, stories, metaphors, and symbolisms ? Thus, elusively making us believe that the description process, or the representation of fundamental reality, is actually the reality itself. We have been wrongly conditioned to believe that a map is actually the territory being mapped. Whereas a map cannot be the territory it maps. It only depicts the territory. In other words, epistemology is never the ontology \u2014 nor metaphysics. I have recently written two essays on this. You may like to go here for the first piece .... http://qr.ae/TUpqMa ",

            "answer_text": "A simple implication would be the irrefutable limitation of total conscious experience into the confines of language. Another way to say this is\u2026different languages produce different conscious experiences\u2014but it is possible to have a non-linguistic conscious experience. The inability to ever perfectly measure or define non-linguistic conscious experience with language is the most significant implication of metaphysics, epistemology, and axiology. This is precisely why art has both implicate and explicate effects on people. Likewise this is why communication can be paradoxical and present two conflicting messages in what is spoken versus what a person actions express. ",
