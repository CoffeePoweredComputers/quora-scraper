            "answer_text": "Absolute freedom is expressed only through the ability of omnipotence, and so is the possession of God. One with a more sophisticated understanding might even say that it is an ability to perform that lays well beyond any God\u2019s - and instead would be the characteristic of not only a Divine Being, but Divinity itself. What is more is that the ability of omnipotence also inherently requires the resources of omniscience, the act of omnifiscence and the condition of omnipresence. This is relevant to the question because absolute freedom can not be distinguished from absolute control. This is true because one would have to be totally deterministic for themselves. They would not only need to be a participant within, but would also need to be the creator of their reality (in other words, their specific World or their particular reality - noting that Universe would be inclusive of all Worlds, and itself is an expression of Divinity). However, there is still a problem here\u2026 The problem being that the absolute freedom of any single God is relative; here, meaning limited to an ideal archetype - of which the God themselves are an expression of, or is a perfect role model for. Much of Ancient Mysticism talked about Gods and their Worlds, which is to say their realities or perspectives within which they were all powerful, but this only necessitates that these Gods were all powerful within their respective kingdoms. To explain further, a Divine Being (who is deterministic for themselves) and Divinity itself (which is deterministic of itself) are two separate matters. This is relevant to the topic because being totally deterministic for oneself and omnipotent in actions still does not mean that one possesses absolute freedom. Given the differences between God and Divinity, it can also be said that this Divine Being would not only need to be the creator of their reality, but that they themselves would also have to consist entirely of that reality - in that this would allow them to be not only deterministic for themselves, but also to be deterministic of themselves (meaning able to self create, which would seem very necessary for the freedom to be truly absolute). They would be the inventors of themselves and for themselves; inseparable from themselves, and knowable only of and unto themselves. If one wanted to be flippant about it, they might say that God (although here meaning the Divinity beyond being) is the ultimate narcissist. So, all of this is for the purpose of returning back to the original question where in talking about philosophies of total determinism and absolute freedom, these extremes seem to necessitate that one delve into matters more closely related to Theology (which itself would seem is just an academic take on Mysticism). In the above, you find both total determinism and absolute freedom - and maybe can conclude that rather than being in complete contrast to one another, that neither can exist without the other. ",
