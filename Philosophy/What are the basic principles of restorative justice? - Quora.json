            "answer_text": "I want to write about this but I have no time now, except for one very important point. I will come back sometime and fill this answer out. The following are my opinions, they are not derived from legal textbooks.. thus they might not accord with \u2018legal\u2019 authorities. The word \u201cjustice\u201d, when qualified by an adjective to give us \u201crestorative justice\u201d, indicates that there are various genres of justice. That might surprise many of us because justice seems to be a rather simple idea, despite the number and inner complexity of legal codes. The point I want to put on the record now is that fundamental justice, the justice that sustains the cosmos is \u2018inescapable regenerative restorative justice\u2019, not the type of justice that most societies use to sustain societies and civilisations. The latter is only ultimately useful if it is practiced in the conscious context of a viable universal hope of restoration; retribution is not about restoration. As fundamental and as absolute, retributive justice offers no ultimate hope except now in some jurisdictions as a secondary option and as a kind of escape hatch for the accused who is assessed to be \u201crestorable\u201d, given the cooperation of the \u2018plaintiff\u2019. Those detail I want to discuss later. If human organisation and social function is to resonate with fundamental justice, the \u201cscales of justice\u201d genre of justice that we depend on for security (but not joyful hope) cannot produce the harmony and (moral) growth we generally hanker for. All genres of justice should be consciously derived from \u201cfundamental restorative justice\u201d, not from \u201cLady Justice\u201d and her scales. The thrust and the context of existence is \u201crestorative\u201d throughout, except in most human practice a policy. I do not know of any society or any organisation that treats \u2018retributive justice\u2019 as a contingent, dependent and derived from \u2018cosmic regenerative restorative justice\u2019, not even so-called Christian societies or Christian institutions. In practice, humanity at large, as well as institutions that are supposed to deal in \u2018regenerative restorative justice\u2019 all deal in \u201cthe scales of justice\u201d justice. The following from Wikipedia is loaded with meaning and it rightly reflects or represents the roots of cultures that esteem notions such as the \u2018rule of law\u2019 and in doing so we can say that such cultures do not explicitly understand, esteem or hope in the rule of \u2018restorative justice\u2019 while there is no hope for moral/spiritual flourishing in \u2018Lady Justice\u2019. Thus societies cannot be \u2018regenerated\u2019 under the rule of Meat, Isis, Themis, Dike or Moses et al., even though it is now more clear than ever that it is legislators that drive culture\u2026 into common (western) sterility. The separation of \u2018church and state\u2019 is not productive because church and state compete in terms of the same genre of justice - \u201cscale balancing\u201d justice. This is foolishness on the part of the church because its jurisdiction is supposed to represent \u201cultimate regenerative restorative justice\u201d, i.e., the Christian community generally promotes its own and various versions of \u201cthe rule of law\u201d. This is why the churches cannot connect, despite all the sensual gimmicks \u2026 the churches cannot connect in really useful civil action and cooperation because, even when it promotes restoration or regeneration its goal is to establish a righteousness scales. In radical Christian terms - contrast Torah, Mishnah, Rome etc - restoration is assumed as the grounds for human dealing, it is not an option. The structure even for the so-called condemned is NOT time/space imbalance but the fundamental all-embracing cosmological fact of divine love\u2026 contrast divine pissed-off-ness, divine hurt pride, divine vengeance. Thus \u201cthe regenerative, restorative justice that originally shook both the \u201cJewish\u201d and the Roman worlds is not well or widely represented in the churches much less in legislatures. Wikipedia gives us this information about Lady Justice: The personification of justice balancing the scales dates back to the goddess Maat, and later Isis, of ancient Egypt. The Hellenic deities Themis and Dike were later goddesses of justice. Themis was the embodiment of divine order, law, and custom, in her aspect as the personification of the divine rightness of law. She is indeed most consciously embeded as \u201cthe Way\u201d in our world. She is\u2026 sadly\u2026 the fundament principle and condition upon which even the so-called Gospel of restoration is rationalised. But she is sterile and all that is built upon her is sterile\u2026 it cannot regeneration, restore except to sustain us in this common mediocrity and suffering. ",

            "answer_text": "Principles of Restorative Justice The following is taken from an article written by Howard Zehr and Henry Mika, (1998), \"Fundamental Concepts in Restorative Justice\" , in Contemporary Justice Review, Vol. 1. I. Crime is Fundamentally a Violation of People and Interpersonal Relationships. Victims and the community have been harmed and are in need of restoration. The primary victims are those most directly affected by the offense but others, such as family members of victims and offenders, witnesses and members of the affected community, are also victims.The relationships affected (and reflected) by the crime must be addressed.Restoration is a continuum of responses to the range of needs and harms experienced by the victims, offenders and the community.Victims, offenders and the affected communities are the key stakeholders in justice. A restorative justice process maximizes the input and participation of these parties - but especially primary victims as well as offenders - in the search for restoration, healing, responsibility and prevention.The roles of these parties will vary according to the nature of the offense as well as the capacities and preferences of the parties.The state has circumscribed roles, such as investigating facts, facilitating processes and ensuring safety, but the state is not a primary victim.II. Violations Create Obligations and Liabilities. Offender's obligations are to make things right as much as possible. Since the primary obligation is to the victims, a restorative process empowers victims to effectively participate in defining obligations.Offenders are provided opportunities and encouragement to understand the harm they have caused to victims and the community and to develop plans for taking appropriate responsibility.Voluntary participation by offenders is maximized; coercion and exclusion are minimized. However, offenders may be required to accept their obligations if they do not do so voluntarily.Obligations that follow from the harm inflicted by the crime should be related to making things right.Obligations may be experienced as difficult, even painful, but are not intended as pain, vengeance or revenge.Obligations to victims such as restitution take priority over other sanctions and obligations to the state such as fines.Offenders have an obligation to be active participants in addressing their own needs.The community's obligations are to victims and to offenders and for the general welfare of its members. The community has a responsibility to support and help victims of crime to meet their needs.The community bears a responsibility for the welfare of its members and the social conditions and relationships which promote both crime and community peace.The community has responsibilities to support efforts to integrate offenders into the community, to be actively involved in the definitions of offender obligations and to ensure opportunities for offenders to make amends.III. Restorative Justice Seeks to Heal and Put Right the Wrongs. The needs of victims for information, validation, vindication, restitution, testimony, safety and support are the starting points for justice. The safety of victims is an immediate priority.The justice process provides a framework that promotes the work of recovery and healing that is ultimately the domain of the individual victim.Victims are empowered by maximizing their input and participation in determining needs and outcomes.Offenders are involved in repair of the harm insofar as possible.The process of justice maximizes opportunities for exchange of information, participation, dialogue and mutual consent between victim and offender. Face-to-face encounters are appropriate in some instances while alternative forms are more appropriate in others.Victims have the principal role in defining and directing the terms and conditions of the exchange.Mutual agreement takes precedence over imposed outcomes.Opportunities are provided for remorse, forgiveness and reconciliation.Offender's needs and competencies are addressed. Recognizing that offenders themselves have often been harmed, healing and integration of offenders into the community are emphasized.Offenders are supported and treated respectfully in the justice process.Removal from the community and severe restriction of offenders is limited to the minimum necessary.Justice values personal change above compliant behaviour.The justice process belongs in the community. Community members are actively involved in doing justice.The justice process draws from community resources and, in turn, contributes to the building and strengthening of community.The justice process attempts to promote changes in the community to both prevent similar harms from happening to others, and to foster early intervention to address the needs of victims and the accountability of offenders.Justice is mindful of the outcomes, intended and unintended, of its responses to crime and victimization. Justice monitors and encourages follow-through since the healing, recovery, accountability and change are maximized when agreements are kept.Fairness is assured, not by uniformity of outcomes, but through provision of necessary support and opportunities to all parties and avoidance of discrimination based on ethnicity, class and sex.Outcomes which are predominately deterrent or incapacitative should be implemented as a last resort, involving the least restrictive intervention while seeking restoration of all the parties involved.Unintended consequences such as co-optation of restorative processes for coercive or punitive ends, undue offender orientation, or the expansion of social control, are resisted.Additionally, Zehr and Mika (1998) note that the following \"signposts\" are indications that we are moving towards restorative practices: Focus on harms of wrongdoing more than the rules that have been broken;Show equal concern and commitment to victims and offenders, involving both in the process of justice;Work towards the restoration of victims; empowering them and responding to their needs as they see them;Support offenders while encouraging them to understand, accept and carry out their obligations;Recognize that while obligations may be difficult for offenders, they should not be intended as harms and they must be achievable;Provide opportunities for dialogue, direct or indirect, between victims and offenders as appropriate;Involve and empower the affected community through the justice process, and increase its capacity to recognize and respond to community bases of crime;Encourage collaboration and reintegration rather than coercion and isolation;Give attention to the unintended consequences of our actions and programs;Show respect to all parties, including victims, offenders and justice colleagues.",
