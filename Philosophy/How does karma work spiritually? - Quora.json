            "answer_text": "What you call as \u201cmy life\u201d is a certain amount of energy controlled by a certain amount of information. This information, in today\u2019s terms, can be called software. A certain amount of life energy is charged with a certain amount of information. Together, this information technology is you. You become a certain kind of character because of the type of information that has gone into you. The past impressions of life go far beyond the moment you were born, but in your perception right now, at least from the moment you were born till today, what kind of parents, family, and education you had, what kind of religious and social background, what kind of cultural realities \u2013 all these impressions have gone in. Someone has become a different character simply because of the type of information that has gotten into him. This is what is karma. This information is traditionally called karma or karmic body or causal body \u2013 that which causes life. This information is on many different levels. There are four dimensions, two of which are not relevant right now. For understanding, we can talk about the other two. One is sanchita karma. This is the warehouse of karma which goes right back to a single-celled animal and even inanimate substances from where life evolved. All the information is there. If you close your eyes, become aware enough and look into yourself, you will know the nature of the universe \u2013 not because you are looking at it through your head, but simply because this information is present in the making of the body. There is a warehouse of information going back into creation. That is your sanchita karma. But you cannot take your warehouse and do retail business. You need to have a shop to do retail. That \u201cretail shop,\u201d which is for this life, is called prarabdha. Prarabdha karma is a certain amount of information allotted for this life. Depending upon the vibrancy of your life, life allots for itself how much information it can take on. The creation is very compassionate. If it gives you the whole lot of karma that you have, you will be dead. Right now, many people are tortured by the simple memories from the 30-40 years of this lifetime. If they are given a hundred times that memory, they wouldn\u2019t survive it. So, nature allots prarabdha, an allotted memory that you could handle. \u2026\u2026\u2026more on karma -> Karma means action. As you sit here, you are performing four types of actions. Your body is doing something \u2013 otherwise, you would not be alive. Similarly, your mind, emotions, and life energies are also performing some action. These four are happening every moment of your life \u2013 in wakefulness and in sleep. More than 99% of your karma, your actions, are unconscious. But the residual memory of these actions builds up within you. For example, as you walk from one place to another, there may be 10 different kinds of smells, but you may not really notice them unless something is acute. But all the 10 different smells that entered your nostrils are recorded within you. The human system is a phenomenal machine. It does not miss anything. Whether you are conscious of it or not, it grasps and records everything, all the time. Based on this memory, you develop certain tendencies. The traditional word for these tendencies is vasana. Depending upon the type of vasana you have, you tend to move towards certain kinds of life situations. We say \u201cIt\u2019s your karma\u201d \u2013 that means \u201cIt\u2019s your doing.\u201d Unfortunately, karma is being projected as punishment or reward for something. Karma is neither punishment nor reward. It means you are building up memory; you are unconsciously writing a \u201csoftware\u201d, every moment of your life. Whatever your software turns out to be, accordingly you behave, function and experience your life. Karma means life is entirely your making. Whether you create it consciously or unconsciously is the question. No one up in heaven is operating your life. Karma means you create your life. Once you understand that you are largely creating your life unconsciously, is it not natural for your intelligence to try to become as conscious as possible? Consciousness is like the voltage of a light bulb. If you crank up the voltage, it shows you everything. If you lower the voltage, it only shows you a little. There is no point trying to be conscious. If you make your life energies very intense, consciousness will burn within you. If there is no intensity, if you are only talking and reading about consciousness, it will not happen. Wiping Out Karma We must understand, in Indian culture, God is not our goal. God is one more tool. The ultimate goal and highest value for us is liberation, freedom, mukti or moksha. Right now, heaven may look like a great place, but if you go there, you will be bored after some time. But anyway, do you have proof that you are not already in heaven? You are already in heaven and making a mess out of it! If you are willing, the presence of the Divine is as much here as anywhere else. Mukti means to break the cycle. Why would you want to break the cycle? People think if you are miserable, you will want to break the cycle. Not at all. A miserable person will want to come back richer, better, healthier, taller, more beautiful, more whatever else. Only a person who has seen life in all its facets will want to go beyond this. Mukti means we want to wear off the karmic information that we have gathered, which is trapping life in it and building a body around itself. If you dismantle this karmic information, the life within will not be you or me \u2013 it will be just life. This is a living cosmos. To give an analogy \u2013 if you blow a soap bubble, the bubble is real. But if the bubble breaks, only a drop of water will fall down. The rest of the bubble will be gone. The air that was in the bubble will merge with the air around. Life is not only in you, it is outside of you too. That is why you are breathing in and breathing out. You cannot exist without that. You may call it oxygen or something else, but that does not matter. Essentially, what you call life is all-pervading. It behaves according to whatever kind of information it gets trapped with. That is what we refer to as karma. Karma is like a software. It is all the same life energy, but with a different software. So, it behaves entirely differently. If you dismantle the karmic software completely, where will life go? Nowhere \u2013 it is just there. Only the individual identity will be lost. In fact, the life within you never has individual identity. It is only your software which is individual. If you write it unconsciously, it will assume all kinds of forms \u2013 some you may like, others you may not. If you write the karmic software consciously, you will create what you want. -> none of this is my own content. Copied from -> isha.sadhguru.org ",

            "answer_text": "I very strongly recommend reading of the books \u2018 Aghora \u2018 volumes 1, 2 and 3. 1 and 2 will set the tone and 3 will take you to a full understanding of what Karma is all about. While the books are a biography of Swami Vimalananda a wealthy renunciate who delved in the beyond and the hereafter, the writer disciple Svoboda matures spiritually through out the treatise. You will feel you are a part of the picture. While Volumes 1 and 2 may be off putting for the \u2018puritanical' (they narrate tantric practices), Volume 3 is all about karma, more than you will ever need to know. For those \u2018puritanical \u2018 folks, start with An Autobiography of a Yogi about the life and times of Swami Yogananda. ",
