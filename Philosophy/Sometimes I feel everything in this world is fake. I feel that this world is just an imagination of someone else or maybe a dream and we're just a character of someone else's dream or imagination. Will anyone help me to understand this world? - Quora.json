            "answer_text": "Once there existed a saint named Zhuang Zhou. He was known for always being happy for no reason. But one day, he was sitting outside his home with a sad face. And people were wondering what had happened to him. A person came to him and asked what had happened? To which he replied that he was facing a problem that no one could solve. That problem had left him puzzled and no one seemed to have a solution to it. He said, \u201cLast night, I was dreaming of hovering over flowers in a garden as a butterfly.\u201d The person asked,\u201dWhat is the problem in that?\u201d. He said,\u201dI was sleeping and in my dream I had become a butterfly. It could also be that the butterfly had gone to sleep and is dreaming that she had become me. My life could just be a dream of that butterfly. It\u2019s possible. Now, I don\u2019t know whether my dream is true or that of that butterfly? How do I solve this problem. It has put a question on my life, my reality. And no one seems to have an answer to it\u201d. ~ An excerpt from Osho\u2019s discourses. ",
