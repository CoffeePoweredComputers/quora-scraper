            "answer_text": "Any significantly deep thought is philosophy, while science is a methodology derived from several philosophies. Thus philosophy is broader than science, and not a science itself. To be a bit more specific, science is the method using empirical tests to judge the validity of a hypothesis, and thus to dismiss failing hypothesis, showing them to not be truthful. Empirical tests are tests which rely on the empirical stance. The Empirical stance is the notional that reality is stable and rational (in the mathmatical sense). Empiricism is a stance in epistemology, and epistemology is the philosophic subject that seeks to address the subject of how we know what we know. Epistemology, is a sub-section of metaphysics. Metaphysics is the sub-section of philosophy that deals with abstractions. Thus science is a methodology that is derived from philosophy. Philosophy is not the science of science. ",

            "answer_text": "The thing is u need to define what a science ,bfore answering this question . A science is a field of study,which involves decomposing huge, complicated ideas from nature into smaller basic ideas and using these ideas to predict deatails of similar events .(I.e., everything except faith,fantasy and religion). Now if u didn't know,science is a subset of philosophy ,(natural philosophy) as philosophy describes the ability to form unbiased conclusions from limited info we have about the world .Hence,Anything which is part of science is ALSO part of philosophy ",
