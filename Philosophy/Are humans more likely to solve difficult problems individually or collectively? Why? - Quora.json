            "answer_text": "I have made an informal study of this topic with my teams, over the years. Granted a MMO is not the Manhattan Project but we try. In my experience, most major breakthroughs come from individuals working late or early, often during a short break or distraction (or even in a dream). The group or team provides purpose, time pressure, positive competition, the quality bar, camaraderie and peer pressure. My teams mostly play our B+ game in group collaboration, then we find extra time to slink away to a quiet corner, to conjure up the serious stuff that we hope will awe and impress our colleagues.  So, to me, individuals crack problems alone, while teams push us to be our best. A lone researcher can do great work, but talented peers helps keep your energy up, so private results come quicker. ",

The question is complex, because some difficult problems are best solved alone \u2014 and others are best solved with a team of qualified engineers (or other professionals). ",
