            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t \u201cfind your true self\u2019, regardless of whether or not consciousness can be seen by the mind. True self isn\u2019t in there waiting to be discovered \u2014 it emerges as your relationship with truth evolves. One way to say that \u2014 brief but somewhat punchy \u2014 is \u201ctrue self gives birth to itself.\u201d So there\u2019s no point in looking for it buried away inside you: you won\u2019t find it. That doesn\u2019t mean that introspection or self-observation are pointless: there are plenty of truths that can be uncovered by turning on the bright lights of self-awareness\u2026 it\u2019s just a mistake to mark any of those truths as \u201cmy self.\u201d The self you can discover is always some derived concept: you take out your knife, and you cut around something that seems like an edge or a boundary between \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d, and you designate \u201cthis\u201d as \u201cself\u201d, and now you\u2019ve got a self-concept. It doesn\u2019t matter what provides the boundary, anything you choose will yield the same result semantically \u2014 \u201csome definition of I which was produced by discrimination and semantic designation.\u201d That includes \u201cenlightened\u201d ideas like \u201cthe self is consciousness\u201d or \u201cthe self is non-dual awareness\u201d, as well as traditional ideas like \u201cthe self is your values\u201d or \u201cthe self is your inner love\u201d, etc. There is no way to construct a definition of self which doesn\u2019t rely on this bit about discrimination and designation, and in general those processes occur in a way which \u201cdisowns\u201d the resulting definition \u2014 in other words, the individual treats their self-definition as if it were a pre-existing truth that they have discovered, rather than a meaning which they created. That\u2019s \u201cdisownership\u201d: failing to acknowledge ones\u2019 authorship of a distinction or concept. So is \u201ctrue self\u201d even an authentic possibility? My answer is an unequivocal \u201cyes\u201d. Absolutely, it\u2019s an authentic possibility. But\u2026 a \u201cdisowned meaning of self\u201d is inherently inauthentic, according to me. If you have a definition of self which you didn\u2019t create, then I call \u201cbullshit.\u201d You\u2019ve disowned your knife of discrimination \u2014 you\u2019re acting as if there\u2019s some external authority which blesses the meaning you give to \u201cI\u201d\u2026 like the laws of meaning, or God, or some famous philosopher or something. But no such authority can be found and authenticated. So then does that mean you\u2019re free to just make up any old definition of \u201cself\u201d as long as you acknowledge your authorship? Nope! Can\u2019t get away with that one, either\u2026 because if you (for example) try to make up the idea that you are Napoleon Bonaparte, you run into the problem of \u201cit\u2019s your word vs. a huge pile of facts.\u201d There\u2019s a ton of facts which validate the conventional meaning of \u201cNapoleon Bonaparte\u201d, and if you want to co-opt the meaning of \u201cNapoleon Bonaparte\u201d and give it a different meaning than what convention offers, you\u2019re going to have to dismiss a huge pile of facts. The meaning of \u201cNapoleon Bonaparte\u201d isn\u2019t naturally in your domain of authority: you can redefine it, but doing so won\u2019t give you any deep truth that you can stand upon. This conversation can go on for quite a while: a complete treatment of all of the \u201clogic of meaning\u201d that surrounds the topic of true self is a lengthy conversation. So I want to zip past a lot of that and share how this turns out, if done correctly: there is a domain of meaning in which you are an absolute authority, and that domain has limits. Within those limits, you have no competition: you have complete power to make truth, and the truth you make is just as true as any other truth. But, making that kind of truth is entirely optional: nothing will make this kind of truth for you, if you don\u2019t make it. The space just stays empty if you don\u2019t fill it. What you get by being human is the possibility of true self, but not the actuality. To \u201cactualize\u201d true self requires giving birth to yourself \u2014 you have to realize that the potential exists, that you already have the power that you need, but that power must be exercised \u2014 and then you are 100% responsible for the maintenance of the truth that you create: you create it ongoingly, in effect. The domain of authority that a human naturally has is the power to create \u201ctranscendent truth\u201d about the self. A \u201ctranscendent\u201d truth is a truth which is not \u201cboxed up\u201d by opposition to other kinds of truth. An example of a transcendent truth is \u201cI am whole and valid.\u201d This truth is true because I have the authority to make it true, and my designation of that as a truth is entirely grounded by my willingness to stand for it and uphold it. This truth is not in opposition to any other truth, it provides a context or \u201cframe\u201d for other truths, but doesn\u2019t argue with them, as would happen if I claimed to be Napoleon Bonaparte. So I create that truth and then I relate to that truth as something which I can express, and a sort of \u201cvalidation loop\u201d occurs between the results of my self-expression and the truthfulness of the truth I\u2019ve created\u2026 my willingness to put myself on the line to uphold that truth results in actions which demonstrate that it is, in fact, true. I am indeed whole and valid, and my actions and feelings and thoughts validate that. But to keep that straight, I must be willing to hold my own authority as absolute in this domain \u2014 I can\u2019t rely on anybody else validating my authority, nor can I allow others to \u201coutrank\u201d me in this domain. It is entirely my job to say what \u201cI\u201d means: I can make and validate and uphold transcendent truths about that, and when doing so, I become \u201cself-grounding\u201d, and then I know what true self is \u2014 not just as an abstract concept, but as a lived experience that affects my life in profound ways. Sorry, that\u2019s kind of a long treatment of the topic, even though it leaves out a lot. It might be obvious that this viewpoint disagrees with all other viewpoints about the meaning of \u201ctrue self\u201d, since it relies on a pretty careful path through the subject of \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019, but I stand by the claim that all of its competitors can be slain with counter-arguments. This one will remain standing in any storm. ",

            "answer_text": "Since the body, mind and soul are one composite unit - who you are is the ultimate reality (permanent) and what you are in body and mind is the mid-reality (temporary). Now in the mid reality, you remain in illusions presuming the thinking self to be that true self. Once, you go beyond the mind, you discover your true self. The actual self or the ultimate reality cannot be seen but can definitely be observed by your superconscious section, which is considered by science as the unconscious part of the brain. How? When you are alert and aware, you will observe that there is another self seated in the mind checking, guiding and warning your thinking self; whenever it tries to do something unfavourable or when crossing a certain limit, warning- you should not. This subtle inner voice is that true self, which cannot be seen but can be felt. Spiritualism refers to that as the soul and the role it plays in the mind is that of the witnessing consciousness. Whenever, you are alert, observant, attentive and aware you shall discover that inner witnessing self, guiding you now and then whenever required. So long as your desires do not suppress refusing to listen to that divine residing within - Thou Art That. giankumar.com ",
