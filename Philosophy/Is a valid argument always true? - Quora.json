            "answer_text": "By \u201ctrue\u201d I assume (although I may be wrong) you mean that the conclusion of the argument is true. But valid arguments do not always have true conclusions. Saying that an argument is valid means that it is logically structured in such a way that if the premises are true, then, necessarily, the conclusion is true. But the antecedent of this conditional may very well be false. In other words, a valid argument can have false premises. In that case, the conclusion may or may not be true. Consider some examples of the argument form Modus Ponens (a simple, and uncontroversial valid, argument form) [conclusions in bold] True conclusion: If dogs are animals, dogs are alivedogs are animalsdogs are aliveFalse conclusion: If dogs are animals, dogs can speak englishdogs are animalsdogs can speak englishTrue conclusion, valid argument, but a false premise (and therefore not a convincing argument): If dogs are animals, dogs have brainsDogs are animalsDogs have brains.",

            "answer_text": "Valid arguments are always truth-preserving. That is to say, the conclusion follows from the premises so if the premises are true then the conclusion will be true also. However, validity is no guarantee of a true conclusion since a valid argument could have false premises. If Peter Hawkins is President of the United States, then the moon is made of cheesePeter Hawkins is President of the United StatesTherefore, the moon is made of cheeseThe above is a valid argument. But the premises are false, and so is the conclusion. ",
