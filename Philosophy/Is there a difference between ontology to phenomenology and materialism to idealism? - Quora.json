            "answer_text": "No, because materialism and idealism are opposites. Yet, ontology and phenomenology are not opposites. Define the terms and the answer becomes clear. Ontology is the study of the relationship of Being to Ideas. For example, in Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument for the Existence of God, he said to get the Idea of the most perfect Being. Call that God. Now, does that perfect Being exist? No? Then you have failed to get the idea of the most perfect Being. It can\u2019t be perfect if it doesn\u2019t exist. So, try again. So, the relationship between the Idea of Being and Being itself was established by Anselm. Even Plato and Aristotle missed this doctrine. It is the essence of all Philosophy since Descartes. So much for Ontology. Phenomenology is quite different; it is about phenomena, which means appearances. It is based on the ancient doctrine that the material world (the empirical world of the five senses) reveal only Appearances (phenomena). They are not the Real Thing. The main evidence is that they are always springing up into existence, lasting for a varied duration, and then they fade away and die. That is the essence of all material things. They are all temporary. Therefore, says Phenomenology, they are all Appearances; manifestations of Something Else. Hegel maintained that behind all Phenomena rests the Geist (Spirit, God). The Spirit expresses itself in Phenomena so liberally, that World History is the result. This is Dialectical Phenomenology as conceived by Hegel (which is different from the phenomenology of Husserl). In any case, Ontology is about Being and Ideas, and Phenomenology is about beings and Geist, so they are more similar than opposites. So, I see no parallel with the opposition of materialism and idealism. ",

            "answer_text": "Materialism is the opposite of idealism. Materialism states that the world is entirely material, there is no spirit, no souls, no existence of Ideals. Idealism states either that the world is fundamentally ideal in nature, or that the material world is some manner of emanation from the fundamental ideal nature of the world. The first position is that of Hegel, the second position is that of Plato.Ontology is the study of what is, literally it means the logos of being. Phenomenology is the study of what appears, phenomena are appearing things. Ontology and phenomenology are both present in a great many philosophers' writings. Immanuel Kant, for instance, prioritizes phenomenology over ontology, stating that the world is appearing things, and that whatever things are in themselves - the noumenal world- is unavailable to human understanding. Husserl, I believe, completely merges his ontology with his phenomenology with his battle cry \"to the things-themselves\" by which he meant things as they appear minus the intentionality human understanding places upon every appearing object. The difference between ontology and phenomenology for Kant, is that ontology is logically unavailable to human understanding, while for Husserl the difference between ontology and phenomenology is the intentionality of human apperception. Martin Heidegger calls this marriage of ontology and phenomenology, onto-theology, and he inquires for the first time in history why our understanding of being is so divided ",
