            "answer_text": "The concept that consciousness has \u201clevels\u201d is derived from our experience with sleep and chemicals that alter the manner in which we experience the signals coming into to us from outside. Consciousness is the act of paying attention to signals (plus the subjective sense this experience is happening to \u201cme\u201d). Intelligence is recognizing patterns. They are related cognitive functions in that without attention one cannot \u201crecognize\u201d anything. Recognition (cognizing then recognizing) is not the same as paying attention; in fact, we may gaze at something we cannot recognize, being cognizant of something that we haven\u2019t yet recognized, until we finally recognize the pattern. Thus cognizing (being conscious of) something and recognizing (knowing what it is you are conscious of) are correlated but not the same at all. ",

            "answer_text": "IQ is determined by standardized testing. It\u2019s not used to evaluate extreme mental states or altered states of consciousness. Psychiatry offers other standards for that measurement mostly just to evaluate pathology. Wisdom traditions also have their own milestones for progress in meditative or ecstatic states if that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to. One thing to note though is that more educated people tend to be able to be better at empathy, which is a widely valued trait in traditions of self-cultivation. Coming from a purely western point of view, your testable intelligence can be affected by pathological neurological or psychological states, but the measure is usually one of disability. As far as I know, psychology doesn\u2019t offer milestones for any positive extreme states of consciousness. There\u2019s no contemporary western equivalent of positive contemplative trance or shamanic type states. ",
