I can't tickle myself, that doesn't work but others can. It is no proof but\u2026 Jokes with a surprising twist make me laugh. I am not very funny but when I come up with a joke myself once in a while it feels like \"Eureka!\" not \"Hahaha\" it is different\u2026 Although I consider myself a smart ass :-), I have been taught things by people: conclusions I could never have come up with on my own. The world just seems to big and complex for solipsism to be a real option. It's bigger than me! ",

You are Shakespeare, Sappho, Hildegard of Bingen, Mahler, Ada Lovelace, Salvador Dali, Julie Mehretu, Rilke, Emily Dickinson, Laoze, Kurt Godel, Sylvia Plath\u2026 Do you really think that is possible? If true, then your solipsistic consciousness is hiding things from you. In effect it is partitioned into other conciousnesses that have access to talents and abilities that are not available to your reasoning self. Almost like there are other people. Absurd things can be real, but solipsism is absurd. Thinking solipsisticly\u2019s sticky. ",

If you're the only who really exists, how can you ask me, an ontologically unreal person to answer that. If I say \"yes solipsism is real\" then what it means is that I'm the only person who really exists, but if John says solipsism is real then, to him, he's the only person who really exists, and if you say it, then you're the only person who really exists. If solipsism is \"real\" then I, the person answering, am not a real person but a mere figment of your mind so in essence my answer on solipsism is the result of your mind. Another person cannot answer to you whether solipsism is \"real\". ",

We have a collective-subconscious, or we know the will of the group without communications. And, there are people who at times can engage and know another person\u2019s mind. In western cultures, this collectiveness and interconnectedness has been repressed. I think this collectiveness also engages animals\u2026. S.V. I do not know if there are any persons out there sharing one mind and one soul (spiritual aggregates), but its possible, for a short duration anyway. ",
