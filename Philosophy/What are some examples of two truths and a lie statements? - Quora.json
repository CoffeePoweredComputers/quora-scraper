            "answer_text": "A little off topic but... When you start work someplace new or begin with a new group of co-workers on a committee, it is common for you to be paired up with another member; the idea being that you will exchange information about yourselves and then your 'partner' will introduce you to the larger group.  I tired of this on occasion. So, sometimes I'd make up outrageous things (i.e. I said that I had cycled across the Sahara desert, studied aboreal locomotion in new world monkeys, filmed underwater as great white sharks preyed on seals in the oceans off South Africa, etc.).  But I'd always end by also saying that my life was really like Walter Mitty and that everything I'd just said was a fabrication.  It was funny to watch the other person dutifully writing down everything I'd said, including the fact it was fiction, until the 'light' finally went on and we both had a good chuckle. Then, sometimes, they'd introduce me that way and I'd enjoy the all-too-brief admiration of the other participants until the truth was revealed. Another good-natured chuckle. But it did make it harder to convince them, later, of anything a bit out of the ordinary. ",
