Imagination is all what mind thinks and then those thoughts can go in any direction depending on the fear and insecurities of a person. The more fear and insecurities a person has the more it has tendencies to think about preventing those dangers and threats in life which as also the result of the human thoughts which in turn how much a person is evolved.

            "answer_text": "Yes without control of awareness you are letting your imagination wander aimlessly in any direction, if you direct you awareness, focus, and energy in a specific directions it\u2019s a lot more successful to reap results. It\u2019s like a farmer planting seeds on farms all over South Dakota, instead of in a central farm. He\u2019ll have to go around everywhere to see minimal produce and varying results. Versus him concentrating his labors to one farm and seeing that they grow. Whatever you focus or put energy into, it will come back to you and you will manifest it. Hope you a have a wonderful day.

You have no control over your emotional response to the world around you. However, we all are responsible for our actions. Otherwise, civilization would cease to exist. ",
