That\u2019s usually a sign they are atheist also. In nihilistic thought, we just happened to exist, to live, and everything exists for no reason other than. it. just. does. Without getting into a theological issue but a philosophical one; there are reasons. Everything exists now because it existed before in a universe in motion, and that means change is constant. In the moment that is *This Instant,* everything and us are different in the way we are because of what the universe and everybody else just did in the moment before. And here\u2019s the kicker: Whatever we\u2019re doing or not doing in this instant (or lifetime) is going to affect how everything else is in all of the remaining instants of our lives and of the universe. Now, you don\u2019t know why, but for most of your entire life, you\u2019ve been feeding yourself for no reason \u2014 right? If it were really for no reason, why are you just now wondering why? Why didn\u2019t you starve to death years ago, or at least last Wednesday? It\u2019s because you are programmed to live, and you only get to live once; and what you do in the next instant and the next will affect how you well you could enjoy living in the one after that. The reason for life is (drum roll): While you\u2019re alive, to see how well you can live it. Not necessarily to live big or fast or in the public eye, but hopefully healthy, productive and to leave the world a better place for the kids. ",

If you\u2019re thinking in terms of whether there\u2019s life after death, immortality, in religious terms, let\u2019s just leave that one alone. No one knows. For all intents and purposes, it\u2019s a matter of belief. So, I\u2019ll keep my comments focused on the simple issue of finding meaning in life by living it every day. In that sense, every life has meaning. It has meaning to oneself, as we go through life, experiencing it every day, growing, increasing in our understanding, gaining perspective, and experiences all the joys and sorrows, triumphs and disappointments, of a life lived to its fullest. Beyond experiencing our own lives, we never can know or understand completely the effect our lives have on others. Sometimes we receive feedback, but often what we\u2019ve said, a kindness we\u2019ve extended to someone else, a moment when we stopped someone from acting in a way that might have damaged another, or some other seemingly small act will have effects that ripple far beyond our immediate experience. Sometimes we hear about them. At others, we never become aware of the good (or potential harm) our actions have had. Maybe eternal life lies in those small kindnesses or inadvertent hurts that rebound through time. Therefore, never consider your life to be or have been without meaning. You never know\u2026.. ",

On the grandest scale, it really doesn't matter if you live or die. On that scale, the universal scale, none of this and none of us matter. At all. But on your scale, you do matter. You (should) matter to yourself and you matter to the people around you. To your friends, your family - especially your children, if you have any -, to all the people whose lives you touch. So get your act together and find meaning for yourself. It doesn't have to be grand or special or last forever. You can find meaning in the smallest, most trivial of things. Your local park is full of trash? Clean it up! Your elderly neighbor can't manage the stairs anymore? Help her out! The single mom next door is on the verge of collapse? Offer to babysit, so she can do something just for herself once in a while. There are a myriad of small ways in which you can positively impact the world and the people around you. There is a plethora of ways to find meaning for oneself. Stop moping and start doing. ",

            "answer_text": "you may not know the meaning or purpose your life has but that does not mean it has no meaning or purpose. I can think of three occasions when my just being somewhere had a great impact on someone's life without my planning. Once I found a little boy lost in a department store and ended up restoring him to his mother. Another time I found a toddler on the sidewalk who had wandered out of his backyard and took him home, and the third time I was just standing at the bottom of a staircase when a child fell down and landed on my foot which saved his life as my foot was softer than the floor. ( bad sprain to my toe). My point is your existence can have meaning even without your intention. That said , it would be a good idea to intentionally do things that help others , find some way in your work and daily life where you give to others. Kindness and good deeds give meaning to your life and make your life worthwhile. ",

My life has a great deal of meaning\u2026 to me, and to other people around me. Just because there is no evidence that life has any intrinsic meaning does not mean there is no other kind of meaning that it could have. If there is anyone else who you interact with at all ever, then your life has meaning to them. All the lack of an intrinsic meaning to life means is that you are free: free to give your life whatever meaning you like. Go for it. ",

Other times you're just tired running a race you cant seem to see the end of. It is a bit discouraging. My advice would be to go and spend some regular time in a very peaceful place. Free your mind from this world. Try to focus on all the happy moments in your life. Learn to create new dreams. Exercise a bit. Eat healthy food. Start a new page and forget the upsetting things from the past. Build a new attitude. It is something you need to do for yourself.  ",
