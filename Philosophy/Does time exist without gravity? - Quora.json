            "answer_text": "What a timely question. I've been thinking about this today before i saw this questiin. And ive been perplexed for most of this thought process. But I think I have come to a answere. In my past ponderings my beliefs have been gravity actually is plasma, aether, dark energy, or as some call it the fabric of space in a originally infinitly spread out and frozen form. Then something happened somewhere in the infinity of space and time it fell out of balence somewhere in space. Or maybe many locations. Each location is the beginning of a universe. I believe all following the same rules. The rules are simple the fields only act is to attract to itself. The field the plasma the aether IS gravity and there is nothing else. Matter is gravity condenced into a spinning ball. This is probably why instien had a hard time defining gravity. So when gravity is infinitly spread out and not in motion it is like a sea of glass. When it is in motion in space its verry nature is to collapse into itself. In space it takes on a ever condencing and ever faster spinning orb with a disc like center untill the sise of dark matter whuch is a plank in sise stops it from condencing any more and if forced dencer light is born. So in my mind time is the chronological history of the movements of plasma or the fabric of space. Well this all sounds lovely to me accept for one gawing Thing I believe to be a fact. Movement or no movement time is still passing. From my perspective time is still passing even if nothing is happening. So now I'm confused. What the heck. Ok how to figure this one out? What is the originall space? Well its absolutly nothing. What is the fabric of space? That which was born from nothing. It's just a energy field born from something that was different about the nothingness somewhere in space that generated a field that attracts to itself. So basically all this stuff is actually nothing. The only way it becomes anything is threw the fabric interacting with itself in a spin matter form. Threw its own sole purpose and existance gravity. But time is also born from nothing. Or is it. Does time actually pass. Or do I perceive it to. Is time even necessary. When you take a atomic clock in a plane and drive real fast. Time is not changing. The atomic clock works because of the exchange of electromagnetic energy between particles. Moving the clock real fast simply pushes electromagnetic energy threw the particles faster. Instein's expierament was to test atomic bonds and had nothing to do with time. My conclusion is time does not exist and is not necessary. Time is nothing more then a way for man to measure the chronological movements of the fabric of space. Light or radiation is a convenient way to see the past movments of celestial objects or to see our way about. Yesterday to you I did not exist to you fine people. Tomarrow I will cease to exist to many of you. Because you will not recieve light from my movements any more. Did I actually ever exist in a diferent time. Or is time utterly non existent and irelevent. ",

            "answer_text": "time is but the construct of passing moments. Moments will happen if you are alive, dead, if gravity existed or not. Time itself is endless, constant, never changing series of events. It happens now as I type. If I type quicker, my events happen, if I type slower then less events happen, yet the same time passes by regardless of how quick I type. Gravity is the reaction of one body on another. it is a physical property that is all. Spacetime is a made up term to try and understand how gravity works. But gravity does not change time it mealy changes the speed of events, but time itself remains unalterable. Light may bend, clocks may alter, but time itself remains the same. We may just not know how to measure real time, there may not be a way. Things change with temperature, just as they do with acceleration as they do with gravity. Things change, but time remains the same. If we have 1 second on earth. it is an earth second, at that temperature range, and that gravity effect, under that motion. We look at a second on mars. And it is a Mars second under its temperature range and its gravity and motion. The difference between these two can be calculated using maths. But this does not mean each has a different real time. So in my humble opinion, Time is time, gravity is gravity, and although time may appear to change with gravity, it is just the bending and changing of a clock that you see, not time itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Does time exist without gravity? Yes, time does exist without gravity, that is, it can be found where space-time is not warped (gravity is when space and time, which are parts of a single object called space-time, are warped together). When you are standing upright, your feet are moving more slowly through time than your head is, due to the gravity of the Earth. If you were approaching a black hole, and I was watching from a distance, I would see you slowing down as you get closer to the event horizon, since time is warped, and when you reach the event horizon, I would see you freeze there forever, utterly motionless. You, on the other hand, would not experience time slowing down as you approach the event horizon. Amazingly, time can warp into a space dimension inside black holes, and can even do so at the beginning of the Big Bang. Now, a universe where a law of gravity does not exist is going to look utterly different than the one we find ourselves in. In fact, it may be that a universe requires a law of gravity. ",

People think of clocks when they think of time but there\u2019re other kinds of time. The most important kind allows events to happen. So. The OP wants to know if there's time without gravity. Probably not clock time - I think a universe without gravity would be too weird for clocks - but, as long as there are particles that change position (events), there will be (some kind of) time. ",

Assuming that time independently flows in an arbitrary point of space is quite misleading, despite what the mathematics of general relativity seems to tell you \u2014 these virtual coordinates are just averaged linearizations among discrete interactions of particles in a discrete kind of \"space\" (which is timeless and spaceless in the sense we contemplate these terms). When there are particles to combine and interact, there will be derived time and gravity, both as averaged and linearized mathematical concepts. The aforementioned is not a part of mainstream physics, it is in my personal opinion. ",
