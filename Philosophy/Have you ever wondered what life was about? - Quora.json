            "answer_text": "I have grown up listening to my elder brothers\u2019 mischieves. Now these guys are twins. So you can imagine: two hyperactive children, perched into a single home, since birth. Hell has a different name, people. When they were two, for instance. They found a basket. They got under the basket. And wouldn't you know they are up and about on our terrace . . . which didn't have railings. My mom had a simple rule. If the house is silent, Hell's gone loose. So my supermom, with her superhearing ability, hears people from 100 or more metres away on the terrace of a different building screaming for my brothers to stop. And up she goes, with her supermom superspeed. Time? Meh! The clock trembles to register another tick lest my supermom's gaze should crumple it to pieces. I still laugh my brains out when I hear her voice imitate their voices as she had picked them up: \u201cTrain is moving, brother.\u201d *Giggles like a two year old* \u201cChoochhoooo.\u201d (Did I mention my supermom was born with her supersarcasm like every other Indian mom?) Oh but you know, this doesn't even clear the top ten of most silly and dangerous things they have earned for themselves! They deserve a limerick for that: Ooooh, they have cut each other. Broke each other,Torn each other's clothes. They have stitches on their heads,And scars on their brows! Their valiant methods, all uncrownedHave so been renooooowned. There was a little time,I remember clearly.They burnt the caterpillar,With pure gasolineYes you read it right.There's not a fight.They had burned the guyWith gasooooolllllliiiiiinnnneeee! (And mind you they were then fifteeeeeennnnn!) Still tip of the iceberg, guys. But let's not dwell on their \u2018trivialities\u2019. What prompts my answer is recent. Four years ago. . . My aunt had a baby. So, that'd be the first baby I've actually seen grow up. But then one fateful unfortunate day . . . I get to keep my eyes on him. How hard could it be, right? Meh, my mom did it everyday. Wrong. I turn my eyes for a second, and poof, the little devil's gone. What the \u2014? Neel? Dude? Where did you go? Oh my God, Neel come out from under the sofa! Dang it, Neel, get off the floor! NO! DON'T EAT THAT! JFC! Don't play with the fucking matchsticks! No, not even the blades! Oh dear Bloody Mary, get away from the broken glasses! Dear lord, no! Don't go on the frickin\u2019 terrace! What da faq are you doing, Neel?! Da Faq, Neel! Get away from the socket, you idiot. NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL!  So you can imagine. A meek little kid. Broken to his soul. Staggering his way to his home. Leaning on his gate, his eyes weary from the pain of the wars. A soldier of might, carrying the dead weight of the utter lunacy. Imbecility. Stupid-frickin'-dity. That day, my dear readers, I wondered. And my voice weakly asked, \u201cMom\u2026\u201d \u201cUh-uhh?\u201d \u201cHow in the bloody name of God did you manage to keep us alive?\u201d  So yeah, what I wonder most in life is if our mom isn't a secret agent fighting against evolution to keep suicidal morons alive. I still wonder. ",

Which came first, the chicken, or the egg? And please, do not tell me, that dinosaurs, were here first for; cause Dino\u2019s, too, laid eggs. So, to try to simplify it again, to its smallest life form. Where did the life\u2019s building blocks\u2019s living cells -an atom- -an particle- , -an organ- -an membrane-, first ever were? Or, was even, born, outta? But, -unless, of course, you\u2019re referring, to life, as in truly being, alive indeed- as in if truly were, to be living life as wells; than to just, exist overall! while still may be considered I indeed, part of that whole building cell block life if! but ya! If you think bout, there\u2019s really there nothing to think off, so may be due to, why of the question indeed; cause overall, why even give a thought, of what can\u2019t even think off? So, in retrospect, CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT, EVEN WHEN STILL TO BE BELIEVED, HAD 9 LIVES OFF INDEED.

SUCH A WONDROUS THOUGHT, OF A WONDROUS, THAT STILL KNOWS NOTHING OFFS. ONE LAST THOUGHT UNTHOUGHT OFF: -does one needs to die, to then be considered alive? Or one just needs to be alive, to considered, to ever if ever still, will have to die? and/or, one that might resonate with some, if not or so hopes, many\u2019s? -does one just needs be born again, to then just be alive as wells? just to say\u2026.

            "answer_text": "It is o.k. to think about faith issues, meaning of life, and afterlife; that is a wise thing to do. Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives, we may not feel good without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day...for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates God is testing us in our short life on earth; the wealthy father has the right to test his children before distributing the wealth. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that test as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-our-purpose-of-existence-in-this-world/answer/Sabri-Shahin We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife.

But I know sometimes there are no scientific explanations to certain things. It was yesterday that my dad passed away exactly one year ago. Since his passing a lot of times I have wondered about how I will be able to see him again and have thought about where he is now. Even though I know it might seem silly sometimes I look up at night and just stare at the stars hoping I find an answer about where he is. I just miss him\u2026 ",

I settled for the explanation given by German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) that the Universe is, in a restricted sense, the best possible one that God could have created. Leibniz emphasized the role of a benevolent deity in creating this, the best of all possible worlds, where everything exists in a perfect, pre-established harmony with everything else. In such a universe, meaning of life, as implied by John Locke (1632-1704) makes sense. He believed that in a natural state all people were equal and independent, and everyone had a natural right to defend his \u201cLife, Health, Liberty and Possessions\u201d. Those who do not get these ideas naturally have to be educated to understand them. ",

All life wants to reproduce. It's the ultimate goal and make sure some live to tell the tale. It could be asexual, with multiple partners or use another life to reproduce (I consider virus life, just because they use others to reproduce shouldn't change that.) They might have numbers to make sure some survive.So why is reproduction the meaning of life? Because not only does it promote change so life can always adapt. It's to continue life itself. If there was some grand scheme, they should be evidence but there isn't. I can only use what's around me. ",

It is only now, in the midst of the unsolvable global crisis that we can\u2019t ignore any longer that whatever we built, invented is falling apart, slipping through our fingers. It is only now that we feel as if we woke up on the \u201cwrong planet\u201d whose laws we do not know. Still I believe we exist in a \u201clawful\u201d, natural system which works based on an intelligent plan, that follows clear cause and effect processes.

Just 4 years back the government had provided orders worth 50000 crores per year and today it has shrunk to just half of that. But this is also a opportunity to show yourself that you are strong enough to bear this and come out of it.
