            "answer_text": "A very deep question indeed. First of all I don\u2019t believe holoconsciousness (the conscious of the universe) is the same as God in the religious content. More likely it\u2019s a natural phenemenon that is aware of the whole universe. Every atom, electron, tree leaf, virus, human, planet, star, galaxy is part of it\u2019s consciousness , which is a mind bogling state of consciousness unimaginable for our mind. This holoconsciousness develops the same way as we do , born with the big bang, forming galaxies, life and consciousness. At the end it will die in the heath death of the universe. Now why in heavens name? It was the great philospher from Holland, Spinoza (1632) , who realised this was the case and he called the holoconscious \u201cnootwendig\u201d . This an old Dutch word for \u201cnecessary\u201d . In the previous century Planck and other quantum scientists discovered why consciousness is necessary. Our universe is in an indifferent quantum state for eternity. This means there is no time, no space and events can only happen in a certain probability and are potentially around but not in real time. It is very important to realise that the quantum universe has all the information how to built a universe : atoms, electrons, tree leave, virus, human, planet, star galaxy. Then holoconsciousness encounters and creates a classic universe from the quantum one with time, space, natural laws, order, chaos and complexity. This is called the universal quantum collapse. It neutralizes the inert quantum state of many probabilities to one probability and that\u2019s our reality. On a small scale this was proved by many experiments. (collapse of the quantum wave function) Now back to your question : Why does that (universal) consiousness give us the illusion we are different entities.?The answer is that natural laws do this, not holoconsciousness! Evolution developped a brain that connects with holoconsciousness to get reality in to our mind properly. Our mind has to connect that consciousness again to the mind body system, because only with a self it can independently survive and have a partly free will to act. If this was an intentional act of holoconsciousness is a matter of believes. If you believe holoconsciousness is like God it seems likely it wants to procreate consciousness in its own universe, but that\u2019s not my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Within one's own awareness there's a LOT of different things going on: visual, auditive, touch, etc.. None of these things have any central \u201cme\u201d that knows them. There's just the knowing itself. But whenever a process connects some of these things, it is a completely new thing arising inside awareness. But we just don't experience it like that. In the same way a visual or auditive memory feels very much like actually sensing light or sound. It feels connected to actual light and sound. But it's a completely different cat. The sense of a central \u201cme\u201d is these extra things arising in consciousness that subjectively appears to be deeply engrained with all sorts of other things. That's why I feel \u201cI\u201d only have my memories, because when such a memory arises it is usually accompanied with a \u201cme\u201d feeling. If we weren't having these extra things, these after-processings, arising in awareness, that feel as if they have anything to do with the actual experience instead of a new experience, we wouldn't be confused about this. It's just interpretation of reality, not actual reality. Unless you have learned to observe it like that via meditation. So, my actual vision knows nothing about my actual hearing and the after-processing that appears to combine them knows nothing of the actual vision and the actual hearing, even though it appears to, because it is caused by it. Also, my vision knows nothing of your vision, yet when you tell me about it and show a picture, my processing feels like it's connected with it. All these words in this answer are separate experiences, just like the interpretation of the answer is separate from the words. The latter just feels connected because it is accompanied with the experience of the understanding that they're caused by them. So a whole world full of experiences, including memories and interpretations, that are all \u201cknown\u201d by only itself, yet it is one\u2026 ",
