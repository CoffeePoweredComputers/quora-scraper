            "answer_text": "\u201cForgiveness is the scent the rose leaves on the heel that crushed it.\" The Amish had an issue right after a major event in October of 2006. Recess had just ended for 25 or so Amish children. They were returning to their small one-room schoolhouse. A local milk truck driver named Charles Roberts, who was not Amish, backed his truck up and went inside. He had weapons and scared everyone; he made the boys carry lumber, a shotgun, a stun-gun, wires, chains, nails, tools and a small bag. He then let the adults and boys go. He lined the ten little girls up in front of the chalkboard. Then systematically unloaded a hailstorm of bullets and shot them all, then himself. Five barely survived and all have problems. One girl had over two dozen bullets in her little body. The first responders got PTSD. Charles did not know them. He'd planned it for a week. God took his daughter nine years earlier so he retaliated. In addition he'd molested some children 20 years earlier and felt the urge coming back.  What happened next stunned the nation and created an uproar. The Amish started forgiving right away. They didn't display the hate and vengeance most everyone felt but instead they went for grace and compassion. The Grandfather of one of the victims said, \u201cWe must not think evil of this man.\u201dAnother Amish father noted, \u201cHe had a mother and a wife and a soul and now he\u2019s standing before a just God.\u201dAn Amish neighbor comforted the Roberts family hours after the shooting and extended forgiveness to them.The Amish parents of victims visited and comforted the shooter\u2019s widow, parents, and parents-in-law. One Amish man held Roberts\u2019 sobbing father in his arms for almost an hour to comfort him.The Amish set up a charitable fund for the family of the shooter.Hurting is not a choice; but hating is. We don\u2019t get to choose how people treat us. But we do get to choose how we respond.True forgiveness is a choice. That comes from accessing spirituality in the emotion of anger. Injustice! Not fair. You\u2019ve been wronged! Now what? The Amish see it as contaminating their lives with negative energy. They don't want it. That eye for an eye is old tribal animalistic survival beliefs. Justified revenge. It keeps the cycle of hate and fear alive sometimes for Millennia. The original justified outrage is lost but the offspring can maintain that disgust through the eons. In the biblical story of Judah and Tamar in genesis 38, it is a mess with the death of his sons and him having sex with his daughter in law. The boys are killed supposedly by God for disobedience. Lots of justified deaths. By the time Jesus comes along there are attempts to forgive and be decent. John 8:1-11 finds the harlot and Jesus says \"You, who are without sin, throw the first rock to kill her.\" They disperse.  Injustice always tends to drive revenge whatever the cost. It's hard when saving face and righteous indignation are used in place of decency and compassion. The greater good is peace in one's own heart. The people who went to watch the putting to death of Timothy McVeigh for blowing up the Murrah building in Oklahoma City did not get the satisfaction they thought they would after he died. Their loved ones were still dead and now they had cheered a human dying. The evil got on them and it did not feel good, but slimy. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the world could be a better place if people world stop at \"tooth for tooth, eye for eye\" in dealing with confrontations. Individual people tend to act pretty close to this \"ideal\". One might beat someone up for an insult or physical attack earlier, the reciprocating beating would generally be on par with the harm received earlier. In a more civil situation, one generally  seeks no more than the repair cost for an auto accident, for example. Nations rarely respond correspondingly or symmetrically when attached. Stronger countries tend to inflict a lot more harm on its opponent when compared in absolute dollar terms or number on victims. It is interesting to question why nations don't stop their beatings on their opponents as an individual might to teach a lesson but not kill or inflict permanent damage. ",
