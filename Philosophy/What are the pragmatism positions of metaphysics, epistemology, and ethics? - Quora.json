            "answer_text": "Perhaps what you want to know is, what would be the metaphysics of a pragmatist, etc? For a pragmatist there are almost no metaphysics to worry about. Our prime pragmatist was William Jsmes, who literally wrote the book on Pragmatism, argued that any considerations about principles or theory are only important if they affect the situation at hand. See below: \"But now, instead of resting in principles after this stagnant intellectualist fashion, let us apply the pragmatic method to the question. What do we MEAN by matter? What practical difference can it make NOW that the world should be run by matter or by spirit? I think we find that the problem takes with this a rather different character.\" \"James\u2019s response is based on the idea that truth is a fact that will make a difference among a given group of facts, and since there is no more reason to favor the group of facts \u201cbeing north, then west\u2026etc\u201d to the group of facts \u201cbeing in front of, then on the side of \u2026.etc.\u201d there is no reason to think one response is more true than then other. What counts as true depends what you are trying to do, where \u201ctrying to do\u201d is taken in a very broad sense to include, say, which equation you might be trying to solve.\" His famous example of a man and a squirrel running around a tree demonstrated his abeyance of principles. If the man runs around a tree with a squirrel opposite him, running around the tree to stay hidden, is the man running around the squirrel? Of course it depends on what you are asking. \"James\u2019s response is based on the idea that truth is a fact that will make a difference among a given group of facts, and since there is no more reason to favor the group of facts \u201cbeing north, then west\u2026etc\u201d to the group of facts \u201cbeing in front of, then on the side of \u2026.etc.\u201d there is no reason to think one response is more true than then other\" Truth then is situational and dependent on circumstances. Same with epistemology and ethics. ",

            "answer_text": "Six points are in order here. In philosophical anthropology, James thought of a human as a stream of consciousness, and of the conscious being as unified by his internal cohesion, the way one pulse of awareness follows from and flows out of another, not by any facts as to its physical or metaphysical setting.2. In metaphysics, James defined himself by negation, resisting both the \"upper\" and the \"lower\" dogmatisms, both idealism and materialism insofar as either threatens to impose on us a deterministic block universe. 3. In epistemology, Jamesian thought had both a negative and a positive pole. He told us to beware of verbal formulas we cannot translate into practical terms, and to believe what is in the line of our needs. 4. In ethics, James held that the only fact true about all goods is that they are objects of desire -- that objects of desire do and must conflict with one another -- and that moral life accordingly has a tragic aspect, which it is our duty to lessen over time. 5. In politics, James resisted early U.S. imperialism, and proposed the re-direction of energies into \"equivalents\" of war: that is, a strategy of the sublimation of violence. 6. In aesthetics, James wrote that the difference between the first and the second best things in art \"absolutely seems to escape verbal definition -- it is a matter of a hair, a shade, an inward quiver of some kind....\" ",
