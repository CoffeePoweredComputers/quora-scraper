            "answer_text": "No. Somoene who is anti-racist could recognize that capitalism works against racism. Racism is irrational, and thus unprofitable. If \u201cgreed\u201d is the defining characteristic of a capitalist businessman, why would he suddenly start caring more about the color of a customer\u2019s skin than the color of his money? Yes, there are always a few businessmen who are racist, but that means that their non-racist competitors can beat him in competition for customers, AND workers, as well. A businessman who refuses to hire members of some minority creates a larger labor pool for non-racist businessmen to hire from. Commerce requires people to be nice to one another. A rude salesman will make fewer sales. People engaging in international trade need to learn about foreign cultures. Racism comes from ignorance. Commerce under capitalism allows people to interact with one another, learn about one another, and this overcomes the fear that comes from ignorance. It is true that under laissez-faire capitalism, there wouldn\u2019t be affirmative action policies or anti-discrimination laws. People have the right to freedom of association. However, that would work against those who are racist enough to let their bigotry get in the way of making a profit. Racism had to have declined considerably throughout the society long before the government reversed its long standing racist policies. People had to set aside their bigotry before they could vote in politicians to overturn the Jim Crow laws. It was capitalist freedom that helped them do this. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not at all. There is no inherent link between economic systems and how people treat other races. Our current capitalist system has produced some racist outcomes. This seems to be why a lot of people believe that capitalism is racist. Their reasoning being this: (1) There are significant racial disparities in our society (2) Our society has a largely capitalist economic system (3) Therefore, capitalism results in racial disparities But this is untrue. Capitalism itself doesn\u2019t result in racial disparities; rather, a capitalist system that has been perverted by centuries of racist policies results in racial disparities. If you deny an entire group of people the right to fully participate in the economy, that is going to have long-term consequences regardless of whether this economy is capitalist or socialist. Capitalism doesn\u2019t advocate for things like slavery or the theft of land from Indigenous Peoples, nor is racial oppression something that only happens under capitalism. Capitalism can actually do a good job at reducing racial discrimination. Free-market competition means that prejudiced business-owners who forego customers or don\u2019t hire productive workers because of their race tend to struggle. For example, back in 2004, researchers in New York submitted job applications with similar resumes but different races and measured which firms showed the greatest racial disparities in callbacks. Of the businesses that discriminated the most, 36% failed by 2010. Of the businesses that discriminated the least, 17% failed by 2010[1]. Markets make racism expensive! Mind you, I\u2019m not saying that capitalism eliminates racism, because it clearly doesn\u2019t. Free-markets do, however, often work to alleviate the effects of racism.
