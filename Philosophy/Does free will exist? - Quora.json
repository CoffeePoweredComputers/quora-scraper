            "answer_text": "eh kind of wordy but here ya go Do humans have free will? Few questions cut to the core of human experience quicker then this one. It's easy to see why. With free will we are in control of our lives and morally responsible for our actions, without free will we are reduced to mere robots following out the programming given to us. The implications of free will are staggering and yet the human race has failed to reach a consensus on a question that is absolutely essential to our existence. Do we have free will? Our everyday experience tells us yes, but the logic of science tells us no. And so we reach a stalemate. Determinists, Compatibilists, Libertarianists, and many other \"ists\" argue amongst themselves throwing out concepts and getting entrenched in their viewpoints with no progress ever being made. Debated for thousands of years, no one ever thought to question to the question. Humans don't have free will. Free Will has us. Before you let this ridiculous and absurd sounding statement fool you, lets first take a look at what exactly Free Will is and isn't. The commonly held definition of Free Will is \"the ability to freely choose between different possible courses of action.\" This definition seems to be appropriate and in line with our everyday experience at first glance. If we can choose between different courses of action (and it feels like we can) than we have free will, if we can't choose between different courses of action then we don't. Seems straightforward right? Either we have free will or we don't. Our everyday experience supports it (Libertarians, Compatiblilists), and the physical laws of the universe refutes it (Determinism). This is where 99% of the people get tripped up and stop. They take a side, either yes or no, and they make their stand, not moving an inch. That is unfortunate for them however, because our journey to the truth of Free Will is just beginning. \"The ability to freely choose between different courses of action\". Regardless of if you believe in this definition of free will or not, this is a good place to start our inquiry. You will see soon that this definition crumbles under scrutiny and will soon be irrelevant. So withhold your concerns for a moment and keep an open mind, we are headed to the uncharted waters of discovery. \"The ability to freely choose between different courses of action\". Lets start by analyzing the assumptions and implications of this statement. \"The ability to freely choose\" implies a lack of necessity and restriction on the choices we make. For example, lets say I'm deciding between an apple and a banana for a snack and I choose to eat an apple. Eating an apple vs eating an banana are two possible courses of action that I freely chose between even though I ultimately chose to eat an apple. However here a question arises: WHY did I eat an apple? I could've ate a banana, but I chose to eat to an apple. Why? Why do we make the choices we make? This is a very powerful question that can destroy a lot of the false assumptions that exist around free will. Why do we make the choices we make? There must be a reason....right? Lets examine the possible answers to the \"Why\" question and see what it means for free will: Why did I choose to eat an apple instead of a banana? I chose to eat an apple because it was more desirableI chose to eat an apple for no reasonThose are the only two options. That's it. And when you look at it, option 1 is the only acceptable justification for free will. Think about it. If I ate an apple for no reason at all, how is that choice of my own Free Will? If you don't even know the reason for your actions, then you are acting randomly, at the whims of fate. In order to have a free choice, you must have a reason for making that choice. Indeed, reasons must form the basis for choices because the very act of choosing requires comparison and evaluation of the reasons for choosing the different options. If there is no reason for choosing, there can be no meaningful choice. So there must be a reason for our choices, otherwise we would not be making any choices at all. What is the reason for our choices? The choice that we will choose will always be the most desirable choice at the time according to the given information. Period. Even if the choice seems to be undesirable, (self-starvation or torture) it is always the most desirable choice at the time it was chosen. If this is not self evident to you please contemplate why you make the choices you do further, but we must move on to our next big question: \"Do we choose our desires?\" \"Do we choose our desires?\" If you accept the premises that no choice can be made without a reason, and the reason we base our choices on is desirability, the next question that logically follows is \"do we choose our desires?\". This is a very important question. If we choose our desires then we can have Free Will, as the the value ranking system (desirability) governing our choices would be under our control. If we can not choose our desires, then human Free Will is impossible, as we would be totally controlled by our desires, not unlike a puppet on a string. This is an unpleasant notion to be sure, so lets start our inquiry by assuming that we can choose our desires. If we can choose our desires, then we need a reason for choosing our desires. Without a reason for choosing, no meaningful choice can be made. Yet here we run into a paradox: how can we choose our desires when our desires are the very mechanism we use for making choices in the first place?! It is impossible, we can't: in order to make a choice we need desires, so it is impossible for us to have chosen all of our desires. We were born initially with desires that we didn't choose, and these desires determined the choices that will determine the course of our entire lives. Regardless of whether we are free to fulfill our desires or not, the critical point is this: we are not in control of the desires we have. \"If we are not in control of our desires, what is?\" This is the next critical question. If we do not choose our desires, where do they come from? There are only 2 possible factors that can determine our desires: genetics + environment. The environment that you were born into, along with the genes that you were born with determine your desires, decisions, and the course of your entire life. And you have no control over either. If you disagree, think about this question: \"Did you choose the environment and genes that you were born with? No, obviously you did not. This truth is undeniable. Environment and genetics forms the totality of human decision making and it is out of the scope of our control. Lets examine and see how environment and genetics functions: Environment (Input) v Genetics (Program) v Decision (Output) Much like a computer program, human beings are totally controlled by their programming. The genetics you are born with is your initial program and the environment is the input that that is ran through the program to create an output, or decision. The human persona which takes credit for decisions can be compared to a figurehead president who is completely at the mercy of his government even though it outwardly seems like he is in control. While you may still think that \"you\" chose to wake up this morning, the fact is that it was your genetics and environment that led you to make that decision. And you can not have chose your genetics because it is your very genetics that chooses! No matter how you look at it, the conclusion is inescapable. Lets recap the ground we've covered so far so we are on the same page moving forward. If you disagree with any of the premises, do not move on until you are satisfied. MeanFree Will is the ability to freely choose between different courses of actionThere must be a reason (value ranking system) for a choice to be meaningful.The choice that is chosen is always the most desirable (highest value)Humans can not choose the desires (value ranking system) that determine their choicesSince humans do not choose the program (value ranking system) that determines their choices, they do not have free will.Conclusion: Humans do not have free will. A compatibilist would argue that humans have free will as long as they are free to fulfill their desires, but considering the fact that all of our desires are given to us by factors completely out of our control (genetics and environment), this argument seems to be a cop out of the finest order. Is a puppet free if he loves his strings? In my opinion no he is not, but its up to you to decide for yourself. Freedom, it seems, has everything to do with a lack of necessity and constraint, and all independent decision-making entities (programs, humans) require necessity and constraint in the form of a value ranking system in order to make meaningful choices. If an independent decision-making entity was completely free, it would have no framework with which to make any choices at all, no way of comparing and evaluating different options, and no way to even comprehend its own existence. Freedom is an ideal that is impossible to live up to, yet humans have always had the strange conviction that freedom is ours, despite countless evidence to the contrary. Is this conviction wrong? Is determinism right after all? What determines the program (genetics) and input (environment) that determines all of our choices? Tune in next time to find out! Its not like you have a choice ;) *hint who has free will? ;) ",

            "answer_text": "It is possible, but hard to see how. When I say that it's \"hard to see how,\" that's not the same as to say that it's implausible. It is very possible, but first we would need to take out a powerful and very persistent philosophical argument: If the universe is deterministic, then we obviously don't have free will, because we can't have chosen otherwise.If the universe is not deterministic, then it is random. If our decisions are random, they're not freely willed.Determinism and randomness exhaust the possibilities.Therefore, we cannot possibly have free will.This is a powerful argument, and many knowledgeable and credible people do accept it or at least consider it a threat. It seems to indicate that self-determination would require an infinite regress of self-determined actions, each of which is caused by the one prior; this possibility seems ridiculous to many people, and seems to make free will incoherent whether they believe in a \"soul\" or not. So where's the (potential) problem with the argument? Depends on your position. There are those who dispute the first premise. They're called \"compatibilists\", and they believe that determinism and free will are perfectly compatible. They would say that it's not really important that your decisions are determined; they're still yours. You choose them, based on the unique confluence of factors that make up who you are. \"You could have done otherwise than you have done,\" most compatibilists say, \"if you had wanted otherwise.\" This is a popular position, and until recently it was the mainstream position among analytic philosophers. But there are good reasons not to believe in determinism. Certain interpretations (including the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation) of quantum mechanics are indeterministic, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Massimo Pigliucci wrote a guide about skepticism regarding determinism: http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/12/handy-dandy-guide-for-skeptic-of.html (also worth reading on the topic: http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2012/01/jerry-coyne-on-free-will.html) Some have even argued that taking physics seriously would reduce the importance of concepts such as causation which are often invoked to show the purported incredibility of free will. But half of the battle in arguing about a complex question, like that of free will, is coming to a fruitful definition of the concept at hand. I don't think there's any reason to rule compatibilistic definitions out before giving them a fair shot. In some ways, they may capture more of what is important about our \"common-sense\" concepts of free will than libertarian definitions, and they may bear more relevance to ethics and the law. Compatibilists would likely look to psychology to determine if a decision is free. Was it make under duress or temptation? Was the person's will weak? How does he or she justify or excuse his or her actions? These are crucial questions for anyone interested in the links between human action and moral responsibility. There are those who dispute the second premise. They believe that if a decision is created from a confluence of indeterministic and deterministic factors, it is possible for it to be a rational choice of the agent in such a way that the agent could have done otherwise. One question that needs to be addressed is if quantum mechanics is necessary to understand decisions. There are many ways this has been proposed to occur - some ridiculous, some less so. There are dozens of decision models that show different ways that this kind of free will could work. Proponents of these models say that they make it possible to make an undetermined decision that's still a \"me\" decision. But some people say that these models still don't really guarantee us real free will. One could argue, for example, that if we could build a probability distribution of our decisions, then we don't really have free will; instead, decisions are just a matter of random \"luck\". I'm among those who believes that such actions would not be free in a libertarian sense. There are those who dispute the third premise. Do randomness and determinism really exhaust the possibilities? It certainly seems like a terrible lack of imagination to assume so. A third way between determinism and randomness could, for example, result from strongly emergent properties. Such accounts are popular among what are called \"agent-causal\" libertarians. Dispositional accounts of causation are increasingly popular in philosophy of science, and there are powerful arguments, raised by people like (current foremost proponents of dispositionalism) Stephen Mumford and Rani Lill Anjum, that dispositionalists ought to be libertarians about free will. It has been noted (for example, by L. Buchak in \"Free Acts and Chance\") that the obvious failure in the argument at the top of this answer is that strictly speaking, determinism and randomness are not the only options. We can easily imagine the possibility that, if one were to roll back time and setting it going again, our choices of options would not converge to a particular probability distribution. This wouldn't guarantee free will, but it would be a first step. The notion of self-generation, often held to be key to libertarian free will, is sometimes argued to be incoherent. But I think there is good reason to believe these arguments often contain flawed assumptions. There are probably other avenues one can take, but I lack the creativity to think of them. (For the record, John Conway and Simon Kochen seem to believe that non-deterministic, non-random events are necessary based on their Free Will Theorem in quantum mechanics, but there are deterministic ways around their argument. This is frequently brought up in discussions on free will, but despite the name it is hardly a coup for free will proponents.) Crucially, for someone to act freely does not mean that their every action must be free. If someone, frightened by a loud noise, instinctively drops a delicate tray, we may be less inclined to assign responsibility for its shattering because the action was unconscious. But if that person, through a series of free actions, had built his or her mental capabilities so as not to be frightened, he or she may not have dropped the tray. This is a silly example, but its lesson can be carried to more complex ones. And there are those who dispute the means of argument itself. On a more fundamental level, one could argue that scientific theories are only empirically adequate models about reality, and don't convey metaphysical truths. Others might argue that science takes causality as being axiomatic; they say that, for example, even if there were free decisions, scientists would try to explain them deterministically. Philosophers like Colin McGinn and Thomas Nagel believe free will exists, but we may never discover how it works. These people may say that there is still plenty of room for free will. It has been argued rather extensively that the entire problem is just a language game with no resolution. But these arguments don't really give us much to work with. It's more interesting to argue under the assumption that the theories accepted by scientists are true; otherwise, there's not much to say about the question at all. But we must keep in mind that what we know about physics is like a drop in the ocean. More than 100 years ago, few trained physicists would have taken seriously the possibility of indeterminism at all. There's also the concern that neuroscientific experiments, like those performed by Daniel Wegner and Benjamin Libet, have \"disproven\" free will. This conclusion is entirely beyond the rather meager evidence for it, and the methodologies and interpretations of such experiments have been heavily criticized. As they say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence - and considering the weight on introspection on the side of free will (at least in its compatibilistic form), claiming it doesn't exist is rather extraordinary. In short, we don't really know whether free will does or does not exist. It's premature to go either way. I agree with Scott Aaronson when he says: \"But when it comes to the more ethereal questions \u2014 the nature of consciousness and free will, [...] etc. \u2014 I don\u2019t have any beliefs whatsoever. I\u2019m not even unsure about these questions, in the same Bayesian sense that I\u2019m unsure about next week\u2019s Dow Jones average (or for that matter, this week\u2019s Dow Jones average). All I have regarding the metaphysical questions is a long list of arguments and counterarguments \u2014 together with a vague hope that someone, someday, will manage to clarify what the questions even mean.\" To borrow from Pigliucci again - doubting free will really just serves the same purpose as doubting the existence of the external world. It's useful in that it's humbling, but in the end, there's no reason to do so, and we will (and should) keep assuming free will and assigning moral responsibility anyway. We don't even know what consciousness is. How can we know whether we have free will? ",

We are, for want of a better description, engines that make decisions. So it's not surprising we take responsibility for those decisions. This ownership over our own actions creates the illusion of free will. And very satisfying it is too. But all our choices, deeds and actions are the result of some prior causes: Memories, genetic-predispositions, character defects, accidents, lusts, goals - momentary neurochemical flickerings or just random quantum interactions.  In other words, just atoms doing physics.  No will. No freedom. And all those causes, they too had had prior causes.  If we were an omniscient observer staring into a person, we could watch every one of these golden strands of causality and trace them back in time to before the birth of the person. Alas, we have no such powers. The mind/brain is a black box to us. It's workings obscured. And so we have to satisfy ourselves that the origin of an action was somewhere within that grey meat-computer.  And having done that, we can assign blame.  But pity the poor omniscient observer. He can see the cause of everything, and so is obliged to see every action as blameless and inevitable. EDIT. It's probably worthwhile explaining why free will is impossible.  A lot of people assume this is an argument based on determinism, or brain function or something else. It's simpler than that. In this universe, and pretty much every universe we can imagine, there are only two possible types of event. Class 1) Caused events  - things that happen because earlier things happened.Class 2) Uncaused events - thing that happened without any prior cause. For this argument we can consider thoughts and decisions to be events like anything else.  Including the choice of Cheese or Tuna sandwich.   A class 1 decision is the product of what happened before. A logical process, an accumulation of preferences, a reaction to some event.   There is no freedom in such a decision. It's outcome was forced by what went before. (that's what class 1 is) - Using health conscious input factors we logically chose tuna.  That's a rational and willed decision. But it's not free.  A class 2 decision is unlinked to prior circumstances. As such it must be spontaneous. It must materialise without context or reason.  Quantum phenomena are a good example of this. But we could imagine some mental die-roll which allows us to pick at random and get cheese.  Again there is no possibility of freedom here. Because we can't control or influence such events. Class 2 events must be random. Because it was random, it was not willed. There are no other classes of event. Not in this universe. Not in any universe we can imagine. ",

Im always interested to hear someone explain why they feel we do not have free will. Perhaps someone could start by saying what would be required for free will tp exist. In discussing this in the past, a couple of people eventually admitted that actual free will would mean having absolutely zero prompting towards a decision.  This would involve no knowledge of consequences or memory of past decisions. For instance, if you go to a restaurant you have no freedom to choose.  If you order a salad, its not your decision.  You did so because you know it is healthier. If you have the t-bone, its because you know you like steak. Again, clearly, out of your control. In order to have free will, you would apparently have to have no knowledge of what food taste good or is good for you. Then you could actually have a say in choosing what to eat.Does anyone have an explanation of free will that does not go to these absurd levels what qualifies as 'free'? ",

            "answer_text": "Does free will exist? Answer: No! I think we can all agree that it feels like we have free will. But many of our feelings are actually illusions. I see a red apple on the table, I pick it up, I sniff it, and then I drop it on the floor. But there is nothing inherently red in the skin of the apple: it is merely reflecting light of a particular wavelength. My brain detects this and converts it into my perception of red. But if my perception of red had been swapped at birth with my perception of, say, blue, I would never have known the difference. Similarly, I did not touch the apple, I only detected its electrical charge. The apple neither possesses an inherent odor nor makes an inherent noise as it strikes the ground. These are all constructs of my brain, designed by evolution over millions of years to let me know that something is there, but I might never know the absolute true nature of what it is. My point is that when something feels real, it might well not be real. Thus, the fact that free will feels real cannot be relied upon as proof that it is real. We must look deeper. If you search a bit on the Internet, you can find evidence of one or more studies that reveal that \"our decisions are made seconds before we become aware of them.\" So, it would appear that at least much of the time, it's the subconscious mind that makes our decisions for us. This does not bode well for advocates of free will, for surely we would make decisions wholly with our conscious mind. It's interesting that our subconscious mind informs the conscious mind of a decision in such a way so that the conscious mind incorrectly assumes that it made the decision \u2014 all on its own. Brain-scan studies say otherwise. It's often said that \"everything happens for a reason.\" Although most of the folks that say this have something else in mind altogether, the true reason is actually \"cause and effect\". Nothing happens on its own. Of course, what I'm talking about is determinism. But, given that determinism is true, free will can be no more that one of many illusion. As taken from the Internet, determinism is \"the doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will. Some philosophers have taken determinism to imply that individual human beings have no free will and cannot be held morally responsible for their actions.\" Logically, it should be enough to simply state that nothing could possibly happen without at least one cause. This should be self-evident. I find it interesting that our intuition tells us that this must be true although many often invoke a god as the cause and yet most adhere to the free will philosophy. Again, this is a key element of religion. Of course, we all know that many religious individuals use the statement, \"nothing just happens\", to attempt to convince others that the universe itself must have had an architect; ergo, it must have been a god. But they fail to grasp that this must also apply to any god: who was/is god's architect? They also miss the fact that even if this did prove that a god created the universe then it would in no way prove that it's the god that they follow nor that the god took an active interest in his/her/its handiwork following the event. But still, the fact that science can not explain the cause of the birth of our universe is persuasive to a great number of unscientifically minded individuals. It also makes having free will easier to believe, for if the universe had no cause why not other things? To a scientist, the response to the question of how the universe began can often be satisfactorily answered by simply stating \"we don't know yet, and we may never know.\" But of course, this is not going to satisfy very many laymen. To compound the problem, some scientists claim that the universe began with nothing. But they also say that it began as a singularity which is something. So where did the singularity come from? I don't know. Personally, I do not believe that the universe sprang from absolutely nothing. There must have been some energy in some form. Somehow, this energy gave rise to the singularity from which the universe erupted. Scientists often refer to this as a quantum fluctuation, but to us non-cosmologists it's difficult to understand. I also subscribe to the theory that the total energy in the universe is zero. How could it not be?, Or at least, very near zero, since the birth of the universe must have been seeded with a bit of energy. So, for me, I just accept the fact that something must have always existed but I will likely never understand exactly how the universe actually began. This, of course, means that the universe itself had a cause. But this opens up a whole new can of worms: Is the multi-verse \u2014assuming there is one, and I think there is\u2014 deterministic as well? I should think that it would have to be. That's not going to sit well with very many folks at all. Oh, well! ",

            "answer_text": "I started getting doubts about free will after my wife died from an astrocytoma brain tumour. I took up reading about neuroscience. I read a book by Professor Eric Kandel. Memory, From Mind to Molecules. Second Edition, Larry R. Squire and Eric R. Kandel. Roberts & Company, 2009. A Nobel prize winner. I got information from some huge encyclopedic books. Bibliography later. What he wrote made sense to me. He showed that memory takes place in the synapses around neurons, by a process of training. Your brain contains a huge assembly of these interconnected neurons. By training is meant that if a path through the neurons is traversed frequently it becomes more easily traversed again. On the other hand if a pathway through the neurons is infrequently traversed the strength of the pathway is weakened. A neuron will emit an action potential when sufficient interactions from other neurons takes place in its synapses. The action potential is a pulse of electrical activity that propagates the length of the axon of the neuron and affects the synapses of the neurons that it is connected to. Hence the activity in the biological brain is a huge process of interactions of the action potential pulses around pathways in the brain. It follows that what you experience as a thought is actually the activity along pathways through the neurons in your brain that these interactions take place along. Of course I am skipping some of the more intricate details for the sake of describing the main points without undue waste of time. Read Eric Kandel for the details down to molecular level. The essential ingredients of intelligence are memory and a decision process. Without memory you wouldn't know what is going on and the decision process enables you to make a response to what ever is going on. The neuron has a memory in the synapses and a decision process due to the threshold effect that occurs when an action potential is generated. Hence, the mechanism of the neuron is the mechanism that gives your brain and hence you, intelligence, as well as the ability to think. Your brain is a biological pulse logic system compared with our computers that are silicon based Boolean logic systems. Can you see what is going on here? Your memory and hence your intelligence is produced entirely through the training that takes place during your life. There is no little voice in your head working things out for you, the whole process has been done by training in the neurons of your brain during the course of your life. Consider a newborn baby. The baby is born with instincts to cry if wet, hungry or left alone. The baby has no ability to make a decision, it moves its arms and legs in a somewhat random manner until it eventually finds out through a process of trial and error how to move its arms and legs in a useful manner. As the baby gets older and is sufficiently trained it can of course make decisions but the decisions are entirely based on the training that the baby has received. We as adults have gone to Uni or training school to expand our ability and increase our training to control our environment and participate in it. Unfortunately there is no doubt that we are androids, biological robots with feelings. There is no free will. Consider your digestive system. It has its own neuron based brain that controls the digestive process. Then there are the endocrine glands that do their control through chemicals that they monitor and regulate in the blood stream. For example the sugar level in your blood is controlled to enable your brain to function properly. If you eat too much sugar the process stops working because the gland that controls it only has a limited range of control. Our entire guts are automated by separate parts of neuron based brain or special glands. All you do is get on with your life, whilst your body runs on automation. Having been an octogenarian for some years I can report to you that sex is controlled by a chemical in your blood stream. Up to puberty, about ten years old, I had no interest in sex. After the testosterone was unleashed into the blood stream at puberty, sex became active. Now at my age in my eighties the testosterone has diminished considerably and sex is no longer active. That is, I have a low libido. This is called an andropause, whilst the ladies have a menopause when they run out of eggs. It is all about, well a bit about, sex until you hit the andropause, after which it is all about staying alive without undue discomfort. Biologically, you are no longer useful. Consider the male lion. The lionesses catch the prey, whist he can keep them safe and mate with them, after which they leave him on his own in the Savannah to die of hunger so that they can look for a younger male. No free will applies to all creatures from ants to zebras. Instead you as human can write a book. There is more essential detail to this that I haven\u2019t told you about here but that you can read about in my book. Look out for the revised version of my book: A Theory of Nothing. How is the finite reality created from the infinite? By D. N. Warren-Smith, MSc. Archway Publishers. Should be available in December, 2018. There is a lot more to life that you probably haven\u2019t realised! The corollary for young people is: start learning as quickly as possible, even before you go to school or preschool and perhaps develop a skill. This will give you a much better chance to compete and subsist in this competitive world of biological robots with feelings. ",

            "answer_text": "Partially, but it depends on how you define \u201cfree will\u201d. It is possible to define free will such that it becomes logically impossible, and it is also possible to define it so that it is obviously real. It turns out, therefore, that answering the question is quite trivial, but defining the term is where the real battle occurs in this argument. As such, I offer a deep dive into the definition, to determine which definition is most intended and sound. Free-will opponents like to define \u201cfree will\u201d as the ability to act differently if we were to wind back the clock. They claim this definition is not a straw man because it is uncontroversial, yet I do not see any proponent of free will assert such a definition and no proponent of free will that asserts this definition is provided. They go on to claim that according to this definition, there must be no free will because your action was determined by unseen forces acting prior to conscious awareness, desires and motives, beliefs and presuppositions, that exist outside of consciousness that are in the driver\u2019s seat and that consciousness is merely an observer of the process but not a participant. There are several hidden assumptions behind this meaning, however, that make it invalid and not useful: It implies all or nothing. That is, it implies you must either have total control or none at all, it does not leave room for free will acting only on a case by case basis or acting partially. The proof that is offered implies this bifurcation, an experiment run under very simplistic conditions shows autonomic functions preempting conscious decisions, and it is inexplicably assumed that these results may be extrapolated to define how decisions are made in much more complex circumstances. As such, it sets an artificially low bar for successful assertion, all that one needs to do in order to argue no free will is to demonstrate that desire is in some manner influencing all action, a rather trivial observation. We all know of many cases where our response is all but autonomic, such as when we jump at a fright, etc. It is not the simplistic, routine, highly conditioned cases where we would expect to find free will acting, but rather the most complex cases where extreme deliberation of far reaching consequences is required. To establish that free will exists, one is not required to establish that it always exists, establishing its presence only in some cases is sufficient to prove it not non-existent. One way of stating this case that illustrates the point is to say, we may have freedom to act in accordance with our desires, but if you say you can have whatever color car you want so long as it is green, effectively saying we have freedom but extremely limited choices, therefore you have no freedom at all. This argument would be like saying you can go in any direction, so long as it is in three dimensional space, in other words, since we are limited to desiring what we desire, but since desiring what we desire is the only kind of desire, it is not a real limitation. It is saying, you can do what you want, so long as it is what you want. As I said, not a real limitation.It implies randomness is the only true hallmark of free will. All preferences are reasoned by some desire, without desire there would be no reason for a preference of direction therefore any direction taken without desire would be by definition random. As proof of this, it was a significant discovery when quantum mechanics showed that there are elements of matter, on the quantum level, whose behavior is indeterminate, or random. This was taken as highly influential to the philosophy of determinism, the antithesis of libertarian free will. The problem with randomness being the only true hallmark of free will is that randomness has no value to us, and value underpins the entire argument, that is, we only argue about free will because we consider free will to be of some value. If we arbitrarily define free will to be \u201cacting randomly\u201d then this form of free will would cease to become valuable to anybody. The fact that the form of free will advocated by proponents is considered valuable, forces the definition of \u201cfree will\u201d to be something other than \u201cacting randomly.\u201d Even if you could establish that \u201cacting randomly\u201d is the correct definition of free will, and then you established most convincingly that human are not capable of acting randomly, what have you really accomplished? You have established that humans are not capable of something they never asked for or wanted in the first place. This discovery would hold about the same significance as the discovery that humans are not capable of destroying the universe. Since we assume the argument over free will does not lack significance, we should not then define the term in such a way that the inevitable conclusion of the argument is a complete extraction of all significance. This type of straw man fallacy could be compared to children suddenly claiming to not care about winning or losing when they lose in sports, something I have personally seen my children do. Rather than owning up to the loss, they prefer to re-define the loss so that it lacks significance.It does not allow for changes in stimulus, training, reflection, or consideration to occur when the clock is wound back. Why not wind the clock back to 10 years before the event, subjecting me to possibly different experiences over the 10 year period and leading to a different outcome? What is conscious control, if not a change in outcome based on a change in conscious evaluation, when new information is revealed, new insights discovered, etc. If I want a reliable car, I choose based on information available at the time, when new information becomes available, if I still have not made the commitment, I have the power to revise my decision based on the new information. In other words, I am not locked into a decision, but the decision can be altered when new information is made available. Is that not conscious control, when we can freely change our mind when new information is considered?It is not a definition that is asserted by proponents of free will, therefore it is a straw man. If you want to arbitrarily define \u201cfree will\u201d in such a manner that it is trivial to take it down, this does not accomplish anything of value and does not make forward progress in the world of philosophy.I will admit, proponents of free will have done a poor job of articulating a definition of this term, leaving the term wide open to opponent definition co-opting. I am a proponent of free will, and while I am no authority on the term, I have thought long and hard about the term and where it is of value to society, therefore I offer the following definition that I would be happy to defend: \u201cThe ability, in important cases, to consciously choose one's path to a desired outcome in a manner that considers factors whose awareness is only made possible by human intelligence, consciousness, sentience, and belief in principles.\u201d This definition recognizes the strong role of desire to determine the end result that is envisioned, but leaves, in important cases, the path to that end result up to consciousness. Certainly decisions that require a refined and highly sophisticated understanding of the world would require conscious deliberation, but I propose that when the end result for many paths is the same, we have evolved to leave those particular decisions up to the consciousness. This is not to say that there are no sub-conscious factors influencing the decision, such as strongly held biases, memories of trauma or pain, but these factors act as team members of a consensus, and the arbiter of those voices is the consciousness. This definition stills allows one to justifiably hold a criminal responsible for their crimes. In the case of most crimes, there are many complicated factors that must be considered in order to perpetrate the crime, and the fact that the good will for society was not considered valuable enough to be influential in the decision to commit a crime, is what is offensive to society. In the case of a criminal, the harmony and good will of society was either actively ignored, or considered but rejected as of no worth. In either case, you have a free agent that is by example making the argument that society is of little value, and is not worthy of protection and care. This definition also allows for desire to be in full control of the goal, while giving up control to the consciousness only to the method of accomplishing the goal. It retains the \u201cwhy\u201d while only giving up the \u201chow.\u201d It allows for autonomic responses while making room for consciousness to play a roll in sophisticated decision making. And it accommodates morals, because while no one could be faulted for wanting what they want, they can be faulted for their chosen path, which must be carefully attenuated to not only reach the goal of desire, but also to fall within a plethora of other constraints and complicated, strategic and moral objectives. Finally, this definition retains value in the form of free will it describes. While we may not have control of our root desires, it is valuable that we have control of the path we choose to accomplish those desires. We can choose the path of greater good, over a shortest path characterized by selfishness and harm. We can choose to create a world where we all achieve our desires together in harmony, rather than a world where we must kill and destroy in order to survive. Finally, we can take credit when we choose good over evil, when we choose hard work and accomplishment over laziness and ineptitude, when we choose kindness and gentleness as oppose to hatred and violence. There is certainly, however, merit in the observation that we often attribute far too much responsibility to people\u2019s behavior than is justified. We are products of a vast indoctrination program, from our genetics to our upbringing, the vast majority of which is not controlled by us. We are trained and condition from birth with certain values, and when some of those values are missing and this absence causes anti-social behavior, we are right to pin some of the blame on bad parenting, or even a long multi-generational history of bad parenting. But this does not require that we can not play a role in our own conditioning. There are countless examples of those that survived traumatic circumstances growing up but went on to choose a different path. At a certain age, we achieve the ability to affect our own conditioning, we become aware that exposure to inputs can have a positive or negative effect on this conditioning, and we can make strategic decisions to increase exposure to good inputs and limit exposure to negative ones. This is self-training, self conditioning, and results in behaviors that can appear to be autonomic, but whose origin are the conscious mind. While there is merit to giving more fair consideration of the panoply of conditioning influences over a lifetime, most of which are not our responsibility, and the unfairness of ignoring these influences is undoubtedly at the root of the no-free-will intent, it would nonetheless be incorrect to infer from these observations that the consciousness plays no role, that we are helpless in effecting the outcome of our lives. Not only would there be real consequences to people\u2019s decision making if they were to accept this proposition, real harm they would experience in missed opportunity and other harms to society including crime, it is simply speaking not true, there are powers that we have at our conscious disposal, tools if you will, that can affect the outcome of our lives and it is certainly our responsibility as responsible members of society to make full use of those tools.

            "answer_text": "I'm unsure (unlike almost every other respondent :).  Some say that we cannot possibly have a free will, since we are comprised of sub-parts that are themselves subject to physical law. The 'illusion' of free will is an evolutionary advantage, helping to promote a sense of self (and self care and self responsibility). They don't explain how it is logically necessary that the answer is 'no'. I do have some sympathy for their point of view, however. At the atomic level there does appear to be some form of semi-causal action that aligns with our intuition about self - something that clearly obeys laws of action while at the same time is random. As others (was it Daniel Dennett?) commented back in the 90s, if we really weren't controlled to some extent, then our actions would be completely random and could not express any kind of personality.  Our personality is essentially all that is fixed about our behavior and thought patterns. That we have a personality at all seems to indicate that there is some degree of fixity of our mental states. But the question is whether our personality is completely fixed, or only partially? If we take the machine analogy again, its easy to see how we could have some responses that are deeply entrenched and hard to overturn. Other mental states may totter between two equally probable configurations (two equally stable states?). Perhaps thermal noise in the brain (random or coincidental firing of neurons, or that probabilistic/quantum action of atoms themselves) is enough to tip the balance between those states. That might reflect the 'catastrophic' (in the catastrophe theory sense of the word) behavior experienced in the gestalt formation of a thought or impression. I think if it were easy for us to penetrate to the truth of this matter, it would be too flimsy a veil over the mechanics of a deterministic mind, and would not promote any kind of evolutionary advantage. If there truly were some kind of not-caused-by-physical-processes aspect to our actions, that was also not-just-thermal-noise-in-a-chaotic-system, would it feel any different to us? I don't think it's a pointless question, though. I do wonder whether the nub of the question is actually a riddle - what could be purposeful and random at the same time while not being influenced by physical law? ",

            "answer_text": "For decades, philosophers and theologians have maintained that society as we know relies, almost universally, on universal free will confidence, and that it would be disgraceful to abandon this conviction. Of one, our codes of ethics suggest that we should select between right and wrong openly. This is regarded as \"absolute independence\" in the Christian culture, the desire, rather than being driven by appetites and longings, to decide, to aim with the positive. This connection between freedom and goodness was reaffirmed by the great Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant. He claimed that there would be no use if we had to take the path to justice because we were not able to select. Today, free will takes over every part of American politics, from healthcare to criminal justice. The notion that everyone should make a difference, regardless of their beginning of life, pervades the common society and underlines the American dream. Barack Obama wrote with The Audacity of Hope, that US \"values are grounded in a profound joy of life and a faith in democracy.\" In their argument to be clear by clockwork laws of cause and effect all human conduct, science has continuously increased. Such transformation in understanding is the culmination in an scientific renaissance that began about 150 years ago, when Charles Darwin published the first essay \"The Species' Origin.\" Shortly after his hypothesis of development, Darwin started his son, Sir Francis Galton, to point out the consequences: intellectual ability such as intellect would be been hereditary as it has evolved. Nevertheless, we utilize certain senses, and certain individuals have to take decisions to a larger degree than others. So we are not free to chose our fate, but rely on our biological inheritance. In the 20th century, Galton started a dialogue on ecology and diet. Are our behavior the product of our genetics? Or the product of what the world has imprinted on us? The importance of each element has accumulated amazing facts. Whether scientists favored one another or a combination of the two, they gradually concluded that it was necessary for our behavior. Studies into the inner workings of the brain helped in recent decades to settle the controversy over nature nourishment and gave another blow to the idea of free will. Brain scanners enable us to look through the skull of a live human to reveal intricate neuron networks which encourage scientists to generally conclude that both genes and the world form these networks. Although the science community still accepts that neurons are not just a handful or much of our feelings, dreams, experiences We recognize that differences in brain function will alter behaviour \u2014 else no alcohol or antipsychotics will be impacted. It also refers to the anatomy of the brain: instances of ordinary adults being murdered or pedophiles during the formation of a brain tumor demonstrate how reliant we are on the physical properties of our gray substances. Some researchers claim that Benjamin Libet, an American physiologist in the 1980s, showed our equality. Electrical movement was believed to evolve in the mind of a person until, for example, he or she lifts his or her hand; Libet demonstrates this development until he or she deliberately chooses to travel. The understanding of how we want to behave, which we generally mix with free will, appears to be an add-on, a post hoc reconstruction of what occurs through the brain. The discourse on ecology and nourishment in the 20th century primed us to see ourselves as forces that are outside our grasp. Yet it left some room for the prospect of us challenging our conditions or biology to become the writers of our own fate at least in the common imagination. Neurosciences are a more revolutionary challenge: they define the brain as a functional organ like any other, and say that we do not act in a specific way any more than we would beat our core. The present scientific picture of human action is a neuron that ignites other neurons, triggering our thoughts and actions in an unbroken chain that stretches back to and beyond our birth. We are thus completely predictable in theory. In Science, we could predict the answer to a certain booster with 100 percent precision if we could completely understand any person's brain architecture and chemistry. This work and its implications are not new. Nevertheless, what is new is the dissemination of distrust of free will through laboratories and the mainstream. For example, over the last decade, the number of court cases involving neuroscience facts has more than doubled \u2014 mostly in conjunction with the defendant arguing that their brains made him do so. In other contexts too, many people absorb this message, at least judging from the numbers of books and articles which explain \"your brain on' from music to magic. Determinism is gaining common currency to one degree or another. The skeptics are on the rise.This development raises awkward \u2014 and more and more non-theoretical \u2014 questions: Do we get moral irresponsibility if moral obligation depends on trusting in our own organization, then when belief in determinism spreads? What will happen to the many institutions that are founded on it, if we gradually regard trust in free will as an illusion?Two psychologists in 2002 had a simple but clever idea: they should conduct an experiment to discover, rather than hypothesized what could happen if people had lost confidence in their ability to choose. At the time, Kathleen Vohs from Utah University and Jonathan Schooler from Pittsburgh University asked one group to read a passage that argued that the free will was an illusion, and another group to read a passage on the subject, neutral. Then the leaders of every party were exposed to a range of temptations and their conduct was observed. Will discrepancies in abstract philosophical beliefs affect the decision of people?Oh, well, really. When the community is called on to take a mathematical exam that makes it easy to cheat, it has begun to see free will as illusionary responses that appear to look illegally. Unless they were to steal \u2014 to take more money than was due from a $1 coin envelope \u2014 those who had been further compromised by their confidence in freewill. Vohs told me about a series of measures that she and the school teacher \"aren more prone to behave immorally those who are led to know less of the free will.\"When you stop believing that you are free agents, you don't think you are responsible for your actions. They thus behave less accountably and succumb to their lower instincts. Vohs emphasized that the outcome is not limited to the artificial conditions of a laboratory experiment. \"With people who believe more or less in free will of course, you see the same effect,\" she said.  In another study, Vohs and colleagues for example, assessed the degree to which a group of working people believed in free will and then tested their work success by looking at the ratings of their supervisor. People who believe they manage their own acts more strongly turned up more often on time for work and were considered more competent by the supervisors. Free will has in fact proven better than prescribed methods, such as self-professional work ethics, to predict the job results.Roy Baumeister of Florida State University, another expert of free will psychology, has broadened these findings. For example, he and fellow students found that students who had a weaker faith in freedom were less willing than those who had a stronger trust in free will to give their time to support a classmate. Similarly, those who are influenced by assertions like \"Research has proven that free will is an illusion\" are less open to giving the money to a homeless individual or to leasing a mobile phone to someone.More Baumeister and colleagues research have associated a diminished confidence in free will with pain, frustration and a decreased dedication to connections. When participants were encouraged to think \"all people have a lower sense of existence implying, as it is, that all individual acts are the product of past occurrences and can be eventually interpreted by means of the flow of molecules. Another research released earlier this year indicates that a greater confidence in free will is associated with a lower academic output.The list goes on: it has been shown that the idea that free will is an illusion renders individuals less imaginative, more inclined to compromise, less motivated and less happy for one another. In all ways it appears like we follow our dark nature as we accept determinism.Few researchers are confident telling citizens should accept that they can lie outright. Advocating the propagation of falsehoods will betray their dignity and breach a belief long kept sacred by philosophers: the Platonic dream that the real and the wrong would go hand to side. Saul Smilansky, professor of philosophy at the University of Haifa in Israel, throughout the course of his life, has been grappling with this question and concluded painfully: \"The reality can't be tolerated in people's view\" regarding the free will. Smilansky is adamant that the free will of the conventional sense doesn't exist \u2014 and even if more citizens knew it will be really sad. \"Imagine,\" he said to me, \"that I am debating whether I have to do my job, for example, to spill into enemy territories or to do anything more earthly by disclosing any misdeed. I feel, however, that I should not be forced to choose the egotist path. That, he claims, is quite risky for humanity because \"the more we embrace the deterministic image the worst it can be.\" The idea that everybody understands the lack of free would, should mean that we can conclude, 'Everything they do, it is not a choice\u2014we cannot fault it.' Smilansky claims that determinism removes not only responsibility but also appreciation. Imagine I gamble my life by going on a bold trip into enemy territories. Then they would inform me I had no alternative, because, in Smilansky's word, my accomplishments were clearly 'the unfoldment of what has been given,' and so not commendable. Much as the removal of responsibility would minimize an deterrent to crime, it would destroy an opportunity to do well. He believes that our successes are less impressive, our characters would seem less inspirational, and we will quickly fall into decadence and disarray.Smilansky is in favour of a belief he terms illusionism \u2014 that democracy is actually an illusion that must be protected by society. In the ivory tower must be restricted both the theory of determinism and the evidence that justify it. Only the initiation would choose, as he put it, to 'see the grim reality in the heart,' beyond these doors. Smilansky claims it is real if something extreme, perhaps horrible, resides over it\u2014but, if there is a option between the wrong and the worse, then the real needs to go for the sake between humanity.Smilansky's claims can at first sound odd as he suggests that the universe is full of full will: since we don't even make a choice, who cares what knowledge is released? New learning, of course, is like any other sensory input; it can affect our behaviour even though we're not aware of it. A belief in democracy might not be an encouragement in the terminology of cause and effect, but it does inspire us.Illusionism is a minority position among academic philosophers, most of whom still hope that the good and the true can be reconciled. But it represents an ancient strand of thought among intellectual elites. Nietzsche called free will \u201ca theologians\u2019 artifice\u201d that permits us to \u201cjudge and punish.\u201d And many thinkers have believed, as Smilansky does, that institutions of judgment and punishment are necessary if we are to avoid a fall into barbarism.Smilansky does not support Orwellian thought management strategies. Luckily, he says, we require them not. Obviously, we have confidence in free will. Because of enthusiastically frustrating the expectations, scientists and analysts clearly ought to demonstrate a degree of autonomy. Smilansky assured me that most scientists \"do not know what the implications of such theories are.\" \"Promoting determinism is easy and risky.\"However, the social and psychological implications are not immune to these authors who speak against free will in general. Others actually may not accept that the breakdown of humanity may have such effects. Some of the most popular is the neuroscientist and writer Sam Harris, who began the idea of free decision in the 2012 novel * Free Will*. Like Smilansky, he does not accept that free will occurs. Yet without the entire premise, Harris feels we are better off.Harris said to me that \"we need our convictions to follow the facts. Illusions are still going to push us off, no matter how well-intentioned. For examples, we are now using the jail danger as a tactic to persuade individuals not to do anything. Yet if we then agree that \"inner action, given this fear of violence, stems from neurophysiology,\" he concluded, then we can grasp more what is actually behind harmful acts \u2013 and how to avoid them. \"We need,\" Harris told me, \"to consider what leverage we should draw as a organization in order to inspire people to be their best form.\"According to Harris, even the greatest offenders \u2013 for starters, murderer psychopaths \u2013 was unfortunate. \"It was not their dna that they selected. Their parents were not selected. You didn't create your mind, but your subconscious is the root of your thoughts and behavior. \"In a fundamental way, your sins are not your own. In order to rehabilitate the victims, to safeguard communities, and to eliminate potential offences, we should accept that sincerely. Harris thinks that \"anything like psychopathy can be curable over time,\" but only because we understand that the brain is the cause of dysfunction, not any aerial-free will.If we acknowledged that, we will be free of hate. This might sound like the keystone to a human existence to keep people accountable for their acts, but we pay a high price for it: blaming people makes us furious and revengeful. \"Compare the reaction to Hurricane Katrina,\" proposed Harris, with \"the reaction to the 9/11 terrorist attack.\" For many Americans, the individuals who captured those aircrafts are the personification of terrorists, who are free to do bad. Nevertheless, should we renounce our notion of the free will, their actions could be treated like any other normal phenomenon \u2014 and that, Harris argues, will make our reaction much more reasonable. Although the scale of these two events was identical, the responses varied significantly. Nobody decided to seek vengeance on tropical storms or wage a war on nature, but Katrina was free to merely direct its attention on the restoration and prevention of potential disasters. The reaction to 9/21, claims Harris, was compounded by anger and a thirst for vengeance, contributing to the senseless destruction of countless more lives. Harris doesn't suggest we shouldn't have replied to 9/11 at all.Perhaps a somewhat specific and probably less inefficient coolheaded answer should have appeared. \"Hatred is toxic,\" he said to me, \"and may destroy people's lives and culture in general. Losing trust in free choice destroys the excuse of loving someone forever. Whereas the research from Kathleen Vohs and her colleagues indicates that social problems that arise from having * our own * behavior as decided by factors beyond our control \u2014 weakening our values, motivation and meaning \u2014 Harris claims that social gains are extracted from the very same perception of * other people's * behaviour. The philosophical consequences of determinism seem from this point of view very different and much stronger. But for some counter arguments you should also check this video right here:  ",

            "answer_text": "Can moral responsibility be ultimately under control of free will? Control is possible if someone controls morally himself, but then, does the early self control a later self, leading to infinite regress in a finite life?An agent acts with moral responsibility only if he has control over the ultimate source of his action. There is no control by the agent over the ultimate source of agent\u2019s action if it is caused by natural laws and the past, but also if it has no cause of control. Nothing can be causally prior to itself. Therefore, moral responsibility and free will are impossible.Believers in a God are incoherent. They want to believe that every contingent state of affairs has an efficient cause because it is an way to comfortably believe in the necessity of a cause of the cosmos, God, but at the same time believers want to believe that there isn't an efficient cause on free will because it is an way to comfortably believe that the man's free will, and not a God, is the responsible for evil. Believers in a God believe in the necessity of causes when it is convenient.If it is better for God to have given free will to man than not to have given, why do schizophrenia and dementia rob so many men of genuine free will? Autistic individuals believe less in God than non autistic individuals, they are not prepared for God's love by divine decision. If the world is sufficiently unjust to allow the inference to a just God, are we justified in assuming that God\u2019s justice will be discovered in a supposed afterlife? Why is there eternal damnation? God actually didn't take risks in creating a free will man, because an omniscient God knows who he will send for the eternal damnation before the logical order of creation. If human parents recognized that it was near enough to certain that, were they to have a child, their child would be raped, tortured and murdered, then those human parents would choose not to have a child. How, then, could it be acceptable for God to choose to have lots of children in full knowledge that they will be raped, tortured and murdered? Who deny that God\u2019s knowledge extends to future free will actions will have the difficult task of accepting a doctrine of divine providence, if God does not know what free agents will do. Can an omnipotent God create an agent who is able to act without divine knowledge of what the free agent will do? If yes, there isn't omniscience, if no, there isn't omnipotence. If God is an omniscient sustainer of the world and its contents, God is conniving with evil because keeps the evil agent going throughout the duration of his evil planning and acts. We have laws for the imprisonment of people who inflict suffering upon animals.Why don't animals have free will, yet they suffer like us? If animals are incapable of undergoing a process of spiritual growth, animal suffering is just pointless.Why would God value the free will of the Nazis and slave owners above the freedom of tens of millions they oppressed? When it comes to a choice between the freedom of those who would be raping, torturing and murdering young children and the protection of young children, we unhesitatingly agree that evildoers may be legitimately deprived of their freedom, it just isn\u2019t worth that much. Would a just God allow millions of people to die atrocious deaths simply to promote the freedom of a few evildoers? We can think in a God\u2019s answer to a prayer from Auschwitz: \u201cNo, I will not free you, for otherwise your fate would not have been in Hitler's hands; and then Hitler's freedom to choose between good and evil would have been less significant.\u201d Evil actions of a few free beings diminish the freedom of millions of people and children who suffer the evil. The value of qualities developed through experience with evil is overcoming evil. If there was no evil, what is the value of God to allow evil in the first place?If God\u2019s lack of moral development does not take away his perfect goodness, then why would he place so much value on our learning to resist evil, rather than always being so? If there is free will in heaven, why is there no sin in heaven? If God foresee free will and perfect beings together before create perfect beings, our suffering is sadism. God allows through hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and diseases spread by animals, indiscriminate suffering regardless of individual free will. Why do some people suffer much more than others? Does that mean they're better people as result and then only they get to heaven? Do we need to pray for more of God's good blessings from horrendous suffering? Consider the deontological principle that one should always treat others as ends in themselves and never as mere means. If the most vulnerable people are forced to suffer for others to demonstrate moral excellence, then the most vulnerable people are used by God as a mere means to improve others. Sane people don't desire that others face horrendous torture and death so that the rest may have a chance to prove their heroism.Why would God choose to use suffering to promote spiritual growth, rather than a world in which the pursuit of deeper spiritual goods is possible without horrendous suffering? Couldn't the goal of providing opportunities for others to respond nobly be achieved by any means other than facing monstrous torture? Physical bravery and courage can be manifested in sports, for example, moral and intellectual courage can be manifested in scientific inquiry. Kindness and love can be manifested in a mother's care of her infant without the infant's having a disease. God could promote spiritual growth making a world in which we can choose whether or not to make the effort to develop spiritually, physically, and intellectually and to help others develop in these ways, but we cannot significantly harm ourselves or others. There's no reason why a God would need to use monstrous suffering as a causal means of spiritual growth. If what matters to him is free will for actions that differ greatly in moral value, would it not be better if men were created who did not have the power to do evil but had the freedom to do good or not, but not evil?The notion that a good God uses evils as a means to higher goods is incompatible with his omnipotence because he would not need use deplorable means to achieve his ends. Consider every sentient being that suffer excruciating pain throughout its entire existence. Why do the joys of heaven as compensation for child abuse justify God\u2019s permission of abuse on earth? No free will, reward or compensation can make it good or right. The existence of the most basic moral obligation to prevent terrible suffering by a child abuse coming from God\u2019s permission implies the non-existence of a God worth of worship.Is it true that because determinism, that of an agent could not avoid acting wrong, and therefore morality and criminal punishment are errors? From the skeptical of responsibility perspective, morality is not about backward-looking assessments of blameworthiness and praiseworthiness, rather, morality is forward-looking, functions by invoking recommendation. The denial of moral responsibility is consistent with the principles of moral rationalism. The imposition of sanctions could have purposes other than the punishment of perpetrators: it can also be justified by its role in incapacitating, rehabilitating, and deterring offenders. There are measures for preventing crime more generally, such as providing for adequate education and mental health care, which the moral responsibility skeptic can readily endorse. Juries routinely condemn defendants without empirical evidence that defendants' will is not determined by any antecedent conditions outside them. Even if a criminal is not morally responsible if there is no free will, it may be as legitimate to segregate or control him in defense of others as it is to quarantine or control those who are not responsible for their contagious diseases. We want to prevent the effects of misbehavior just as we want to prevent the effects of disease or hurricanes.If free will is the basis of moral responsibility, why can moral judgment have morally irrelevant reasons of which we are not even aware? Moral psychology experiments show that the moral thought is affected by environmental factors of which we are not even aware that are completely irrelevant to the moral issues. Examples among many: A- Emotion: viewing a humorous video clip can have a substantial impact on participant\u2019s moral intuitions. Hearing different kinds of audio, stand-up comedy or inspirational stories, has divergent effects on moral intuitions. B- The order in which the moral hypotheses are considered. C- Moral judgments can be affected by the smells in our environment: a whiff of fart spray; spraying the questionnaire with a disinfectant spray; people are more unconsciously generous outside a store from which the smell of freshly baked bread emanates, than outside a hardware store. D - Whether we're in a messy room, or in a dark room. E- Whether we've recently washed our hands, even the proximity of a hand sanitizer dispenser, the presence of dirty pizza boxes, have all been reported to influence moral intuitions. (See for example Sinnott-Armstrong, 2006, \u201cMoral Intuitionism Meets Empirical Psychology\u201d, in Terry Horgan editor, Metaethics After Moore; and \u201cMoral dilemmas and moral rules\u201d - S Nichols, R Mallon - Cognition, 2006) Supposed intuitive objective moral self-evident propositions cannot be proved or known by inference from premises. But in reality, moral intuitions provide justification only after inferences to check them. At least some of a priori or intuitive moral judgment are highly unreliable because various morally irrelevant factors and biases can affect moral judgments. Supposed \u201cobjective\u201d intuitive moral claims aren\u2019t self-evident because non-inferential justification of moral intuitions is unreliable.Would skepticism about moral responsibility undermine attitudes such as moral resentment, indignation, guilt, and gratitude, essential to good personal relationships? Is there a tendency of the moral skeptic to suppress evidence for moral skepticism when witnessing atrocities or when engaging in moral argument and political debate? The understanding of the lack of moral responsibility modifies the rationality of certain emotional reactions. While moral anger, resentment and indignation don\u2019t disappear if we feel that moral responsibility doesn\u2019t exist, there are alternative attitudes available to us, such as moral concern, disappointment, sorrow, and resolve. Instead of moral guilt feelings, an agent can acknowledge that he has acted immorally and he feels deep sorrow for what he has done, and as a result he is motivated to eradicate her disposition to behave in a bad way. One can be thankful to a young child for some kindness without supposing that he is praiseworthy in the basic desert sense. In certain situations, refraining from resentment or moral anger may be beyond our power and, therefore, even the skeptic of moral responsibility may not be able to adopt alternative attitudes. We might expect to be unable to appreciably reduce immediate emotional reactions of moral anger as an immediate reaction upon being deeply hurt in an intimate personal relationship. However, in a non-immediate rational reflection, moral anger can be diminished or even eliminated, and we can reject any force that is supposed to justify a damaging response to evil.If free will is the basis of moral responsibility, why does luck undermine evaluations of moral responsibility?We seem to blame those who have murdered more than we blame those who have merely attempted murder, even if the reason for the lack of success in the second case is that the intended victim unexpectedly tripped and fell to the floor.Imagine that two otherwise conscientious people have forgotten to have their brakes checked recently and experience brake failure, but only one of whom finds a child in the path of his car. Why does the unfortunate driver receive more moral blame and criminal punishment?Gauguin feels some responsibility towards his family and is reasonably happy living with them, but nonetheless abandons them, leaving them in dire straits. Gauguin chooses a life of painting in Tahiti over a life with his family, not knowing whether he will be a great painter. In one scenario, he goes on to become a great painter, and in another, he fails. Thus, how the success turns out, something which might be almost entirely a matter of resultant luck, seems to have a lot to do with the evaluation he'll get.We tend to think that people should be praised or blamed only on the basis of what they can control, and yet we regularly praise and blame people on the basis of the results of their actions, even if these are beyond the control of the agents.Luck undermines evaluations of moral responsibility. Our genes, care-givers, peers, and other environmental influences all contribute to making us who we are. We lack control over everything: the results of our actions, our circumstances, our constitution, and our causal history. Where can one draw a line of principle between worthy luck and condemnable luck?Does the free will of Compatibilism preserve moral responsibility?Compatibilism claims that we have free will and that we are morally responsible even though all events are causally determined. We can define free will in terms of control in the action necessary for moral responsibility. To the deterministic aspect of Compatibilism, the source of the traits and dispositions of the agent can be traced back to conditions of origin that were completely beyond his control, having them is subject to luck. To the free will aspect of Compatibilism, agents are responsible for their actions if they intentionally modify themselves to have a certain set of traits and dispositions. A compatibilist might say that as long as an agent takes responsibility for his dispositions and values, in time he will become morally responsible for them. But having the series of dispositions and values by which agents shape and modify their dispositions and values is subject to luck too. Thus, the actions by which agents take responsibility for their dispositions and values are explained by luck.",

            "answer_text": "We don't know. A lot of people believe in free will, but free will hasn't been proven yet It entirely depends on whether the Universe is deterministic or not. Newton's law more or less described a deterministic model of the universe. Every action has a reaction, and if all conditions remain the same, you always get the same result. For years, it was not known whether the whole Universe was deterministic. However, as scientists studied the Universe more and more, they found that Newton's laws (and it's derivatives) apply well to the Universe EXCEPT, at very small scales, and very large scales. Sub atomic particles don't follow Newton's laws, and whole galaxies don't follow Newton's laws. Does that mean Newton's laws are wrong? Well, they are right 99% of the time. For most practical reasons, Newton's laws apply, but at the fringes, Newton's laws don;t apply.  We do know is that subatomic particles have their own rules, and we are begginning to understand them using Quantum theory. Quantum theory posits that sub atomic particles work non-dterministically. You cannot say for sure that a sub atomic particle being at a particular point in space-time. You can only compute the probability of it being there. You cannot say for sure that a particle is headed in a particular direction. You can only compute the probability The funny thing is molecules follow Newton's laws, but sub atomic particles don't. So, molecules are made up of things that do not follow the rules that molecules follow. How is that possible? Sub atomic particles behave non-deterministically, but they make things that behave deterministically. How is that possible? We don't know Secondly, if we assume that our free will is the consequence of the way we think, and thinking is what the brain does, the question arises:- does the brain behave deterministically, or non-deterministically? If the brain is deterministic then you have no control over your thoughts. You might think you do, but you do not. Your brain is just wired to think those thoughts. Free will is an illusion. However, if the brain is non-deterministic:- maybe quantum fluctuations cause the brain to behave n0n-deterministically. In this case, the thoughts that your brain creates might be controlled by random quantum fluctuations. In this case, maybe there is free will, but it's a random occurence that you have no control over.  Or maybe what we consider random quantum fluctuations are not really random but controlled by some sort of supernatural power that we don;t understand? Maybe the random quantum fluctuations are our soul. Maybe it's God flipping things in our brains. Maybe, it's Karma controlling our lives. Now, when we talk about things like supernatural forces controlling quantum fluctuations, we are talking about hypothesis that cannot be proven So, if your question is \"Does 'free will' exist?\" The scientific answer is We don;t know ",

            "answer_text": "UPDATE: Now it seems to me that my answer was to a wrong question, and not directly relevant. My answer deals with Perception of freewill rather than the Existence of freewill itself. But Im just gonna leave it here for anyone interested. I cant say with absolute certainty, but Im gonna give you an analogy explaining why I dont think free will exists. First, how do we perceive if something has free will or not? Predictability. If we can 100% predict the behaviors of something, then it shouldn't have free will. If we cant at all predict the behaviors of something, and it's alive, there's a big chance it has free will. So, let's assume, some day a UFO lands on earth and some alien-made robots start coming out. They have living skins covering them (like the Terminator) and are programmed so complicatedly that we cannot predict their actions at all. Do they APPEAR to have free will? Sure. Do they actually have free will? Nah. For humans, this is only a theory I believe in, but it's a very probable theory, that thoughts are only particles moving and reacting to stimulation. Thoughts appear to be free will because they are very unpredictable because of their complexity; but we know they could be predictable due to two known facts: 1. Thoughts are not randomly created. However creative one can be, one cannot imagine a color he has never seen. (lol try it) This suggests that thoughts are the direct results of physical, material environment. 2. Applying an electric current to certain parts of the brain results in the same bodily reaction as if the brain ordered so. E.g. some scientists use electricity to stimulate the part of a dead frog's brain controlling its left hind leg, and found that while dead, the left hind leg moved just as if the brain would order it to. This suggests that thoughts are only a complex form of electric current So personally, I believe free will doesnt exist, and someday may be we can actually measure and predict the thoughts of humans. But until that day, we should act as if free will does exist, because we have no choice otherwise. (I mean, when your bladders are full, are you gonna exercise your presumed free will or wait for some external determining force to tell you to go empty them?) ",

            "answer_text": "I think it exists if you define it as I do, which is \"the decision making process, as seen from the perspective of the decision making entity itself\". There is nothing magical or supernatural about it, and there's no need for true non-determinism.   Imagine the computer in an autonomously controlled car.  The computer has to model the world around it, and use that model to predict such things as the behavior of other cars on the road (some of which may also be autonomous).  It includes itself in that model, of course.  But it doesn't try to predict its own behavior in the same way as it predicts the behavior of those other entities.  If it models its own decision making facility, it models it in a fundamentally different way than everything else in the model, since that is the one part that IT CONTROLS.  Trying to predict its own decisions would essentially put it in an infinite loop. Human brains do essentially the same thing.  When they think about their own thought process (and decision making ability), they are unable to describe it in the same way they describe other things.  It seems fundamentally \"unpredictable\", because it doesn't make sense to try to predict its own decisions.  So we get all confused about it and think its magic because it doesn't fit in our regular model of everything else. Ultimately, though, it is just a matter of perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "I look over alot of the answers here and it\u2019s surprising that nobody here has gave this topic more than 2 minutes of actual thought. Let\u2019s start by getting 1 thing clear. The ability to make a decision is not what makes Free Will. Free Will means your Will is Free. Your wants, desires, choices are not contingent upon ANYTHING. So now, let\u2019s start over. When you make a decision, yes it is you making that decision, but was your decision truly free? Was it an act or a reaction? Did something transpire to cause you to make that decision? We live in a universe that is completely governed by CAUSE and EFFECT and I\u2019m seeing people here saying they have free will. It feels like you\u2019re completely in control of your decisions, but are you? Did nothing influence, trigger or cause you to make the decision(s) you made? Absolutely not. We merely REACT to our environment ALL the time. You can\u2019t do anything with 0 stimuli. This is why Free Will is just an illusion, because it feels like we do, but we actually do not. From the time you were born, did you have a choice of your DNA? Nope. That alone damn near controls everything about you from how you look to how you act. Did you have any control over where you were born? Your culture shapes almost everything about you. Did you have any say so on how your parents raised you? Do you have any control over how your chemicals in your body metabolize? Your body is literally controlled by hormones and they are secreted based off stimuli. (I.e. Hardcore workout, Big Scary threatening dude on a subway sitting next to you, Hot chick at the club, delicious hamburger, or fun sports) Your body will react in very distinct ways based on what hormone is being released and how much of it is being released. Also, your past.. Do you have any control over your past? Your past also shapes your future decisions. I\u2019m going to stop here, because I could write and write about this aaaall day long about how you have 0 control. You are ONLY reacting, which feels like you are in control. Even down to the thoughts that you are experiencing while reading this, is merely you reacting to the words on this screen. Did you just choose those thoughts? Nope. Seriously, just take time and think about it. ",

            "answer_text": "It makes no difference whether or not we can justify free will by an objective measure. The existence of a feeling of voluntary control by itself is sufficient to invalidate the proposition of a deterministic universe. Not only would there be no survival advantage to such a phenomenon as a 'feeling' of free will (or any feeling for that matter) but it would not even be conceivable ontologically. It is to say that there is some advantage to having a shadow of a palm tree in a universe where no palm trees can ever exist. The solution I think hinges on a couple of things. First, that we are not literally one thing with one free will, we are many different sensorimotive agents sharing the same overlapping experience with both bottom up and top down participation. It's all us, but we are more than the sum of our parts. We are influenced by many different competing senses and motives but that doesn't mean that those processes are not also influenced by our overall perceptions and decisions. We can choose to focus on different impulses vying for our attention if we want.  The other thing is that just because we don't have absolute authority over our thoughts does not mean that we have no voluntary control over our thoughts or actions. If that was the case, there should be no reason for us to make any kind of distinction between the actions we take with our minds and and hands and the peristaltic contractions of our digestive tract. It would make no sense at all for us to have some kind of feeling for the difference between shooting someone in the face and sitting in on a park bench looking at the birds. if both circumstances were identically determined from outside of our awareness. It would be like imagining that a tree thinks that it's running around the forest all the time because there must be some kind of evolutionary advantage to it.  Think about it. It doesn't matter what a tree feels like as far as reproduction is concerned. Evolution is not teleological, it's teleonomy. An oak doesn't have to experience some fantasy of having some kind of impossible freedom in order to drop more acorns. It doesn't work that way. It's just that the trees who happen to drop more acorns by natural variation have a higher probability of populating the forest with more high-acorn-yielding trees. We should forget about this line of reasoning entirely, it's overreaching and distorts the role of evolutionary biology. If you can read this, there can be no other reason for it than that there is a possibility of making sense of it for your own purposes. In a deterministic universe, there would be no point to reading anything since all of your understanding was out of your control and your opinions would be provided for you. To doubt your own consciousness is not possible, because doubt is a form of consciousness. Free will is not the illusion, it is the disembodied voyeur which disqualifies free will on the grounds of second hand observations of the behaviors of objects in space. Free will is not an object in space, it is a subject through time. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes there is such a thing as free will. For example, moral actions. These actions are either uncaused, caused by another, or caused by oneself. First, there is no action that can be uncaused. If this were true it would go against the fundamental rational principle that every event has a cause. Second, a person\u2019s actions cannot be caused by another. If that were true they wouldn't be 'personal' actions then would they? How would anyone be held responsible for their actions if they were always caused by something else? A person\u2019s moral acts are actually caused by oneself. They are not caused by another or uncaused. They are not indeterminate or determined by another. It is always a freely chosen act when one could have done otherwise. One is only responsible for a choice if there was free will to avoid making it. All responsibility implies the ability to respond. Determinism destroys this human responsibility. But determinism proves itself to be false anyway. Denying that some actions can be free is self defeating. It shoots itself in the foot. If you are a complete determinist and follow the logic where it leads you must insist that both determinists and nondeterminists are determined to believe what they believe. But determinists believe self-determinists are wrong and ought to change their view. But \u201cought to change\u201d implies freedom to change. This is contrary to determinism. C.S. Lewis also showed that for determinism to be true, there would have to be a rational basis for their thought. But if determinism is true, then there is no rational basis for thought, since all is determined by nonrational forces. So, if determinism claims to be true, then it must be false. Free will is alive and well. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Or let them, it's your choice. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Free Will, defined as the ability to have done otherwise, is not logically possible. All events must either be caused or uncaused, these are the only logical possibilities. In a universe where all events have prior causes, Free Will cannot exist as every outcome is completely determined by the given set of conditions; there is only one possible outcome. In a universe where some events do not have causes, Free Will still cannot exist as uncaused events cannot be willed into existence by a person, they would happen at random for no reason. These exhaust all possibilities, and therefore Free Will does not exist. This, however, does not undermine our own causal agency, we causally determine our actions, and as such still have the ability to determine our futures to our liking. I would like to add that since most of the world assumes Free Will to exist, the truth that it does not exist would have significant implications in the real world. Holding others morally or ethically accountable for their actions, good or bad, is no longer reasonable given that they could not have done otherwise. A person's choice isn't ultimately up to them, despite how much they agree with it. This would change the way we view others, hold grudges, or even hate others at all. We would still need to lock dangerous criminals away for the safety of others, but to punish them or hate them for being morally depraved would be wrong, it IS wrong. This may seem like a casual response on Quora, but it's in fact a pretty big deal. Unfortunately, many people aren't willing to hear this reasoning out. I hope someday that more answers like this will pop up, and more people will be willing to keep an open mind to ideas like Determinism. It might just change the world. ",

            "answer_text": "We as people have free will, but this is not to be confused with being able to control our outcome. What do I mean by this? I am free to go into a bank and apply for a 1.2 million dollar loan, but I can not control whether or not I receive this loan. Under string theory, there is a reality which exists out there in which I do get this loan.  I point to Chaos Theory and the Butterfly Effect: The philosophical argument that everything which exists in the world in interconnected. For example: something as small as the force of wind generated from a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can eventually build up and snow ball into a force causing a Typhoon in Japan. Under this philosophical argument, lets perform a thought experiment. You are walking down the crowded streets of New York City drinking your morning coffee. By accident someone bumps into you, this causes you to spill your hot coffee over a stranger standing to your left. You apologize but this man has become extremely angry. As you walk away this man gets a call from his girlfriend, but because he is now angry the two get in a phone fight which ultimately leads to their breakup. After their breakup, the man moves back home and the girlfriend moves to California.  Just think for a moment, the small act of someone bumping into on the street snowballed into life changing actions and consequences for complete strangers.  Now, Did these people exercise their free will or where their actions decided by forces beyond their control? You could not control getting bumped into by a stranger, the man could not control you would spill coffee on him and the girlfriend could not control her boyfriend being upset. Yet everyone actions here are dictated by these occurrences.  I argue we all still have free will here. You did not have to walk down that side of the street but you choose to, you did not have to get a coffee that morning but you wanted to. The man did not have to act angry with you, but he choose to let this emotion control him. He did not have to get upset with his girlfriend but he did. The girlfriend did not have to break up and move away, but she choose to. Though everything in the Universe is more interconnected than perhaps anyone might realize, if nothing else in life we are responsible for controlling our own self. I for one believe we are always given a choice, we do indeed have free will. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting answers...  Oddly enough, the debate on the existence of free will didn't start until after it was put forward as an important concept.  Christian Theology was actually the main actor in bringing the notion of free will to the forefront of intellectual discourse. The \"liberum arbitrium\" is very important in (Catholic) theology because we see that man has a real power of cooperation with the grace of God.  God can (and does) even move our will from within but leaves us free to accept/choose that movement. On the philosophical side of things, it would be helpful to establish what the will is, and what it is for before analyzing a particular quality of its exercise, i.e. freedom.  For Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics), the will is a power (dunamis), potency, or faculty - which in and of itself is not free unless you mean \"free\" as in \"free beer.\"  Choice, on the other hand, which is an act of the will, implies a certain amount of freedom.  You do not choose what is imposed upon you, so, for Aristotle, you do not choose your \"end\" (telos - in the philosophical sense).  You cannot choose whether or not you are attracted to something good, what you can choose is whether or not you will respond to that attraction.  And responding to the attraction of that which is good requires a choice of means - that is where our ethical freedom lies, in the means we choose to attain our end, which is the good we are attracted to. One of the things Nietzsche drew everyone's attention to was what he called the \"will to power.\"  While our will is also what enables us to be efficient, to move things forward, to be \"willful,\" that is not its primary function.  The primary function of our will is to form acts of spiritual love, and that is what gives us the greatest amount of interior strength. Loving is being moved or attracted by another person, and all the love songs ever written bear witness to the fact that this is the strongest force that exists.  And though love is incredibly gripping in its capacity to move us, it is terribly vulnerable at the same time - the slightest misunderstanding, the slightest breach of trust, wounds love and causes it to lose its strength, and causes us to lose our sense of direction and purpose.  So to fortify this love, we must regularly choose and re-choose whatever means will enable us to remain attached to the end (person) who attracts us. I think we realize the existence of our freedom to the extent that we realize how much it depends upon us and our choices to remain attached to the person we love. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Does free will exist? Why, or why not? - -Free will is the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion according to definition. - -If free will does not exist, people are not responsible for their bad or good actions and one cannot blame and punish the people when they do bad actions and one cannot praise and reward the people when they do good actions. -According to the philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, we are responsible for our actions, so free will exists. (By oneself indeed is evil done and by oneself is one defiled. By oneself is evil not done and by oneself is one purified. Purity and impurity depend entirely on oneself. No one can purify another.)- - According to philosophy of Theravda Buddhism, there are (physically, mentally and verbally) good actions and bad actions. Gotama Buddha told people to restrain from bad actions and encouraged to do good actions on regular basis. (To avoid all evil, to cultivate good, and to cleanse one's mind \u2014 this is the teaching of the Buddhas.)- -According to philosophy of Buddhism, doing bad things is easy, and doing good things or restraining from doing bad things is difficult. (It is easy to do things that are bad and unbeneficial to oneself, but it is indeed most difficult to do things that are beneficial and good.)- -Gotama Buddha taught people to choose the good action. (more difficult action.) (If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not delight in sin: pain is the outcome of evil.If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight in it: happiness is the outcome of good.All tremble at violence; all fear death. Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor cause another to kill.Just as a wealthy merchant with few attendants avoids a dangerous road, just as one who desires to go on living avoids poison, so also, one should avoid doing evil.Although one's mind goes around and looks for all over the places, he will not find out one who loves someone more than himself. So also, most of the people love themselves most. So one who wants his own benefit should not torture others.Think not lightly of evil, saying, \"It will not come to me.\" Drop by drop is the water pot filled. Likewise, the fool, gathering it little by little, fills himself with evil.Think not lightly of good, saying, \"It will not come to me.\" Drop by drop is the water pot filled. Likewise, the wise man, gathering it little by little, fills himself with good.)- -It means people have free will to choose to do bad actions or good actions. -We are responsible for our actions, so we have free will according to the philosophy of Theravada Buddhism. - Source - Tipitaka - - - Very Long Answer (Explanation) \u2026\u2026. In the early morning of July 23, 2007, Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky, two career criminals, arrived at the home of Dr. William and Jennifer Petit in Cheshire, a quiet town in central Connecticut. They found Dr. Petit asleep on a sofa in the sunroom. .........The two then bound Petit\u2019s hands and feet and went upstairs to search the rest of the house. They discovered Jennifer Petit and her daughters\u2014Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11\u2014still asleep. They woke all three and immediately tied them to their beds........ At 9:30, he drove Jennifer Petit to her bank to withdraw $15,000 in cash. .......While Hayes and the girls\u2019 mother were away, Komisarjevsky amused himself by taking naked photos of Michaela with his cell phone and masturbating on her. When Hayes returned with Jennifer, the two men divided up the money and briefly considered what they should do. They decided that Hayes should take Jennifer into the living room and rape her\u2014which he did. He then strangled her, to the apparent surprise of his partner.At this point, the two men noticed that William Petit had slipped his bonds and escaped. They began to panic. They quickly doused the house with gasoline and set it on fire. When asked by the police why he hadn\u2019t untied the two girls from their beds before lighting the blaze, Komisarjevsky said, \u201cIt just didn\u2019t cross my mind.\u201d The girls died of smoke inhalation. William Petit was the only survivor of the attack. ................... As sickening as I find their behavior, I have to admit that if I were to trade places with one of these men, atom for atom, I would be him: There is no extra part of me that could decide to see the world differently or to resist the impulse to victimize other people. Even if you believe that every human being harbors an immortal soul, the problem of responsibility remains: I cannot take credit for the fact that I do not have the soul of a psychopath. If I had truly been in Komisarjevsky\u2019s shoes on July 23, 2007\u2014that is, if I had his genes and life experience and an identical brain (or soul) in an identical state\u2014I would have acted exactly as he did.

Convict heritage inspires mixed feelings June 8, 2015A recent report in Molecular Psychiatry identified a \u201cwarrior gene\u201d connected to criminal behaviour. This inspired renewed speculation that a convict ancestry might make Australians more predisposed to violent crime.This fear of genetic contamination from convict ancestors has existed in Australia since early settlement. Between 1788 and the end of transportation in 1868, around 162,000 convicts were sent to the colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen\u2019s Land and Western Australia.An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts.In 1856, Van Diemen\u2019s Land was renamed Tasmania in an attempt to purge its convict past.And the fear that we might be cursed with a genetic predisposition towards criminal behaviour?

Human intellect at birth resembled a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know. Persian philosopher Ibn SinaAt birth the (human) mind is a \"blank slate\" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's sensory experiences. John Locke-Generally, the tabula rasa thesis favor the \"nurture\" side of the nature versus nurture debate, when it comes to aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behavior, and intelligence. -Scholarly and popular discussion about nature and nurture relates to the relative importance of an individual's innate qualities (nature) as compared to an individual's personal experiences (nurture) in causing individual differences in physical and behavioral traits. From Tabula rasa - Wikipedia Nature versus nurture - Wikipedia - -Fall of the Tabula rasa (Blank slate) concept -Generations later, people questioned about the blank state theory of mind. When observing the children, they found out that the children had distinct personalities, characters, talent since young. Within same culture, within same environment and even within same big families, some children were introvert, some were extrovert, some were easily angry, some had sense of humor, some learnt easily in studying, some had talents in arts, music, dancing, playing piano, etc, some had talent in different sports since young, majority of children had sense of morality since young (they knew what is good, what is bad without learning from adults). -Some researchers even found out that they could predict which children will be successful in later life, who would complete university education by doing so simple experiment to the children. \u00b7 (The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a series of studies on delayed gratification in the late 1960s and early 1970s led by psychologist Walter Mischel, then a professor at Stanford University. In these studies, a child (4-7 years of age) was offered a choice between one small reward (sometimes a marshmallow, but often a cookie or a pretzel, etc.) provided immediately or two small rewards if he or she waited until the tester returned (after an absence of approximately 15 minutes). In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI) and other life measures.From Stanford marshmallow experiment) - -The children are morally good at birth -Regarding the morality, even children under 2 years old can tell, to an extent, what is good and bad, and often act in an altruistic fashion. (The last few years produced a spate of related studies hinting that, far from being born a \u201cperfect idiot,\u201d as Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued, or a selfish brute, as Thomas Hobbes feared, a child arrives in the world provisioned with rich, broadly pro-social tendencies and seems predisposed to care about other people.

One puppet rolled a ball to a second puppet, who passed the ball back. The first puppet then rolled the ball to a different puppet, who ran off with the ball. The baby was next given a choice between taking a treat away from the \u201cnice\u201d puppet or the \u201cnaughty\u201d one. As Bloom predicted, the infant removed the treat from the naughty puppet\u2014which is what most babies do in this experiment. But for this little moralist, removing a positive reinforcement (the treat) was not enough. \u201cThe boy then leaned over and smacked this puppet on the head,\u201d Bloom recounts.

By the time the Hougoumont landed its shipment of 281 convicts, the Swan River penal colony in Western Australia had been reliant on convict labour for 18 years, and received almost 10,000 male prisoners from Britain.From http://theconversation.com/the-s... ) - -(From Stain or badge of honour? Convict heritage inspires mixed feelings June 8, 2015A recent report in Molecular Psychiatry identified a \u201cwarrior gene\u201d connected to criminal behaviour. This inspired renewed speculation that a convict ancestry might make Australians more predisposed to violent crime.This fear of genetic contamination from convict ancestors has existed in Australia since early settlement. Between 1788 and the end of transportation in 1868, around 162,000 convicts were sent to the colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen\u2019s Land and Western Australia.An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts.In 1856, Van Diemen\u2019s Land was renamed Tasmania in an attempt to purge its convict past.And the fear that we might be cursed with a genetic predisposition towards criminal behaviour? A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that, adjusted for population, Tasmania \u2013 with the highest proportion of convict descendants \u2013 had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation.From https://theconversation.com/stai... ) - -So according to present concept, human life becomes more and more complex and confused. There are a lot of contradictions. -Human beings are born blank in brain and learn from environment they are raised to become what they are in adult, it is thought at first. -Later human beings are set in characters, personalities, intelligence since birth and they have no free will, it is thought like that later. -Human beings may or may not be successful in spite of their psychopath brain. - - -According to present day concept, all the life in earth were arise from simple DNA. First it started as a single cell as an unicellular organism and later evolved into complex multicellular organism. All those organisms are related and evolved by the simple DNA instruction. Charles Darwin was the first to formulate a scientific argument for the theory of evolution by means of natural selection. -So DNA is the life of organism. No DNA, no life. -In human being, DNA of the child of is given by mother and father. The child's external features (physical characteristics) are built up according to those shared DNA. So scientists figure that the internal characteristics (Personalities, intelligence quotient, Emotional Intelligence, etc) of the child must be also derived from the parents. -When DNA makes a human being, mind spontaneously occur in that human and it permanently disappear when that living being dies. - -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, each and every human being has own unique soul and when that human being dies, most of the souls has continual repetitive cycle of birth and death called samsara (not just in human world, also in other living worlds) according to his karma. In Buddhism, karma specifically refers to those actions of body, speech or mind that spring from mental intent (\"cetana\"), and bring about a consequence or fruit, (phala) or result (vip\u0101ka). -If that particular soul comes back to human world as rebirth, that particular human being will have distinct personality, I.Q, E.Q according to his daily routine doings, habits. Those characters are not derived from his own parents, according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism. -So one human being will have personality, intelligence distinct from his father and mother. In other words, if one pair of parents produces a lot, a lot of children, the parents will find that their children will have so many distinct personalities and intelligence different not only from the parents but also among the siblings. According to that thinking, if one pair of parents make a lot, a lot of clones from one embryo and give birth to them (by surrogate mothers or other means hypothetically), they will get a lot of identical children with distinct personalities and very different range of intelligence among them. - Science will not accept above concept, because science dost not accept concept of soul. According to current science idea, all of those identical children must have same personality and not so different intelligence. -Science can explain about the physical appearance of children by inheritance of genes from parents, but science cannot explain about the internal characters (personality, behavior, I.Q, E,Q) by inheritance of genes from parents. - On Same psychopath trait with different futures It is better to make enemy with a wise man than to make a friend with a fool. A wise man will not harm other people for the fear of bad consequence to himself.-Some people have psychopath brain change and personality and they develop into criminals in later life. But some people have psychopath brain change and personality and they develop into successful people in late life. Why? -Because they have different intelligence, wisdom. -If a person with psychopath personality has high I.Q, he will control his impulse because he the bad consequence and he will develop his personality as a advantage to be successful in his career. -If a person with psychopath personality has low I.Q, he cannot control his impulse and he will become a bad guy in later life. -So where does that high I.Q come from? If a person made a lot of learning, studying in previous life, he will find that it is easy to learn, easy to study in later life and he can have high I.Q. (If you find a person with much higher I.Q than you, he may work harder, learn harder, study harder than you in at least one lifetime ahead of you. - \u2026.. there is the case where a woman or man when visiting a priest or contemplative, asks: 'What is skillful, venerable sir? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? What, having been done by me, will be for my long-term harm & suffering? Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare & happiness?' Through having adopted & carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is discerning wherever reborn. This is the way leading to discernment: when visiting a priest or contemplative, to ask: 'What is skillful?... Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare & happiness?'\u2026.. Beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness & refinement \u2026\u2026\u2026From Culakammavibhanga Sutta - - -So, -Human beings are not blank slate at birth. According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, some people are born good regardless of their good or bad environment or good or bad behaviors of their parents. Some people are born bad regardless of their good or bad environment or good or bad behaviors of their parents, too. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, personality is learned as it was acquired from previous life (his/her repeated actions at that life). In one person's life, his/her actions, which he/she repeatedly does, become his/her habits, behaviors, and then become personality. -That does not means their good or bad behaviors, attitudes are fixed since birth. they can change from good to bad or bad to good during their lifetime. During the growing period from childhood to adulthood, they can become good or bad (especially bad if environment encourages) according to influence of environment (parents, teachers, surrounding people, etc). But it is easier to change from good to bad. It takes more effort to change from bad to good. - - Note ........ As sickening as I find their behavior, I have to admit that if I were to trade places with one of these men, atom for atom, I would be him: There is no extra part of me that could decide to see the world differently or to resist the impulse to victimize other people. Even if you believe that every human being harbors an immortal soul, the problem of responsibility remains: I cannot take credit for the fact that I do not have the soul of a psychopath. If I had truly been in Komisarjevsky\u2019s shoes on July 23, 2007\u2014that is, if I had his genes and life experience and an identical brain (or soul) in an identical state\u2014I would have acted exactly as he did. There is simply no intellectually respectable position from which to deny this. The role of luck, therefore, appears decisive. \u2026..From https://samharris.org/the-illusi... - -Modern Science does not accept the importance of so-called individual\u2019s soul or spirit or self or consciousness. That thing is the meaningless, purposeless consciousness appeared out of nowhere after DNA or genes make human beings (with brain) alive. Scientists only look the human brain as an individual at one time. When one individual human being becomes alive, he has one and only unique consciousness and that consciousness disappear forever when that particular person dies. There is no connection with present, past or future. So they get the following conclusion. Free Will is an illusion. All humans\u2019 behavior is entirely controlled by the physical properties of their brains. A person did not make his or her brain. Therefore, a person does not really control their own behavior.From http://www.samharris.org/forum/viewthread/17248/ - -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, that so-called individual\u2019s soul or spirit or self or consciousness is related to past, present and future if that particular spirit or soul doesn\u2019t liberate from cycles of rebirths. So his routine actions, habits, behaviors from his past lives will show as his characters, personality, and intelligence in present life and those can continue to next life if he does not change in his present life. -In his essay on Free Will, Sam Harris wrote that, \u201cif I were to trade places with one of these men, atom for atom, I would be him: I cannot take credit for the fact that I do not have the soul of a psychopath. If I had truly been in Komisarjevsky\u2019s shoes on July 23, 2007\u2014that is, if I had his genes and life experience and an identical brain (or soul) in an identical state\u2014I would have acted exactly as he did.\u201d -But in my opinion, if Sam Harris\u2019s so-called soul or spirit was born into Komisarjevsky\u2019s environment, I believe he will not become a murderer. He will still be a scientist, author like he is now because of his past deeds. -Suppose that there are tens of thousands of children are born to the same environment like Komisarjevsky\u2019s one, not everyone will become a murderer like him. Most persons will become average persons, some will become famous, successful, some will become criminals according to individual\u2019s past and present action, behavior, habit, thinking, etc. -So according to the philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, one person can change his future by his free will. There is a free will in every individual. Whether one believes or not, whether one wants to change or not, it is up to oneself. - - References from Theravada Buddhism -There are these four types of people to be found existing in the world. (1) One in darkness who is headed for darkness,(2) One in darkness who is headed for light,(3) One in light who is headed for darkness, and(4) One in light who is headed for light.(1) A person is born into a lowly family -- the family of a scavenger, a hunter, a basket-weaver, a wheelwright, or a sweeper -- a family that is poor, with little food or drink, living in hardship, where food and clothing are hard to come by.

He engages in good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct. This is the type of person in light who is headed for light.These are the four types of people to be found existing in the world.- -(The threefold bodily misconduct. A certain one is cruel, destroys living things, is with bloody hands. Engaged in destroying living things without compassion.From village or forest takes others\u2019 possessions stealthily. Takes what is not given.Misbehaves in sexuality, misbehaving with those protected by father, mother, mother and father, by brother, sister, relations, with those with a husband, becoming liable to punishment, or even those garlanded and made to promise.-The fourfold verbal misconduct. A certain one tells lies, in an assembly, at a gathering, amidst relations, gone to the guild, or in the presence of the royal family. Called upon to stand witness and asked to tell what he knows, not knowing would say I know. Knowing would say I do not know. Not seeing would say I saw, seeing would say, I did not see. Thus for his benefit, for another\u2019s benefit, or for some small gain he would tell lies with awareness.He would slander, hearing here would tell it elsewhere to make a split here. Hearing elsewhere would tell it here to make a split there. Thus he disunites the united, fond of disuniting talks words to disunite.He would talk roughly, saying insolent words that are sharp and cursing, words bordering on anger and not conductive to concentration.He would say frivolous, untimely, untruthful words, not in keeping with the Teaching and the discipline, words that could not be treasured.-The threefold mental misconduct. One covets others\u2019 possessions, thinks may those things be mine.He is angry with a defiled mind, thinks may they come to destruction and not exist.He is with wrong, perverted view that there are no results for a gift and sacrifice. There are no results for pure and impure actions. There is no this world, no other world, no mother, father, no spontaneously arisen beings and no recluses and Brahmins who have come to the right path and by themselves realizing declare this world and the other world.- -The threefold good bodily conduct. A certain one abstains from destroying living things, throwing away stick and weapon ashamed abides compassionate to all living things.In village or forest does not take what is not given, the possessions of others.Does not misbehave in sexuality, not misbehaving with those protected by father, mother, mother and father, brother, sister, relations, or with those with a husband, becoming liable to punishment, or even those garlanded and made to promise.-The fourfold good verbal conduct, A certain one does not tell lies.

Knowing would say I know. Not seeing would say I did not see, and seeing would say, I saw. Thus for his own good or for another\u2019s or for some small gain he would not tell lies with awareness.Would not slander, hearing here would not tell it elsewhere to make a split here. Hearing elsewhere would not tell it here to make a split there. Thus does not disunite the united, fond of uniting would talk words to unite.Would not talk roughly, saying polite loving words going straight to the heart, words pleasing to the populace at large.Not talking frivolously, would talk words that are timely, truthful and in accordance with the Teaching and the discipline. Words that could be treasured.-The threefold mental good conduct. One does not covet others\u2019 possessions, thinking may they be mine.Is not angry and not with a defiled mind, thinking may these beings be well and happy.Is with right view not perverted, i.e., There are results for a gift and sacrifice There are results for pure and impure actions. There is this world, and the other world There is mother, father, and spontaneously arisen beings. In this world there are recluses and Brahmins who have come to the right path and by themselves realizing declare this world and the other world.- Think not lightly of evil, saying, \"It will not come to me.\" Drop by drop is the water pot filled. Likewise, the fool, gathering it little by little, fills himself with evil.- It is easy to do things that are bad and unbeneficial to oneself, but it is indeed most difficult to do things that are beneficial and good.- One by one, little by little, moment by moment, a wise man should remove his own impurities, as a smith removes his dross from silver.- Life is easy for one who is shameless and bold as a crow, which slanders others and is pretentious, aggressive and corrupt.Life is hard for one with a sense of shame who always seeks purity, who is free from attachment, which is modest and who sees clearly what is proper livelihood.- Few are those people in the world who, when acquiring lavish wealth, don't become intoxicated & heedless, don't become greedy for sensual pleasures, and don't mistreat other beings.- Don't ask the ancestry, just ask the moral characters. Just like the flame arising from any firewood, the man from inferior ancestry can also become steady learned, educated, wise man, arahat.- Source - Tipitaka ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote a critique, which I pasted below, of a well known video which shows some experiments preformed by neuroscientists that supposedly \"disproved free will\" (this video is discussed on some other posts, you can find links there or via google). Basically, they showed that when we place a man in a scanner and ask him to, at random, select between pushing the button placed in his right hand from the button placed in the right, they can predict via brain-imaging which button he will push (left or right) about 6 second before he makes a decisions and press it.  The video makes it seem that, given the scientific findings explained in the video, there is no other belief or theory that\u2019s acceptable besides the idea that \u201cour subconscious brains drive our decisions and our couscous selves just follow it\u2019s command.\u201d This is false\u2014 there are multiple other logically sound positions a person can take which allow us to logically believe in free will even with the standing science surrounding the debate. Let me point out a few of these stances: The Brain Region Question:Just because we've shown that neuroscience can predict about 6 seconds before we know what we will do the actual act of what we will do when we participate in randomly clicking a button in our hand, this does not mean they can predict other actions which require different brain situations. This is where the author steps into theory. This experiment shows what our brains do in a very specific setting and notes that certain brain regions \u201clight up\u201d long before we know what we will do and that these brain regions show which of two options will be chosen by us consciously. It does not prove the brain acts like this in other, very different settings.  Yes, it shows that when we randomly select between two choices our brains decide long before \u201cwe\u201d (the couscous us) decides, but what proves we might not rely on some subconscious part(s) of our brains to help us decide who to marry, what car to buy, and how to write comments on Quora. It\u2019s obvious to those studying neuroscience that we use different parts of the brain for different activities\u2014 what if one part or parts holds our \u201cfree will\u201d and we only access it when doing certain tasks? What if all of our brain has wired into it a \u201cfree will\u201d function, but we don\u2019t use it when randomly choosing between two buttons? What if our brains use a kind of subconscious auto-pilot for making some decisions (like clicking randomly between two buttons) but use a \u201cfree will overdrive\u201d when it comes to different, more important decisions\u2014 like moral decisions?  Only more neuroscience and philosophy will tell!  The Cogito Model:The Cogito Model is another option in the array of theories that explain the mechanisms of the brain and the possibility of free will. This model shows how we can exist in a way that is not deterministic, (i.e. in a way that allows free will). In a way, I alluded to something like the Cogito Model when I said \u201cwhat if all of our brain has wired into it a \u201cfree will\u201d function.\u201d The link below will dive into how quantum mechanics (a well established set of observations in physics) plays a role in our neuronal activity (in our brains) and so allows the idea that \"we are in the drivers seat\" (as opposed to the idea that \"our brains control us.\") The Cogito Model. It is a very in-depth article, so I'll point out some of the main features for light-readers:  a) The scientific community has proven that particles on the quantum mechanical scale not deterministic, or, in other words, they are not caused by something which will fix a certain behavior or outcome: they are random, non determined in nature. (If you'd like to learn more about this, check out the MinutePhysics video on this entitled \"Can We Predict Everything?\" just google the title.) b) Our brains, which are composed of neurons, function at a level so small it is in touch with the quantum mechanical.  c) This provides the logical idea that our brains, at some level, are random or have access to randomness, which could allow us to make decisions freely.  (That sound's a little weird, I know, but if you think about it\u2014 about the brain being able to have a \"starting point\" from a place of randomness, you'd be able to logically conclude that we can really decide freely what we will do given nothing is causing our decision, no past set up or force since there is a launching pad of \"chaotic noise\" or randomness from which our brains get to be creative and free). Another interesting bit to know is well expressed in this quote:\"[...] experiments show that the unconscious mind initiates seemingly voluntary acts, some as much as 0.35 seconds earlier than conscious awareness. Back in the 1980s, Benjamin Libet concluded that we have no free will as far as the initiation of our movements are concerned, but that we had a kind of cognitive \"veto\" to prevent the movement at the last moment; we can't start it, but we can stop it.\" (Quoted from 8 Things We Simply Don't Understand About the Human Brain).  So we could say free will is a component we invoke during the last steps of our decisions.

The alternative is a deterministic worldview which treats us like billiard balls rather than the complex choice bearing individuals we appear to be based on the evidence available to us as human, philosophers, and scientists. The World is a Stage:We both act in the world and are acted upon. Ultimately, to my knowledge, we can't verify via science either way. However, irrespective whether free will exists or not--we should act as if free will exists. (Which incidentally seems to be the larger question....at least to me....). If only because it makes life more enjoyable and fulfilling, but also because it makes ideas like responsibility a core. It give meaning to our desires to protect women and minorities from the dehumanization that others might. This resonates with the power and possibility that lies in the universe and in humanity. The Value of HopeFurther, the argument for hope is compelling. That a world with hope and acting as if hope is a possibility makes more sense than acting as if there is an all controlling force in our chemistry. If we act like that, we would resemble some of the scenes from Lord of the Flies--because it would be a world of no value in humans, no responsibility, no accountability, and no justice. Argument Fail: Science Whether Chemistry or Biology Can't Exclude Freewill and ChoiceThe core of this question has a far, far larger burden of proof. To say that genes, biology, or chemistry shape who we are doesn't mean they determine who we are or to what extent that is the case (its a continuum if you will). This means that 99% of the answers here simply don't answer the question. For instance, chemistry wouldn't be able to say if choice existed or not--it simply is not geared to make a determination of this philosophical query. If there is a study from chemistry or elsewhere that says otherwise, I would like to read it. The hidden or embedded premise that \"chemistry can explain everything about humans and life\" is a bit dubious. As such, chemistry in one sense begs the question of choice--almost in the same way that math begs the same question with respect to this answer. Chemistry isn't a science capable of detecting human choice--which suggest using it as evidence is a bit of a fool's errand. However, the unpredictability of scientific results (aka the margin of error in experiments which involve human subjects and perhaps even animal subjects) suggests some force other than chemistry is at work, which further suggest chemistry alone is a poor tool to determine the answer--and further suggests a detectable degree of indeterminacy--which might just be choice. (I recently compiled some quotes from John Polkinghorne on this issue, which I encourage you to read here Investigating Science, Quantum Mechanics, and Free Will ) Also, I imagine despite the correlations, that many chemists and even neuro-biologists still believe in the notions of human choice. If you read the literature on soft determinism its far, far more convincing than the literature on hard determinism which relies on radical conspiracy theories which are extremely hyperbolic and lack connection to how we experience reality in our daily lives. Libet Experiments Don't Provide Answers:Tim Bayne from Oxford in Free Will and Modern Science points out that the Libet experiments are really looking at issues of indifference rather than deliberation (two separate categories of wills or intents), so the experiments aren't the \"ideal exemplars of free will that Libet takes them to be\": But although Libet-actions involve an act of will they do not involve deliberation\u2014at least, not immediately prior to the action. In my terms, they are examples of disinterested agency, for the agent has no reason to flex their wrist at one particular time rather than the other, or to flex it in one way rather than another. Indeed, Libet experiments are explicitly constructed so as to minimize the rational constraints under which the subject acts. We might think of Libet-actions as manifesting the liberty of indifference. He continues by noting Libets assessment of the type II readiness potential is misguided and flawed: As Mele (2009) and Roskies (2011) have observed, we simply do not know. Our ignorance on this point derives from the fact that the RP is measured by a process known as \u2018backaveraging.\u2019 Because the RP on any one trial is obscured by neural noise, what is presented as \u2018the RP data\u2019 is determined by averaging the data collected on a large number of trials. In order to compute this average, the EEG recordings on different trials need to be aligned, and this requires some fixed point\u2014such as the onset of muscle activity or some other observable behaviour on the part of the subject\u2014that can be identified across trials. Any RPs that are not followed by an action simply won\u2019t be measured, and so we don\u2019t know how robust the correlation between the RP and Libet-actions is.15 As such, the conclusions from the Libet's studies as well as those papers influenced by the conclusions must be viewed in a very critical light.Experience:When picking your worldview on this question--it just makes sense to err on the side of choice. Determinism requires humans to act like robots, but the experience of life isn't robotic, despite patterns of behavior (realize I'm carving out distinctive middle ground here). Infinite regresses on other possibilities don't seem particularly constructive--except to say that we have amazing imaginations which tremendously powerful and flexible engines. Moreover, the experiences of situations of lack of control versus situations of relative freedom are vastly different. Often the internal feelings and calculations as well as the external demeanor of people who have good self-concept and self-control versus those who are addicted is vastly different (and there is a broad continuum of steps between one situation and the other). In the case of drug addicts we literally know much of what chemical influence does to control, but by contrast the experience of human existence is in sharp contrast to those experiences (Frankfurt seems to make a similar argument). * Further, psychologists say that our brains decision-making resembles a man on top of a elephant (metaphorically). In that sense, we are still in control, just the ways in which humans can exercise that control are limited to 1. self-control 2. will and determination 3. self-motivation 4. accountability. Moreover, neuro-biologists talk about two systems of thought--one more intuitive and instinctual, the other more reflective. The act and experience of reflection isn't really captured by the determinists. The human experience of choice and deliberation includes focus, attention, degree of will (volition or intention), among other deeply complex and intertwined experiences of human conciousness. To deny these forces seems to belie reality. Mele highlights some of those experiences: Such agents are capable of modifying the strengths of their desires in the service of their normative judgments, of bringing their emotions into line with relevant judgments, and of mastering motivation that threatens (sometimes via the biasing of practical or theoretical reasoning) to produce or sustain beliefs in ways that would violate their principles for belief-acquisition and retention. They are capable, moreover, of rationally assessing and revising their values and principles, of identifying with values of theirs on the basis of informed, critical reflection, and of intentionally fostering new values and pro-attitudes in themselves in accordance with their considered evaluative judgments. Presumably, most readers of this essay have each of these capacities in some measure. All such capacities are bypassed in cases of pro-attitude engineering of the sort at issue. In such cases, new pro-attitudes are not generated via an exercise or an activation of agents\u2019 capacities for control over their mental lives; rather, they are generated despite the agents\u2019 capacities for this. Earlie in the essay, Mele calls attention to the metaphor of driving a car, which I think is apt for contrast: Control is a topic of much discussion in the literature on autonomy. Sometimes it is claimed that agents have no control at all if determinism is true. That claim is false. When I drive my car (under normal conditions), I am in control of the turns it makes, even if our world happens to be deterministic. I certainly am in control of my car\u2019s movements in a way in which my passengers and others are not. In the same way, the experience of being in control of decisions and our lives mirrors this position (the alternative would be the life of a television across which visuals and energy were flashed, but someone else was in control of the remote). This isn't how we experience reality. In fact, were humans to take this perspective it would only lead to regression, irresponsibility, and isolation. Such a shift would only re-ify the truth claim that we control and need to control our behaviors. Category Mistake/Faulty Assumptions:To examine human conciousness based on causality is itself a category mistake, according to an astute reviewer: The feeling of free will is so completely different from the feeling attending perception of ordinary cause-effect phenomena, that to apply the word \"cause\" to the former might well be due to some inept attempt to articulate something distinct from all other experiences, but using words appropriate only to those other experiences. Perhaps the feeling of free will is inherently incapable of articulation. A philosophical writer would at least consider that a scientific study of free will in terms of cause-effect relations is inherently misguided. Rationality Transcends Causality J.F. Johnston highlights: As Steven Pinker observes, morality, consciousness and free will are \"deep enigmas\" and \"elusive quantities [sic] whose origins still remain wrapped insubstantial mystery....\" (28) This honest admission tells us that we have reached the limit of science and have crossed over into philosophy--specifically, into what Ernst Cassirer called \"the philosophy of symbolic forms.\" (29) A creature constituted solely by the physical flux of nature could not stand outside of, and bring order and meaning to, that flux. Mind cannot be identical with the matter it describes. To be conscious of natural forces, we must be to some extent independent of those forces through a reasoning faculty that transcends the matter it seeks to understand. Reason is the creative power that brings intelligible order to the raw material of the experienced world. The practice of science itself is evidence of conscious choice. Johnston continues: The world we live in is quirky, mysterious, and dangerous. Althoughwe live in a hostile environment, we are sometimes able, with consciouseffort, to transcend it. In doing so, we become aware that we are partof an order of being which transcends the bare struggle for existence.Consciousness is a fundamental component of reality, like mass andelectromagnetism. It is in some respects even more fundamental, since we could not understand physical forces without it. Consciousnessformulates the mathematical systems that make physical realityintelligible. It may be a mystery to scientists and a scandal tomaterialists, but it is a fact of human life. Consciousness, in turn,brings choice and responsibility. These are the characteristics thatseparate us from robots. They are worth defending. As such, there is a strong reason for maintaining our current legal and ethical ideas around free will, responsibility, and dignity. Changing course without 100% proof across the board would sacrifice much that we as humans hold meaningful to ourselves as well as to our friends and our families. I\u2019ve written 16 reasons why we should believe in free will here: Nathan Ketsdever's answer to What are the best arguments against deterministic behavior of humans? There are also a number of critiques of the Libet experiments including this: The Libet Experiment and its Implications for Conscious Will End Notes: I believe this later concept is in Isaiah Berlins Four Essays on Liberty--but I'm not honestly sure. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_BerlinI'm curious if Rene Descartes would have also proclaimed--I experience life as a choosing being--therefore I am. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren\u00e9_DescartesMultiple Schools of Thought on Free Will vs. Determinism Diagram:  Source: http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/ * Source: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/** Professor of Philosophy Alfred Mele at Florida State University http://myweb.fsu.edu/amele/almele.htmlhttp://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousMele.html***J.F.

            "answer_text": "Here's my attempt - I doubt there's a better platform than Quora to discover the flaws in this line of thought. Choose to believe in one of the following : 'A causes C' or 'B causes C'. Unless you have any information about your choices, predicting your choice is as difficult as predicting which nuclei will decay. For simplicity, there \"may\" be a \"relation\" between the non-deterministic nature of Quantum World and Free Will. How - ATM, I don't know; may be, they are not related, but is there any evidence or proof? Do you have a choice to work hard? Or, why is it that some people can work hard, others cannot? Is it the upbringing? Or do they have a choice? (Here, I am asking about the \u201cwill\u201d, and not mental/physical stamina.) Now, choose to believe in one of the following : \"you have free will' or 'you do not have free will'. You are \"free\" to choose - you can change your belief at any time, unless you know that either of the belief affects your behaviour. More specifically, the former favours you to work harder. Now that you have some information about these beliefs, your choice is biased and you lost free will in this matter. You can still have free will in this matter if you choose to question the belief that \u201ceither of the belief affects your behaviour\u201d. At least to me, it seems that you do not have the choice to decide how much you can work, unless, you can change your belief - you have the \"free\"dom to choose your beliefs, and these beliefs determine your decisions. This also applies to irrational behaviour that people show sometimes - unless they show the insight to evaluate their beliefs, their behaviour is difficult to change; for example, the previous generation vs. the current generation. Even hypnosis deals with your belief systems. So, yes, you have the free will to choose your beliefs; beliefs that significantly affect \u201cyour\u201d behaviour. (The behaviour, which exists due to our animal instincts, may be impossible to change - you may change your belief regarding the behaviour, but if your body does not comply for it, some \u201cissue\u201d may occur - try ingraining the belief that you dislike food.) Edit: From the comments, it may become clear that this is still an ambiguous answer! ",

            "answer_text": "Humans are convinced that they make conscious choices as they live their lives. But instead it may be that the brain just convinces itself that it made a free choice from the available options after the decision is made. The idea was tested out by tricking subjects into believing that they had made a choice before the consequences of that choice could actually be seen. In the test, people were made to believe that they had taken a decision using free will \u2013 even though that was impossible. The idea that human beings trick themselves into believing in free will was laid out in a paper by psychologists Dan Wegner and Thalia Wheatley nearly 20 years ago. They proposed the feeling of wanting to do something was real, but there may be no connection betweeen that. The study builds on that work and says that the brain rewrites history when it makes its choices, changing our memories so that we believe we wanted to do something before it happened. In one of the studies undertaken by Adam Bear and Paul Bloom, of Yale University, the test subjects were shown five white circles on a computer monitor. They were told to choose one of the circles before one of them lit up red. The participants were then asked to describe whether they\u2019d picked the correct circle, another one, or if they hadn\u2019t had time to actually pick one. Statistically, people should have picked the right circle about one out of every five times. But they reported getting it right much more than 20 per cent of the time, going over 30 per cent if the circle turned red very quickly. The scientists suggest that the findings show that the test subjects\u2019 minds were swapping around the order of events, so that it appeared that they had chosen the right circle \u2013 even if they hadn\u2019t actually had time to do so. The idea of free will may have arisen because it is a useful thing to have, giving people a feeling of control over their lives and allowing for people to be punished for wrongdoing.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It may seem strange to you but this is the reality of it. All conscious entities at some point have the ability to recognize their soul and it's source or remain ignorant of it/deny it. In the latter, free will no longer exists for those beings. They are at the whim of nature. They have invalidated themselves and are thus essentially Non-acting AI. Something akin to NPCs in media programming. Basically, they are nothing to themselves and anything beyond but soulless vessels \u2014 just organic matter. Society, then, is itself a natural phenomena because human organic matter is a naturally occurring animal. You see, the civilization they love is nothing but an ephemeral, animalistic, naturally occurring phenomena. Now, for the former, they recognize their souls and the souls of other beings. When they see other people, they see more than the body \u2014 they perceive with their mind's eye (sometimes called the third) that person's true self. It is harder to see this way because of the animal illusion and the fact that so many chose to be these \u201crobotic\u201d animals at the whim of nature when they invalidated their souls. Since these people recognize the soul, they also recognize layers of reality. Since they recognize layers of reality, they also recognize moral agency. However, this doesn't mean such conscious actors always act in a moral way that is in harmony with the tenets of Christ, for example. Indeed, such \u201cactors\u201d are in greater danger than those who deny their souls. Those who deny their souls and become basic AI with no real understanding simply blow away and drift wherever the currents of their precious world wants them. Those who recognize the soul and its creator yet act against it? Yeah, well, it's not going to be a preferred fate. It seems to me, and I could be wrong, but I think most people living today are simply \u201cAI\u201d. Really, they've no purpose beyond this world and time and are easily discarded. As is their wish and belief anyway \u2014 they have no need for God, and God definitely has no need for them. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy, the tough questions are starting to show up in my feed. This\u2019ll be good for people\u2019s perception of my mental health. I\u2019m gonna be that guy who says no, the idea of free will is kind of nonsense. Let me lay out why I say that. In order for you to truly have control, which is necessary for free will, it\u2019s my opinion that the results of your actions cannot be random. Sure, you can choose whether to call \u201cheads\u201d or \u201ctails\u201d when someone flips a coin, but it\u2019s not an informed decision with some kind of intentionality behind it, even if you\u2019ve rationalized some idea about why your answer is better than the other. Even though you\u2019re able to freely make that choice, I don\u2019t call that \u201cfree will\u201d because you have no control over the outcome, and you cannot logically be held responsible for the consequences of being right or being wrong when the result is random. People will argue me on this point, but for the sake of understanding my argument you\u2019ll have to accept, at least for the moment, that free will is only free when you\u2019re making an informed decision with established consequences for each option. Now when we\u2019re making more concrete decisions, we feel as though we are manipulating the outcome. After all, if you\u2019re debating getting the large ice cream instead of the small one, the actual size of the dessert isn\u2019t what makes you pause - you\u2019re thinking about the stomach ache you might get if you eat too much, or the extra pounds you\u2019re afraid to see on the scale tomorrow morning. Decision-making is all about weighing outcomes and consequences against one another, and we feel the most secure in making a decision when we feel as though we know the consequences of all of the options, so that we can judge those consequences effectively. It\u2019s my opinion that this idea, that we can know the effects of our options and make a decision based on those outcomes, is nonsense. There\u2019s always a chance that the consequences we anticipated are completely different from the actual outcome, and an even greater chance that there will be consequences that we didn\u2019t consider, even that we could never have anticipated. The interactions of the things we don\u2019t control with the things we think we do control always lead to unpredictable results. What\u2019s more, the way cause and effect tend to ripple out means our decisions have consequences so distant from us that we\u2019ll never even know we caused them. Consider: you\u2019re driving down a highway, running late for an interview that could land you your dream job. The traffic is pretty dense, not much room between the cars. The dude in the truck in front of you is going way slower than the lane next to you, but there\u2019s a brief opening in that lane after the next car moves past you. It\u2019d be a risky move, but you could probably make it over in time. Do you switch lanes? If you do switch lanes, the person you\u2019re pulling in front of is going to have to hit their brakes a little, suddenly. That means the person behind them will have to hit their brakes, too; and the person behind them, and so on, because the traffic is so dense. Those slow-downs build on each other, and this is what causes those weird delays you get on the highway where you keep expecting to see a massive, ugly accident but never do, and it is entirely possible under the conditions I described for a single car changing lanes too abruptly can add as much as a 15-minute delay to the travel times.[1] Maybe there\u2019s a father behind you who\u2019s going to miss his son\u2019s first baseball game because of that backup you caused. Maybe there\u2019s somebody with a medical emergency in the car trying to get to the hospital as quickly as possible - who knows what the effect on that situation could be. Maybe it\u2019s not that dramatic, but a couple hundred people get home from work a little later and a litter grumpier because traffic was bad. Very few people are going to argue in any way that those things are your fault, despite your decision to switch lanes being a direct cause of them. You certainly never intended any of those consequences when you changes lanes, you just wanted to get to your interview. You didn\u2019t know - you couldn\u2019t have known. And that\u2019s exactly why I say you ultimately didn\u2019t have free will in that situation, even though the choice to move over was completely under your control. You had the apparent free will to decide whether or not to take the action you did, but you were acting under a false set of assumptions about the effects of that decision - not unlike a person who thinks that a coin flip is less likely to land the same way it landed before, or that the side of the coin that\u2019s up before the flip affects the outcome. What\u2019s more, that false set of assumptions isn\u2019t something that you created yourself, it\u2019s what was suggested to you by the world, by society, by the context, by previous experience, and so on. You had good reason to think the way you did, but those reasons were external to you, and they led you astray. Our frame of reference is so small and so limited that we don\u2019t have true control over much of anything, and we\u2019d almost certainly make fundamentally different decisions if we really could foresee all the consequences. That doesn\u2019t sound like \u201cfree will\u201d to me. Footnotes[1] Traffic jam mystery solved by mathematicians",

            "answer_text": "No. I have two intuation to explain my answer. First is more like psychology based explanation and second one is based on Karma. When you decide to do certain things and you can choose from options which things to do then you can say you have free will, right? But it is paradox. Whatever you decide to do is led by your thinking, hormones, desires to name a few. This list also contains Karma but leave it for now we will discuss about it in while. First we will decide what is you after that one's thinking we can explain/understand. One is consistent of physical body and of meta physical body. Leave meta physical body for now as one can argue he/she won't believe in that. In your physical body decesion taking and thinking is done by our brain. Which is mystery itself as we don't know how it works. But one thing we can say from our experience that it depends on our feelings and hormones. Well we have no idea how our feelings and hormones behaves. May be it is programmed in our DNA or may be not, we don't know yet. But if first one is true then defenetly we don't have free will. Now for those who believes in Karma, we know that our current life is based \u200bon our previous Karma, and previous one was dependent on its preceded and so on. Well it is also paradox. When we do something we can not decide that we are doing this because of previous Karma or because we want to/feels to do this and we are doing this because of free will. From both intuation we can say that there are plenty of chances we don't have free will. May be we have who knows. The point is Base is not clear that what are we and how we function then free will that is part of us can not be explained/understood. I personally believe that we don't have free will. You are free to believe whatever you want. (It is like giving you blue or red pill. Whatever you choose you are still in Matrix ;) ) But may be we don't have free will. May be free will doesn't exist. May be this universe is just someone's dream. May be we are in simulation. May be we are in Matrix. May be we are actors in Westworld. Who knows!! ;) I hope rather than finding answer and arguing it is right or wrong, you enjoyed my answer. May be this answer was written by my free will or may be it was due to my previous Karma. The top is still spinning!! ;) ",

            "answer_text": "The fact that Adam and Eve had a choice to make in the Garden of Eden shows beyond all doubt that mankind was created with a free will. The first couple chose to sin, and that choice has plunged the entire world into spiritual darkness leading to our need of salvation. Through it all, mankind has retained his free will, and we will retain free will in heaven. Is it possible that people in heaven can exercise their free will to sin again and get kicked out of heaven? No, it is not possible. To back up a bit, we need an acceptable definition of free will. We have free will, but not in the way most people think. Our freedom consists in the fact that we are free to choose according to our desires. As long as we have a minimum of two available options, we must make a choice, and we will always do so according to our strongest desire. But, in the case of a fallen sinner, he or she is not at liberty to choose according to righteousness. This is what Jesus means when He says that the one who sins \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is a slave to sin\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (John 8:34). This is not the language of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free will\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as people typically think of it. The unregenerate person has a sinful nature; he is not just inclined to sin but driven by sinful impulses. It is perhaps helpful to say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are free to choose what we want but not free to want what we ought.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d This greatly limits our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freedom\u00e2\u20ac\u009d because the list of things we want (as sinners) coincides with whatever pleases our sinful impulses. Our choices are for things that will ultimately destroy us (Proverbs 14:12). As Paul says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Romans 7:24, NLT). When we are saved, we are liberated from our natural bondage to sin. The Holy Spirit sovereignly regenerates us and in grace gives us the ability to want what we ought to want, namely, forgiveness, salvation, and the lordship of Christ. When we trust in Jesus for salvation, we begin a moral progression, a journey toward holiness in which we put to death daily the sinful impulses that reside within us and strive toward godliness. In heaven we will be completely devoid of sin; our only desires will be for the things of God\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthings that bless us, fulfill us, and give us life. This is true liberty (see Romans 8:21). We will retain our free will in heaven, but our will is sanctified there. The sin nature will be gone. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, in my opinion, it depends where we are viewing this from. If we look at this as a kinda closed system universe (removing the idea of multiverse theory) from the view of you or I, it appears like we can do whatever we want, and that we do have free will. However, if we look at it after applying this idea of multiverse theory, then there is an infinite amount of universes, each with the infinite amounts of possible changes and outcomes, so we would just be the version of this universe that followed this particular route, meaning we don\u2019t have any free will and it is just a predetermined existence. A good model of this idea is in the Series Westworld with the how the robot host think (and to all intents and purposes do!) have free will, when actual fact, they are just following the scripting in their code. *Kinda spoiler alert!!!* This is then shown better when they talk to a host and show her the coding, to show she is actually a robot. The screen shows the dialog created by the code, in response to what the scenario. She starts talking and sees how the machine copies her word for word. She then is surprised by this and then continues talking, trying to stop it from copying what she is thinking. It then marks every time she\u2019s going to hesitate and break off script. To her, she thinks that she has free will over what to say and do, when actually it is all per-determined and she has no freedom at all. So from this, we know that from our position and view, we do have free will in the sense that that\u2019s how we will perceive it. However, we don\u2019t(and most probably never will) know if this is free will is just an illusion, or whether we truly have full free will. And essentially, this makes no real difference, as our entire life and existence is based of the premise we do have free will. BTW I believe in per-determination along with the multiverse theory (in case you were curious) Hope this answers what you were asking, as this was how I interpreted the question. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, the question is not so much whether or not free will exists, but how we can define it such that it is meaningful and functional for the way it is commonly used and attributable to neurological processes. This is not an easy task because it seems to be an oxymoron. The \"free\" part doesn't appear to be logically compatible with the \"will\" part, not to mention the deterministic or indeterminist reality in which it is supposed to exist. What we need is something neurologically compatible which can be responsible for moral and other sorts of agency. For those reasons, I prefer instead to talk about self-determination. A system is self-determining when its decisions have some autonomous component, not determined by something outside of it. The system might be deterministically or indeterministically formed or structured, such as the way the brain has evolved as a combination of the expression of its genes and the use of the biological material for that expression. The brain is also partly structured by use and disuse, as well as its input and feedback regarding its output. This is often referred to in the literature as its plasticity. Brains also have a biofeedback process. And its this biofeedback process which I believe is the strongest candidate for what we want to call self-determination. I would bet that the more complex the brain, along with its Encephalization quotient, which frees the brain to greater degrees from direct connections to its sensory input and motor output, for thinking. Because of its biofeedback and plasticity, thoughts can be redirected on themselves and change the brain without dominant external influences. This, of course, is just one possible neurobiological story, and it would require more formal observations, measurements, and experimentation. At the cognitive and psychological level, I believe self-determination becomes possible when we can consider hypotheticals and counterfactuals, not so much representationally, but systematically. The logical formation of a negation makes these possible, as well as disjunctive reasoning, which is the basis for choice. Because I can negate, I can consider hypotheticals and counterfactuals. Because I can consider hypotheticals and counterfactuals, I can consider disjunctive possibilities and preferences, both representationally and, more importantly for self-determination, in my behavioural responses. I can do either A or B. If part of my biofeedback is dedicated to considering A or B, whether I choose A or B is to some degree autonomous and unpredictable outside the system (such as by observing my behaviour). If that's not what we mean by free will, I don't know what is. What would be experimentally interesting is to contrast disjunctive choices, in the one case with obvious and extreme coercive pressures, and in the other case without those pressures. If the experiment were set up right, the outcome should be much less predictable without the extreme coercive pressures. I would interpret that outcome as evidence for free will. With the right experiment, it could be run and compared for a number of different species, and in turn, their brains could be neurologically compared to explain the difference in the results. It should be noted that cognitive science, neuroscience, and even philosophy of mind are not my primary fields of interest. I would be interested to hear how those who do study those fields weigh in on the question and my proposed experimental approach to it. I may very well be missing some fundamental facts in those fields. ",

            "answer_text": "Science demonstrates that all interactions of matter--including all events in the human brain--are sufficiently caused by previous events. If we know enough about the laws that govern these interactions and the current state of the universe, we would be able to exactly predict any future event. Does this mean that the doctrine of \"agency\" or \"free will\" is false, since all human choices are predetermined by the laws of physics? We know from the scriptures that God can exactly predict the future, but we also know from the scriptures that we have our moral agency to decide our future. There must be a solution to this problem, but there is as yet no generally-accepted solution. The Spirit and the Body Everything we think and feel is probably correlated with some physical changes in the brain. And, really, this shouldn't surprise the LDS, since they do not believe that \"mind\"/\"spirit\" and \"body\" are two totally separate and utterly un-similar things (See Cartesian fallacy): There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes; We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter. (D&C 131:7-8) Thus, in LDS theology there is no spirit/matter dichotomy. Spirit is matter, though less easily detected by mortal eyes. If a spiritual experience or a \"thought\" from our spirit/mind is to have an effect upon a mortal being, it's not surprising to find detectable physical changes in the gross \"non-spiritual\" matter which we can study. You won't detect the actor (the 'spirit matter'), necessarily, but you might expect to see the effect of the action (on the 'body matter'). Newtonian Determinism A question that is likely to create an argument in any LDS Sunday School class anywhere in the world is, \"Does God perfectly know the future?\" Half the class will insist that he does, because the scriptures are clear: O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it. 2 Nephi 9:20 The other half will insist that this is not possible, since this would destroy the free agency of man, which is also clear: Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves\u2014to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life. 2 Nephi 10:23 But God\u2019s knowledge is not really the question anyway. The real question relative to free will involves the nature of physical and spiritual law \u2014 is it deterministic or indeterministic? The Universe is said to be \"deterministic\" if, given the state of the Universe at one point in time, there is only one state possible at a later point in time. The Newtonian world view was deterministic. It concluded that, given the present positions, velocities, and other properties of every bit of matter, field, and (we would add) spirit, the future values for these variables are completely specified. Thus, the orbits of the planets, the weather, the rise and fall of nations, or the outcome of every love affair is already determined, based on the current state of the universe. It is hard to see how free agency can exist in such an environment. Quantum Uncertainty The alternative to a deterministic Universe is a Universe in which, given the state of the Universe at one point in time, more that one state is possible at a later point in time. We call such a Universe \"indeterministic.\" Since the early 20th century, it has been clear that the fundamental laws of the Universe are quantum mechanical in nature. In quantum mechanics, the present state of the Universe may precisely determine a probability distribution, but, ultimately, the future state of the Universe will involve a random selection from among the allowed possibilities. The future is always partially uncertain. This is the majority view of the interpretation of quantum theory, but it is not the only view. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophystates, The scientific evidence for quantum mechanics is sometimes said to show that determinism is false. Quantum theory is indeed very well confirmed. However, there is nothing approaching a consensus on how to interpret it, on what it shows us with respect to how things are in the world. Indeterministic as well as deterministic interpretations have been developed, but it is far from clear whether any of the existing interpretations is correct. [1] But does quantum mechanics do anything to help the situation relative to free agency? We must remember that quantum mechanics is partly deterministic \u2014 the determination of the probabilities for each possible outcome \u2014 and partly indeterministic \u2014 the final random selection of one state out of all the possibilities. Since the ultimate selection process is random, it is no different than the process of flipping a coin. The quantum world view, with each decision slave to the outcome of a coin toss, seems less conducive to free will than does the deterministic world view. What Is Free Agency? The existence or non-existence of free will has deeply troubled Mormon and non-Mormon philosophers for centuries, and the problem shows no sign of resolving itself. One Mormon philosopher, Blake Ostler, [2] has suggested that there is a third possibility between determinism and indeterminism. This is the \"creative synthesis\" suggested by philosopher and theologian Charles Hartshorne. In this view, the moment of decision itself creates a new entity that did not exist in the previous moment, one that is affected by the decision process and that contributes to the outcome of the decision process in a deterministic but unpredictable way. This, it is suggested, is what we call \"free will.\" On the other hand, a Mormon physicist, Ronald Hellings, [3] has argued that Hartshorne\u2019s description of \"creative synthesis\" sounds suspiciously like a simple non-linear process, a completely deterministic thing that engineers and scientists encounter and solve all the time. In Hellings\u2019 view, free agency should be thought of as the name for the deterministic causes that arise inside an individual\u2019s uncreated intelligence. Determinism is required, according to Hellings, in order to allow those causes to truly make the decision and not have it stolen away at the last moment by a random flip of an electron in someone's brain.

            "answer_text": "Yes. But the very meaning of free-will will differ among the creeds. To Rabbinic Jews, the substance of all things, and their properties, and the laws that regulate and determine their activities, were created by God out of His free will. Indeed, the very act of creation, as told in Genesis, tells us that man was created in God's image; referring to our ability to reason and exercise grammar to communicate...not anthropomorphism. God could have created the Universe in a different way and change the laws that govern it. There is no necessary inherent order in the cosmos. The concept of Nature as a self contained system is profane to Jews...we are free to use our thinking, reasoning, capabilities -- even if some of us are better at it than others. Our free-will is unbounded except by laws that govern peaceful coexistence as we exercise that free-will...but, again, we can choose to obey or transgress those laws. Christians generally, in contrast, harbor an Alexandrian Hellenized belief structure wherein a universe created by God followed Aristotlean design: Aristotle\u2019s deity was deprived of free will, and the logos shattered. For Aristotle, divinity and predictability were concepts that went hand in hand. Just as Aristotle perceived nature, Aristotle\u2019s deity acted through a predictable sequence of causes and effects. God, according to any Greek philosopher, could not have suddenly changed his mind and decided to create a world - or extinguish it. For Aristotle, change was a trait of human beings, not of gods or of nature. Creation of the universe would have implied a change in the divine mind, which could only be a function of intentionality or will, a characteristic Aristotle\u2019s theology did attribute to its deity. Aristotle relied on his astronomical observations to prove that the universe was eternal and that it has coexisted with the eternal-and-devoid-of-free-will deity. This premise led Aristotle and many other philosophers in antiquity to conclude that the cosmos never had a beginning. So, as we can see from the above description, the meaning of free-will depends upon your orientation - do you incline towards an Alexandrian Hellenized version or a Babylonian Hebrew version of free-will...the gravity of that knowledge affects everything you do, and how you engage with others in this world.

            "answer_text": "A chess program thinks for a moment, its algorithms running at inconceivable speeds. Split seconds pass by while it assesses billions of potential moves and counter moves. It finally chooses, and in an instant you realize that you've been crushed again by the computer. This is the shared experience of any chess player who bravely challenges the world's top chess programs. Even the best human players can no longer avoid this experience.  Yet do humans get the last laugh? Does free will put us above such rudimentary processing machines? It seems that way, but logic says otherwise. Choice When you think of free will, inevitably you're brought to the human idea of choice. Yet choice itself proves nothing. The chess playing program chooses every time it decides upon a move. The choices just happen to be the result of a complicated algorithm capable of beating human chess players.  You need to illustrate that you are free to choose to logically illustrate free will. This should be easy you might say. But I promise you, its not only difficult ~ it is logically impossible! Prior Causes No matter how impressive the playing skills of a chess computer, we know that every choice it makes is entirely the result of a prior cause. The program takes a series of data (moves, position, time, theory) and calculates its best move. There is no freedom involved, each decision is entirely chained to the data. Change the inputs, and the choices it makes will change. We can definitively say that any choice that is the result of a prior cause is not the result of freedom - it is the result of that cause. Just like the billiard ball whose motion can be traced back through a series of prior causes, so can each of the moves of a chess playing program provided you can understand its coding.  What about you? How many of the choices you make are the result of prior causes versus free will? Consider how much freedom you had in your choice to think about chess playing programs just now. Or purple monkeys. Both ideas were just imput into your mind because you read these words. These are prior causes, which by definition are void of free will. But take it a step further. What about every preference you have? Did you choose your favorite color or is it an existing preference derived from elements outside of your influence? Though your preferences can change, do you control this? I'f you prefer the color blue, can you genuinely force yourself to prefer the color purple? Any choice you make based on a preference, whether it be something simple like an apple over an orange, or more complex that mixes many preferences like a particular career path - each time these choices are developed entirely on preexisting data that your brain processes. You are capable of choosing, but you are not capable of changing the elements that influence those choices any more than you can change the past or that chess playing programs can alter their inputs. Yet you say, I am free to choose an orange even if I prefer an apple. But what would cause you to choose against your preferences? As soon as you can answer that, you are back to another cause, and in fact just replacing one cause for another. As long as there is a cause, just like with the chess playing program, there can be no free will. Life Experience With every decision, you have a lifetime of experience to rely on. Yet all your wisdom and moral leanings are based on what you've developed up that this point in life. Your values, no matter how they are developed, are mere inputs that influence each decision in the same manner that the chess playing program uses certain principles to decide its best move. You may argue that your moral compass isn't based on any life experience, you were born a certain way, or your soul defines who you are. But what freedom did you have to be born a certain way or with a particular soul? Even if these elements represent the overwhelming source of what influences your choices, you are still not free to choose them at birth any more than you are free to choose your parents or your genetic composition. Illustrative Example Sam Harris offers an astoundingly simple yet profound experiment in his book \"Free Will\" that demonstrates how easy it is to overlook a lack of free will. To paraphrase: There are over 2 million cities around the world. Pick a particular city. Think about the process that just took place in your brain. Were you free to choose any city on the planet? You would have to know the name of every city for that to be even possible. You were therefore not free to choose any city.  But even among those cities that you do know, were you free to choose any of them? Did you consciously review every city you know the name of and rule most of them out? What naturally occurs is a small selection of cities appear in your thoughts, and you chose from among this group.  But what causes this particular list of cities to appear? Perhaps you visited these cities recently, read about them, or saw a picture of one on the wall. Maybe they are places you have lived, saw on television, or heard mentioned in a nearby conversation. What is important to note here is that you have no conscious control over the small selection of cities that popped into your thoughts. The entire selection you had to choose from is the result of prior causes, many of which you might not even be able to explain. Take it a step further. What made you choose the particular city from this small group? Personal preference? Randomness? It had to be something. And whatever it was, it had a cause. If it had a prior cause, its was not free. You can analyze the process of any choice in this manner. It is always either a prior cause, an external factor, complete randomness, or a combination of all three. Yet in none of these areas does logic permit free will Back to Billiards Consider for a moment a game of billiards. A shot is taken that sets multiple balls into motion. If the exact same setup could be reconstructed, and the exact same initial shot taken, the balls would end up in the identical position. The laws of physics do not permit otherwise.  Compare this to the manner in which you define your choices. If you could live your entire life up to this moment the with the exact same set of experiences and circumstances, would you choose a different city in the experiment above or the same one?  If the answer is the same, then you understand how you are entirely locked into your choice by the sum of all your prior experiences and preferences. If the answer is different, then there must be a variable that changed, and this new variable is a new cause. You are thus replacing one cause for another, but still tied to a prior cause. And if you assume your answer could be different because it may be entirely random, then you are still left void of freedom. What is Human Choice? When you follow the logic, choice falls entirely within the confines of one or more of three distinct elements, none of which allow for free will: 1 - the influence of prior causes2 - external influences3 - randomness What part of choice falls outside of any of these? It is difficult to accept, but in any given moment, you have no control over what you will choose next.  Even if you stop reading at this moment and walk away in disgust, this is a choice that is the result of preexisting preferences and  biases that elicit emotions with regard to the topic. You did not consciously choose to like or dislike this any more than you consciously chose to like or dislike a particular food. And if you still don't agree, imagine that you lived your entire life over again up to this very moment. Would you possibly feel any different?

            "answer_text": "Does free will exist? Free will and causality cannot co-exist \u2013 one or the other has to go. You can\u2019t have it both ways: Either everything is caused - in which case we don\u2019t have free will.Or we do have free will \u2013 in which case not everything is caused.The easy option is to stick with causality and deny the existence of free will. But if you deny free will you are negating everything that we value in human existence: love, kindness, generosity, selflessness, altruism, artistic and literary creativity etc. etc. All these become hollow and empty if they are caused, determined and unchosen rather than optional, elective and voluntary. Deny free will and you deny our humanity. What kind of person would that? So how do you argue in favour the existence of free will? If free will is to be preserved, then it is necessary to counter determinism. And that means digging deep until you find a flaw in causality: You must undermine the philosophical assumptions causality is built on! So, what are the philosophical assumptions underpinning causality? There are two possibilities: Causality is an inbuilt aspect of realityCausality is a methodology which we create in order to get a handle on realityIf causality is an inbuilt aspect of reality, then free will is impossible. But if causality is a methodology of our own creation, then free will become possible. If causality is something created by mind, then we have the choice where to apply it where not to apply it. And one area where we should not apply causality is to complex systems. We should not attempt to apply causality to complex systems. Complex systems have feedback loops where an effect is turned back on itself in such a way as to becomes its own cause. Trying to apply causality in these circumstances is pointless, futile and frankly - misguided\u2026 In complex systems it becomes impossible to separate cause from effect When we stop applying causality to complex systems, we have made the first step towards rescuing free will from the clutches of determinism. That is because the factors that influence the choices we make using free will are complex \u2013 so complex that we cannot even start to fathom then. And we shouldn\u2019t even try. Life exists on the cusp between order and chaos. So too does consciousness. And this boundary is never explored more profoundly by consciousness, than when it exercises free will to instigate an action - and in that way to implement its intention\u2026 Life, consciousness and intention operate on the cusp between order and chaos Causality works with simple systems where what is ordered and what is random is clear cut and straightforward. As a methodology, causality breaks down, when you try to apply it to the cusp between order and chaos - where cause and effect become indistinguishable and identical. Life and Free Will are complex systems where causality falls apart\u2026 ________________________________________________________________________ Links to my related Quora answers: Time and space are artefacts of mind Fundamental Philosophical assumptions Questions Science can\u2019t answer Determinism and the biosphere Free will and Humanity ",

            "answer_text": "Question at time of answering: Does free will exist? Normally I like to give a short yes/no answer, followed by a longer explanation. I am not going to this time because this is one of those questions where having weird ideas about the right answer can lead one to being more wrong than if one maintained an intuitive belief in the wrong answer. Google definition of \u201cFree Will\u201d: the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion. I\u2019ll use this definition for the rest of my answer because it seems to match the common usage of the phrase reasonably well. I won\u2019t make much mention of the bit about fate, though, because while fate has historically been the primary opponent to free will, I believe it has fallen out of fashion in modern academic discourse. If one wants to clarify the concept of free will, the key word is \u201cnecessity\u201d. Any actions or decisions made by necessity are outside of outside of the domain of free will, the others have the potential to be within it. Now, there are other constraints, unconscious actions for example tend not to be described as acts of free will, but this is more of a filter then an all-encompassing barrier and therefore of less relevance to the question of whether free will exists at all. Necessity can mean a lot of things in this context, but there are two meanings I would like to focus on. The first is apparent, non-absolute necessity. For example, if someone holds a gun to my head and tells me to do something, it\u2019s necessary that I comply with their demand. Yes, theoretically I could disobey, but it would not be unreasonable for me to defend my actions later by saying \u201cI had no choice!\u201d I mention this kind of necessity first because it is the sort that actually affects people on a day-to-day basis (though hopefully in less extreme forms than my example). This kind of obvious and binding necessity, or the lack thereof, is the sort that affects the morality of actions, and determines how \u201cfree\u201d people feel. The second is theoretical necessity. If an effect is entirely the result of its causes, then it was necessary in this sense of the word. One does not have to know what the causes were, only to know that they exist. One typically thinks of causes as deterministic, that is, if causes A and B occur, then effect C occurs with 100% certainty. But since we are speaking of necessity in the context of what free will is not, we can include randomness in our understanding of causality, because random acts are not thought of as being \u201cchosen\u201d. Also, probabilism, which is what you get when you mix determinism with randomness (for example, if causes A and B occur, then there is a 75% C will happen and a 25% chance D will happen), can also be included, for the same reason that weighted dice are not considered free agents. Free will, when discussed on an intellectual level, tends to be that which lies outside the domain of what I have described as theoretical necessity. Free Will, in this form, not only does not exist, but is self-contradictory to the point of meaninglessness\u2014it could not possibly exist, even in principle. When people speak more generally (and less precisely) about \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cchoice\u201d, they tend to be referring to some form of the kind that is opposed to the apparent, non-absolute necessity I described earlier. This kind of freedom absolutely exists. This distinction between different meanings of necessity seems to be the basis of compatibilism and, more importantly, the conflation of the two meanings is I suspect the reason why people get so defensive when faced with the prospect of \u201cfree will\u201d not existing, as the obvious and rather boring truism that effects have causes\u2014deterministic, random, or probabilistic\u2014gets morphed into the feeling that the laws of physics have put a gun to one\u2019s head and are demanding obedience.

            "answer_text": "Free will? I think that's something to do with being able to make decisions disregarding any outside influence, i.e., you can eat a green apple not because it's the only apple there or that it's green, but rather because you want to for the sake of wanting to and without much of any other reason. Free will in itself doesn't make much sense, but I think we all know what it is. Perhaps the difficulty lies with articulation. Maybe it's just my own inability, but that's irrelevant. Now that I've at least somewhat given my own personal definition to it, let me divulge into the logic and possibility of it. I believe most of what we see as free will is a lack of understanding our own minds, how they work, and having a lack of skepticism in our actions for more or less narcissistic reasons. Why do you do what you do? Why do you act in some ways instead of others? Why are you reading this? Well, I think I can answer the third for you. Curiousity, right? Maybe it's just because you're bored? But then again, why specifically this? Probably a combination of the two. More likely because of a whole bunch of outside influence that neither you or I can name off of the top of our heads. To list the major ones tho, I'd say nature and nurture. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the nature v. nurture argument, it essentially entails how our personalities came to be. Nature being genes, genetics, chromosomes, etc. Nurture being our environment, how we were raised, our friends, etc. Personally, I think it's a combination of the two that makes us who we are. But what does all of that have to do with free will? It has everything to do with it. It is it. They are equal. Free will in the end is the miscomprehendtion of these two arguments. You didn't really eat that apple because you just wanted to. You ate it because you were hungry and it was most accessible at the time, or that you were just in the mood for an apple for one reason or another. You never do anything without a reason to do it. That reason either being genes or you're environment. Free will is just simply logically impossible. Not to bash anyone too much, but you know what group of people cite this \u201cfree will\u201dmost often? Christians. They do it as a way of blaming you for your own actions. It's a lie. Everything you do is not because you chose to. You have no control over anything you do. For example, a murderer isn't sent to jail, or rather shouldn't be anyways, because he \u201cchose\u201d to kill that person. Instead, he is sent there so he can't do it again. You can't blame people for what they do because they didn't actually have control over it. The other thing is that most people might look at this and think \u201cwell sure, I make my decisions based on what I can gain from them, but I still have the physical ability to do other things\u201d. Thats true, you do have the physical ability to do other things. But guess what? You never will do those things because it would go against your very nature. So again, you can but you just never will. If you killed a person, you were going to no matter what, not including future possibilities. If you dont, you never would, at least in that specific case. I know that sounds like a really convenient argument, but that really is how it works. In my opinion, true and absolute free will would be totally and completely \u201crandom\u201d, or at least unpredictable, and thusly, logically impossible. In the end, our free will really is just the illusion of choice. Nothing else. ",

Do you always choose cheesecake? That\u2019s not because you don't have a choice. It\u2019s because you make bad ones. Learned behavior (\"Cheesecake gives me gas\") and cognition (\"Cheese cake is bad for me\") are part of the deal. You learn from your mistakes. You can correct them. PARADOX OF OMNIPOTENCE What if I was omniscient and could always see the results of my actions no matter how far in the future? If I was omniscient, deciding would be a meaningless act. I'd be trapped by future knowledge. All decisions would be moot. Theologians say free will is God's gift - it's so we can make good choices. To me, that doesn\u2019t make sense. God's the one with free will issues, not us. Being omniscient \"screws the pooch\" where free will\u2019s concerned.

            "answer_text": "Think about this: You can pick up a pen and drop it at any time. But the question is WILL you? Then as yourself: Why will you drop a pen?  In order to drop the pen, you have to want to prove you can drop a pen more than you want to conserve the energy required to pick up the pen. Why do you jump when somebody scares you?  Your fight or flight response is activated and your adrenaline spikes. In that moment, your reflexes detected a possible threat, which caused you to jump. In that moment, without realising it, because of your learned beliefs combined with your animal instincts, you unconsciously wanted to avoid a potential threat more than you wanted to risk being victim to it. Why does a smoker quit smoking?  Smoking is incredibly addictive due to the nicotine it puts into your bloodstream. In order for a smoker to quit smoking and unlearn the positive feedback loops created by the drug and the brain\u2019s subconscious reaction to it, they have to want to stop smoking more than they want to smoke. They have to want to live longer and have improved mental health more than they want the short-term gratification of the cig. Why does a person leave a cult?  People leave cults often because they realise their cult wasn\u2019t achieving what they thought it was. The perceived end result and the fantasy they lived in was no longer more desirable than the effort they put into supporting the cult. They no longer wanted what they thought the cult ultimately did more than they wanted the devotion and self-sacrifice that went into it. Now think about why a person does a selfless act:  In order for them to commit the act, they have to want the perceived end result more than they want alternatives and the price they put into it. In the moment that the act is committed, they have to have the perceived cause within their set of interests. Selfless people have the wants and/or needs of the many in their own interests. People who donate to charity have, in some small way, the interests of the people they think they are helping, whether it is true or false. People are the products of past stimuli. Every thought you have, no matter how creative, was derived from stimuli in some way. Trace every belief, no matter how rational or irrational, back and it will be caused by nature or evolution in some way. We receive stimulation from sights, sounds, other ideas from other people, ideas we make for ourselves- they are all derived from past stimuli. We like different colours because we learned to associate them with different ideas. If you choose to see it from another perspective, you can only choose to do that because you have learned that doing so might be a good idea. You have learned to feel rewarded by it. You can choose to try and improve yourself, but that requires a motivation- a first \u201cknock\u201d that gives you an idea. If you motivate yourself to do something, it\u2019s only because you have learned in the past to be able to motivate yourself. If you choose to learn things now, it\u2019s only because you have learned that learning is good. No. Free will does not exist. No matter what happens, every second of every day, and every action or thought, no matter how good or terrible, rational or irrational, good or bad, you are a slave to your own wants and past stimuli. Everything human is ironically a product of evolution. In order to do anything, you have to WANT to do something more than you want to not do it at the moment you choose to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "As Greg Klebanoff wrote, \"You have asked one of the most important and profound of all philosophical questions.\" Society cannot survive unless it establishes rules with the expectation that because of the fear of punishment and the hope for reward the individual will make the choice to follow them. Everything in the physical world is determined by a succession of causes and their effects. Determinists point to fMRI studies demonstrating that a behavior is always initiated before one becomes aware of it, if at all, and therefore consciously asserting one\u2019s will cannot be possible. If the power of one\u2019s will could change causality, determination could not consistently exist. The concept of Compatibilism, that though we are in a determined universe free will also exists, championed by the ancient stoics and medieval scholastics such as Thomas Aquinas is rejected by both Determinists and believers in free will as a feeble excuse to avoid the attempt to resolve the issue. However, one answer to the philosophical question what is time may make Compatibilism possible. Many regard time as including past, present and future; events occurred in the past, occur in the present and will occur in the future. Existence of events in the physical reality, however, is limited to those occurring now. Those that had occurred or may occur exist in a mental reality as recollections or envisioned possibilities. The majority of the brain is dedicated to non-conscious functions. Behavior is unconsciously initiated by experiences arising from stimuli from the external and internal physical environment coupled with the experiences of conscious memory and imagination. Reflecting upon the consequences of prior actions and visualizing alternatives with the potential for more desirable results, one may alter their unconscious choices in the future. Free will exists within one\u2019s mental reality. ",

            "answer_text": "We don't know yet. All of science is a way of making sense of things. As long as a theory makes logical sense and has thus far remained un-disproven, it is fair to accept it as a sufficiently accurate representation of reality.  By wrongly assuming that theories that seem to hold true at the moment will always hold true, we would be supporting a deterministic view of the universe. By saying that our understanding of the universe is absolute and that it isn't just one of the many ways reality can be more clearly perceived, we are saying that the universe is indeed, governed by a set of knowable rules, and that we have found some of those rules. Anything we can't explain, and as a result not predict or determine, scientists attribute to the gaps in our knowledge, and mystics attribute to an unknowable force that controls the universe. This unknowable force, that acts on it's own and is influenced by nothing else, is a superset of what you call Free Will, the possibility of a priori. The idea that not everything is cause and effect, and that something needs to have started it all. One way to understand this is to attribute this to divinity, and to say that God created the Universe. The more rational response would be to acknowledge that we don't really know yet. You can never know that a particular theory is absolute truth, because you can never know what new contradictory evidence we might discover tomorrow. Similarly, you can never know (with absolute certainty) that the universe is deterministic, because we will possibly never reach a state where we have found everything there is to be found and are able to define rules that explain all of them. A lot of important technology of today works on probabilistic models rather than on robust deterministic systems. Communication Technology is one example. The pursuit of knowledge is just that. A pursuit. It's like striving for perfection. You try to get as close as you can, and that ensures quality in your work, but you can't really ever expect to get there.  Whether free will exists or not is something we can not yet say with certainty, but what you can say, is that belief in the existence of free will is a necessary tool for human progress, and for enabling human morality. Centuries ago, people had built whole schools of thought around ideas that have been disproven since then. Knowledge is not absolute. What is important is the accuracy of these ideas within the scope of their application. When they were believed, the ideas were a sufficient representation of reality. They worked, and they were accepted. Free will, (like God), may or may not exist, but the idea of free will, (like the idea of god, for some people) is foundational to the functioning of the modern world. ",

            "answer_text": "Free will is an illusion. But here's what is extraordinary: think and be convinced of this is a step towards genuine free will. There is a way to reconcile deterministic and non-deterministic. It is a theory showing that the universe is self-organized in such a way that it produces an increasing diversity at every level of organization.Our mind occupies a significant number of these levels, from biology to self-awareness. Each floor creates additional independence by establishing a representation of the underlying floor. With a pyramidal mind, we manufacture concepts increasingly complex. Thus we move from the physical to the mental. At higher levels of the psyche, the stack continues. Our awareness of the world is led by self-awareness, of how we behave. An additional level is to observe ourselves within the society to see the anchors of our personality. Another floor and we draw a representation of the interactive humanity. Nothing says where self-organization goes. There is a physical limit related to the capacity of the brain to continue by ourselves. But our minds are capable of designing intelligences without such limitations. We can give free rein to our imagination. Free will as we see it in the ideal is a bit silly fantasy because no element of decision arises from nothingness. The factors of each act can be disassembled finely going down levels of self-organization. Even those believing in a \"soul\", unique identity support, should ask where it comes from and why this particular model has been awarded us. The problem is only moved.The only attitude that can seem to the ideal of free will is to give exposure to the hazard: making his choice coin. But here we are no longer the owner of a \"free will\" as the referee has become the World to whom we entrust the choice of the result. Free will is a nonsense, and yet we are building something that comes close gradually. Self-organization is an asymptote to the free will.It produces a diversity making the prediction efforts increasingly obsolete. This gives reason to anti-deterministic. Simultaneously, when looking back the way of self-organization, it is deterministic. This is not a contradiction. This forces us to revise the definition of Time. But your wonderful brains do not they burn at this time too? I bring mine back to the kennel. Time to feed it... ",

A. Rehl's answer to How is free will in humans logically justified?\u2026also check comments sections under these answers.  Screenshot of one of the 'motivating' comments:  \u2026here follows my full reply on above comment:  Free-will doesn't mean there is freedom in everything. I enjoy exchanging thoughts with you, that's my choice. I could as well hate what you say because I think it's wrong ;) Anyway, have you please read what B. A. Rehl says on free-will? He says it so well with very few words. I'd love to hear your view on what he says. \u2026 There is something I like doing in the morning which I don't think many people can do. On the weekends I like to sleep in, till 10 in the morning because over the working days I sleep just 5 hours on average. My wife and young daughter wake up earlier and they talk aloud. When I catch their words they pull my attention sometimes which prevents me to keep sleeping. I learned to ignore the meaning of their words. I still hear voices but they are just meaningless sounds for I freely chose to disable my brains to process meaning of words. It's similar like if they talked in Chinese language which I have no clue about. Also, when I drive on the round with my wife, and with others too, I notice how quickly they get angry if someone on the road drives strangely\u2026 I almost never chose to get angry over that. Oh yes, I could, freely. Perhaps not every human being has the same degree of freedom in their \"thoughts\". I put thoughts in parenthesis because it's not even thoughts but more like mind or say consciousness. As mentioned in previous example I can freely disable my thoughts. Also, freedom, as in your example, doesn't work like that. Body has certain needs and reactions. It would be stupid to forcefully go against that. I loved sweets just last year, and this year I don't like them anymore, including the ice cream which is (was) my favorite in summer time. Now, since I am mentioning this, I remember I was thinking to myself that I eat too many sweets\u2026 So, it seems, I did consciously chose, on the long run, to dislike the taste of chocolate ice cream. \u2026. If you studied free-will a lot I am sorry to tell you that most philosophers who say free-will doesn't exist are wrong. Again, we have a scientist among us, right here at Quora, who is researching consciousness daily, for many years, and who wrote up to about 85% of his new cognition theory which will be the foundation to build the first conscious machine. Many tried and failed, while wasting billions of dollars, but we now have the first human being which is showing some real promise. Why don't you read what he has to say about it, instead trusting people who are just (more or less) guessing about free-will? BTW, if there is a glass of water in front of me, and if I reach for it, surely I see no problem if that can be measured before I do it. Neuroscientists would detect process of my brains which is not conscious. And most processes of the brain don't demand conscious thought. But put me in that experiment and I bet you I will confuse them like hell. I sometime like to play with my mind and I can think like I will move my hand to the right and I chose, without putting that will into words, to move it to the left. If you have friends who deal with such experiments you can let them know to invite me and find out that they were wrong in thinking they can predict what a conscious human being can do. ;-) All humans have free-will. It's just that some are able to deploy it better than others.  I\u2019d also like to add, that main feature of free-will is not to freely chose how we feel in particular situatuons, but how we make choices when we work with limited amount of data and face new experiences. What computers surely cannot do is complex abstract thinking, especially in new situations. Humans excel at that, thanks to consciousness and free-will.  I will also collect elaborate answers of opposite view, ones which say free-will doesn\u2019t exist. Here we go: Derek Phillips's answer to How is free will in humans logically justified?Martin Millen's answer to Does free will exist?",

Too many of our practices and beliefs presuppose a basic and important difference between acting freely and not acting freely.

Thoroughly integrated into one\u2019s belief systems, the denial of free will would create a double-bind strong enough to drive one insane, for it would institute a rift between how one thinks about human action and how one must think of oneself and others if one is to function normally as a human being. For me to believe, for example, that the composition of this text \u2014 my choosing of these words rather than some others \u2014 is itself a fact explainable by factors beyond my control would effectively make my writing of them absurd, would indeed undermine the very conception of myself essential to continuing with this act. (It is no accident that the sense of having ones actions controlled by forces beyond oneself is a common delusion of schizophrenics.) One simply cannot see oneself as a marionette and go on with life as normal. To stop believing in our capacity for free will is, in essence, to stop believing in ourselves.  2. What makes belief in free will a problem is that none of the extant conceptions of free will holds water. The most straightforward and natural way to think of it is as the ability for one to act or not to act with respect to some option, and for that ability itself to be free from any necessitation. Taken together, these conditions describe exactly what acting freely feels like: I can do this or that, and nothing outside myself makes me do one or the other. On this view, the crucial matter for determining whether an action is free is what explains why one did this rather than that. The answer to that question cannot appeal to anything that is not also ultimately under the person\u2019s control: one must be free all the way down. Importantly, there can be no final explanation of why one did this rather than that other than to say simply that one did it. Any further explanation would presumably appeal to something not under the agent\u2019s control, and that just won\u2019t do. But this creates a problem. The only acceptable explanation, according to this straightforward and natural way of thinking of free will, is not really an explanation at all. It does not in fact tell us why one did this rather than that. To say that an action is entirely unexplainable in this way is like saying that it is random. If there are no further factors making it more or less likely that one outcome or the other would result, then from the outside observer\u2019s view, it is effectively like a toss of the dice. But whatever we might mean by freedom, we certainly do not mean anything like that. As with an action that is necessitated, this type of free action seems to be something not properly under the agent\u2019s control. The free actions we care about are not random or in any way arbitrary but presumably directly related to the nature of the person in question. That\u2019s what it means to say that they did it. So, this very natural understanding of free will seems to require something impossible: the ability to choose in a way that is both meaningfully tied to one\u2019s nature and yet which is also open-ended at the most basic level. Human freedom, thus conceived, requires both roots deep in the earth and the gift of flight, a grounding in nature and an absolute freedom from constraint. It presumes us to be, at our motivational core, much like flying trees, and, like flying trees, an impossibility. 3. In light of the apparent failure of the intuitive conception of freedom, many philosophers \u2014 called \u201cCompatibilists\u201d because they think free will is logically compatible with necessitation \u2014 try to explain freedom in a way that doesn\u2019t require such open-endedness. They say that freedom is just a matter of doing what one wants, or decides, or wills \u2014 or any other number of theories that interpret freedom as being something that is primarily psychological in nature and which does not entail the metaphysical indeterminacy that the first concept of freedom implies. Sometimes they jazz this up to give it the appearance of open-endedness, saying things like \u201cinstead of doing this, one could have done that, if one had so willed,\u201d but of course this just pushes the problem back to the new condition. One wants to ask: okay, so could one have so willed? And so on. At any rate, none of the Compatibilist theories work, for it can always be shown that the seat of a person\u2019s freewill so-called \u2014 their desire, decision, will, etc. \u2014 is dissoluble in the larger nexus of causes, and therefore explainable in terms of factors not under their control. In other words, all such factors can be shown to be the consequences of factors that are beyond the agent\u2019s control. (This point was made with ruthless logical clarity in Peter Van Inwagen\u2019s An Essay on Free Will.) The Compatibilist conception of freedom is too superficial, too subjective in nature, a matter of appearance rather than reality. At best, it provides an account of the persistence of the illusion of freedom. This is fine as an explanation of how the naive may proceed, but it poses a terrible problem for the Compatibilist philosopher. The philosopher understands that what seems true to him and other human beings \u2014 that one is ultimately in control of whether one does this or that \u2014 is actually not true. That is a remarkable admission, and it would take the cleverness, self-deceptive skill, and overall jadedness (\u201cmetaphysical insouciance,\u201d as I once heard a prominent Compatibilist philosopher describe it) of a hardened academic to avoid feeling the gravity of it. 4. To summarize: On the one hand, free will can be interpreted as a sort of detachment from the world of causes and effects that allows maximum movement but precludes meaningful engagement. It makes free will effectively random. On the other hand, free will can be defined in a largely subjective way, an illusion of autonomy entirely consistent with absorption in the world of causes and effects, an ersatz \u201cfreedom\u201d that precludes truly spontaneous and sovereign action. So, either we are alienated from the causal order of the world or we are absorbed by it. Any way you slice it, we get nothing adequate to our lived experience of freedom, nothing that makes sense of what we must assume, on pains of insanity, about ourselves. The problem of free will is one of the most persistent, complex, and confusing problems in the history of philosophy. Its solution, if one should be forthcoming, will only be found in a very deep re-conceptualization of the causal order of things as well as of ourselves. Or it could be that in this venerable puzzle of philosophy, indeed in the very fact of free will, one faces what is rightly called a mystery: something now and forever beyond our intellectual ken. This last option will undoubtedly make some of us descendants of the Enlightenment very uncomfortable. But wouldn\u2019t it be surprising if there were no such things in life? What leads us to think that human intelligence, evolved for the purposes of survival and reproduction, should be adequate to comprehend all manner of things? And if there were a place where human understanding runs up against its limits, wouldn\u2019t the nature of free will be an ideal candidate?  ",

            "answer_text": "Scientifically, most likely no, free will as we understand it, does not seem to exist. This is somewhat like Stephen Hawkings\u2019 statement of God, we do not see scientifically how or where can it exist. Philosophically and politically though, it has a very important implication \u2014 can we deny (or replace) free will with any more scientifically accurate or verifiable definition or description? No. Which means free will, although we somewhat know does not exist literally, is still (one of) the best metaphors for something that we can\u2019t describe better - the individual cognitive identity - how we cognitively differentiate one individual from another? We may one day find a better, more accurate description of it, but before that, free will is our best effort in trying to allow individual minds to process information with minimum external manipulation. Philosophically, this also means equality \u2014 with free mind, comes the freedom of pursuing things each individual wants, and responsibility associated with it. Before we go down the path of having \u201cME\u201d determine what each one of your mind is thinking, and distribute resources accordingly, there might be a debate about why \u201cMY\u201d mind is allowed to determine everyone of yours thoughts? Before we can find a scientific reason, free will is our best tool to restrain our own urge of intervene in other people\u2019s thoughts (hence ensure some level of equality in the society). ",

            "answer_text": "Not only is there room for free will in a deterministic universe, free will is an essential component for surviving and evolving in one. It is an essential component of consciousness, which is an essential component of life. Free will is a feeling that we all experience. There is no denying of experience. There is only deciphering the nature of it. Free will is not the illusion. In its conflict with determinism lies the illusion. Free will is the product of not knowing, and of the unknowable. Both are plausible and frequent even in a deterministic universe. Nothing has to be random. There just has to be unknowns. At this point whether the universe is deterministic becomes trivial because it does not help any immediate cause for any subject indulging in its free will. The conflict between determinism and free will evaporate when knowledge and circumstances are placed in any naturally occurring order. The conflict of free will only occurs when this order is tampered with or ignored, as many thought experiments do. The illusion of free will is inherited from the illusion of these experiments. With proper experiments, we can obtain concrete free will even within a deterministic universe, as with the following example from Ron Maimon:  For example, let's take \"free will\". Looks like a difficult question, doesn't it? So let's define free will in terms of sense impressions. I notice I can move my hand. Big deal. Ok, there are atoms and let's say they are deterministic. Does this contradict me moving my hand? No. But if someone knows all the position, he can tell me whether I will move my hand or not without consulting me. Doesn't this contradict free will? No more than me saying \"Jack Nicholson is going to get out of bed tommorrow.\" It's true, but that doesn't mean Jack Nicholson is being manipulated by me, or somehow \"isn't free\". The issue is that it seems I don't have any choice in lifting my hand. But how would you demonstrate this to me? You could come in and say \"computer calculated your hand, and said you are going to lift it ... now!\" But then, by talking to me, you are shaking air atoms, thereby ruining the computer's prediction. When I head what you say, I keep my hand down and say \"sorry, computer was wrong.\" So you can spite any prediction when you know about it, and this is consistent with atoms behaving deterministically, and if you don't know about the prediction, it's not much of a challenge to your free will. So the free will question is solved, there is no question, it's just an illusion in the mind that there ever was a conflict between free will and determinism, people were just stupid. What Ron illustrates is the inherent positivism in nature and in our existence (the above is an excerpt from his answer: Ron Maimon's answer to What is logical positivism? What are some of the inherent flaws within its schema?). With positivism, there are no contradictions. To add, consider what randomness is. Randomness emerges when we lack information. Random = Unable to predict. This happens easily with a lack of information, and if there is anything we lack, it is information. Free will is the experience of being faced with decisions and being provided with options. To this end, you must be something that needs to make decisions to experience it. The weather does not experience free will. We can feel it because we cannot predict what anything alive will do in the next moment. We cannot even predict our own actions for the most part. But this feeling of not knowing and the world being unpredictable is what is important! What would you do without it? What would you do if \"what would you do\" was never a choice? Nature has answered this question for us, and free will is its answer.  Free will gave the universe life, and it is, without question, why we feel alive. Do you feel alive? Free will is the solution to not knowing. It's nature's way of compensating for our inability to predict our actions and the actions of others. Questions regarding determinism are always framed with the premise that we know everything. We are free to keep hoping this will one day become possible, but even in a world where it is, there will be plenty of people and circumstances in which this information will not be available. One such circumstance is how we view and experience the world as living human beings. The premise of our existence is lack of information. We are biologically designed to obtain information and figure out how to survive, given our lack of initial information. What are senses? What is our brain? What is our body for? We are a machine designed to cope with the unknown, to gather knowledge, and to work within the boundaries of our existence with the goal to survive. So to put ourselves in a situation where the premise is we know absolutely everything is a leap of epic proportions. We would break before it made sense. If anything, it would be impossible to be deterministic and human at the same time. And herein specifically lies the conflict, and the illusion. Finally, the above interpretation of free will fits nicely with the computational universe paradigm also. A program cannot predict the outcome of its own execution without actually executing its code. The code is determined, and the outcome is also. However, the outcome cannot be obtained without execution, which is never free. Execution costs energy and time. The problem isn't whether any outcome is predetermined or not. The problem is whether we can predict its outcome without paying for execution. And here we have room for free will.  Free will isn't a force that contradicts determinism. It is a force that complements it, in circumstances where execution must precede outcome. Free will is a program guessing what could happen if resources were spent executing code before having to execute it. A program can only execute its own code. The same applies for humans. We can only execute our own code. The next leap in our understanding of ourselves will be in the deciphering of this code, which is completely obtainable. We are open source, and all we need are the tools to read our code. However, even then, the outcome of that code will not be obtainable until it is executed. And this is precisely why we will always have room for free will. And if free will is a must, we can work backwards and see that actually we do not need to know everything once we have free will. We don't even need to know or understand our code. Free will makes up for all of it, and rewards us with a sense of freedom and being alive. That makes free will an amazing piece of code, if it is in fact a program, which it would be under the terms of the computational universe. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, we really have free will. Please let me offer some definitions: By \u201cfree will\u201d, I mean one\u2019s ability to cause things that one likes and to prevent things that one dislikes. By \u201creally\u201d, I mean that such ability exists to some degree. There is not a total absence of such ability. By \u201cwe\u201d \u2014 and this is the crux of the whole explanation \u2014 I mean a complex entity with two main aspects. (1) We are part of a fabric of causes-and-effects. We arise from causes that produce us as effects, and in turn we are causes that produce effects. (2) We are sentient. We experience phenomena. We make some sense of our experience with our intelligence. We suffer and enjoy. Now, the degree to which we have free will is the degree to which those two aspects overlap. If there is little overlap, if the events we experience have little to do with the events we cause, then we have little free will. We suffer the kind of world that Emerson described: \u201cEvents are in the saddle, and ride mankind.\u201d In contrast, if there is much overlap, if we cause the events that we suffer and enjoy, then we have much free will. Certainly, behavior and subjective experience have a physical basis in the chemistry and biology of the brain. However, that does not answer the question of whether we have free will. Rather, it identifies a place to investigate the question. As a crude simile, we can say that the neural signals in the brain are like billiard balls colliding and careening in ways conditioned by physical laws. An obvious next question is: What were the preceding events that kicked off those movements? At the billiards table, there are moments of intention, when a player aims and strokes a cue stick. In the brain, why does the neural signalling follow certain patterns, and why do the patterns change? It seems to me that the brain has moments of intention, too, and that the intentions, themselves, have an impact on the brain. May I suggest a Zen story? 2.

            "answer_text": "According to the wisdom of Kabbalah, we are chained not only by biological genes, but there is a program running through us, which we are parts of, not only in this lifetime, but throughout a long and consistent chain of Reshimot (\u201crecords\u201d or \u201creminiscences\u201d) that are embedded in the mind, the heart and the soul. This programming of Reshimot is what determines our lives. In this case, if we exist inside a program that has been predetermined, where is our freedom and independence? We can become free and independent to the extent that we rise about our nature, which is an egoistic desire (i.e. a desire to enjoy for self-benefit alone). Everything in nature, including our own human nature, is predetermined, and so in order to attain real and absolute freedom, we need to activate a special mechanism to open the door of the \u201ccage\u201d of our corporeal world, into a spiritual, eternal and free world. We can conclude from life experience and history that freedom is a concept that we strive toward and fight for. Our lives are full of struggles for bits of fictitious freedom that society presents us with. We try to be as it would have us be, and we are prepared to fill up our lives with empty acts, just to get some appreciation and respect. At first, we fight for freedom from the burdens of parents and the family. We try to escape circumstances that were forced on us, and the duties that make our lives difficult. We invest a great deal of effort just to attain this fake freedom. But in order to attain genuine freedom\u2014freedom from our nature, where everything is predetermined\u2014we have to apply efforts. Such freedom can be attained not in the afterlife, as religions promise us, but here in the corporeal world, in this very life. However, in order to realize this freedom, we need to put in efforts to rise above our nature, above our world. What does \u201cabove our world\u201d mean? It means that we acquire spiritual attributes, beyond the five senses (sight, smell, touch, hearing, taste) that we perceive our world with. How, then, is it possible to rise above our world and acquire the spiritual attributes? It is possible through the choice of an environment that guides such progress. Parents change their location, or change an address on their ID in order to select the place where their children will learn by themselves, and the kind of education that they want for them. They try and create for their children such an environment that they believe will guarantee their positive development, and they are absolutely right in doing so. They naturally understand that when they are under the influence of a certain environment, there is no freedom of choice, and so they will try to act in the one place where they can make a difference, the freedom to choose the environment that would influence them. Many philosophers tried to analyze and measure the influence of the environment on people\u2019s personalities. On the basis of research and experiments that were made, and also through their own intuition, they realized how powerful such influence was. The wisdom of Kabbalah provides a full analysis of the influence of the environment on us. Its conclusions are unequivocal: a person is completely dependent on his environment, willingly or unwillingly. It is thus important to understand how to build such an environment, and what we need it for.  ",

            "answer_text": "Few notes / supplements to previous answers: 1. Like Shan Kothari noted, Whether free will exists or not depends on the definition. If to act freely means to act without coercion or compulsion, and that the person is the source of the action, then free will is quite easy to demonstrate. If, however, by free will you mean a deeper kind of self autonomy then it might be more difficult to demonstrate. Another thing is our concept of the \"I\" who acts freely, that might influence our answer to the question. 2. Quantum Mechanics does not strictly contradict determinism. It depends on interpretation. 3. Indeterminism does not necessarily mean that free will exists. Some problems remain. For example, the problem of differentiating humans and sunflowers with regards to free will and autonomy: If events in the world are determined only probabilistically, both the sunflower's angle of turning towards the sun and human action are probabilistic in nature, or not fully determined. So whats to make the human action free and the sunflower action not free? We would need some kind of mechanism or \"deus ex machina\" that will enable us to be the ones who choose between the different probabilities. Furthermore, if the world is random and not even probabilistic, free will is even less probable because in that case our actions would be hardly different than a coin toss. 4. There are philosophers who claim that free will cannot exist whether the world is deterministic or not, because the idea itself is impossible. One of them is Galen Strawson who proposes this argument to support this view (in terms of moral responsibility):(a) In order to be morally responsible, one has to be the cause of one's action.(b) but we act because of the way we are and, (c) we are not the cause of the way we are, or, in other words - one does not control the way he is. (d) You might say that some people can control or cause the way they are, but (e) even if this is true, they could only control the way they are in virtue of the way they were previously to that. (f) And if they could choose the way they were previously, it could have only been done in virtue of the way they were before that. (g) And so on, in an infinite regress. When you think about it goes eventually to one's childhood or infancy, times where one can obviously not choose the way he is. (h) Hence free will (in the broad, libertarian sense) and moral responsibility are not possible.(This argument appears in: Galen Strawson,The Impossibility of Moral Responsibility, 1993. If there is interest, I can post a more detailed version of it). ",

            "answer_text": "I will refer to some of the key arguments mentioned by others. I will be very happy to discuss this topic further. Also, thank you for the great input. Shan Kothari (SK) says, \"It is possible, but hard to see how.\"  1. SK, \"If the universe is deterministic, then we obviously don't have free will, because we can't have chosen otherwise.\"  The universe could be deterministic, but that would not imply that we don't have a free will. The history of the universe (the so-called \"past\" and \"future\") could be written in the Book and we could be given the responsibility to influence the system (for some disguised reasons given how limited we are), i.e. make decisions, but - for some deeper reasons - our decisions could always be the same ones as those in the Book.  2. SK, \"If the universe is not deterministic, then it is random. If our decisions are random, they're not freely willed.\" If a link between two elements of a chain does not exist for us (someone),  it just leaves (from our perspective) an empty space that is \"somehow\" filled, not randomness. Randomness means that this empty space could be filled with all possible values with the same probability and we use it for modeling purposes (since it may explain variance behind the data quite well). Just because something does not exist for me or you, it may exist for some other reference frames. Hence, determinism and randomness do not necessarily exhaust all possibilities.  Glyn Williams (GW), \"We are, for want of a better description, engines that make decisions. So it's not surprising we take responsibility for those decisions. This ownership over our own actions creates the illusion of free will. And very satisfying it is too. But all our choices, deeds and actions are the result of some prior causes: Memories, genetic-predispositions, character defects, accidents, lusts, goals - momentary neurochemical flickerings or just random quantum interactions.  In other words, just atoms doing physics.  No will. No freedom.\" Indeed, all actions need to be considered together with the rest of the universe (the Monty Hall problem and books on machine learning teach you about priors). Still, decisions could not be \"ours\" in first place given what we think about us as humans (we are built out of particles, have creatures inside us, understand very little about our brains, what makes decisions?).  We would need to define what identity is and accept that we cannot be considered without our history (and likely our future, too). So, the fact that our decisions depend on some prior causes does not necessarily imply that free will does not exist.  SK, \"In short, we don't really know whether free will does or does not exist. It's premature to go either way.\" I agree. Machines are gonna help us with the learning :) ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways to answer this:1. The universe may be deterministic, but it is so computationally difficult to predict what a human might do that the only way to determine this is by simulating the human. Then we have in effect free will because we cannot in any meaningful sense predict what a human can do. We can only watch and observe what they (or an simulation of this human) can do. 2. The currently accepted definition of free will is wrong. I personally do not believe in the concept of free will as an absolute. I believe that free will is relative to an observer. For example, an omniscience god would look at a human and conclude a human has no free will because the omniscience god knows everything, including what they will do. On the other hand, a human would not consider a mouse to have have free will because we can put the mouse in a particular situation and predict what they will do. In the middle is a human observing a second human. Since they cannot predict what the human will do, the other human has free will as seen form a human observer. If you think of free will as a relative quality, not absolute, then all us humans have free will as seen from the position of our fellow humans. ",

            "answer_text": "The original question is: Does free will exist? Answer: Both the determinism and free-will co-exist. \u201cLife is like a game of cards. The hand you're dealt, is determinism; the way you play it, is free-will\u201d Your personality, physical and mental, you are born with, and the environment, your familial, cultural and financial, you are born into, make up your fate. This is your initial deposit in the account of your life. A person is defined by the choices he makes on a day-to-day basis and by the actions he takes in response to the stimuli of the world around him. Essentially, an individual is determined by the degree to which he exercises his own free-will. The great philosopher-poet Sri Aurobindo has a beautiful phrase for the present moment: the pure and virgin moment---that razor\u2019s edge of time and existence which divides the past from the future. The present is yet unlived and unspoilt, and therefore, is very much changeable. Where there is a will, there is a way. Here your free-will comes in. You can change the present the way you want, and consequently, the future too, for the future is the outcome of the present. Positive thinking has an effective role to play. It has been proved that most of us have been living far below our potential. We have to analyze and assess our merits and demerits, without bias and with a clinical precision. Then we have to start developing by making optimal utility of our merits. If we move ahead with a passion and determination, none can stop us except our own negativity and habitual lethargy. Lots of folks mistake their bad management of life for destiny. But positive thinking has its own limits which our motivational speakers don\u2019t concede, at least in public. Now-a-days, their stereotypes are ubiquitous and they keep dishing out, day in and day out, their worn-out fables, parables and platitudes. As Schopenhauer says, \u2018A man can do what he will, but not will as he will.\u2019 Imagine a hen tied to a post with a metre-length rope. The hen is no doubt is bound and its freedom of movement is apparently curtailed. All the same, it can move as freely as it wants within the circle described by the radius of a metre. If it rues that it is fettered and becomes disheartened that it cannot move, it forgoes its freedom of movement even within that circle. Positive thinking and motivation help it to make maximum utility of the available freedom of movement. But no amount of inspirational talk can make it get beyond the circle. We can create our own destiny and enjoy living to the limits of our potential. Each of us is unique. It has been found that the average person only employs a small per cent of his latent abilities. He has various physical and mental resources which he habitually fails to use. You and I have such resources. Evaluate your strengths and weaknesses. Then, start building on your strengths and discover how many talents and abilities you have that you didn\u2019t even imagine you had. If once we begin putting them to optimum use, we will be changing our otherwise statuesque fate and fulfilling our possible destiny with an informed free-will, and that too, with a vengeance!

            "answer_text": "If I supposedly have free will, I'll opt to not have free will. If I must have free will, then I don\u2019t have free will. Whether you think you have free will or not, you don't have any more or less control over your life. Try going one day thinking you have free will and one day without. Your life will not change one bit. It surely won't make your butt look smaller or lessen your desire for cake. All the free will in the universe can\u2019t help you prevent a common cold, the occasional flat tire or door ding, losing your job, heartbreak, ingrown toenail, athlete's foot, mosquito bite, STD, boredom, depression, loneliness and much much more. If having free will can\u2019t help me with life\u2019s little annoyances, what is it really good for? If you take the no free will route, you will find that it is much easier to forgive yourself and others. That is the only real difference. If you see them as victim of circumstances, it will help grow your empathy. Let's face it, no matter what you believe in or how educated you are, you'll eventually say or do something stupid. If I think you have free will, I have a good reason to blame you, hate you, give you the silent treatment or even light your nose hair on fire. Even if I punish you, you can never prevent yourself from doing or saying more stupid things in the future. If I see that you have no free will, I'll just give you a hug and say no big deal, it's not your fault. Fault, the other F word. This F word is used often and far more dangerous. Now, tell me which way of thinking do you prefer? To free will or to not free will? If you require scientific proof, I have this to say. All the scientific proof in the world won't convince some people. Many people still think the Earth is flat. Maybe their brains are flat as well. If you have sufficient critical thinking skills, you can conduct many scientific experiments with your own life. The best and only argument that free will believers have is, \u201cyou could have done otherwise or you could have chosen differently\u201d. This criteria is something we humans made up. If you use this criteria as your basis for having free will, why can\u2019t I use my own criteria? Religion and the justice system relies on free will to put people in check. It order to punish you, these systems require that you believe you are in control of your decisions. If religion and the justice system can control my behavior by means of physical pain, financial pain or mental pain, how can they also claim that I have free will? That is a contradiction if I ever saw one. You see, all man-made concepts have loop holes if you know where to look. Ever noticed that no one is debating the existence of oxygen? That's because oxygen is an objective truth. Have you ever been asked if you believe in oxygen? The keyword here is \u201cbelieve\u201d. Objective truths don\u2019t care whether we believe in it or not. When a topic is being debated to death for thousands of years to no avail, it should tell you that something isn't right. That is because free will is a subjective truth. Before you claim something to be true, you first have to define it. Ask 100 people to define free will and you'll get vastly different answers. Objective truths are not up to humans to define. It is true whether we believe it or not. At what age do we supposedly have free will? At age 3, 10, 18, 21 and who gets to decide the age? If you get to pick 18, I get to pick 81 or 150. How much and what type of education will suffice? How much weight do you put on IQ over EQ? How much weight do you put on their upbringing, the environment they grew up in and the time in history they were born? These are just a few of the burning questions I have. Change one thing about the person\u2019s past and you\u2019ll drastically alter their life. As you can see, defining free will is impossible because there are way too many variables to consider. Whether you think you have free will or not, you are equally right. Report back here when you can take on the perception of another species using your free will. I would love to take you to a 6 star restaurant for dinner because you are special, exceptionally special. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always had a deep interest in neuroscience, and some of the work of Numenta: Home of the HTM Community, especially their The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence shines a lot of light on this question. To properly approach an answer to this question, one must learn some neuroscience. There is no way around it. It is no different from needing to know Differential Geometry to understand and appreciate General Relativity, as Einstein discovered long ago.  The above is taken from the above references. In this illustration, you are seeing (!) how you may recognize a cup. You can see the cup with your eyes; you may touch the cup with your fingers. In both cases. you perceive the cup, and even with your eyes closed, you would still recognize the cup. This is all going on in your cortical columns, as illustrated below:  Basically, as the thousand brains theory goes, each of your cortical columns possess the model for \u201ccup\u201d, and many other objects you are familiar with. Based on the tactile input from your fingers, the cortical columns associated with each finger gets part of the input, which might match many different objects in the single column. But what happens is that all the cortical columns, one for each finger tip, etc., all vote on what they think the object is, and your conscious mind only become aware of the outcome of the voting process. Hence, you perceive \u201ccup\u201d. The same is true when your eye scans the field. It\u2019s the same process, really. There are deeper issues going on with these cortical columns, and I entreat you to follow my links above, or at least watch this:  Jeff Hawkins is the founder of Numenta, which is doing something novel in the research of AI: studying the brain to see how it does things, and then understanding ways to replicate that in code. So here, neuroscience meets AI. Now, what does all this say about \u201cfree will\u201d? Jeff does not approach that question in his research directly. I would love to hear his views on it, however. Here\u2019s my take on it: \u201cFree will\u201d is a construct our neocortex creates. Well, there\u2019s more to it than that. You see, there is the concept of \u201cfree will\u201d, and the actual supposed manifestations of \u201cfree will\u201d. I don\u2019t think one can even approach \u201cfree will\u201d without also approaching the question of consciousness itself. And I will have to say that even our consciousness and self-awareness are constructs. Our neocortex monitors itself, as it does sensory input from the outside world, and those cortical columns are also involved with the modelling of both. Both are useful fictions that basically serves as model of interaction with the complex world we live in. They allow us to move, navigate, and interact with the world in complex ways. They allow for abstractions and inference. They allow for our brains to create novelty that would allow us to devise strategies for survival that evolution alone would be far too slow to adapt to. Our qualia are all useful fictions. For example, the colours that you see every day, or music your ears experience, are all constructs. The colour \u201cred\u201d does not exist in nature anymore than the music of Mozart. They are what our neocortex represent them as to our conscious minds, itself a product of representation. This conclusion will be profoundly disturbing to some, perhaps to most. It is something I personally feared to be the case for decades, and now our new level of understanding of neuroscience appears to confirm it. So, in conclusion, free will, consciousness, self awareness, etc., are all useful fictions to allow us to circumnavigate life itself.  What are the implications of this? Should the above conclusions affect how we interact with one another? Should it affect the nature of jurisprudence? Does it change the \u201clove\u201d we feel for those that are \u201cclose\u201d to us? I would say, no. It is one thing to take the \u201cred pill\u201d, as it were. It\u2019s quite another thing to know what to do about it, if anything is to be done about it at all. And what can you do, really? if a perpetrator harms you or someone you care about, you are not going to be interested in \u201cthe devil made me do it\u201d style of excuses, now are you? Nope. You\u2019ll want justice to be properly served on the perpetrator, regardless of whether \u201cfree will\u201d is merely a construct or not. Just count it as a deep and terrible secret you know about human existence. If anything, you should appreciate the \u201cmystery\u201d of our existence even more, and at a deeper level than ever before.  On the theological front, I will state that I am an Atheist, big time. However, why so many wish to entertain the notions of deities is a rather complex topic. And worthy of a discussion on a separate topic / question in its own right. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes.  Of course free will exists. Everyone must decide for himself whether to do what is right or what others say he should.  This is not an easy choice, but only each person can make up his own mind. Everyone must decide for himself what is ethical and what is not.  It is important that big decisions in this area are consistent with general society, but it is still a free choice.  There are consequences for making a bad choice in some cases, but it is more likely only the person himself will know about the decision and outcome.  For example, a business man must decide in each case whether it is ethical (proper) to refund a purchase to a customer who isn't happy.  Is it more important to have a satisfied customer or the profit from the sale?  If this person is the business owner then it is indeed a free choice. Most people face difficult decisions from time to time.  It may seem his entire future is at stake.  This may even be true.  One personal example is the decision of whether or not to make the first flight in an airplane I built myself.  In this case there were issues of the quality of the airplane (i.e. will it fall apart in the air like others of the same design) and the pilot's skill and currency to complete this task.  Nobody in the world could force this decision on me.  Many people tried to influence me one way or the other, but the final decision was certainly mine.  Was I willing to risk my life to fly this plane?  Was I willing to live with myself if I got someone else to make this flight and he was killed?  This is the essence of free will.  (I made the flight and the outcome was just fine.) Perhaps it takes a certain kind of person to make his own decisions - to exercise free will.  This may be another example of people who are free to live their life as they choose and those who feel forced to do everything others demand. ",

Yes Free will is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded. Free will is closely linked to the concepts of responsibility, praise, guilt, sin, and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen. Wikipedia Do individual animals (no they are controlled by and live out and by their instincts) and humans have or are free willed? No, in the case of human individuals as they are absolutely determined, like everything else, in the universe. In the case of humans by their genotypes, phenotypes, epigenetics and personality-types - as I wrote in the FREE for download manuscript of my book - Absolute Determinism and Lack of Free Will Determinism from the 1 st and 3 rd person perspective as well as the universal point of reference are dealt with. This is to show the absence of free will in the last perspective and the illusion of it when seen from the first two perspectives. 'Free' choice is dealt with as well as the absence of free will and the consequences of determinism for law and court judgements are explored. So, what if any, is the place and the role of God in all this? Did s/he create determinism and the potential for or any semblance of choice and free will? Or is the existence of God, the fulfilling of prayer intentions and miracles impossible and redundant in a universe of determinism (laws of nature etc) or universal determinism? ",

FREE WILL EXISTS At its lowest levels, nature is unpredictable - anyone who studies the complexity of the human nervous system appreciates how unlikely it is that people are wind-up toys. No denying the fact that people can be compulsive or irrational - even, to some extent, predictable. But saying we\u2018re stuck reading a script from cradle to grave? Unlikely. FREE WILL IN SCIENCE Free will isn\u2019t totally ignored in science. One answer to this Quora question (Sachan King) mentions a study by Dr. Dan Wagner which claims free will is an illusion. Wagner shows how real decisions actually happen long before we\u2019re even consciously aware of them. We don\u2019t control our fate, we\u2019re the last to know. Does Wagner\u2019s work mean we\u2019re stuck inside a body that largely ignore our wishes - slaves to a decision making machine? If we are, where\u2019s the free will? Wagner thinks the conscious part of your brain is the real you - a small slice of awareness that goes for a ride on the rest of your brain. If decision making isn\u2019t entirely a conscious act -if it\u2019s distributed throughout your brain and your body (as it actually is) - to him, that shows the \u201creal you\u201d got robbed. He\u2019s the professor, not me, but that seems contrived. The entire human being isn\u2019t lock-stepped into its fate from birth. That\u2019s pretty clear. The fact that we\u2019re a little vague about what\u2019s going on in our upstairs isn\u2019t big news to most of us - we knew it all the time.  ",

            "answer_text": "No.  Or, rather, there's no reason to believe it exists other than \"it sure feels like it.\" If that's reason enough for you, then so be it. I think feelings are really profound aspects of being human, but they're not good predictors of reality, of facts about the physical universe.   Let's talk about the moment leading up to when I choose between a vanilla and chocolate ice-cream cone. The causes of that moment started with the Big Bang. The Big Bang caused THIS which cause THAT which cause SOMETHING ELSE, and so on. And, eventually, we get atoms forming into a planet with people and ice-cream cones on it. And brains. And brains that have a preference for certain flavors.   We also have situations, like the fact that the grocery store ONLY had vanilla for the past month, and I'm really, really tired of it. And we have the fact that my father, who beat me when I was little (not really), loved vanilla ice cream.    We have all these genetic and upbringing-based and situational pressures that lead me to choose chocolate.   Now, almost everyone I've met who believes in free will doesn't dispute any of that. They say, \"Yes, we're not TOTALLY free. We have all these pressures that come from our genes and our upbringing and whatnot... But in the END, we STILL have the freedom to choose. Maybe some times we lose our will and give into temptations or whatever. But a lot of the time, we are free to choose.\" What does that mean, exactly? Who is the \"we\" that is choosing?  Let's imagine a brain. Not a real brain but a cartoon one. A simple, simple model of a human brain: it has a makes-choices-based-on-genes region. That takes up, say, 20% of the brain. It has a makes-choices-based-on-upbringing region. That takes up 30%. To please the quantum physicists, let's say it has a region that makes-choices-based-on-randomness. That takes up 20%. Then there's the region that is makes-choices-determined-by-what's-happening-right-now and what-just-happened. That's another 20%. All those parts weigh in saying \"chocolate! chocolate! chocolate!\"  But that final 10%, the free-me part, says, \"NO! I VETO THAT! VANILLA!\" Okay, that was silly, The brain isn't really like that. There's no a determined-by-genes part that separate from a determined-by-nurture part. The whole brain is shaped by many forces, including genetics and environmental ones. But if the free-willers are right, there's still some part of the brain that is free. It can overrule all the other forces. When genes and upbringing and randomness say \"no,\" it can say \"yes.\" (If that's not true, in what sense do we have FREEDOM of will? If we're TOTALLY constrained by genes and so on, how are we free? You can't be totally constrained and free at the same time.)   So that free bit... What is it? Where is it? What's your evidence for it existing, other than, as I said at the start, \"it feels like it exists\"? (If you believe free will exists because you feel like it does, that's fine, but be honest about it. Say, \"I have no evidence for it. I just feel like it exists.\")   That free bit, which is not controlled by genes or upbringing or situation or randomness, is cut off from the causal chain going back to the Big Bang. How did that happen? Are OTHER things cut off from that chain? Is it possible that, tomorrow, I'll push a bowling ball down a hill and it will roll upwards, because it is free from normal causation?   And if that part of me is not making its choices based on genes or whatnot, what IS it making its choices based on? \"Whatever it wants?\" How does it get those wants? What causes them? Genes, upbringing, etc.? No. It can't be that! That's what the will is free from.    So you have a supernatural entity in your head, one that can't be detected and one that you have no proof of? That's what free will is. ",

            "answer_text": "Two books that influenced my views on free will are \"The User Illusion\" by Tor Norretranders and \"The Illusion Of Conscious Will\" by Daniel Wegner.  Research shows that the human brain is designed to create the illusion of control even when that control is objectively absent (for example, believing you have control over a mouse pointer on a computer monitor, when in fact it is being controlled by someone else or by a program).  Wegner argues that the internal experience of will or voluntary action is best viewed as an emotion, what he calls an \"authorship emotion\".  The internal experience does not necessarily match objective reality. What this suggests is that even if we are completely deterministically driven beings, our brains are designed to convince us that we are free.  Presumably our brains evolved this way because the authorship emotion has survival value for humans. Many people believe they have control over their own thoughts, even if not over all their actions or any of their emotions.  But this belief is also easily disproved by experiment.  Pick any thought you would like to have, and decide to think only that and nothing else for 5 minutes.  OK, how about 1 minute?  All right, now try to exclude all thought from your mind for 2 minutes.  How about 30 seconds?  Students of meditation have been running these experiments for millennia, and the results are clear: thoughts arise and disappear through mechanical processes that are entirely outside of our control.  It is claimed that after years of training and conditioning, some of them do learn to focus exclusively on some thoughts and exclude other thoughts, but it is difficult to validate those claims objectively. Since most conceptions of free will involve a subject generating a thought (freely, voluntarily) and then carrying it through to an action, it is hard to argue that free will exists. ",

We are also born into certain environments that affect our views and values in this world. And I believe our value systems are hugely influential to our behaviors and thoughts. This is a simplified example but it's just to make a point - a Muslim child born into a family that has a deep seeded hatred for Jews will grow up hating Jews. If you took that same child at birth and put him with a Jewish family who hates Muslims, the child will grow up to hate Muslims. So I believe the child is not making a choice to hate one type of people, it is simply being conditioned by the environment it grows up in. And I believe this type of thing happens with every culture in many varying ways; the conditioning of children to think and act in certain ways. So I think these factors create a narrow \u201cpassageway\u201d of possibilities for that child's thoughts and actions. These passageway are different for all of us, based on our experiences. If the child spent half his life with a Muslim family and half his life with a Jewish family the passageway widens because he has experienced two opposing environments and value systems. I believe that our genetics, environment and experiences determine the shape or width of our passageways, but within those passageways we are able to make choices that are of our own free will ",

How I think this can relate to free will: The individual insect had no free will in the sense that it completed the job (destiny) appropriately but it still had free will to place the grains of sand in its own order. I think this is a simple big picture that can also in some way apply to humans. I think Freewill is not so much an either or issue but a relativistic one. Putting it crudely; our Mind tells our brain to move our body to do what ever, (there are cracks in the ice regarding science moving in this direction). So where do the thoughts come from? They\u2019re deterministic in the sense that there is an infinite chain mesh of causation via all our interactions (can also go to \u2018other lives\u2019 & without confusing things re; space/time illusion etc.). OR we are all part of crowd or a plant/organism or Whole or the ONE which can also be thought of as an infinitely complex, utterly non linear clockwork where we can \u2018not\u2019 move relative to others but the whole crowd can move. So there are Wholes within Wholes where ultimately only the greatest Whole has freewill. Or my elbow can do what ever it wants as long as it goes along with me. Like Einstein said; freewill or not you may still need to go to jail. One way or another we have been to jail which is just one of our experiences that superimpose on each other to ultimately tells us whether to turn left or right. \"What a liberation to realize that the \u201cvoice in my head\u201d is not who I am. Who am I then? The one who sees that.\u201d Eckhart Tolle On a deeper intuitive level I think we have an infinitesimal amount of Free Will. ",

Parts of this theory we allready found in the laws of physics and the laws of quantum physics. The remainder, we are calling the unified theory, wiil be able to link those theories together, but also proofing we do not have free will. However, if the existance of the unified theory can be disproofed, or if we can proof that the existance of the universe did not start with a single event, free will would still be an option.

            "answer_text": "The original question was \u201cWhat does it mean \u201cfree will does not exist?\u201d\u201d The idea is that determinism precludes free will. Determinism is the idea that every event is determined by, i.e. is the necessary result of, previous events. So that when you make a choice, whether impulsively or after long deliberation, that choice is entirely determined by the events leading up to it - the full circumstances, including your mental state. From a personal (subjective) viewpoint, we can and do make free choices - we can assess the circumstances, visualize the available options, imagine the likely outcome of each, and select the option that we want at the time; it seems to me that this is what most people mean by \u2018exercising their free will\u2019. But objectively, those deliberations are determined by the circumstances - how we perceive the circumstances, how we analyze the options, the cognitive abilities and experiences we bring to bear on them, how we feel about the outcomes at the time, etc. These are what determine our choices, and they are, in turn, determined by prior events. So the whole process, including what we wish to do (our \u2018will\u2019) is determined by what came before, which means there really isn\u2019t any freedom involved. People often say they have free will because they could have chosen differently in some particular circumstances; but in a deterministic world, in order for them to have made a different choice, something would have had to be different, either in the circumstances, or in their mental state at the time. So they could have chosen differently if circumstances - or how they felt about those circumstances - had been different. Things (the choice) would have been different if things (circumstances) had been different\u2026 That\u2019s a deterministic tautology. So in one - subjective - sense, we freely choose what we wish, and in another - objective - sense, what we wish is determined by prior events, so there aren\u2019t really any choices. As Isaac Bashevis Singer said, \u201cWe must believe in free will \u2014 we have no choice.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "First, we need to set the stage. Quantum mechanics says that the universe is not deterministic, which means free will is not forbidden by space-time. However, to state that the universe is not deterministic does not automatically make free will possible. If your hand selects, say, the apple--over, say, a banana--then the taste/flavor of the apple will soon \u201crun through\u201d your consciousness. If you do not like the taste--which \u201cemerges\u201d in your consciousness: emergence is vital here--your body will not force it down. So who\u2019s really in control? The body or the mind? Alternatively, if the body does override the mind, then there are good evolutionary reasons for it. \u201cBut everything is motion. How can you have free will in it?\u201d A: We have no idea of what motion really is; but, if emergence is real, then it could change the very flow of motion. That is, you would not move your hand off the fire if you didn\u2019t feel the pain; that is, there\u2019s a reason why pain must be \u201cpainful.\u201d This is the \u201cWhat Mary Didn\u2019t Know.\u201d Can a mechanical world harbor everything that is vital for the animal? No. Pain must be felt. In fact, the fragmentary worldview of science is so bad even the quantum has to take a leap (to the effect). On Causality: \u201cCause and effect\u201d is such a bad picture of reality that you cannot seriously entertain it. Why is it bad? Because it starts with an infinite regress (What caused the first cause and what caused that, and that, and that, and ... that?), and ends up ... with an infinite regress. It is paradox-hell from start to finish, and you want to employ it as a tool to describe reality? In other words, if you fragment motion like science does, then everything is deterministic. That is, randomness, chaos, order and etc., are only possible if we fragment motion. But Zeno\u2019s paradoxes show us that we are not allowed to do such a thing. The fragmentation of nature is illegal. Try to saw a river in two, I bet you couldn\u2019t do it. Becoming is beyond chaos and order. Becoming is beyond meaning and meaninglessness. To state that becoming is futile or mechanical is to shoot yourself in the foot. In short, the universe is not made up by man-made logic. The universe is beyond all. Beyond good and evil. Beyond fact and fiction (which are one and the same thing). To sum up: Your consciousness has to decide what action to take based on emerging information. But then you say that your consciousness is made up of trillions of tiny robots and that the robots do not have free will, which leads you to conclude that you do not have a free will. If you believe that, then you have misunderstood what emergence really means. If it takes four men to lift a car, then the act of coming together and actually lift the car is the emergence. Even if the one guy (or tiny robot) is unable to lift the car (no free will), then the four men together can do it (free will). Trillions of tiny robots = no free will Trillions of tiny robots working together (i.e., synergy) = free will Consciousness may be the property of emergence. Thus, now you have a state that is irreducible to the tiny robots, so you can\u2019t blame them. \u201cEmergence is not real.\u201d Friend, the doors to your Lego car are an emergent property because your doors here are irreducible to the level when your car is a bundle of bricks! Emergence is not magic nor dualism. It is happening right before your very eyes. When does free will enter the evolutionary scene? Do frogs have free will? A: Well, that depends on our definition of free will. Obviously, free will is complicated. When does an ape become a man? The answer is, never. We are still apes. Maybe frogs have some rudimentary free will? Who knows? Moving on: Your hand chooses the apple over, say, a banana, there is a computation in your brain, the data is sent to your consciousness and, your consciousness feels that it chose the apple, when, in fact, it did not! But this illusion of free will doesn\u2019t hurt at all, evolutionary musing. But let us push evolution a little further. What does hurt? A: The apple tasted like shit! You send that emergent information back to the hand and your hand rejects the apple, information which could not be obtained otherwise, which can only be attained after the fact that. It was thus nature made us: not as a by-product, but as a vital function in the survival scheme of things. Of course it is evolution. But that your body chooses before you do is not a case against free will. To state that we do not have free will because there is no mechanical way! Well, that is true. But that doesn\u2019t mean that nature is mechanical. Zeno\u2019s paradoxes positively destroy all things fragmented. I believe that nature is sensory because nature could not get the fragmented picture of science to work. \u201cSo our free will can alter the course of space-time?\u201d A: I believe it can to some degree. Our minds actively create space-time; this is one of the wonders of quantum mechanics. It from bit (John Archibald Wheeler). Time may be a survival tool of the animal. Mind simulates time (Immanuel Kant). At the top level of the free will hierarchy is your consciousness. This consciousness is irreducible to any lower level. You are active in choosing a path. That is how nature made you: as an agent of survival that must choose the right path in order to survive. You are not cast into a fluffy, fairy, predetermined world. You are cast into the jungle, and here you must learn to survive. If the universe was truly predetermined, then why evolve such a complex path-finding system as our consciousness? \u201cYes, but thoughts arise in consciousness and vanish, how is that free will? When you chose the apple, the whole thing were just thoughts flowing in and out of consciousness. How is that free will?\u201d A: Now you are fragmenting again. You are your thoughts, memory, ego, the whole bit, so I do not know what you are talking about.\u201d A consciousness more evolved than ours, may even display a greater case of free will. \u201cWhen I think about a famous person, Elvis pops up. So, how can I have free will? Hell, I don\u2019t even like Elvis!\u201d Free will or not: You have to like Elvis. Ultimately, you will say, \u201cReality is like a movie, there is no free will in it.\u201d I say, \u201cReality is like a movie that is being shot ... on a rock flying through space.\u201d If that does not convince you, then I don\u2019t know what the hell will.

            "answer_text": "It does exist and it most certainly is not an illusion. Free will means superficially our ability to control our own muscle movements. We are not free to choose what we are, we are only free to choose what we do. And we can only do what our muscles can do. On a deeper level free will means having a choice. This means that we are free from deterministic causation. We are not forced to do what causality by past events would dictate. We can follow our intentions, our desire for a certain kind of future instead. Our decisions are affected by past events. One might even say that our decisions are made by past events, because that is what we essentially are, individual collections of past events. The freedom is in having a choice of alternative actions to satisfy our will. In the core of free will is our ability to see and invent alternative courses of action. That requires some random thinking outside the box. In essence, free will is deterministic filtering of randomly generated ideas. It enables us to act spontaneously and creatively while still being true to what we are. Due to involving randomness, free will is incompatible with full determinism. In full determinism there could not be any randomness at all nor any illusion thereof. In fact, there could not be any illusions at all, as they would represent an alternative view of the reality and there simply are no alternatives in full determinism. ",

Every single bit of that is nothing more than an illusion created by our brains, especially the claustrum, which is where all of our senses come together to create our reality, and the part that leading research, hypotheses is responsible for consciousness. We are still at the mercy of every single interaction, whether it be based on the laws of physics, QM or chemistry. There are also illnesses such as encephalitis lethargica that further bring free will into question. They are awake, and aware, and cannot choose to do anything as the reward system isn't working properly. The substantia nigra is a little part of the brain that is involved in movement and reward and makes up 1 of the 4 parts of the basal ganglia. It is just behind the cerebral peduncles, the part of the brain that is involved with sensory and motor information. It is made up of 2 parts, pars compacta, made up of dopamine synthesizing neurons, and the pars reticulata which basically uses the GABA neurotransmitters to inhibit neurons from firing rapidly or too often. The substantia nigra is involved in other illnesses such as Parkinson\u2019s and schizophrenia. As you can see, without all of these chemicals working properly we aren't in control of much at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for quite a while now, and I think I've finally formed my opinion. I don't think it's accurate to say free will does or does not exist, as I think it's kind of a mixture of both, and that's not me just settling for middle-ground. Here is a piece I wrote on the topic: While the issue of choice and freedom is a familiar one in the eyes of the modern person, free will is not necessarily the most ancient of topics in existence. This is because for a creature to debate the existence of its free will, it must have reached a sufficient level of intelligence and self-awareness. This intimate realization of one\u2019s own existence is a prerequisite to the capability to ponder the nature of said existence: is it a free one, or is it determined? Humans must have, therefore, reached a certain level of intelligence, before which we were incapable of comprehending what being free really is, and whether or not we are free agents. In here, I will be relating freedom to intelligence, demonstrating that at least some degree of freedom is an inevitable side-effect to attaining a high level of intellect. Often do determinists claim that consciousness is the source of the illusion of freedom. They go on to claim that our choices and actions have causal relationships with a variety of factors coming from our environment. The sheer quantity and diversity of these factors, be them psychological, or environmental, or whatever, makes tracking a cause or reason for an action not only impossible, but also downright incorrect (as there are in fact many interdependent reasons for a decision). While such reasoning is partly valid, it neglects internal factors that ultimately affect everything we do, and are perhaps just as important. What such reasoning neglects is the effect our own thoughts and analysis have on a situation; In other words, it neglects the extra factor that consciousness, and specifically self-awareness, brings to the table. This self-awareness cannot be brushed away as a mere metaphysical, nonexistent entity. It is inherently existent, and is in many ways tangible, not metaphysical. The fact that it is an established and recognized word proves that it is a real and essential part of the human experience, rooted in physical aspects of human physiology. Denying its existence is tantamount to denying happiness exists: just because something is part of a subjective experience, doesn\u2019t mean it is not part of any objective reality (i.e whatever causes the sensation of happiness, or the state of self-awareness, is itself an existent entity in this universe). Now that we have established self-awareness as a real entity capable of affecting occurrences and outcomes, it is worthwhile to focus on how a creature\u2019s own self-awareness affects the decisions it makes. If we prove that a person\u2019s self-awareness, resulting from our relatively high level of intelligence, does affect the choices we make, then we have established solid ground for our existence as at least partially-free agents. Ultimately, what it comes down to is our intellect, which gives us analytical skills, as well as the capability to not only reflect on the current situation, but also make predictions as well as reflect back on previous decisions. When these mental processes occur in tandem with a state of awareness, a person attains the ability to express thought, and offer insight. The silent, inner ramblings that occur in each and every one of us, are in fact factors we react to. For example, thinking of a sad, even distant, memory can cause one to cry. Crying is an action occurring as a result of a stimulus delivered internally. Further, a deep analysis of the general situation leads an intelligent being to change their course of action. What such analysis, or distant memories intentionally brought into the present, or conscious mental processes in general, have in common is that they are rooted in thought; they are ultimately expressed or performed through a particular type of thought that is self-aware. Some may argue that even these thoughts aren\u2019t quite \u201cup to us\u201d, but the very essence of freedom is whether we have an effect on the things we do, and our thoughts, which are expressions our conscious selves, are what we really, truly identify with. In other words, consciousness and who we are are very much the same two things. And since consciousness, as demonstrated previously, does affect the things we do, we do actually have a say, and are in a way, free agents. In conclusion, though a deterministic world-view may be factually accurate by reducing actions to a series of interactions between a living creature and a complex network of factors, determinism tends to completely neglect internal factors arising from our intelligence. It should be obvious that our conscious selves\u2019 ability to, with their mere expression of thoughts, partially affect the decision-making process is at least a discrete form of freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and it can be proved to exist, because Humans ( and cats) can always be bloody- minded and exercise their free will by choosing to do the opposite of what anybody can predict them to do. If hard determinism is correct in asserting that there is no free will then it should be theoretically predictive of people's actions. So, if you ask someone to choose a number between 1 or ten ( or a colour or press one of a range of buttons etc) then the determinist should be able to predict this choice. You tell the determinist that you are going to ask a person X to willingly choose,say, a number between 1 and 100. ( or choose a colour or raise a particular finger etc. The choice task is irrelevant to the point)You ask the determinist to predict the answer, and inform them that you will inform X of this prediction before they make their choice.You stipulate that the determinist cannot lie e.g deliberately give a false predictionThe determinist predicts X will give the answer \"9\", or else says they cannot predict for reasons belowX is told the predication is \" 9\" and asked to make their choice.If person X now chooses \"9\" then the determinist prediction is proved to be correct.If however X,knowing that the prediction is \"9\", wilfully chooses a different number, say \"25\", then determinism is proved to be partial. One can denote X's ability to falsify or prevent any prediction by using the conventional linguistic token \" free will\". If the determinist predicts \"25\" then X can exercise their \"free will \" and choose \"9\" etc. X can always willingly choose to falsify the prediction, and thus predictive determinism, simply by exercising their \"free will\".The determinist knows that if they do give a prediction it can always be negated so at point 4 they must answer that they cannot make a prediction. This shows that there are circumstances where it is impossible to make a deterministic prediction, determinism can never fully predict actions. That deliberate willing of a different behaviour to that deterministically predicated can be denoted by the linguistic term \" free will\". I am making no metaphysical point about the existence or non- existence of some metaphysical \"thing\" or \" process\" called \" free will\" but merely using the linguistic term \" free will\" as it is ordinarily used in everyday language e.g if you asked the man on the Clapham omnibus if they have \" free will\" they will say, \" Of course I have, I can choose to do A rather then B, or B rather than A.\" Only madmen and philosophers deny that we have the disposition denoted in everyday language by the conventional linguistic term \" free will\".

My personality, as I would describe it, is simply how I would respond\u2014behaviorally, emotionally, and psychologically\u2014to any specific situation. I can control my actions. I choose to take the actions I take based off of my personality. In this sense, I have free will. However, my personality is decided entirely by factors outside of my control. I don\u2019t get to choose it. It\u2019s a combination of nature (my genetics) and nurture (my environment). Because of this, if you were able to understand every variable of what my life would be before I was even born, you could know that on this day, at this moment, I\u2019d be expressing these exact thoughts on the topic of free will instead of doing my homework. In this sense, I have no free will. Now, that is an entirely secular argument. I\u2019m an atheist, so it\u2019s not surprising that this is the argument I\u2019ve chosen. But, I\u2019ll make another one. This argument is going to assume the existence of an all knowing God. Okay, so God knows everything. That means He also knows everything that is going to happen. What if I were to tell you\u2026 He knows which pill I\u2019ll take long before Morpheus even offers. That means if he knows I\u2019ll take the blue pill, I can\u2019t take the red one, because then God wouldn\u2019t be all knowing. I have no option of taking the red one. In this sense, I have no free will. Some people would counter that, \u201cHe may know what you are going to choose to do before you do it, but you are still the one choosing\u201d. No, you aren\u2019t. Because long before you\u2019ve been presented with the choice a set of events that will occur have been locked into place. Everything that has ever happened would happen again under exactly identical circumstances. Therefore, we have no free will. ",

            "answer_text": "Does free will exist? This is a question I\u2019ve been asking myself for a long time. If free will doesn\u2019t exist does it mean we are predestined? Or does both exist? I\u2019ve been reading all of the theories, both philosophical and scientific theories for it. I still haven\u2019t come to a conclusion. But I think I tried to find my own answer. So, for explaining this I am going to approach in a different way. I don\u2019t know if you have played this game, but I think in all of our lives we have encountered with this game,   Yes, the Far Cry series. Especially from Far Cry 3 (I have\u2019t played before that), there have been multiple endings for Far Cry. That means you can choose the endings. Its your own choice. However you like. But however, you cannot choose something which does not exists. That means your ending will always be one of those endings that were pre-designed by the developer/quest desginer. Lets get more complicated,  I think you have heard the game of Telltale\u2019s Walking Dead. The game doesn\u2019t only have multiple endings but also have decisions and consequences. So, you have created the story for Clementine, basing on your actions and consequences. Again, you can have so many story and events generated for you. But you cannot get something which isn\u2019t designed via the quest designer. Now, back to the real topic. Does free will really exist? This could be answer both philosophically and scientifically. The Science is yet to develop for the free will. But philosophy has dealt with it long ago. According to philosophy/theology, God or the Creators decisions impact on our lives. We are all like the players of video games. We choose our own stories. Where God/Creator is the quest/life designer in this case. But God/Creator isn\u2019t like us. He is superior to us. His designs are much more complicated. He perhaps created multiple or even infinity paths for us. We are one who choose. But can we go beyond our limits? Lets give an another example, I think you might have seen this movie,  There\u2019s a scene here, I request anyone who has seen this movie please check it out,  The scene is really complicated. Here, she gets an accident by the taxi driver. Before that the guy tells what if that was that or that was that. The whole thing could\u2019ve changed for one action or decision. So, I think for out life its \u201ceither do or don\u2019t.\u201d For example, either read my answer or don\u2019t. Either read this question or don\u2019t. Either sit on quora or don\u2019t. These are all of the little events and actions in our lives which we fulfill. Supposes, if God has destined you to both read my answer and not to read. Then you could read or not. Your choice. But if God hasn\u2019t destined to not read my answer, then you won\u2019t have a chance! Your network connection could go bad. Your device might have a problem. You might run out off electricity etc etc. So, now does free will exist. I don\u2019t know. We cannot go beyond our destination. But we could surely choose between. And as far as I know, almost every major religions say that we have our own free wills. So, yes free will exist. But predestination also exist. Its not for me to tell if free will exist or not. Its that we could always choose the good or bad. Thanks for reading :) ",

He responded assertively that the claim was wrong & faulty \u2026 that humans DO HAVE free will. I pointed out that, as an engineer, he knew he must study evidence before discounting or refuting it. And that his strong refutation, prior to careful study, was in and of itself, proof that he was being flooded by unconscious agenda, which was then being unconsciously reframed (motivated cognition) as intelligent consideration.

I claim that such a definition should be relative (i.e. the free will of a system compared to that of another) rather than absolute, such that for each pair of systems we can define a measure of free will advantage of one over the other. My definition is as follows: A has more free will than B if A can simulate B, therefore predict and therefore control it. Of course the ability of A to predict and control is not binary, rather it is a spectrum whereon one end of it is total simulation of a system and ability to control all \"inputs\" to it, and on the other end - randomness - total non-understanding of a system. The key concept is this: What is random to us may be less random to higher systems. We have more free will than a rock, but (at least as individuals) we do not have more free will than the stock exchange. For further reading: The above answer closely relates to the concept of Kolmogorov complexity. And another note: I think this is also a good definition for intelligence. ",

To my mind, anything that happens may be deterministic, in that it is in principle fully explicable in terms of physics;\u00b9 e.g. you made decision X because, deep in your brain, neuron A fired off a chain reaction through networks B through K, releasing neurochemical L, \u2026, &c.; at the end of which series of deterministic physical events, the result is that you perform some given action; ornon-deterministic, in the way that quantum mechanical events may be, which is to say unconstrained by anything exterior, except in setting up the probability distribution.Now, what do you mean by free will?  Is your will free if it is subject to deterministic physics? It may be free from any number of kinds of coercion, but it clearly isn't free from inevitable causality. Is it free if some  aspects of it is non-deterministic\u2014which is to say, are utterly random, with no regard to your life experience, your thoughts, your preferences?  If so, it may (to some degree) be free from causality, but I've never  heard anyone say that by freedom, they mean the freedom to do things unintentionally, entirely at random.  Or do you mean some nebulous libertarian free-will notion, where you have some magic external control that is neither  deterministic nor non-deterministic? If so, I'd be fascinated (and I do mean this) to have a cogent explanation of what you mean.  If I had to answer this question with simply \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, I would say no\u2014we don\u2019t have free will, because it is not a coherently defined concept. That is, it\u2019s not that \u201cfree will\u201d describes a property that we lack, but rather that the common notion of \u201cfree will\u201d fails to actually apply to any logically consistent reality. Of the logically coherent possibilities, it seems to me that determinism is preferable to non-determinism. (Which does not say anything about whether it\u2019s true; but I do take exception with the common demonisation.) Ideally, I want my decisions to be based on my best understanding of reality, and move me toward the best course of action to further my goals in alignment with my ideals. But if I want to always make the best possible decision, that really does single out one possible decision for every choice; so that, whether determinism is true or not, I should hope that I act as though it were by always choosing the best option.  \u00b9 Or, if you\u2019re a dualist, perhaps by some extra-physical mechanism of the \u2018spirit\u2019 or \u2018soul\u2019; but I don\u2019t see how this frees you from logical constraints of causality. Note that when I speak of chain reactions and the \u201cend\u201d of a series, the salient relationship is causal dependency rather than temporal ordering. If you want to suppose some time-and-space-less spirit does your thinking, its thoughts still have causal antecedents\u2026or not\u2014but not something in between. ",

It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019ve been predetermined or not, so long as they belong to you, rather than some outside agency. Free will thus becomes a question of outside influence. Was someone holding a gun to your head, forcing you to make a particular choice? Did someone have undue influence over you, fooling you into making a particular deicsion? If not, your choice was free. It\u2019s generally accepted that we have at least this form of free will. Incompatibalist free will is the idea that all that matters is whether you could have made a different decision, whether your decisions are pre-determined. If they are, you don\u2019t have free will. If you can decide otherwise, then they are. A lot of the people motivated to answer questions like this will tend to argue against this form of free will. It\u2019s called incompatibalist, because it\u2019s incompatible with a school of philosophical thought known as determinism. Determinism is the idea that all events in the universe are (pre)determined. This is generally described as a situation where all events are caused, completely and entirely, by preceeding events. Thus all events form a giant chain, where A causes B causes C, and so on, from the very first event through to the very last. Such an arrangement leaves no room for the idea that we can events, since everything is fixed. Thus there is no room for (incompatibalist) free will. One problem with this view of the universe is that science has generally suggested it to be nonsense. Modern physics is full of random events, that is events that can not be predicted, even in theory. Godel did some very good work in proving this mathematically. From here there are two places to go. You can either go with Hard Determinism, the idea that universe really is determined, it\u2019s just determined by a means we don\u2019t know about yet. So it\u2019s theoretically possible that we will in the future come across a determinist theory for everything that does away with random events. However, it\u2019s not a popular theory at the moment, and there\u2019s no particular reason to believe this will happen. The alternative approach is Soft Determinism, which is basically Determinism with random events. All events are deemed to be either (pre)determined, or entirely random, with no other type of event allowed. This saves its adherants from contradicting current science, while still denying free will. Again, though, there is no particular reason to believe this to be the case, and it relies on an essentially arbitrary division of the universe into two types of events. Free will ends up being denied just because it doesn\u2019t fit into this arbitrary framework. Futhermore, I\u2019d suggest that determinism itself is flawed. Our understanding of events relies on local causation, that is, that events that happen are the product of what we see around us. If you cross the road, and get hit by a car, you\u2019d explain the accident in terms of the care with which you crossed the road, the attention of the driver, the speed of the vehicle, the traction of the road surface, and so on. You wouldn\u2019t cite the composition of the universe immediately after the Big Bang. Yet under determinism, the Big Bang is the best explanation for you being hit. All other possible factors are just local approximations, inaccurate proxies for what really determined the accident, which was the composition of the universe at the start of time. Determinism ends up being deeply hostile to cause and effect as we generally understand it. As such, I\u2019d suggest that free will, no matter how you define it, is almost certainly true. There\u2019s nothing in science or logic to discount it. The only reason to dismiss it is if you believe, a priori, that the structure of the universe is such that all events must be pre-determined (or random). While this belief is well-established amongst several major US educational establishments, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any obvious reason to regard it as true. It\u2019s not necessary for science, and it\u2019s deeply hostile to our ideas around cause and effect. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, free will exists. It exists because if I am presented with a choice between A or B I can freely choose between A or B, and no one nor any one thing can force me to choose one way or another. Even if someone threatens me if I choose A, I can still be stubborn and choose A, whatever the consequences. Some people might say free will doesn't exist because there are only 2 types of events: events that are caused by something else and events that are not, and that the universe is either deterministic (no free will), or random (no free will).I think there is a flaw in the reasoning there, and it lies in the perspective they choose in order to answer the question. Say I am presented with a choice between a tuna and a cheese sandwich, and before choosing anything I ask two different people who believe the universe is deterministic to explain to me why I have chosen what I chose. Person 1 I will lie to and say I chose tuna, and person 2 I will lie to and say I chose cheese. Now they both will come with a similar explanation and both will conclude that I have chosen either tuna or cheese because of what they just said. But I have not chosen at all. So since there is no conceivable way to prove them wrong at all by making a choice, any choice, and they cannot both be right as they contradict each other in the final part of the choice, there is a problem with their theory. The perspective of looking backwards in time and finding a set of possible causal events chaining into the choice and explaining it does not have a lot of merit for this question. They can find causes leading to tuna and causes leading to cheese, but I haven't even chosen yet. The reason for this is that the brain and all its processes involved cannot be tracked and cannot be completely followed. They are a black box, and assuming that a black box contains only deterministic paths is an assumption, just like assuming that free will happens inside that black box, with your conscious choice affecting the outcome as an extra ingredient on top of the input. As long as the black box is not completely transparent (and I am not sure it's even theoretically possible for it to be) there cannot be any definitive answer that includes the black box. Then what remains is that from the perspective of me myself looking forward (since looking backwards doesn't have merit, and looking at it from an external point doesn't either because of the black box) I see I can choose either tuna or cheese, so yes, there is free will. It's the only valid reference point from where to answer the question. One last addition to the statement that there is either a determined universe or a random universe: I think it's possible that the universe is determined by our choice. Looking forward from myself as reference point again: It's not random whether I will choose cheese or tuna, as I can choose. It's not determined what I will choose, since I can still choose. If I choose tuna I will live in a universe where I have chosen tuna, and if I choose cheese I will live in a universe where I have chosen cheese.Of course from any given point I can trace a direct line back to my first choice, and even understand my choices, but that doesn't mean the universe is determined... Well, it has been determined NOW, but looking to the future, that future still needs to be determined by our choices.So the PAST is determined, the future is not.Of course things happen that can be described as random, but that to me doesn't mean we live in a random universe either. It's a mix of the two, and most randomness could probably have theoretically been predicted. The past is determined, the future is still undetermined, and our choice turns one into the other. (Scientific calculations and precognition can predict the future, and the less dependent on choice the calculation or precognition is the more reliable the result). But I am just a guy not really knowing a lot about this all, so I could be making some mistakes in my reasoning. If so, please point them out, always good to learn :) ",

            "answer_text": "TL;DR Total free will does not exist, but with the use of technology you can strive to get closer to it. As long as we are constrained by needs that we cannot control it is very difficult to talk about free will. Some of these constraints are your basic physical needs like eating or having a warm shelter going to more subtle ones such as social interaction, finding love or self actualization. A few hundred years ago, covering your basic needs took up most of your time. Most of the people were working in agriculture and having a shelter or avoiding diseases took a big effort. There was very little time left to do whatever you wished. Nowadays thanks to the industrial revolution and the good side of globalization you can cover your basic needs quite cheaply. You still have to take time for things like eating, grocery shopping or paying your bills but the chunk of time that you can use to do whatever you want can be greatly increased. It all comes down to proper time management and focus. Now that you have a good part of the day to exercise free will you hit another problem. Your freedom (and therefore free will) is constrained by other people around you. You cannot have total freedom without affecting other people's free will. If you would land alone on a deserted island, you would be free. If a second person would land there, your complete freedom ends at that moment. So you can achieve a certain amount of free will in some aspects of life, but total free will is just an illusion.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It depends on one\u2019s frame of reference. Universal Frame of Reference: Free will requires causality sequencing: Choice >>> Decision >>> Action. Thus, causality demands linear time. However, linear time does not exist in the Universe, it is an artefact of the metazoan brain and an illusion of the observer\u2019s mind. Moreover, causality breaks down even further if faster-than-light travel could ever be achieved by anything (especially information) in the Universe. Hence, in this frame of reference Free Will does not exist.  However, this is what happens when you shift to: Personal Frame of Reference: Our self does not inhabit the Universal Reality but a very limited and heavily perceptually filtered reality: we can only experience the dimensionally-reduced shadows of Reality as it casts its shadows on the walls of the cave of our limited mammalian brain. In this reality time not only exists but it is also has an irrefutable direction. Causality may be perceived in an edited delay yet it has very real consequences: you push the glass over the edge and the glass falls and breaks. And you decided to push it. Was it freely?  This is what a though looks like: the timed (simultaneous or sequential) coactivations of neurons. Our brains are part of the Universe. And yet they contain a perceived universe within. And in that universe, Free Will is as real as our past. Because the truth is, when we make a decision, that decision is made by everything we ever saw, heard, touched, read, felt, imagined or experienced. Like a steel ball dropping down a long pachinko panel, seemingly free - yet able to bounce only within the paths set down pin by pin by our past. In other words, in our Personal Frame of reference, we do have Free Will - but only as much as our subconscious mind allows us to have.  ",

Well-balanced individuals have the most free will because they are more centrist and sensible, and likely to be more pragmatic as well. Others simply don\u2019t have the skills to exercise their free will wisely. When free will is associated religion, the discussion will become progressively more pointless. Mixing superstition, mysticism and dogma will turn the topic into nonsense. Free will is a human attribute that exists for the same reasons we have social skills and moral-ethical awareness. Free will is not good versus evil, a simplistic world view at best. You\u2019ve got free will, and if you think you don\u2019t, see a therapist. Like critical thinking, free will requires doing the work of thinking things through with an open mind and nuance. Philosophically, if you\u2019re a rational agent, you have free will. Enjoy it.

We should not erroneously objectify \u201ccause\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d like the natural scientists do (and whoever else thinks naturalistically these days \u2013) in accordance with the dominant mechanistic stupidity which would have the cause push and shove until it \u201ceffects\u201d something; we should use \u201ccause\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d only as pure concepts, which is to say as conventional fictions for the purpose of description and communication, not explanation.\u201d Now, some people will tell you that we can\u2019t actually consciously decide on what to do because all our choices are made by our brains, but this is only true if you subscribe to material reductionism. These very same people will also tell you that we are nothing more than our brains, but what they ignore is that if we really are our brains then it logically follows that our brains are also us. And if our brains make our choices, and our brains are us, then it follows that we make our own choices. ",

            "answer_text": "Amazing that one asks of the existence of free WILL and immediately receives answers examing ACTION. We all have free will. (the DESIRE to act in a certain way in order to produce a particular outcome). But whether or not those actions produce the desired outcome is often questionable. The product of our actions, be them positive or negative, doesn't speak at all to whether our will to act in a certain way exists or doesn't. It most certainly must exist unless we are physically or mentally compelled as if a marionette. So then we are not responsible for our acts? Ridiculous. We are just as responsible as if we baked a cake using sulfur instead of flour. Our free will does not come without responsibility. Quite to the contrary, our free will must always be connected to the GOOD however you define that. ( for me that GOOD. can be none other than our creator). Just as God freely gave us this gift of free will we are obligated to \u201cfreely\u201d assure that this connection remains unsevered. This obligation does not diminish the \u201cfree\u201d aspect ( as has been seen by those who act contrary to the good). Rather the freedom to act on our will remains and it is only the action, not the will, that is brought into question. ",

            "answer_text": "I think science is somewhat divided on this one - and it\u2019s not even clear what \u201cfree will\u201d actually means. From all we can tell from what we\u2019ve found out about brains - they are basically a lot like computers. Very, very complicated computers - and computers that aren\u2019t very accurate or perfect in their operations - but basically computers. There isn\u2019t much scientific debate about THAT. So this leads to a few questions: Can a computer be programmed to have free will? \u2014 Most people would say \u201cNo.\u201dCan a computer be programmed to think that it has free will? \u2014 Most people would say \u201cYes.\u201d Line 423: \u201cif ( askedAboutFreeWill ) print \u201cYes, I have free will!\u201d;So that means that the impressions we have of free will could be entirely false. There have been studies done in MRI machines that suggest that it could be a false impression. I forget the exact details - but it was something like: They put people into a brain scanner with two buttons they could press - and when a light came on, asked them to pick which button they wanted to press at random - then to press it - and to do this as fast as they possibly could after the light came on. They also asked people to repeat the experiment - but this time, after deciding which button to push - to NOT press either button - so make the decision, but take no action. In the second run of the experiment they could see which parts of the brain were responsible for the decision-making and in the first experiment they could see both the part that made the decision and the part that commanded the finger to move and press the button. What they found (surprisingly) was that most of the time, people pressed the button and THEN the decision making part of the brain became active. We decide which button to press about a half second after we\u2019ve already pressed it! This suggests that the \u201cfree will\u201ddecision making was merely the conscious part of the brain doing an after-the-fact rationalization for why the lower brain functions picked a button at random. That makes it seem like the conscious mind is simply choosing to apply labels to things that already happened - and the memory that is stored is that the conscious mind issued a command and the subconscious did what it was told\u2026when in fact the reverse was the case. That said, other scientists say that in a sufficiently complex system - and especially one with imperfect logic - that self-awareness might just be an emergent property of complexity. So right now - the jury is out. We don\u2019t know either way for sure. I\u2019d bet good money we\u2019ll figure it out within the next 10 years. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you think Free Will is. I can't do whatever I want. People like to say things like, \u201cYou are the only person holding you back,\u201d and the like. I say bullshit to that. There is plenty holding me back. First, there are obvious biological constraints. I can't fly to the moon, no matter how hard I flap my wings. Apparently, we now know that some cephalopods, such as the octopus, can alter their RNA in an adaptive manner. But RNA is just a copy of preexisting genetic material; i.e., the ability to change in one way or another has to be a part of them already. As amazing as that is, the ability to adapt in this way actually slows down evolution. Where were we? Oh, right. All I'm saying is, even if my descendants somehow learned to levitate, I won\u2019t be around to see it. But I could use technology to overcome biological hindrances, you might say. Sure, I could take a spaceship to the Moon and wear a space suit on its surface, like Buzz Aldrin. But maybe, just maybe, I don't have the right stuff to become an astronaut. Maybe I can't handle the g-forces necessary or lack the proper psychological profile or education. Even if I possessed all of those things, my chances of becoming an astronaut would still be slim. But what about private space travel, you may ask? Last time I checked it was far too expensive for me. We\u2019re talking something like $80 million, by one estimate. Plus, you\u2019d be asking me to compromise my dream of landing on the Moon for a quick jaunt in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere or, at most, a trip around the moon. No thanks. But what about if I did compromise and raised the money on GoFundMe? Sure, maybe I could eventually raise the capital to pay Elon Musk and Co. But I don\u2019t like my chances. After a little research, the most it seems I could raise would be around six figures. Okay, so if I get a million dollars and then invest it well, maybe I could turn it into ten million before I die. Not enough. Besides, aren\u2019t there other more worthy causes than sending one broke-ass white boy to space? Eh, now that you mention it, turns out I don't really want to go to space that badly. For starters, there are other things here on Earth that interest me far more than that. I have my family to consider, and I can't waste my time with raising money just so I can go into space and post about it on Instagram. I could spend my time in service to myself, but as it stands I am not a narcissist or a sociopath, so I get joy out of serving others. What I\u2019m saying is, besides the biological and economic restraints, I also lack the will to compromise all my other dreams and all of my obligations here on Earth for a chance at a space trip. Hmm, I guess I am holding myself back, albeit just a wee bit. I feel that, with so much up to chance, I can\u2019t possibly hinge all of my hopes on Elon Musk lowering the price of a space trip in my lifetime and expect to live a happy life. There are so many beautiful things right here on Earth that are worth having. So, despite all the restraints of this life, I still have the ability to make choices. I\u2019m free to shoot for the Moon, even if my chances are really lousy. I\u2019m also free to not go to the Moon, set more realistic goals for myself, and maybe still live a happy life. Is that free will? You tell me. [Edited: had to clean up the bit about the Wired article. Cephalopods are amazing! My knowledge of English? Not so amazing. I had ancestors and descendants pointed in the wrong temporal directions\u2026] ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Does free will exist? If not, is a man without freedom the same as dead? Answer: Thank for the A2A.   What is Free-Will.  It is a term philosophers created to argue whether or not what we do is pre-determined by some entity (physical or metaphysical, fate, a god or just the universe) or if we are in control of our own actions. If we act as if we have free-will then we in fact have it.  In answering this question I can either assume it was predetermined that I would answer it or I can assume that I am answering because I want to and I could just as easily not answer it.  The end result is same. Life is about making choices and accepting the consequences of those choices.  If we assume that everything we do is predetermined then we do not own the responsibility for our actions.  If I kill some one then what am I truly guilty of.  It was predetermined that I would kill this person.  I have no choice in the matter.  Therefore I am innocent. It was not my choice, I was forced to do so. We live, we make choices, we try to be happy, we try to find love, we have children, we work, we find things we enjoy to do and people we enjoy doing things with.  Without \"Free-Will\" we would still do all these things. The only effect of predetermination I find is that it eliminates true ownership of our actions.  There can be no real crime and no \"immoral\" act because we have no option in the matter. It would not be the same as being dead. ",

This question is as old as humanity and probably can never truly be answered at all. The answer for you is what you choose to believe, or believe you were fated to believe respectively. However, physics does provide something interesting and relevant to this discussion. Quantum mechanics is, according to the most current understanding the best and brightest minds studying it can produce, probabilistic. That means that the tiniest pieces of our universe do not follow set paths determined by neat equations, but rather \u201croll the dice\u201d and then decide based on that idea of random chance. Bell's Theorem was experimentally verified and peer-reviewed, and it proved that basically nothing that travels at or below the speed of light in a vacuum could possibly explain quanum randomness as the results of as-yet undetected particles or phenomena. So, essentially, either something that travels faster than light is telling quantum particles what to do before they do it (doubtful, becuase nothing made of matter can travel faster than light and scientists have never observed anything traveling faster than light period), or quantum truly is probabilistic. That leaves determinism in an uncomfortable position as it was based on the idea of an orderly, predictable universe. Accoridng to the physicist who devised Bell's Theorem in the first place, he sees only one way to salvage determinism: super-determinism. This view holds that every single quantum fluctuation that ever has and will ever occur was decided the moment the Big Bang happened. However, many people including myself believe this makes existence itself vacuous. For instance, not only would I have been fated to type this the instant the universe was born, it wouls be impossible for me to NOT type this. Under this perspective, consciousness and individuality do not exist. Humans are functionally no differrnt from a rock or leaf. We are like the white froth at the peak of a breaking wave: fascinating and complex, but ultimately just another meshing together of physical particles. You lose the ability to make decisions because decisions do not exist, consciousness does not exist, and therefore you and I and every other \u201cliving\u201d thing does not truly exist any more than a whirlpool in water is any different from the water that surrounds it. You might see the problems this view raises. But, according to physicist's best understanding of quantum mechanics and the extrapolated philosophy that comes with it, you have only two choices: free will or super-determinism. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, within the quantum behavior of our neural synapses. *** Those who disagree are working from a 19th century cosmological model called \"the clockwork universe.\" This model says every action arises directly from preceding actions in a linear way - as if every prior cause, working in confluence with all other prior causes, can produce only one particular result. Anyone familiar with photon behavior knows this isn't true. Just as a photon may be seen as a particle or as a wave - depending upon how it is observed - so effects may arises from probable, rather than definitive, causes. *** The world is probabilistic, not deterministic. This means a myriad of causes conjoin to produce an effect which is probable, not certain.  This machine, called a Galton Board, shows how probability works. Hundreds of balls of the same size and weight are dropped from a single hole at the top-center of the machine. For our purposes, think of each ball as a prior cause. After the drop the same mountain peak always appears. Most balls fall into the center slots and fewer fall into the outer slots. The pattern remains the same...but where any individual ball will fall is a matter of random chance. In quantum indeterminacy, all prior causes form such a pattern prior to any given outcome. Even if we could trace all prior causes in our behavior we still cannot know which cause will \"decide\" what we do next, because the distribution of prior causes is random. A strong cause may, by happenstance, appear at the outer edges of the decision-making field; a weak cause may wind up on top. The image above - an array of prior causes extant before an event (a human decision) - exists in a state of quantum superposition. This means prior causes come together in all possible states simultaneously...so long as we don't observe the field. Once we \"look to check\" our own superposition of causes, then an effect (a choice) can be made. We are always checking our own mentality to see what we might do next. How we view our past determines what we do...not the past itself.  ",

Free will is different from \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cfreedom\u201d, free will would not be the freedom of doing or speaking our minds, it can be better defined as a balance. It\u2019s impossible for both sides of the balance to be up at same time. When one is on the top, other is down below, and that\u2019s the origin our inner conflict. And this conflict is necessary for our development. We do good things, because of our will. No one will take that from us, because it was entirely our choice, and like an exercise, the more we do good thing, the more capable we are to improve our actions. In the same way, if we choose to do bad things, we\u2019ll have to deal with the consequences, and we\u2019re responsible for that. Good deeds and bad deeds are part of that balance because, it doesnt matter if one is poor or rich, if its healthy or sick, free or a prisioner, he is able to do the best that he can or the worst. It\u2019s true that the enviroment affects us and thousands of other variables, but still, with all the limitations we have, we\u2019re always able to improve from there. A prisioner does not have the freedom to go to other places and help others, but inside his cell he can show the utmost kindess to his colegues, and this is an example how \u201cfree will\u201d is not limited by any specific circunstances.

            "answer_text": "By implying the term of free will, you mean something is bounded. The very idea of freedom comes from the idea of bondage. Now on a personal level you may feel that you are independent and master of your own destiny. But everything you do in life is dependent on many factors besides you. The clothes you wear, the food you eat, the water you drink, the house you live in, the relations you have are all dependent on other factors besides you. In fact the most basic thing fundamental to your survival is oxygen which the atmosphere provides. The atmosphere is dependent on earth\u2019s seasons which in turn are dependent upon sun (which is dependent upon the galaxy and so on). So you are not really independent, you only perceive so due to negligible visible importance of such larger picture in your daily life. Now, you may say that your decisions are your own, but they are dependent upon past experiences and present instincts that have been given by nature via ancestral DNA. So, the very idea that you are free is absurd. Your individual will is a millionth part of the will of the collective that drives you to take the individual steps that give you a sense of self control (or free will). You are driven if you believe that you are free of some restriction or free to do something as it gives a sense of dissociation from the collective while everything no matter how random, is interrelated in some way or the other.

Free will could be the result of deciding, where the process of deciding is a mathematically irreducible computation, meaning it is impossible to forecast the result without at least doing the full decision process.Hence I believe the question free will or deterministic universe is a false contradiction. I would also like to add that executing free will as experienced by most of us takes almost a second according to brain scans.Meaning reflexes are at best preset by free will, not executed by free will in the moment.Secondly, free will assumes the existence of will, which research has established to be a depletable ressource.Furthermore, most choices are not made consciously and so are not the result of a conscious free will.Obviously, choice can be made on any timescale and more or less consciously. So the question of free will or not is not correctly posed. Better questions could be:- How to measure the degree of free will in a given choice?- How to get a free-er will?- Are there bounds on the degree of free will? ",

            "answer_text": " Is there no free will?No, Due to two reasons there is free will 1. The Collective ConscienceThe clearest reason given by the supporters of free will: The \u2018universal\u2019 or \u2018collective\u2019 conscience of human beings. That is, no matter what we deny, we cannot deny the reality that in all human societies, including both the worshipers of God and the materialists, East and West, ancient and modern, wealthy and poor, developed or underdeveloped, of whatever culture, all without exception, agree that a law should rule human beings and that human beings are responsible before the law and people who disobey the law must be punished. The fact that we explain this as the general conscience of human beings of the world is the clearest proof of the existence of free will in human beings and the fact that they have free choice. It is interesting to note that those who believe in the school of fatalism, and give reasons for their belief, when they are faced with a real life situation, they act according to free will! For instance, if a person aggressors against them, or annoys or bothers them, they take this person to court and do not rest at ease until that person is punished. Well, if it is really true that a person has no choice or free will, what are all of this commotion and court and trial about? At any rate, this common conscience of the intelligent beings of the world is a living idea for the reality that human beings have accepted the existence of free will in the depths of their being and have always been loyal to that. They cannot live without the belief in free will for even one day. This belief has caused the wheels of social and individual programs to progress. 2. JusticeHow is it possible that God oblige someone to do an evil deed? Then punish him because he did it. This does not agree with any kind of logic! Thus, by accepting the school of fatalism, spiritual rewards, punishments, heaven and hell are meaningless as well as \u2018scroll of deeds\u2019, \u2018questioning\u2019, \u2018Divine reckoning\u2019, \u2018reprimanding the evil doers in the Qur\u2019an\u2019, \u2018encouragement and praise for those who do good\u2019, all of these lose their meaning. Because according to the school of fatalism, neither the good doers nor the evil doers have a choice. In addition, in religion, one of the first issues we encounter is \u2018duty\u2019 or \u2018responsibility\u2019, but does \u2018duty\u2019 or \u2018responsibility\u2019 make any sense if a person has no choice? Can we tell a person whose hands involuntarily shake not to shake their hands? Or can we tell a person who is falling down a steep mountain to stand still? It is because of this that Imam \u2018Ali, peace be upon him, says in a famous tradition (Usul al-Kafi, Vol. 1, p. 119) that the school of fatalism is a school of idol worship whose followers are members of Iblis(Satan)\u2019 party: \u201cThese words of idol worshiping brothers, enemies of God, members of Iblis\u2019 part.\u201d source: The Issue of Predestination and Free Will ",

            "answer_text": "I believe there is not such thing as free will. I am not talking from a conspiracy point of view. Humans are nothing but a collection of experiences. Experiences are external input that get processed on a subcouncious level. Meanning that every decision that you have made up to this point is the only decision you could have ever made on that specific moment. Let me explain that. Say that today you pass in front of a burning building, there are people inside that need saving. You have to options at this point: go inside and try to save someone or not go and let the firefighters take care of the issue since they are more qualified. Let's say ou decide not to go inside and wait for the firefighters. Later that night you discover that 2 people died on the fire and feel guilty because you could have done something to save at least one of them. Someone comes with a time machine and offers you a chance to go back to the moment you passed in front of the building. You travel in time and now go into the flames and save someone. This may seem as if you had free will to save someone or not at the time but the second time was different than the second one therefore you do have free will. But the previous example actually says that you don\u2019t. The first time you decided not to go into the building you had no idea that 2 people were going to die, you had no feelings of guilt attached to the action of not going into the building therefore you relied on every past experience that took you to the point where you were standing in front of the incident to decide it was a better idea to wait for the firefighters. This means that when you go back in time you are not making the decision on the same situation, you are making the decision based on the new information that two people had died and the guilt you feel because of it. Assume that the person who offered you the time mahine would have had one condition. You will travel in time back to the point of the fire but every memory pass that specific instant will be deleted from your brain. If that is the case you would have chosen again to wait and the two people would have died again. Simply because there would be no information in your brain to make you change that decision. If you take any ramdom year of your life let's say your 15th year, and change it entirely, you will probably be a completely dufferent person than you are today. Every decision you make, even if it seems that you have many option is the inly decision you can make in that specific moment that the options were presented to you. So no there is no free will at least not the way you think about it. Every decision and the very escence og who you are is predetermined by all the external input in the form of experience up to that point. ",

            "answer_text": "Free will is loosely defined abstract based on other loosely defined abstracts. It means you are able to make choices - but what exactly makes \"you\", \"being able to\" and \"choices\"? You can bend those definitions to your need, whether you want to believe in free will or not.  For example if you assume there has to be a core of personality independent of every external factor (like genetics and upbringing) to make choices - free will is only possible with assumption of existence of some kind of a soul or spirit that can operate on it's own. \"Bob chose to go to church\" in that case means that either Bob's soul's true nature made him go to church and the whole world could only affect his decision to some degree, or - souls don't exists, Bob was programmed by his parents to go to church and the sentence is a lie. However, if you can consider a person as whole, including all effects of external events, a grand sum of genetics, upbringing, environment, recent actions, metabolism and so on - so defined actor can make choices and it's compatible with determinism.  \"Bob decided to go to church\" in this case are just another words to say \"Bob went to church because he was raised in religious family\" because it just means \"Out of a complex being we call Bob, the part that was determined by religious upbringing played major role in making decision to go to church. But that is still a part of Bob's nature so it's still his choice\".   So, words are kind of elastic and with little effort you can bend them to have fit any approach. The question is - which approach is better. In my opinion, philosophy should eventually answer \"so what should I do with that?\" rather than \"how do we name stuff?\" question.In this case, it means \"How should I treat people if they have free will? How should I treat them if they don't?\". And it much depends on your political views and how you imagine the world you'd like to live and the world that you'd rather avoid. In a world where people assume that other people have free will: It's reasonable to reward and punish people for good and bad deeds just for the sake of justice and fairness.It makes sense to tell people truth and let them make choices.Choices that people made are a good reason to love them or hate them, fight or support them.Manipulating peoples may be ethically wrong.In a world where people assume that other people have no free will: People do not really deserve either rewards or punishment, prisons are only means for other peoples safety and rewards are only a tool of motivation. It's more important to educate people and eliminate pathologies that make people do bad things in the first place.It makes sense to more or less subtly make people do what's best for them.Whenever possible we should equally treat people who made good and horrible choices - they were all just programmed to do so and maybe just need to be reprogrammed to make better ones.We cannot avoid manipulating people and we should only consider if we push them in the right direction.",

This is a self-con because free will is literally defined by confidence. Not having confidence in free will leads to demoralization and belief in fatalism. Whereas confidence and mindfulness (presence of mind) can lead to free will, for all intents and purposes. Through high-level psychoeducation and therapy, you alter the pool of likely heuristic responses to a given situation. So, direct free will may not exist, because the brain may make decisions before we are conscious of those decisions, but indirect free will exists in a reciprocal relationship because we can alter the rules with which the brain makes decisions. Thus free will exists. Chicken or the egg paradox does not apply because the brain has to process a brand new reality every moment.

            "answer_text": "My take on Free Will (FW) is that really it's a verb, a behaviour that occurs. You can't put \"a\" Free Will into a box. FW isn't a 'thing' you can find somewhere if you cut open a brain or looked under a microscope. FW only applies, by definition, to certain objects: specifically living objects. FW is a concept. It is a concept (verb, behaviour) performed by specific objects.  The question is WHY? Why do we apply this term to human beings, or perhaps insects or trees, but not rocks? This is what I think: as an object in and of itself (i.e. not dissecting us into smaller parts), a human shows a type of motion that's of a higher order of unpredictability than inanimate objects like rocks, shoes, atoms. And more complex even than living things like trees or bacteria. But I think 'life' is really the beginning of Free Will because the motion displayed by living objects is unpredictable, and there's a scale of complexity here that goes from purely gravitational, through atomic, through molecular (i.e. chemical) right up to \"life\".  Here's my stab at it:  \u2013 L1 motion : Gravitational : Inanimate. Rocks, shoes, planets. Hyper predictability. Completely slave to gravitational forces. I drop a ball, it falls as expected. It doesn't spontaneously fly away or stop rolling or jump.   \u2013 L2 motion : Atomic : Inanimate. Hyper predictability, but not explicable ONLY by gravitational forces. E.g. bonding (covalent, ionic). Perhaps electrical, magnetic.   \u2013 L3 : (Inter)molecular : Inanimate. Still a prredictable motion. Molecular structures, inter-molecular bonding. Not entirely explicable by gravitational or atomic forces, but require studying molecular transformations.   \u2013 L4-L5 : Life and/or 'Free Will' : Animate (aka \"volition\"). Motion \"willed by\" a brain. What we internally experience as 'choice' (subjective, irrelevant). We 'choose to' stand or jump against gravity, i.e. we objectively can act against (unpredictably) the external G, A, M forces, while a corpse (predictably) cannot. Highest level of unpredictability.  Note that we must NOT do mereology in order to understand this. It is easy to argue that we never \"really\" escape Gr, At or Chem forces because we are also made of the same atoms, molecules etc \u2013 and thus there is some internal chain of events that must be an explanation for the \"seeming\" magical act of \"defying\" gravity e.g. when we stand or jump. However, this goes into nonsensical and circular Free Will vs Determinism arguments, which are heavily influenced by religion.  We escape this mereology and contradiction by remembering that we are talking about the object 'human being' or 'rock' in totality, not its constituent parts or internal functions. We're interested in the net result, the objective behaviour. In order to explain the behaviour of a given object, we must take that object as its whole, else we contradict ourselves and end up in murky water. Of course gravity and atomic forces act on us perpetually, just as chemical and electrical and magnetic ones do. But for the purpose of explaining Free Will scientifically i.e. objectively, we ignore internal processes. Because the focus of the study, of the main question, is the behaviour of the specific object in its entirety.  To conclude: Free Will is the highest level (L4) of unpredictable motion that living objects such as humans have acquired organically; behaviour which cannot ALONE be explained by purely gravitational, atomic, or chemical events. There is a unique internal physical process going on that allows the object in question to temporarily fight against EXTERNAL push-pull influences in a highly unexpected fashion. ",

            "answer_text": " \u201cOf course we have free will. We have no choice\u201d - Christopher Hitchens Leaving aside how I loved his wit, irony and charisma, it certainly feels like we do. However, a number of neurologists disagree with that. Given that I just quoted Hitchens, I can\u2019t refrain from talking about Sam Harris[1][2], another of the four horsemen. Basically the idea is that it is possible to demonstrate experimentally how your brain does all the deciding before you\u2019re even aware of it. The argument goes all the way back to Laplace\u2019s Demon[3] and the notion of causal determinism. In a nutshell, the argument goes like: if there was such an entity (the demon) that knew at any given moment the position and momentum of every particle in the universe, it could theoretically predict the future as all those particles would have one, and only one way of moving forward, given their position, momentum and the laws of physics. The argument has been stretched to the brain and consciousness because they are (or arise from) a physical system that, as complex as it may be, has to follow exact laws, even if we don\u2019t know them exactly at this time. Now, some have started introducing the concept of quantum physics to consciousness[4] as well (not like Deepak Chopra, I\u2019m talking about serious scientists, the likes of Sir Roger Penrose[5][6] or Jim Al-Khalili[7][8][9][10]). Of course, several interpretations of quantum mechanics also leave space for hidden variables and an underlying determinism[11], like De Broglie-Bohm\u2019s or the most mainstream Many worlds interpretation so it\u2019s still entirely possible. To recap: feels like we do, but most of what we\u2019ve discovered so far seems to point out that we really haven\u2019t. In the end, it remains to be seen. Stay tuned.

            "answer_text": "What does \u201cfree will\u201d mean? Practically speaking, from a legal standpoint it means that an individual makes an individual and relatively uncoerced action, and so should be held responsible for the consequences of that action. Whether the purpose of the justice system is punative, or to isolate individuals who are likely to harm others this notion of free will would exist even in a strictly deterministic universe. (However we don\u2019t, I should mention, live in a strictly deterministic universe) Neurologically, many of our decisions are made first, and then justified later by our neocortex. This argument regarding free will assumes that \u2018free will\u2019 is identical to neocortical processing and the conscious mind, which one might disagree with. It also disregards possible neocortical feedback after the fact. When you have to make a split second decision, you may make that decision based on instinct. But when you have time later to consider your decision, there\u2019s the potential to alter your instincts. For those who consider \u2018free will\u2019 to be identical to neocortical processing, this allows free will to exist. ",

            "answer_text": "this is a question that carries so much with four simple words. it puts our whole being into question. what you just ate for breakfast, the clothes you put on, the song you listened to on the way to work, were they all your own choices? your first instinct would be \u2018yes, of course\u2019 but think about it. Was anyone else eating breakfast with you? did you just have what they had. were the clothes just on the top of the pile in your cupboard or maybe even your friend had recommended the song to you day one. All these things need to be taken into consideration when thinking about whether your choices are free. The truth of the matter is that we can all be influenced. we are all susceptible to it. That\u2019s why marketing is such a huge industry. They know that if you see a celebrity using a particular product or wearing a certain brand it will make you want to get it too because you feel it will make you more like that person. We are influenced every single day either subconsciously or consciously we are. We even change to fit in to our surrounding we act how society feels people should act, sometimes when we are unaware. Influence is strong in society and always will be. I do believe that free will exists but I also feel that we as humans have become too lazy, too lazy to think and feel for ourselves without the fear of being mocked or rejected. This fear causes us to conform and change. We wear the clothes that society say is \u2018in\u2019, we listen to music that society says is \u2018the best\u2019 and we act how society says is \u2018normal\u2019. All these things are what makes us lose touch with the notion of free will. I don't feel anyone can ever truly answer this question as how are we to know whether a choice we make is our own or if its influenced or predetermined. But it is fascinating to think about. ",

There have been even studies showing that our \"decisions\" can be detected some miliseconds before we actually verbalise our became aware of them.  I think Sam Harris nails it in this lecture:  If you don't wanna watch the video, here's an interesting piece of it; he proposes a thought exercise, which is this: think of a city, any city. So a name of a city comes to your mind. Maybe three: Paris, London and New York, and then you finally go with London. But did you actually chose that these three would be the \"ones to chose from\"? Why not Moscow? Why not Chicago? Why not Dublin or Glasgow? Did Ruanda or Cairo even pop into your head as an option? Was that by any means conscious to you? Or were throse three cities the candidates because of some pre-existent conditioning that made them \"fresh\" into your mind, maybe places you wanna go, or places you went recently or read about. So, how free were you to chose \"any\" city if those three came in first and you simply ruled out (unconsciously) all the others? ",

According to multiverse theory, every decision we make creates a new alternate universe wherein you did not make that decision (by the way, pretty cool theory. Means there is an infinite number of universes where you are the lizard king of cartel-ruled north Columbio). Where I get fuzzy is this : which universe is this? Did you create the other universe, or did the other universe create you? You know that both universes share a history of decisions, or you wouldn't have to make that same decision (obviously the lizard king of north Colombo has different stuff to worry about than you), so did you make a decision, or did a decision make you?

            "answer_text": "Viewing the individual from the outside, his behavior is determined by various factors, and is, in theory, predictable. So the determinist says, behavior is predictable, there is no free will. Viewed subjectively, from the point of view of the individual actor, he appreciates being free to make his own choices. So, if I have a glass of whiskey every evening at 6 pm, the determinist says, my behavior can be predicted based on heredity, habit, culture, family dynamics, and so on, therefore I do not have free will. I say, I am freely choosing to have my evening whiskey. My free will would be impaired if my wife poured out the whiskey before I could drink it. Theologically, the concept of free will is a response to the problem of evil. If God is all good and all powerful, why is there evil in the world? Answer: because God allows us to exercise \u201cfree will.\u201d If I go to murder my wife, God does not paralyze me or strike the gun from my hand. So the murder is my fault. And since God purposely refrained from making us his puppets, my evil deed is not a flaw in his creation. The determinist, on the other hand, says, the murder was predictable, a product of my nature and the circumstances, so where\u2019s my free will? I suspect he might be right. But, taken to the extreme, this could suggest that my evil deed was \u201cwritten\u201d or \u201cfated\u201d and I had no choice in the matter. Perhaps I should not even be punished! Yet that seems an odd conclusion. And it\u2019s wrong. One of the many factors that goes into my behavior is the judgment of other humans. If I hurt my wife, I might go to prison. My children might never speak to me again. If I\u2019m religious, I might fear God\u2019s judgment as well. So if the threat of punishment or disapproval were removed, there would be more bad behavior. Human society works because we hold each other responsible for our actions, and we should continue to do so \u2014 regardless of whether philosophers tell us those actions are \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cdetermined.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I will try to answer. I tend to believe that free will does not exist, but it is very difficult to prove if exist or not.  Our actions, are in part determined by some genetic lottery that determines how strong we could be, or how weak, within some natural constrictions that can be random, sometimes. But besides the genetics you have, there are social arguments to determine the probability of a having some social rank, high or low.   All these are variables we rarely know a priori. The fact that I, a person of very low social class, would be here writing is a rare combination  of variables, that would had been impossible to predict.  The generation previous to mine in my family only a few went to school.  And those that went stayed there a couple of years.  I had to be raised by an aunt, that do not read, but were very talkative, and I believe she was intelligent as well for her social class and education.  I was not to school till age 9.  For my aunt do not believed it was very necessary.     A my aunt was very talkative, she made me also a child very talkative.  She worked sawing clothes with a machine and entertained herself making me to speak.  Then, when I was put in a boarding school, a terrible experience, I had some advantage over other children that had little capacity for speaking.  My experience of being talkative resulted in having a verbal memory well over the rest of the class.  I discovered as well, that it was easy for me to learn arithmetic and to solve problems.  I let everybody to copy my problems and my little blackboard passed to the desk behind and all the children of the class were copying the solutions of the problems I made.  I was always correct, for my ability with language made it easier to understand the logic of arithmetic problems.   As I was a boy with little social abilities, most of my free time was invested in thinking about the questions of the little encyclopedia.  I was discussing those  arguments, and sometimes trained to challenge some points.  Then, as nobody  in the school love to chat, I had to chat with myself. This facto was casual, but determined that I would like to read books, that was a way of hearing someone chatting.  But this was a lot later, for in the school do not existed any library.  Even if I had to work as common worker in construction sites, my love to read books was not extinguished.  I think this trait was caused by living for many years with a talkative aunt, that made me talk a lot.  But she loved to hear me talk.  He praised me a lot for that.  Then, I was very flattered of being so talkative.  If my aunt would had been laconic and would hate children that speak too much, she would probably had insulted  me or slapped me, if I ever uttered a word I had learned during the summer in the house of my granddad.  Then, I see that this question of my talkativeness was determinant by the influence of my aunt that could not read a paper.  Several aunts and uncles did not know to read.  If i would had not been put in the boarding school for some reasons I would not explain... I would be a simply story teller.  In rural environments it was used to call a story teller to tell stories while they were remove the grains of the maize. This is an odious labor that is taken easily if you are hearing  tales from a good storyteller.  Summing up and starting to become a little abstract. We are all conditioned, but not by a single agent.  Then, even if several agents, three, four, five,  ten, etc. are influencing over you... the effect of the different agents is not the same, or have the same weight.  It depends on the quality of the influence of each agent, and the time each was acting over you.   The result of the different agents acting over your brain, create a mixture of actions you can perform.  Even the attitudes that will be dominant in your life.  The result is a mixture of different behavioral probabilities of your acting.  These probabilities cannot be predicted but in statistical terms. In the same manner we cannot predict which atom would emit a photon between time t1 and t2, we cannot predict with certainty what would be the behavior of a person between a short interval of time, but on statistical grounds. But even then, the precision of our predictions would depend on the statistical knowledge of his behavior.  Then, the acts of a person are determined by some previous agents that had influenced by some previous agents that work on them.  This is called in general, education.  Then, an agent that is religious could push a kid to be religious and to say religious phrases.  But a different agent can work at contrary, and thus, the probability of the behavior of a child is more or less unpredictable.   We can say the actions of a person is predetermined by external agents, in an analogical way as he learns the language.  If he is hearing people around him speaking in French, he would speak French and not Chinese.  For a child to be speaker of Chinese he must live among people that speak Chinese.  Then, if there is some determinism with the language it must exist some determinism with the behavior.   If a child is reared to be meek and tender, and sweet, it would not become a Thailand boxer, that requires a lot of adrenaline and courage, and some capacity to take powerful hits.  Then this question of the behavior is determined by some early  experience.  But from where comes all this noise of conservatives defending that exist a free will?  I had known some people, priests and political revolutionaries, that defended the notion of \"free will\", precisely because they wanted to change my mind on something and make me act according to his wishes.   This is a paradox.  Those that wanted to enslave me to god, or to a revolution, were preaching the existence of \"free will\", like telling me:  \"You can abandon your own path and come to my house to do what I would order you.\"    Then, their defense of my freewill was an intent of changing my behavior.  They were trying to make me his slave.   Once I would join the side of god, I would become the slave of god, or the spokesman of god. Or in the case of a revolutionary, I would had become a slave of the revolution.   Then, the people that defends the existence of \"free will\" pretend to domesticate you and make of you an slave.   Those that say \"there is not freewill\" are accepting that you are not a child anymore, and thus you  had been domesticated already by other people and let you live in peace with your own determined behavior.  then, it exist the question  of the state punishing some actors that commit some crimes.  They punish them for it exist a war between the state and the enemies of the state.  The criminals are the enemies of the state.   I said this because I watched a video about the life of Tamerlane (Tam\u00fcr-e lang), Timur the Lame.  Tells the legend that he started his life as a robber of sheep and horses.  After he gain much experience he formed a gang of bandits robbing, and after more time he had made a whole army and formed the Timurid Empire of Persia and central Asia.  Many of ancestors of our aristocrats started as robbers and pirates.  They eventually created empires and conquered whole nations     The state is doing its best to stop the career of those robbers, for if let to act free, they would end creating an army and would defeat the upper classes.

            "answer_text": "Yes of course free will exists. You demonstrate that every time you enter the voting booth or order from a menu. If you had to fly south for the winter or hibernate or had some other innate characteristic that compelled you to do something then you could question the existence of the free will. I have answered a similar question here before but the question was more like \u2018why did God give us a free will and allow us to sin\u2019? To me the real question is \u201cwhy do we have a free will\u201d? And I believe the best answer to that question is a theological answer. First of all you have to remember that the bible says God made man in his image and likeness. Well, part of he image and likeness of God in man is the free will. According to the bible no one made God give up his son. He did it of his own free will. And no one made his son lay down his life. He did it of his own free will. Everyone has heard the most famous scripture verse \u201cfor God so loved the world that he gave (of his own free will) his only begotten son\u2026. That\u2019s in John 3:16. His son said \u201cno man takes my life from me, I lay it down (again, of his own free will). Now according to Jesus, when the religious leaders came to him and asked him what was the greatest commandment he said, \u2018Thou shall love the lord thy God with all thy heart, mind, soul and strength. This is the first and greatest commandment\u2019. So what you see here is that God made a plan of salvation for his creation because of his great loved for us. \u201cfor God so loved\u2026.\u201d. and when you look at the first and greatest commandment it is for us to love God with our \u2018all in all\u2019. So the idea is that the only way God could get that kind of love from his creation was to get it freely given from man. Just like God freely gave his son and his son freely gave his life. In other words God wanted us to love him but he didn\u2019t want that love innate or built in to us so we would have to love him. He wanted that love freely given to him from us and the only way he could assure that that love was freely given was to give his creation a \u2018free will\u2019. So, I believe that is why we have a free will. So that leads to the question, \u2018If God knows everything then why did he give man a free will and allow him to sin and if God knows everything is there really a free will?\u2026\u2026\u2026 Questions I have tried to answer here on this site\u2026\u2026. if your interested go take a look.

            "answer_text": "According to the person who asked the question- Determinism is the opposite of free will.So if my actions can't be determined, I have free will? To prove that my actions can be determined, you bring in the laplace's demon which knows all the past in the universe including every aspect of mine and also all the laws of the universe.But I know that the demon is trying to determine my move, so to throw it off I will include some counter intuitive decisions in making my move and throw some decisions to chance and take the help of someone else in making some decisions. The demon also knows all other people in the world and it knows I m trying to throw it off by leaving things to chance, and yet it can't do anything about it. So the demon can't figure out my move. There is no determinism. But does this mean I have free will?  My move is dependent on all my experiences and knowledge and influences. Even if it can't be determined exactly- my move is based on external influences and forces. Its not really free. What does this imply?Nothing. So what if all your actions are dependent on the past experiences and knowledge and influences? That is who we are - we are the sum of our past and more. This free will or no free will is unimportant. Its just semantics much like theists and atheists who are pretty much the same, one thinks its too much of a coincidence, one thinks- with quintillion galaxies with trillion stars each- it was about time life developed on a planet somewhere.

            "answer_text": "Answer: No (tl;dr at the bottom) I think an important thing to start with when discussing such a topic is to define some of your terms I shall define \u201cfree will\u201d as the ability to make a decision such that you could have chosen otherwise. (I must thank Matt Acutt for this succinct definition) The only other term I think I will need is \u201cself\u201d. As I define this term it should hopefully become clear why I hold my current view point on free will. My definition of self is likely very similar as others, with one small caveat. I believe that if you are exactly the same person presented with exactly the same decision and given exactly the same information you will make exactly the same choice. Since the choice you made is based on your current beliefs and desires, that means that you ability to make a decision is directly tied to your current beliefs, and desires. And where did you get those beliefs and desires? You got them from your experiences, and the experiences of those around you. Sure it may seem like you have control of which experiences you have, but the experiences you choose are again directly influenced by your previous experiences. You can follow this all the way back to the very first thing you ever experienced, likely before you were even born. In my opinion the free will debate was never about your ability to make a decision, that is a given. The debate is about whether you were ever able to make a different decision from the one you think is best based on your current self. tl;dr Your decisions are based on your beliefs, your beliefs are based on your experiences, and the experiences you have were outside your control until long after your self was defined. Yes you chose to eat spaghetti for dinner, but you were always going to chose that based on who you were in the moment. ",

            "answer_text": "Does free will exist? According to the best minds of western philosophy it does not. Here is how Arthur Schopenhauer puts it: \u201cThe strict and absolute necessity of the acts of Will, determined by motives as they arise, was first shown by Hobbes, then by Spinoza, and Hume, and also by Dietrich von Holbach in his Syst\u00e8me de la Nature; and lastly by Priestley it was most completely and precisely demonstrated. This point, indeed, has been so clearly proved, and placed beyond all doubt, that it must be reckoned among the number of perfectly established truths, and only crass ignorance could continue to speak of a freedom, of a liberum arbitrium indifferentiae (a free and indifferent choice) in the individual acts of men.\u201d Excerpt From: Arthur Schopenhauer. \u201cThe Basis of Morality.\u201d iBooks. David Hume and Arthur Schopenhauer explained why this concept is so difficult to understand. When you study each explanation what you will find is there is a lot of agreement between them in how human action is determined by feelings. In my mind Arthur Schopenhauer is much more thorough and difficult on this. I view him as adding to Hume and not correcting. I live by the law; be most suspicious of anyone who claims to have corrected David Hume. I tolerate Arthur Schopenhauer when he lets on how he corrects Hume (he does this several times and he does it in topics of free will) by giving him the benefit of the doubt but I still study Hume\u2019s views. I claim that you can study David Hume\u2019s views on why the doctrine of \u201cfree will is absurd in one sense and unintelligible in any other\u201d in light of evolution, as you observe important problems of this world and listen to or read the comments of current social scientists, and understand social science to be literally shot to hell. Turning to the mentor to Kant he says the great one solved the riddle of free will \u201c\u2026through the distinction he drew with profound acumen, between phaenomena and the Thing in itself (das Ding an sich). This distinction is the very core of his whole philosophy, and its greatest merit.\u201d I you read him closely you get ideas; the number of feelings from weak (morals) to strong (passions) any human can have is limited; it doesn't take an astronomical number of feelings to make an active human being. Feelings such as courage or bravery in the face of danger, the parents play a big role. All feelings are subject to be cultivated or stimulated but courage is one that is most subject to cultivation and passion for sex is most subject to stimulation. Of course I don\u2019t know what I am talking about, this is a note to work with passages [of] this nature: \u201cThe individual, with his immutable, innate character strictly determined in all his modes of expression by the law of Causality, which, as acting through the medium of the intellect, is here called by the name of Motivation,\u2014the individual so constituted is only the phaenomenon (Erscheinung).\u201d Excerpt From: Arthur Schopenhauer. \u201cThe Basis of Morality.\u201d iBooks. We are all a phenomenon according the above. Our will is of the human will but we are not all of the same set of feelings we just get our feelings from the human set. Our feelings of love and protection or sex is pretty much distributed equally and are identical we only have different strengths of these by differences of cultivation or stimulation. All feelings would be subject to cultivation or stimulation but each phenomenon may have a different set from the big set; some feelings are shared by all and some are not. No one knows/determines what one gets from the human set but the best way to view it is, it is a process similar to \u201cthe roll of the dice\u201d. Enough of the abstract where we don\u2019t have a clue what is being said. Lets get into the simple abstract where we can make some hay. Hume said \u201c\u2026we may assign three reasons for the prevalance of the doctrine of liberty, however absurd it may be in one sense, and unintelligible in any other.\u201d I will discuss the first one because I know Arthur Schopenhauer agree as he said the same thing only different words. \u201c\u2026After we have performed any action; though we confess we were influenced by particular views and motives; it is difficult for us to persuade ourselves we were governed by necessity, and that it was utterly impossible for us to have acted otherwise; the idea of necessity seeming to imply something of force, and violence, and constraint, of which we are not sensible. Few are capable of distinguishing betwixt the liberty of spontaniety, as it is called in the schools, and the liberty of indifference; betwixt that which is opposed to violence, and that which means a negation of necessity and causes. The first is even the most common sense of the word; and as it is only that species of liberty, which it concerns us to preserve, our thoughts have been principally turned towards it, and have almost universally confounded it with the other.\u201d Excerpt From: David Hume. \u201cA Treatise of Human Nature.\u201d iBooks. No human likes to be controlled. It is human to be free to act as feelings dictate. When we are free to act we act based upon our feelings and we feel free but technically speaking we are not free but act according the the particular \u201cphenomenon\u201d we are. We are happy when no outside forces are determining our behavior but we are happy slaves as we are still dictated in our actions by our feelings. To put it differently; when we are free to act as we feel we confusing what is actually acting out of necessity by our inner feelings with spontaneity. Because spontaneity in action is same thing as happiness in action, we feel we are free when Benjamin Franklin\u2019s wisdom is in play but we are not we are simply acting by our feel rather than someone\u2019s else's, thus happy. This is getting into the power of Smith\u2019s invisible hand but I must stop it here. Before I go I will give Schopenhauer\u2019s words that say the same thing as the above. This is a critical step in the critically important process of integration of philosophy: \u201c\u2026it is true that our actions are attended with a consciousness of independence and original initiative, which makes us recognise them as our own work, and every one with ineradicable certainty feels that he is the real author of his conduct, and morally responsible for it. But since responsibility implies the possibility of having acted otherwise, which possibility means freedom in some sort or manner; therefore in the consciousness of responsibility is indirectly involved also the consciousness of freedom. The key to resolve the contradiction, that thus arises out of the nature of the case, was at last found by Kant through the distinction he drew with profound acumen, between phaenomena and the Thing in itself (das Ding an sich). This distinction is the very core of his whole philosophy, and its greatest merit.\u201d He says the same thing as Hume but he gets into \u201cthe thing in itself\u201d as [the] determination of actions. He brings to mind, as I tried to explain above, a set of feelings that makes a human will and there is [room, process, means, way] for difference of inner character by a different adoptions of feelings from the set. If this is true or if I am making sense, most people say it is genetics that determines the set of feelings the individual gets from the big set. In light of Adam Smith\u2019s system and recent history where different Peoples have accomplished amazing feats understood as far as how by Adam Smith, I don't think people with this view are thinking this thing through.

Words are circular - they use other words to describe themselves. They are all members of a closed system. Take the word person - and the \"real\" person.

Obviously that is not true in the real world - but it comes up in the mathematical world. In these worlds that humans have constructed, in their minds, everything is linked to everything else - so there must be no free will. According to word descriptions everything is linked to everything else. However, when it gets right down to it - these descriptions fail to solve some rather important details - like - why does the universe exist at all - ( our \"systems\" want to describe a first event - but can't - in fact in our systems it is impossible - as everything is linked. ) Therefore - using the systems we have today - we cannot know.

If there is a script, than why even care about said choices? Maybe the vanity portion of our intellect convinces us that it still matters, that our thoughts and intuition may allow us to make the right decisions amongst stacks of wrong ones. I mean is there even a right or wrong choice without the ability to decide it? I think there lies our answer. Scripted or not, we choose because we are able, because we must. And those choices define us. Furthermore, in suggesting that the same decisions would be made repeatedly, all variables remaining the same, I'd still question why. Where as hindsight is 20/20, would I make a wrong choice indefinitely because I lacked the foresight? Are we saying that Neo wasn't the one? No anomalies, no margin of error? That sounds like a box, built around a free mind, body, and spirit that was here long before that box was even a thought. No free will? Where's your imagination? ",

            "answer_text": "Chapter I Free will is a problem, which worries us all because not only it affects our morality and judgement of someone conducting amoral and even violent acts, but also free will is what makes up our personality, our feeling of self. Without it, we are merely biological robots with an illusion of being in charge of something. Simply put - Within a physical system everything is predisposed, in other words, all events possess causal events that precede them in time. Some say it can be true for the classical Newtonian system and Quantum Mechanics proves the existence of free will, but this is plain wrong. First of all, we aren\u2019t sure of the nature of QM, there are different interpretations. For instance, Bohmian interpretation is deterministic and completely neglects the probabilistic nature of the Copenhagen interpretation. If the latter is true, you still don\u2019t get free will by any means. In this case, so-called free will becomes a result of probabilistic events and you aren\u2019t in charge of them. It has been around for ages. The key point is that if you know all the properties of the current state, you can calculate precisely what is going to happen in the future. Thinkers back in the days used a demon or some super-intelligent theoretical creature, which could do the task. Now we can call it a super-computer, nothing\u2019s changed since then really. Many people do not realize this problem is bound to consciousness and interactional epiphenomenalism. I.E The brain affects conscious states and vice versa, consciousness also affects the brain. While this stance really begs a good clarification and studies, we already know certain conscious states have their respective neural correlates (just for the sake of simplicity let\u2019s avoid details here). Thus, doing different mental tasks result in activating different brain areas. Whether it\u2019s a good argument for the interactional nature of consciousness or not, we need to determine what sparkles an intentional action. There are three possibilities. You believe you have free will and also a capacity to execute it.You believe things, including your brain and voluntary actions, are inevitable and already determined years ago.You are compatibilist, admitting the existence of both free will and inevitability.The first variant is dubious and arbitrary, why? Because it involves a kind of \u201cmagical force\u201d - a conscious decision, which affects matter and is capable of altering neural activity. This raises a couple of problems. A) A conscious decision can\u2019t fit within the materialistic framework because it\u2019s undefinable, irreducible and a non-physical state. To affect matter you need to have matter itself. B) We don\u2019t have an established scientific model of how consciousness changes matter, though some clear indications exist many thinkers are unaware of, or they simply dismiss them.  Chapter II In the 80s, Benjamin Libet conducted experiments which are still debatable years later. He was a pioneer to scientifically determine if a voluntary decision was conscious, or unconscious and then translated as conscious without being aware of it. Libet asked subjects to flex their wrist a number of times whenever they wished and measured the time at which the action was executed, the brain activity in motor cortex and the time at which the subjects decided to act consciously. The settings of the experiments were easy, he put electrodes on the wrist to detect the action through electromyography (EMG) and put another set of electrodes on the scalp to record the activity using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG records a signal also called readiness potential (RP), which is gradually increasing. To measure a conscious decision, he placed a clock in front of the subjects and they had to follow the hand of the clock and remember where the spot was when they made a decision. Therefore, after the experiment, they could report the place of the hand and determine the time of the decision. Libet asked what happened first in time, the readiness potential (brain activity) or a conscious decision? A decision happened 200 milliseconds before the action, but the readiness potential started 350 milliseconds before that (i.e in total, 550 milliseconds before the action - wrist flexion). Simply put, the brain activity preceded the conscious decision to move. 550 milliseconds is nothing from our scale but for the brain, it\u2019s a very, very long time to conduct certain events at the molecular level. Again, we have some issues. This experiment was perceived as wrong and ridiculed by many. Dan Dennett argued that the validity of the timing of conscious desire to move should be doubted because Libet wasn\u2019t fully depended on objective measures and partly relied on subjective reports from the subjects. Dennett notes that the report is where it seems to the subject to have taken a decision, not the actual time, which has to be measured objectively. After all, visual inputs have to be processed first and there is no other way around besides the clock-dot method to measure the subjective decision. Well, there might be more sophisticated methods but they still have to rely on subjective reports and the input still goes through the same brain structures. So the gap between the decision and the readiness potential can probably be filled by this argument. Flexing wrists can\u2019t be compared to making complex decisions that involve personhood, the past, moral and other factors such as marriage or adopting pets. It would be a very trivial generalization to take for granted but the result is there nonetheless. Libet himself didn\u2019t claim anything over the topic, he never stated free will as an illusory misperception. I think, at heart, he knew something could be wrong with these experiments. He developed a new experiment in which subjects had to abort their movement. In other words, they terminated the conscious decision, this resulted in the following - The readiness potential began as normal, but gradually disappeared 200 milliseconds before the planned action. Libet called this phenomenon \u2018free won\u2019t\u2019. Chapter III To summarize those two experiments above, consciousness can\u2019t initiate a conscious decision to move, but it can prevent it. Thus, we still have the freedom to choose. Does it mean consciousness affect the brain, the matter? Yes.Does it fit within a deterministic physical system from orthodox physicists\u2019 standpoint? Apparently not. We may think this saves free will within the determined machine but free won\u2019t is still odd, because it involves consciousness, a non-physical \u2018force\u2019. (Don\u2019t get confused with pranic energy or similar mystical concepts, I just use those words to put it belletristically.)If there is a space for \u2018free won\u2019t\u2019 does it mean the first experiment could\u2019ve been wrong and we also have free will? Yes, absolutely.If we have free will/free won\u2019t, are we capable of executing the full potential of them in daily lives? I don\u2019t think so, we are so bounded by the events outside, free will is probably a prisoner. Of course, you can choose a colour of your shirt and that kind of stuff but from my point of view, that\u2019s not much. I hate labels as they are arbitrary and do not express my views completely but you could say, I am kind of compatibilist.",

            "answer_text": "In order to answer the question for yourself, answer these question? 1.)  Do you determine your genetic makeup?2.)  Do you determine your character?  By character I mean your starting traits and predispositions with which you react to environmental stimuli.3.)  Do you determine your initial environment (in the womb, in infancy, and formative years)? I happen to believe that the answer to all those questions is no.  Because of this, everything that we think WE do is really based on factors outside of our control.  We need not accept determinism necessarily, but we can say at the very least that our decision making power is HIGHLY constrained by an initial position outside of our control and thus reject free will insofar as free will means being able to act unconstrained.

            "answer_text": "Emotions express the necessity within our reality, feelings our freedom. If you consider the universe Alex Baker is right. For science our reality is deterministic. Althought quatics introduced the possibility of true randomness, there is absolutly no formula, no mathematical concept, no physical law or theory to support freewill. Freewill should be a mental construction, our unhability to forsee what already exists, the future. Philosophes and mystics share often another vision. The feelings, or the relation with God, are kind of break within the chance and necessity flaw, they build the miracle, the freewill. In fact as mammals we are submited to necessary emotions. But through feelings we can learn to tame them. The redemption and the feelings are for human minds, ways to create something brand free and new within their mind. Love as emotion has not a lot to do with love as feeling(sentiment). The first is an accident, the second a decision. This map shows how emotions realy link with body r\u00e9actions and activities.  Our thoughts, our words, our moods, our decisions and actions are deeply influenced by hidden causes we don\u2019t master. Epigenetics tend to demonstrate that the consequences of childhood misstreatements, can last for 5 generations, at least on rats. Feelings (sentiments in fact) are the way human beings learn to break the necessity and flow chain. Taming the emotions is great part of the process. So freewill makes human beings unique realities within the universe, as when they understand, they can decide freely. Understanding another human being however implies the ability to expand sentiments. The more you understand, the more you love; the more you love, the more you understand. They are two sides of one reality. The mind of love and the mind of understanding are the same. Without compassion and our ability to consider our neighbor as a goal and not a mere ressource, we just fall under determinism. What already exists is not an unique path, but a set of possibilites. We can crawl from one to another, however the sentiment of love is always a decision.  ",

            "answer_text": "We are the victims of our own existence. Some may reject this statement for moral or self-deluded reasons. The truth is we can\u2019t overlook the fundamental fact, the fact that there is no such thing as free will (I am discussing here from the ultimate perspective, not the proximal perspective). We exist in an existential box. Of course, the universe is very likely to exist as infinite and incomprehensible forms of reality (we can never know). We all, were born and will be born in a box that is constructed of time and space. The existence of time and space only make sense, however, (but does not depend on) when a human specie who can communicate with each other through a language exists and objects have the property of dynamic transformation or change. At the surface level (and even at more deeper levels), nothing is constant. The human perceived reality is a product of individual and collective consciousness and that consciousness is a created tool for evolutionary human specie to overly simplify its existence. Our body and brain are the product of chemical reactions and combinations triggered by energy. Energy is absorbed from the surrounding environments. Our consciousness is capable of operation only and only through the combination of the right chemicals and innate traits hiding in our cells. Our desires are always and randomly determined by biological mechanisms and processes within our biological brain or body. The truth is that every crimes people have committed or every donations that they have made were determined by their designated brain, the brain that has been developed for millions of years by evolution and several years by social and cultural experiences. Because of all these interactions between our evolutionary past and our current state of existence in ecological, social and political contexts, our free wills are ultimately shaped. Often, we confuse these determined freedoms with local (proximal) free wills, the free wills that are taken out of the context of other interrelated factors. Some argued, \u201cI can eat a pizza anytime I want or I can decide to never eat it until I die. This is my freedom to make a decision or fulfil my desire. Therefore, a free will exists within me.\u201d The funny thing is that they forget to consider what makes them want or need to eat that pizza or other foods in the first place. And also, we tend to ignore another parts that are affected while we try to pursue a supposed free will. Every action that is designed to make the human world a little better, that action is also equally and unintentionally designed to destroy another worlds that are socially, psychologically and physically distance from the human specie, directly or indirectly. It might be tempting to believe that we have the power to manipulate a goal and create a destiny. But if we dare enough to look past our personal ignorances or heuristic perceptions of the world, there are dead ends in all directions. We are born, matured and decayed in an existential box with no real way out. That\u2019s the main reason why people created or create religions, the symbolic realities that allow them to escape the box through their imaginations and rituals. If they keep believing in what they have created by engaging some kind of rituals or thoughts, one day it will make it hard for them to separate the symbolic reality from the physical reality. This might be a sign of mental illness if it is created by a person with the history of schizophrenia. But if several people join this kind of an imagined reality, then that reality is termed \u2018the higher truth of existence\u2019 of a religion. This is the first path, the path that denies reality or existential threats such as death by creating a symbolic/inter-subjective reality. The second path is to accept that we exist in a box with no way out and pay heavy prices through psychological torments. Every truth that we, as collective human civilisations, have ever dug up, one way or another, one time or another, end up as a simple or sophisticated illusion disguised as an absolute truth. Every accepted truth that any great scientist or philosopher has ever revealed is simply just another relative truth in a deeper dimension of reality. These people, in the end, not so different from those who choose to create or be part of a shared delusion. Just because we have the ability to measure, record, categorise and verbalise abstract ideas and concrete objects, does it mean that what our findings about the universe and the supposed reality are real or the absolute truth exists? The question is, do we even have the real ability to categorise? Or is it simply that we linguistically think and socially agree that we have? When we have been bathed in a bath of illusory truths for too long, we can see no further bigger pictures of our own reality and reality of the world we are a part of. We can\u2019t see beyond of what we can perceive and sense or beyond of what we as a collective group have created throughout history. More than sometimes, we confuse the ultimate difference between human created or percieved truths and the truth that is truely and absolutely universal that is extending beyond a collective, comprehensible mind of any species on earth. It is very painful once we have intellectually deported ourself out of the box, consciously and intentionally. There is no way back to blindness. At the first phase of realisation, past and future run over us while we are forced to carve millions and millions of coffin for our present moments. Our sense of present might inititally give way to uncontrollable thoughts that lead to decayed perception of the universe with dried tears or laughters. We have realised too much that we might become paralysed or overwhelmed for many days and nights. We might wish we can turn back the time when we can still exist within that box as an ignorant being with egoistic viewpoints toward outside world and our inner reality, so that we can freely allow our blood running through our veins whenever we are angry. But this is just a short-term wish. No one truely wants to be a blind bat forever. Knowing that truth reduces our ability to pause, and kiss. We have lost our attentional ability that is designed to focus in the present. Everything we perceive become equally significance or insignificance at the same time. Our mind is invaded. Money and a raindrop has become equally meaningful or meaningless. A white rhino, the last of its kind, in the West Africa and a 1000 years old tree in the Amazon are equally important or unimportant. A red rose that we hold one morning and a beautiful lady we speak to one evening are equally attractive to our heart or insignificant to our soul. This is because that realisation has removed our ego and we become part of the universe. Every objects and subjects become equal without a little bit of discrimination. You can find us as a green grass under a soldier\u2019s boot or as a crown on a queen\u2019s head. Nothing is specific and nothing is concrete. There is no black or white. Everything converge into the same entity and that entity has no fixed names or fixed values. Life and death becomes the same source of pain at that point. The truth is that entity itself is not even an entity in our mind. Realising that we can\u2019t live beyond the limited dimensional box is devastating yet it is necessary to for our authetic growth at the human level. Our highest self, a pure state of enlightenment, depends on that transition. Yet, enlightenment does not come easy. We have to pay the price with depression and helplessness to some stages. It always begins with a nihilistic phase of transition. It is not an easy fight. Once we let in the painful truth and once it spreads all over every part of our naive brain, we can\u2019t feel no more for some times. We have no feeling for our own existence. This is how it leads some men to behave in a risky way, to engage in a risky behaviour, just so that they can get in touch with their present again whether that behaviour leads to sadnesses or death. A high degree of excitement or where the line between life and death become very blurred, become the only source to awakening from a life of existential crisis. And some men, unless they meditate on inner peace or outer beauties and courageously accepting that existential truth, will gradually or suddenly lose control of their life. Once they lose their sense of belonging for too long, they want to disappear. Road to facing the brutal fact concerning our own existence does not only deprive us of our own present moments, that realisation also murders all our meaningful actions and beliefs. It is a dangerous path to walk alone. It requires us to meditate and practice self-control. We have to love more. Sacrifice more. Only that we can live a meaningless life filled with beauties. What is more scarier than being physically and mentally attacked by existential threats, on a daily basis? And what is more to lose or gain when there is nothing to lose or gain from the first day we are given a life? Mediating on truths and engaging in compassion and self-control may also be just another delusional acts at the deepest layers of higher and inconceivable truths yet they are all we have got. Or we can choose to become a monster in this dreamy reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Free will of human beings and foreknowledge of God Do we have free will? If human beings have free will, then it means that they can choose between various alternatives. And as long as the choice is thus open, it is undecided and unsettled, it is uncreated. It may fall on any one of the several alternatives; which that alternative would be is not known yet. It is known to none, not even to God; for if God knows it, it means that it is already fixed and the person has no choice. Thus if human beings have free will, none can have foreknowledge. These two things, God's foreknowledge, and human free will seem to be incompatible. Again this, one may argue that God knows all things of the past, present, and the future, but that he does not interfere in people's doing. Just as someone can make a guess about future happenings and the guess may turn out to be true, similarly, God can know of future events. But as He is the most perfect being, his guesses will invariably be correct. In this manner, God may know of the future without influencing human will. Now, if we examine this kind of reasoning carefully, we find that it is fallacious and does not really prove the thing that it apparently seems to do. The first point to be noticed here is that if guesswork must invariably be true, as we believe it to be in case of God, then it ceases to be guesswork. A guess implies some degree of doubt, and as God is supposed to have no doubts, in His case it is knowledge and not guesswork. Now for the sake of argument, let us say that God only knows the future action of human beings, but does not determine them. This, however, does not help us at all in settling the question of human free will, because even if God does not determine our future actions, but only knows them, the fact that they are determined remains. Knowledge of a thing presupposes its existence. Who determines them, whether our own nature through a long chain of cause and effect or an external agency, is immaterial; for inasmuch as they are already known, and thus fixed and not left to our free choice to be made at the moment of action, they are determined or predestined for us. If a thing must happen in a certain way, although that way is to be arrived at through a long and complicated process of various cause and effect operating at different times and in different places, if the things cannot happen otherwise, then certainly it is predetermined and fixed. Foreknowledge invariably and essentially implies predestination - the questions Whose foreknowledge? and Who predetermines? do not arise. The point seems to be quite clear; for obviously until the person who has to decide between two and different alternatives is born, the decision is not made, and any one of the various alternatives is possible; thus if the thing is undecided, that is, the decision is non-existent, how can it exist or be present in the mind of God or anyone else? The decision has yet to be made by the free will of the person who is yet to be born. So long as the person is unborn, his free will is also unborn, and consequently, his decision is also unborn; it is an uncreated state; it does not exist; it does not exist even in mind of God; that is, even God does not know of it, He has no foreknowledge. Thus to all appearances, it seems that either God has foreknowledge or human beings have free will. Both things cannot be so at the same time. If they are, then it is a great and important problem for us to know how much obvious contradictions can be reconciled. What sort of God do we have who knows what we are doing and what we shall do, and still leaves it to our free choice to do whatever we like? And what sort of creatures must we be? Free Will and determinism But if a human being has no free will, then everything is fixed for him. He has no choice, and therefore the question of right and wrong does not arise; as Immanuel Kant says: \"You must only if you can\". Consequently, there can be no reward and punishment, no morality, no striving or struggling, and no true action. We shall, in that case, be like machines, what the French philosopher Rene Descartes call automatons, which work automatically and mechanically. However, we do have some free will called as - conditioned free will. We are like in the middle of a chess game where our free moves are conditioned by previous moves (our destiny). ",

            "answer_text": "THE INNATE ORIGIN OF HUMAN FREE WILL 1. OUR TEACHER * All effects that have occurred or will ever occur must result from the original potential for them. That potential existed since the beginning. Much important potential remains with us today. We contain much more potential for learning. Who will teach us new knowledge? Do we teach one another? We feel that we teach. We talk and write and, because others appear to learn from us, we think that we are teaching them. It is believed that learning comes from the outside world. However, what we receive from others are only signs. The teacher and student are only exchanging photons. Photons are the particle nature of electromagnetism. The ongoing bombardment of a storm of photons does not deliver knowledge. That rush of wildly mixed innumerable bits of data doesn\u2019t teach us. Who then is our teacher? We are our teacher. We learn from innate knowledge. 2. THE EXISTENCE OF INNATE KNOWLEDGE The photons come like a turbulent wind. They are signs of events occurring in the outside world for which we must recognize meanings. The photons are not the events. They are tiny bits of data about changes of velocities of particles of matter that have participated in the events. Individual photons signify tiny pieces of a complex whole. It is their arrangements that signify events in the outside world. Those unique fleeting arrangements are what we have for guidance. We, subconsciously, try to fit meanings to them. We subconsciously choose from our innate knowledge the meanings that seem to best fit the photonic evidence for events of the outside world. It can often be easy to make correct associations. When our eyes are \u2018observing\u2019 events, our subconscious mind is working wonderfully well at telling our conscious mind what we are probably seeing. An incredible amount of data is being analyzed faster than we can see. This ability could not have been acquired by repetition. There has never been repetition. The photonic arrangements are never repeated. The signs are always new. We can pick out patterns in those arrangements only if we already know those patterns. We absorb the photons. We pick out the likely patterns. We do this instinctively. Instinctive behavior is evidence for the existence of innate knowledge. Instinct means that we have the knowledge necessary to carry out an act without having previously been made aware of it. It originates from inside us. Instinctual knowledge is innate. That innate knowledge is genetically delivered to us. We do not learn meanings from signs. Words, spoken or written or, what both are physically received as, patterns of photonic bits of data, are only signs. We provide the meanings. Knowledge of meanings must already be available to us before signs can point us toward them. Since we successfully interpret the photon storm, we can know that knowledge of meanings is innate. 3. COMMUNICATING WITH EMOTIONS When our subconscious mind accepts a conclusion, the conclusion becomes a conscious thought. An emotion is communicated along with the thought. Some conclusions are accompanied by a feeling of confusion. Others by a good feeling indicating they make sense. If it weren\u2019t for this feeling we wouldn't know the difference between a confident conclusion and a questionable one. This emotional stimulation is an important part of the means of communication between our subconscious and conscious mind. An example of emotion is the feeling of desire. We may desire a material object and upon gaining possession of it feel happy. We might smile or laugh, speak with excitement or shout triumphantly. We may gesture enthusiastically or perhaps even jump with delight. This kind of emotional feeling is tenuous. It is not the special emotion that I want to address. The special emotion identifies real happiness. It is an emotion that can point us to a universal truth. I will refer to it as joy. Joy is the feeling you experience while witnessing the birth of a loved baby. There are many examples that could be given; however, it is the uniqueness of the emotion that I wish to identify. The emotion is unique because of the responses it elicits from us. Its responses are opposite to those of the pleasure of gaining material possessions. These unexpected emotional responses are the means by which our subconscious mind differentiates between love\u2019s happiness and possession\u2019s happiness. Joy does not cause us to laugh. We instead tear up or cry. Joy does not cause us to squeal with delight. It cause us to become quiet. If we try to speak, we may find we have lost that ability. It does not cause us to leap into the air. It causes us to feel weak in the knees. It does not cause us to act proud and haughty. It reduces us to a posture of humility and humbleness. Joy is a wondrous example of our being directed toward a fundamental truth. It is an emotional response that lets us know that this is the real happiness we are destined to know. It is an example of our being internally directed to recognize universally set core values. It is not taught to us by other individuals. It came with us when we arrived. It is instinctual. Our emotion of joy teaches us our humanity. 4. INNATE KNOWLEDGE OF MEANINGS The concept of innate knowledge may seem uncomfortable for one trained to believe in a mechanical interpretation of the universe. However, which is more comfortable to say about our response to observing the universe? First, the universe exerted forces on us and parts of us changed their velocities. Or second, the universe communicated with us and we understood its meaning. The second description reflects our reality. The universe communicates with us and we communicate with it. The outside world is busy, and, our subconscious mind does not know what events are occurring. What it knows is that it receives data, and, it finds meanings for it. The data never stops coming. It is received and is compared to patterns and shapes stored in our subconscious mind. The subconscious mind searches for shapes that appear to be predominant. It attempts to find the most probable matches. There is incompleteness and discontinuity in photon data. That makes matching it against innate knowledge a trial and error prone process. The process is sometimes one of making a best guess. This is why optical illusions work. Even when we know the conclusion is wrong, our subconscious mind sometimes insists on its correctness. The result is that we continue to see the illusion instead of reality. Usually we perform better than that. Usually our subconscious mind delivers a vision that quite accurately portrays the outside world. Even then, it must overcome obstructions. Sometimes conscious thoughts are not accepted at face value. We can cause ourselves to think things through more thoroughly. The subconscious mind will then search longer for ideas that can improve the current level of thought. The search for best meanings can be left to stew subconsciously. A better conclusion might later burst forth as a conscious thought. Days may have passed without related thoughts, then suddenly our subconscious forces its new conclusion forward as a conscious thought. We are abruptly made aware of a better conclusion. Our mind may fill in, from its store of knowledge, what it deems to be missing meanings. For example, the mind anticipates change. That is the only kind of data it ever receives. This is why still pictures can be used to create the illusion of motion. Motion pictures do not include motion. The motion is formed in the mind. Our conclusion is wrong but our subconscious approved it. So we imagine the illusion and it becomes what we \u2018see\u2019. Our subconscious mind might fail to find meaning for the data. If our innate knowledge does not contain the necessary interpretation then, we cannot interpret that part of reality. All the senses can be working; however, the mind will not understand the data pertaining to that part of reality. The information is there. The senses are not the cause of failure. It is the missing innate knowledge that has failed us. If we do not innately know it, then we cannot consciously know it. Even when our minds contain the knowledge necessary to achieve understanding, we can fail to correctly interpret the information. The problem is that the data may be unclear. It is always imprecise. We do not experience exactness. The mind is the source of the concept of exactness because the data has never been communicated to us with exactness. Exactness is an innate idea. Continuity is also an innate idea. No living creature has ever seen a continuous line. The concepts of a line or of continuity in general are ideas that come from innate knowledge. Another example is changelessness. We have never received data about the existence of \u2018no change\u2019. The outside world data is always and only about change. The idea of changelessness is innate. We decipher the photon storm with all decisions being under our control. The conclusions reached are what we decide they will be. We control our thoughts. We are capable of breaking free from past modes of thought. We can endeavor to \u2018remember\u2019 undiscovered knowledge without the need for external signage. This self-stimulated process of discovery yields intuition. It yields foresight. People who discover these thoughts are sometimes described as having moments of brilliance. The benefit of self-stimulated access to innate knowledge is its potential for discovering advanced ideas. These ideas are the thoughts that free us from bondage to knowledge of the past and propel our thinking into the future. We can seek out these stored future thoughts if we will recognize that they are innately available waiting to be discovered. The universal cause of life gave us our innate store of subconscious knowledge and the emotions needed to confirm its presence. When our thoughts are guided along the emotion lined path of innate knowledge, we can learn to understand everything we are capable of knowing. Our innate knowledge is waiting to be \u2018remembered\u2019. 5. THE INNATE ORIGIN OF HUMAN FREE WILL We should start our search at the level where intelligence is most complete. Our inquiry should focus on human free will. Human free will is the greatest effect of the cause of life. We can trace it backwards toward its roots. The process will require more complex analysis than has been the case for the mechanical interpretation. Free will exists. We know this because we can choose to not be chained to knowledge of the past. We regularly advance into new levels of understanding that break with the past. Our subconscious allows for incomplete, even ambiguous data to be made useful. Not all pieces need to be in place, and yet we can suddenly become aware of new solutions and ideas. We subconsciously become aware of missing pieces or possible additions that were not discernable from the data. We subconsciously decide that the initial conclusion needs improved. The process is similar to that of jogging our memory. The jogging process contributes to free will. We \u2018will\u2019 more complete knowledge into conscious existence. We can trace the properties of intelligence by looking backward from its greatest result. Human free will is the ultimate result of the fundamental properties of intelligence. How does individual freedom of thought emerge from universal control? How is human free will the result? It occurs because the orderliness of the universe is not communicated to us fully intact. We are released intellectually from the control of universal determinism partly by how we view the universe and partly by how we access innate knowledge. We view the objects of the universe as being discrete. The photon data is discrete. In both cases the discreteness lacks clear direction. Continuity is needed for clear direction. Discontinuity leaves much of the interpretation process up to our innate knowledge. The uncertainty of meaning of received information is the extrinsic part of free will. It leaves it up to us to overlay our own view of continuity. We are left with the freedom to choose among meanings. Our innate knowledge is the intrinsic part of free will. None of us has the same innate knowledge or receives the same information. The meanings we choose can be different. Our individual store of knowledge is unique by virtue of what we each lack. Our unique individual abilities contribute to inexactness and incompleteness making free will uniquely individual. This flexibility of choice is the essence of free will. It is the rationing of knowledge that gives rise to free will. Change is constantly occurring everywhere in the universe. Along with that change the universe also has stability. The properties that cause change are stable. Their orderliness is what makes change purposeful. There is also an induced stability. The inducement of stability is due to commonness of culture and environment. Society introduces stability. Sharing a common environment and culture offers stability. Our culture and environment tend to establish norms for us. However, we are not fully predictable. We have different experiences. Our individual experiences activate different parts of our innate intelligence. We can escape cultural and environmental conditioning. We can compare long standing interpretations with newly \u2018remembered\u2019 innate knowledge. Behavior is repeatedly tested against internally generated choice. We can change our attitude and behavior by drawing upon our reserve of untapped knowledge. This can sometimes be a struggle that may lie dormant unless we vigorously pursue it. Those who do not make the effort can foster doubt. Those who succeed in doing this demonstrate the existence of free will. * Note of Acknowledgement: I used the word Teacher in the title of my first section: 1. Our Teacher., I adopted using it after reading St. Augustine\u2019s Concerning the Teacher, (De Magistro), Written about 389 A.D.; Translated by George G. Leckie, Saint John\u2019s College, Maryland, Copyright, 1938, by D. Appleton-Century Company, Inc., New York, N.Y. My essay presented here was written earlier as a result of my findings from the empirical evidence of physics. A few years afterward, I read St. Augustine\u2019s book. He proved the same need for innate knowledge as the source of our learning. However, he did it using language. So for those who may not agree with my photon based version of the need for innate knowledge, there exists an excellent language version. St Augustine used the title De Magistro translated by George Leckie as The Teacher. I had not previously used the word Teacher. Now I use it in acknowledgement of his earlier proof of the need for innate knowledge as the source of our learning. The rest of my essay is in my own words and has been since first I learned this truth from empirical physics. James A Putnam 8/23/2017 ",

            "answer_text": "Any theory about the nature of reality must consider the true nature of human consciousness, and any deep analysis of consciousness will eventually lead to the problem of free will. What is free will? Does it really exist, or is it just an illusion? Psychic determinism tells us there is no free will. Everything is pre- determined. Human choices are just an illusion. In fact, we can't produce even a single random thought. To prove this to a friend of mine I once asked him to think of a number. Any number would work, but I asked him to think of a really big number. That was just a little trick to make things easier for me. He knew I had read many books of psychoanalysis and that I had a lot of practice interpreting my friends' dreams, so he knew what was coming next. I was going to interpret the \"randomly\" selected number he would chose with the same interpretation techniques I had used to interpret his dreams and the dreams of others. The number he chose was 65900545. Now, as I said, asking for a large number was a trick to make things easier for me, the interpreter. In fact, a large number is actually composed of multiple numbers. So I started the interpretation, asking him to make free associations. \u00abWhat comes to your mind when you think about the number 65 millions?\u00bb I asked. After thinking about it for a split second, he said \u00abDinosaurs\u00bb. I guess the reason is that dinosaurs populated the earth till 65 millions years ago, but the reason is not really important. He already knew he should not reason over the answer, but just say what first came to his mind. Now, \u00abDinosaurs\u00bb was an answer that told me nothing yet, so I asked for more associations. \u00abGive me three words to describe dinasaurs,\u00bb I said. \u00abThey were huge, they lived before man was born... and they had to fight to survive.\u00bb These were his answers. Now, the first two were obvious references to his parents: they were huge [like seen from a baby's point of view], they lived before my friend [the man] was born, and so I thought the third one was probably also a reference to his mother and father. They had to fight to survive. I didn't know much about the story of his parents at the time, so I asked him for a few details, and he confirmed my thoughts. They came from the southern part of the country looking for jobs, as a young couple with a baby. They were not rich and had to work very hard to build a future and live in a beautiful hose. Now, it's much easier to interpret a dream, or, as in this case, a number, a product of someone's subconscious, if you already know the person well. I knew my friend had been recently forced, by his parents, to buy a house for himself. He was a young man with a job, but he was still living in his parents house, with little or no expenses. This is not so uncommon in Italy. He could have bought a nice car, he could have spent some of his money on nice holydays, or just having fun around, living a carefree life. But his parents had forced him to buy a house, and to rent it, to get an income that would partially cover the mortgage instalment. They had forced him to invest for his future. I had already interpreted most of the number's meaning before even getting past the number 65 million and its connection with dinosaurs. A few more questions and answers revealed that the \"900\" was his mortgage rounded up and the \"500\" was the income he was getting from the rent, rounded down. Furthermore, \"45\" was the age he was going to be when the mortgage was going to be fully repaid. Now, the interpretation of a dream, or, in this case, of a number, has to deal with the emotional life of the person who has the dream. There are two kinds of thoughts in our minds, at any given moment: important thoughts, which are emotionally charged, and unimportant thoughts, which are emotionally neutral. Our subconscious always concern itself with important thoughts only. When we are talking about the weather, or any other trivial topic that we don't really care about, our subconscious constantly express hidden references and symbols, depicting our current emotional state. And it does that with words and gestures, using the language of symbols. Sometimes it uses symbols that symbolyze other symbols, like the number 65 millions, which symbolize dinosaurs, which in turn symbolyzed my friend's parents, which were deeply connected with his emotional life. So, what was the interpretation of the whole number? My friend and I came to the final meaning together as we talked about it, like it should always be during the interpretation of the subconscious language. Obviously he didn't like the imposition of his parents. He was a young adult, and he should have been able to control his own finances. At first, he had been angry at his parents for their meddling with his money. But, being a good guy and a loving son, he was slowly coming to the conclusion that his parents, after all, were not asking him anything different from what they themselves had done when they were his age and made sacrifices for a better future. They had to fight for survival, just like the dinosaurs, and his parents' sacrifices had earned him a comfortable life. They didn't deserve his anymosity for just passing down to him their wisdom. The number he had \"randomly\" chosen just happened to be the perfect expression of his feelings: anger and a sense of guilt for being angry. He was basically bargaining with these two emotions. Needless to say, when my friend thought of the number, he had no idea he was going to express his emotional state through it. He just thought of a random number. That's it. See where all of this leads us? If our minds are incapable of producing a single random thought, even about trivial issues, even about the most emotionally neutral thing you can imagine, like pulling a number out of the air, how can we expect our thoughts not to be determined by our emotions and, most importantly, by our subconscious' need to express them in symbols. When the most trivial idea comes to your mind, seemingly out of nowhere, you may think it's just a casual thought, but the truth is, your subconscious is expressing itself about either some important, emonationally charged issue that runs in the back of your mind, or a biological need, like hunger or thirst, or even sexual desire. The point is, it will probably do it using symbols, because those are the words of its language. Now, where is free will in all of this? Let me tell you plain and simple: there is no such thing as free will. Our life runs on tracks, and there is no way to take a different course from what has been determined before we were even born. We can talk about quantum mechanics all day: how the potential states of reality become substantialized in the actual reality, the one that we perceive day by day, with our very limited senses, but in the end, everything that happens is determined by that which had happened before. And there is no way around it. So what is the meaning of all of this? Is there a meaning at all? I believe so, but this will be material for another discussion. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it does. Human free will is a reflection of God\u2019s free will. Since God made man in His own image, God puts into man something from Himself. God puts His Infinite Self in Man. Man\u2019s capacity to imagine is a reflection of God\u2019s Infinitude. How does God do that? God puts into man the characteristic of infinitude structurally by using the idea of Self-similarity. By doing that man is forever indebted to God. At this juncture, it is crucial to understand that integrity of behavior - human and all that exists - is the cornerstone of God\u2019s cosmos. God beckons us to pray because prayer is an integral aspect of the cosmos. God is not in need of our prayers. But we are in need of prayer. Our free will is to allow for willing participation in God\u2019s cosmos. Prayer uses rhythmic motions and holy repetitive words as the integral aspect of participation in the cosmos. Rhythm means to be tethered to one spot, one frequency, God\u2019s frequency. As humans, we are to understand the reason why largeness is reflected within our smallness: the blueprint of the cosmos is reflected in all of us. God is generous while hidden and subtle. These characteristics are reflected in humility. The word \u201csimulation\u201d is adequate to describe God\u2019s intention. Structurally, only a single point need exist for the entire cosmos to continually exist. The picture below is useful. God delegates the Spirit - a created being - which is the cosmic Prime Minister to blow out form. God as King is totally unconnected with form.  The form that God has chosen is geometrically propitious. I won\u2019t go into the details lest I sway from my intended text. Question is: Are we wiling to participate in the chosen geometrically propitious form or not? There are many ways that we can participate in this form in order to reflect it: charity, generous work, basically remembrance of God through action and prayer etc. But man is not God because man is given form or shape. God has no form or shape. God describes His characteristics in numerous ways that mean \u201cunity\u201d and \u201cgenerosity\u201d. The exigencies of life on earth is a distraction if we focus on form and not principle. We are on the right track if we follow principles, principles that reflect integrity. God can be described not only as one but as bliss. Consciousness precedes bliss. Rhythms reflect the unity of a single frequency via blissful motion. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has been plaguing me for a while now, and despite my best efforts to isolate any evidence at all of free-will I'm still empty handed.  I'd have to go with the majority of the answers already posted here (and interestingly the vast minority of people in general) and say no, free will does not exist.  Nature and nurture (perhaps combined with chance) seem to cover the bases well enough on their own. As Glyn Williams notes above however, the illusion of free will is very real and a very active element of our environment (in the form of 'responsibility' as far as I can tell).  I think where the free will arguments get most interesting however is in the repercussions of a world-view that doesn't include it, highlighting flaws in the way we employ concepts like blame, pride, and guilt.  It seems clear that free will is something of a fiction, but it seems equally clear that we must live as if it's real regardless. ",

            "answer_text": "What you want us to consider, limits your question. That is fine. However, the answer to your question may be outside of the limits that you impose. Your question is about free will. This is a question about an individual experience and the interpretation thereof. Looking at Ken Wilber's four quadrants, it would be individual-internal. You then ask us to consider the brain and molecules. In Ken Wilber's model, this would be in the individual-exterior domain. Your question cannot be answered within the considerations that you impose. It's like analysing the emotional impact of, for example, Edward Munch's Scream by analysing the chemical composition of the pigments in the paint he used. Ken Wilber is of course not the only philosopher that points out these different approaches. Our western culture and society is dominated by an objective view of the world. It allows us to greatly master the material component of our lives. At the same time, we deny the subjective viewpoint. We try to reduce it to interactions between neurons, but we don't have a solution for the increasing unhappiness in our society. We stuff our kids with pills and when it doesn't really help, we tell ourselves it's a matter of learning more about the chemicals in the brain and creating better medicines. Just like the scientific method allowed us to dominate the objective material world, it can be used to get insights into the subjective, introspective experience. For example, Buddhism has several theories of what you will find when you introspect. You will encounter several experiences and levels of consciousness. Those are just like scientific theories: nobody can prove them, but they can be corroborated. Like with good science, the experiments have been documented. You can reproduce what others have tried before. And you can talk to experts to validate your own experiments. If you try that approach, maybe you can find an answer to your question about free will. I can't tell you the answer. But there have been many others who have executed these experiments and who have documented them. Try looking up those who have experience. I would suggest starting with Zen or yoga. You will find it's easier to discuss free will in that context than in the context of molecular biology. ",

For example, if I define an engine as a machine that generates rotational energy without fuel or power then engines don\u2019t exist. If I define walking as the ability to change location without your feet touching the ground then walking doesn\u2019t exist. Similarly, if I define free will as the ability to make a decision without being limited or influenced by the environment, prior knowledge, or cognitive ability then free will doesn\u2019t exist. But this isn\u2019t being honest. I\u2019ve simply changed the definition of engines to perpetual motion machines, walking to levitation, and free will to an oracle. None of these things are real. However, working engines do exist, walking works for billions of people everyday, and free will seems to have the same function it has always had. If you study this as science rather than pseudo-philosophy or intuitive arguments then the problem is how to overcome the limitations of prior information states. This is what you run into with computational theory. However, brain function isn\u2019t based on computational theory so it doesn\u2019t have the same limitations. Science does show that the control function for consciousness matches what people think of as free will. There is also a firm definition of free will. ",

He proposes that through introspective observation we can become conscious of the motivations of our actions, and that the sole possibility of human freedom, if it exists at all, must be sought in an awareness of the motives of our actions. \"Inner freedom is attained with knowledge, when we bridge the gap between our perception, which gives us the outer appearance of the world, and our thought, which gives us the inner structure of the world. Outer freedom is achieved with ethical action, when we bridge the gap between our ideals and our deeds, letting our deeds be inspired by imagination. Inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, so that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.\" ",

This image is of a person with particular feelings, dispositions, judgments, inclinations, tendencies, and so on. The idea of a self \u2014 which Jung called the persona, Campbell called the mask, Krishnamurti called the center, etc. \u2014 is an accretion of thoughts that came from psychological conditioning from parents, teachers, authority figures, religious leaders, and so on. The end result is the self, also called the egoic self, or \u201cI,\u201d or \u201cme.\u201d The egoic self is only a belief, it is not at all real. It cannot be found with any earnest and persistent search. It is not at all permanent and is always changing, including from moment to moment and decade to decade. It changes due to further conditioning. So who decides? Who is the doer? It is not this egoic self that is no more than a belief. The egoic self takes credit or blame for outcomes that it misbelieves it has caused. However, no single individual is capable of changing the course of the entirety of consciousness in the same way that a drop of water cannot change the course of the entire ocean. A person is a biological entity with a mind that is an instrument of knowing and problem solving. But the egoic self is nonexistent. So the body can do something only according to the entire movement of consciousness; it is not independent, and to think that it is is hubris \u2014 more conditioned belief. We live in a culture filled with teachers who push this idea of free will, law of attraction, and other nonsense. These ideas feed the egoic self, but are baseless. The only doer is consciousness, which is the totality of all that exists. Until this is realized as what you are then you continue to be fooled by the conditioned mind that you are the actor instead of the director. ",

Neuroscience proves that we can do things, or react to environment instinctively, without conciously realising what we are doing. There are also other things that inlfuence us, like culture, social environment or even personal experiences and character. Assuming that all of these things can influence our decisions, and we can\u2019t do anything about it, this means for me that there isn\u2019t a completely independent and free way of taking decisions. If we are influenced, does this mean that free will doesn\u2019t exist? No. I think that, because we are influenced by an infinite and unpredictable number of things, and every person is different, free will exists. If free will means that we do what we \u201ctruly\u201d want, isn\u2019t what we \u201ctruly\u201d want different for every person? There is no right or wrong for a decision, there is no objective truth about anything. That\u2019s why people take different decisions and everyone is free. If we keep erasing everything that \u201cstops us from being free\u201d we wouldn\u2019t be humans. ",

            "answer_text": "When contemplating this question, it helps to be aware of three schools of thought: indeterminism, determinism, and compatibilism. The way these concepts respond and conflict with each other give shape to the argument for or against free will. Indeterminism is the belief in autonomous agents - entities that are responsible for their own actions. At least some events in the universe occur randomly. While this does not equate to free will, some philosophers believe it allows for human beings to act from their own agency. Determinism is the notion that all laws of the universe are set. Every action or event that plays out does so because there was no other alternative. You have no choice but to act exactly are you are. Compatibilism is the concept that even if all actions are pre-determined, and an individual has no alternative, as long as the actions they take are motivated by their own character and desire (rather than compulsion), then their free will remains intact. The relevant distinction seems to be that inevitable action is not necessarily compelled action - if it is wanted, it cannot be forced. The argument here is that there is no requirement for genuine alternate possibilities, for free will to exist. Compatibilism seems to consider freedom an emotional experience - so as long as your actions are aligned with your desires - your will is free. There\u2019s no definitive answer, at least that I know of. But these are interesting view points that may help you form your own beliefs! ",

The 'choices \" we convince ourselves are of our own are circumstances based, now, unless you can control circumstances within the universe, pray tell, how sure can you be that choices you make are entirely yours, free from any form of influence? Take for example the classical example of Peter denying christ, despite his insistence, that he would not do it, he ends up doing it. Now, we know that Peter had a choice/freedom to choose the opposite, why he didn't is not as important as understanding circumstances outside Peter's area of influence, which  broad about the choices he ultimately makes. Put simply, Peter was set up! Though he couldn't understand it himself, he had little choice in the outcome he ultimately made, to believe otherwise would render the all knowing God a lier. After all what God wills come to pass, free will or not. ",

Experiments in the field of neuroscience to find whether free will exists or it may be an illusion have been to observe the chronology of decision making and action. This has been almost impossible because of the possibility of and difficulty to observe unconscious decisions. Many neuroscientists opine that it doesn't exist but some are of the opinion that it does exist. Read Free will - Wikipedia.If free will doesn't exist, why bother about it anyway. In that case, even to try to find whether it exists or not is also not in our hands.Questions about free will have been philosophical questions rather than scientific ones because of the Naturalism (philosophy) of science and Scientific method.I personally think that it is more practical and less risky to assume or believe that free will exists and take my decisions accordingly. This reasoning is similar to Pascal's wager about religion.",

If I am heading home from work there is only one way I could go which is the most efficient way to satisfy my current objectives which are in general to get home the fastest, cheapest most direct way. There are choices of course, I could take a long way around for a change but only if the desire to do so entered my mind at the time. This would mean a new objective of which I dont have a choice over, rather one that had a prior cause outside of my own direct choice. I could go left instead of right if going right were apparantly more dangerous, but that still satisfies my desire to get home safely. I could defy my objective of being safe by going right despite the danger, but only if a new objective, say to experience a bit of excitement or danger, but that is still a decision based on an objective of outcomes. Free will might give me the choice to go an unusual way but only if there was a reason for it. So free will would only be possible if I were to choose a route that went against any of my desired outcomes. Free will would therefore be a less effective way and wouldnt be a very good idea would it? What use is free will if it can only be applied to defy my desired outcome? Any decision I make must be logical and efficient and must satisfy my objectives. So apart from defying my objectives where does free will play a valuable role? You could argue that free will could be employed ahead of time in choosing which objectives I aim to achieve in general, but again there must be a reason for that also. Can you think of a decision you could make in any aspect of life that doesnt directly take you to your destination without an a priori benefit? ",

Therefore, individuals within that universe have free will, since they can choose and you cannot know (or calculate) with certainty what choice they will make (the choice is nondeterministic, because of the HUP). Across all identical universes within the multiverse, there is a calculable PROBABILITY that an individual will chose a particular path. Thus, across all universes, all possible choices will be made, at a statistically determinable frequency. This appears deterministic. However, that only applies (i.e., is deterministic) if a single individual exists across all universes. Since an individual in one universe isn\u2019t aware of his counterpart in another universe, they are separate, although identical entities (at least identical up to the point where they decide differently). Thus, each individual occurrence of the same person however has free will within his universe. The problem has been that we get hung up on the identical person in two or more universes being the SAME person. They are not. Therefore, each is free to choose. Free will exists for individuals in their universe. ",

Without wading in over my head or getting too philosophical (after all, philosophy comprises questionable answers to unanswerable questions), here are my personal insights. This line of thought started after I observed a large group of people standing all night outside an Apple store to buy a $1200 iPhone to replace the essentially still new one they bought the year before. I wondered what sane person would choose to do such a thing. Answer: They did not choose. They were puppets on a string. The admass and peer pressure and Madison Avenue made the choice for them. You are more worthy if you own this new iPhone - or car or nose ring or handbag or pair of shoes and so forth. Fill in the blanks. Even the food you \u201cchoose\u201d to eat: Salad or that juicy bacon-double cheeseburger? Hmmm? Such a non-choice. Those people standing in line were keeping up with the Joneses (and the Kims and the Pulaskis and the Kellys). Exiting the womb instinct kicks in and we are forced to suckle and cry when in discomfort and seek the warmth and safety of parental caress. As awareness develops, parental and cultural and societal pressures kick in. Do this and don\u2019t do that. Thereafter even the people you choose as your circle friends are not your choice but the choice of all the molding factors that preceded them. I\u2019m sure DNA plays a significant role, but I\u2019ll leave off my argument here lest I get tedious. I think you see what I\u2019m driving at. Give me your thoughts. ",

But this does not mean WE are not responsible for what WE did. Why? Because just like free-will, WE ourselves are equally illusory and fake.2.  Ultimately speaking, only quantum fields are real, all other entities like atoms, molecules, cells, life-forms etc. emerge out of the interactions of quantum fields. 3.  However all these emergent entities can be categorized into different levels of emergence, defined roughly by how complicated they are compared to the underlying particles \u2013 how many particles they are constitute from.4.  So, in a sense, all levels are \u201cmore real\u201d than the levels above it. Let\u2019s define entities of the same level as \u201cequally real\u201d.5.  For example, temperature of a box of gas is less real a quantity than the properties of atoms that form the gas, such as their speeds and locations. This can be seen that before the box of gas reaches thermal equilibrium, we cannot assign to it a physically meaningful temperature value.6.  It is in this sense that I say WE are illusory and fake. But the same goes for free-will, which is a product our consciousness, and is thus at the same level as our consciousness.7. We FEEL that we are exercising freedom of will in making (most of the) choices.8. Therefore We and our responsibilities in making such choices are \u201cequally real\u201d \u2013 in other words, the responsibilities are real FOR US. (Note the importance of 7th argument. People with abnormalities in their neurological system may not feel free when making certain choices. In such cases the responsibility does not lie in them) ",

Those are the electroweak force, the gravity force and the strong nuclear force that mainly act on the electrons, the neutrinos and the two quarks while we should not forget about the fictitious particles and the field Higgs. Using this team phisicists can explain everything in our universe, even the subatomic functions in our body in detail completely. Dispite that, they still can\u2019t explain that thing named conciousness. Could it be that it is something science can\u2019t explain or is it a result of the team we mentioned acting and scientist just can\u2019t comprehend it yet? Besides, let us not forget that our brain is the most complicated machine in the known universe. Who knows..? Our conciousness may even stem from that team that\u2019s acting on its own accord, only abiding to the universe but in the end you do what you want to do, you have free will. Even if there is something that make you want what you want, it is not something that controls you, but you true self. Hope that helped you out! ",

When we are to take any action, we put it in our subconscious mind. Our subconscious mind give us best answer by going to depth and finding similar situation (finding impression of previous karma) that occurred in past, or similar experience (impression of previous karma) and get us answer on how we should react. That means every reaction to any situation is nothing but our reference to our past experience or past impression that was left on our subconscious mind. This also means every-time we have this small window between our action and reaction process wherein we get to choose between following similar pattern of our previous karma or choose new. For Exp if I am hitman and I kill people for pleasure, so whenever there is any situation arises my Subconscious mind will prompt me to kill because that is how I have been doing all my life. But every-time such situation arises I also have small opportunity to alter my subconscious and take different action. This is what is freewill. The small opportunity windows. ",

It seems this statement still allows for the belief that each moment of time is determined but unlinked, my response to that would be, why would a random state (isn't that all it could be?) give rise to (or arguably be) a consciousness that believes it has seen evidence for that which gives rise to it (the brain) and sees a whole load of things that it believes it has previously seen the behaviour of (which also seems to be very consistent and explainable), why would something like that occur randomly?

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. This answer is, of course, subjective and my opinion, and I am by no means an expert. I'd say no. It's not to say that, \"humans can't make their own decisions\", no, but I am saying that no decision is ever truly made, or action ever done, that hasn't been influenced by anything else. This would make it, by definition (Using the Merriam-Webster one, which is \"freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention\") NOT free will.  Another reason is that, in my opinion, you will always make the same choice, even if you redo the event 1 million times. This relates more to the first one, but basically, these choices you make aren't really controlled by you, it's just the illusion of that. They are more heavily based on inferences, and occasionally, minimizing risk. Thus, the decision you came to would be arrived at regardless because of things out of your control. I hope this made sense. If not, please feel free to ask questions. Thanks once again, and peace. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like this to answer with no, although it may seem we have free will. I have two arguments for this the first one is the argument of \u2018wanting\u2019 Consider this. You are given a choice between two options. What will you choose? What you want, right? Even if you choose to choose what you do not want, then that is what you want. Now can you choose what you want? Do you have controll over what you want? To me, it appears not to be. If we do not have control over what we want and we always choose what we want, then you cannot speak of free will. My second argument is a deterministic one. Lately, a lot of research has indicated that some character traits are genetically hereditary. It goes without saying that you cannot alter your genetic traits. If you\u2019re character is partially hereditary, and a lot of choices are built on character, then are you really free? Another way your character is formed is by previous events, mostly in childhood. You can not choose how you were raised, in what environment you grew up in etc.. However, this does heavily influence how you make choices and what choices you make. You are in a sense determined by your previous experiences genes and upbringing to make a certain choice. Some people I know have argued that free will is not so much about whether we really make free choices; rather they argue that is about the illusion of free choice/will. It does indeed appear that we do have free will. I could support such a definition of free will. I am convinced, however, that we are not as \u2018free\u2019 as we would like ourselves to be\u2026.

            "answer_text": "I humbly disagree with much more highly educated people than me. Humbly because tomorrow I may see the wisdom in their arguments. Today, though, I believe that free will means we are free to do whatever we want to do, as long as we understand that those decisions involve risks, and that we will have to live with the consequences of our actions (as will our loved ones and descendants, if we have reproduced or plan to reproduce). Therefore, when love is the foundation our decisions: we will risk/give our lives or livelihoods/riches over and over\u2014because of LOVE of what is good, beautiful, and true for our fellow human beings, related or not by blood. Think Harriet Tubman. Think Oskar Schindler. Think Alexander Solzhenitsun. Think MLK, Jr. Think the young guy protesting communism in China by allowing a tank to crush him. Think of really good parents who raise honest, loving, kind, courageous, creative, humble, witty, hard-working, respectful, and strong children despite poverty, despite disabilities, despite their universal battles with the allure of the illusions promised by the opposite of those traits. Then think of what those loves had in common with the person in your workplace or community who got ostracized, hated, persecuted, or fired because they chose to stand up against a powerful person, system, culture, prefering their losses in the name of goodness, beauty, and truth. They chose their destiny out of LOVE for what leads to the long-term prosperity of humanity\u2014despite perceived short-term (or permanent) material losses. THAT is true love, true religion, true conviction, and the true meaning of life. **Caveat- Most often, the long-term benefits are visible most clearly to the quietest ones in society-the ones quiet enough to hear the whisper of proper principle that comes from within the soul\u2014the ones who withdraw inwards because they know that the fools and fanatics fill the air with noise to attract the highest number of the unthinking herds because they get a validation based on numbers of followers rather than true validation from within, which comes from proper principles. I believe in free will because our puppet strings are cut. We are going through a trial period where our nose grows when we lie, where we fall into the trap of Pleasure Isle. We forsake those who love us the most. But we also have the opportunities to redeem ourselves by listening to our Jimminy Crickets. When we prove that we can love, we can be a real boy.

All of our decisions are the result of interacting forces outside of our direct control. We always do what we are forced to do, but unlike mere puppets, if we play our cards right we we can have a desirable degree of indirect control over our strings.   We are aware, thinking, goal-seeking puppets directed by changeable programming.  The trick is to go from the innate primitive programming which gets our genes into the next generation to more sophisticated programming which brings individual fulfillment within a harmonious society and still gets our genes into the next generation.  The marketplace of ideas abounds with memes vying for our attention. The memes act as goals, rules of thumb, strategies, maxims, dogma, principles, methods, rationale, and other snippets of programming when taken in by a brain. Right now I'm acting as a part of the marketplace espousing the notion libertarian free will doesn't exist yet the interplay of natural forces doesn't preclude us from being programmed to seek and achieve mutual flourishing. To me, this seems significantly different and better than the options available to a dead person. YMMV. ",

We have a body that needs to be nourished \u2014 that is part of its nature \u2014 but this fact does not negate the fact that humans have free will. We have a mind that can make choices and evaluate our alternatives, based on reason and logic. This is free will. The ability to choose among different alternatives and make the best decisions. But free will does not guarantees optimum results. Free will requires a free environment and political system to allow us to make choices. Force is the one way to destroy free will and human freedom. That is why any political system that uses coercion to rule human beings violate their free will and their rights as individuals. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question itself is a part of that free will granted by cosmic intelligence. Here is an excerpt from the Shrimad Bhagavatam (11.3.6) -The argument may be given that if a living entity were subject to the results of his previous activities there would be no scope for free will; once having committed a sinful action, the living entity would be bound in an endless chain of suffering, being perpetually subject to previous reactions. According to this speculation there cannot be a just and omniscient God, since the living entity is forced to commit sinful activities by the reactions of his previous activities, which were reactions to still previous activities. Since even an ordinary gentleman will not unfairly punish an innocent person, how could there be a God witnessing the helpless suffering of the conditioned souls within this world?This foolish argument can easily be refuted by a practical example. If I purchase a ticket for an airline flight, board the plane and commence the flight, once the plane has taken off my decision to board the plane forces me to continue flying until the plane lands. But although I am forced to accept the reaction of this decision, on board the plane I have many new decisions I can make. I may accept the food and drink from the stewardesses or reject it, I may read a magazine or newspaper, I may sleep, walk up and down the aisle, converse with other passengers and so on. In other words, although the general context\u2014flying to a particular city\u2014is forcibly imposed upon me as a reaction to my previous decision to board the plane, even within that situation I am constantly making new decisions and creating new reactions. For example, if I cause a disturbance on the airplane I may be arrested when the plane lands. On the other hand, if I make friends with a businessman sitting next to me on the plane, such a contact may lead to a favorable business transaction in the future.Similarly, although the living entity is forced to accept a particular body by the laws of karma, within the human form of life there is always scope for free will and decision-making. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be considered unjust for holding the living entity in human life responsible for his present activities despite the living entity's undergoing the reactions of his previous work.

            "answer_text": "The more I learn about science, the less I believe in free will. All of our behavior results from a bunch of molecules bouncing around according to the laws of quantum mechanics. Seen that way, we don't have any more free will than pebbles being tumbled down a river. We think we have free will because we can't predict the future, and because our immediate experience is full of so much ambiguity.  Free will is an illusion, but it's a powerful, persistent and useful illusion. The inherently complex and chaotic nature of our brains prevents us from being able to predict our own actions. We're even worse at predicting events caused by the emergent complexities of the interactions between large groups of other people. Way down at the quantum level, we may well be living in a deterministic universe. But because we have no way of perceiving all the intricate quantum interactions doing the determining, for all practical purposes, we might as well pretend to have free will. ",

Your choices are 'willed' by you, with no other influences. Influences here would probably suggest external forces but eventually it was your personal choice. This in itself is your 'free will'. A good example would be: going to work every morning. Every morning you're late because there is always a traffic jam. Every day you tell yourself I need to wake up earlier to take an earlier bus. Yesterday was no different. This morning, your alarm to wake up earlier rang. What did you do? Snooze it five times and still woke up at the same time? Thats your free will. Perhaps not a very good example, but im just trying to say: you are the master of your choices, regardless of circumstances. ",

            "answer_text": "Cognitive bias is a scientific term coined in the 1970\u2019s, and is rooted in behavioral economics. Free will is a question of philosophy that dates back millennia. Science is notoriously ill equipped to answer philosophical questions. The scientific method cannot answer, for instance; \u201cWhat is the purpose/meaning of life?\u201d \u201cIs it okay to sacrifice 1 person to save 5 people?\u201d \u201cDoes God exist?\u201d In a similar vein, the scientific research regarding economic decisions people make known as \u201ccognitive bias\u201d is ill equipped to answer or contribute much to the philosophical question regarding free will.  But, for anyone interested, let\u2019s dig a bit deeper. The question implies an \u201ceither/or\u201d proposition. The question implies either philosophy or science, but not both. Either the metaphysical or physical, but not both. And we can see the belief in a strictly scientific reality in some of the other answers. There is an interesting, deterministic or empiricist philosophy which argues that reality is limited to only what can be observed in the physical, material world. In the strictest sense, philosophy and by extension free will is only an imagined construct as a result of physics, i.e. atoms, chemicals, etc. Paradoxically, those that believe in the above, those that believe in a strictly deterministic, physical universe devoid of free will, face one insurmountable challenge, in that, it is impossible to use science to disprove the philosophy of science. In other words, the philosophy of a purely physical reality and denial of anything metaphysical is in itself an act of faith. ",

They believe that if your life has a predetermined outcome it cannot be free.  But the truth is that your life here on earth is only the physical outcome of a deterministic universe if you keep all the levers on the default setting. As the artificial intelligence of the planet, we have been given a program, a set of rules to follow that are merely for our survival. When we become awakened however, what we notice is that the physical laws of the universe do not determine our fate, it is the nature of our spirit set free from the confines of human society that give us free reign over our fate within the society.   If, for example, you are born into a wealthy family and you suddenly decide that the wealth of the world is a cruel, corrupted system you no longer wish to partake in, you can simply alter the way of your future by disconnecting from the system you deem undeserved of your obeyance. This is an exercise of will determining the fate of the individual by denying the programming of birth. For a person to truly be free, one must take responsibility for every single condition one is held within and each situation must be seen as opportunity rather than as a fate for which you have no choice.

Currently I don't think that any of us know about any other free will present any where else other than Earth. So in truth your question ought to be edited. But, this is still a serious question, so here's a serious answer. First of all we have to define free will. Free will in layman terms is the ability to choose from a series of multiple options without any so called pressure. However in just a few lines I will explain how rhetorical this question truly is. As everyone is a student in their early years, this situation is probably relatable- Q. It's 5 in the morning, have to get ready for school, do I want to go? a) I have to study for my exams. I will top my classes. Nothing can stop me. Muahahaha(Evil laughter) b) Lemme sleep for 5 minutes more\u2026\u2026. c) Why do I even go to school? I am leaving it!! P.S. Still think you've got a choice? ",

Next, extend your right arm out at about 90 degrees, with a slight bend in your elbow towards the ground.  Finally, sing:  \"I'm a little teapot, short and stout\" Go ahead.  Do it. So only one of two things occured as a result of your free will.  You did it, but you were not forced to.  I was not able to come through your screen and make you do it.  Or, you exercised your free will by not doing it. In life, we have a set of conditions which give us limited choices, but we make a choice based on our best knowledge, our background of learning and experience, and move forward.   As humans, we would not be able to negotiate all possible choices of all possible crossroads at one time (like God), which is why we have linear time forged into our created universe.  So, if you define free will as being able to bend physical laws and universal rules through the power of thought, then I suppose you have no free will.  In practical terms though, you have the free will you need to complete whatever you make of your destiny. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes Maybe Those who argue that the physical universe is deterministic, that newtons laws would be violated or that a supernatural force is required are not keeping up on quantum physics. This is not to say the quantum physics proves free will. This is to say that quantum physics leaves open the concept that the physical universe is not deterministic. Which is also not to say that a \u201cnon-physical\u201d answer for this are out of the question. We definitely still don't understand the effect of waveforms on particle minutiae. We don't know the effect of Axions or any other such things on thought. And for all we know there's some sort of spiritual something or other. We absolutely do not know enough to say that free will does not exist and anyone who says that we do is being childish. Now to say that it does exist I would depend on what you are asking. If by free will you mean that when you make a decision you feel ownership over it and feel that you could have made another decision then that is a certainly fact. An ironic fact because we know from repeated evidence fat people often think that they made a decision when in fact they simply acted on impulse and then post hoc decided that they had made a decision. But if by free will you mean that the origin of that decision came from some non-deterministic place? Then the answer is that we don't know. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that we have no way of knowing, and we never will know, whether humans have Free Will or are governed entirely by Causal Determinism \u2014 with every thought being the inexorably determined consequence of prior activity in the universe that predates the dawn of mankind. Causal Determinism is a metaphysical paradigm that posits that all activity in the universe is both (i) the effect of [all] antecedent activity, and (ii) the only activity that can occur given the antecedent activity. That is what is meant by saying that everything is \u201cdetermined\u201d (or \u201cpredetermined\u201d or \u201cdestined\u201d) to occur \u2014 it is the inexorable consequence of activity that preceded it. In a deterministic universe, everything that has ever occurred, is occurring, and will occur since the universe came into existence (however that might have occurred) can only occur exactly as it has occurred, is occurring, or will occur, and cannot possibly occur in any different manner. Causal Determinism does not address the manner by which activity first began. Nor does Causal Determinism address whether activity is intelligently and intentionally designed, or simply occurs based on a random beginning. As such, a belief in a deterministic universe neither precludes nor requires a belief in God. Moreover, Causal Determinism generally explains the process by which all activity occurs without getting into the details of what specifically causes any particular activity. Causal Determinism posits that everything has a cause and cannot occur in any manner other than how it does occur \u2014 without regard to the ability to predict or replicate that activity. Causal Determinism does not posit that the factors that have caused, are causing, or will cause any particular activity can be known or understood, or that any specific future activity can be predicted with any degree of certainty. As Karl Popper has explained: \u201cThe metaphysical doctrine of determinism simply asserts that all events in this world are fixed, or unalterable, or predetermined. It does not assert that they are known to anybody, or predictable by scientific means. But it asserts that the future is as little changeable as is the past. Everybody knows what we mean when we say that the past cannot be changed. It is in precisely the same sense that the future cannot be changed, according to metaphysical determinism.\u201d If Causal Determinism is true, then everything and everyone is bound, in lock-step, to a determined and unalterable future \u2014 hence, no Free Will. If Causal Determinism is not true, however, it may be that some things (if not everything) is free to evolve in a manner that is not destined, including human will. Unfortunately, Causal Determinism cannot be proved true nor falsified, as explained in Does quantum mechanics undermine hard determinism?; Since \"God plays dice\" in the quantum sense and the Universe is not deterministic, does this mean we have free will?; and Is it true that everything that happens is predetermined?. Nor can the existence of Free Will be proved or falsified, as explained at Is there really anything as free will? Like the existence (or lack thereof) of [a] \u201cGod,\u201d people can only have faith that Free Will exists (or does not exist) and/or that Causal Determinism is true (or false), and should not waste their time searching for proof that does not exist \u2014 unless, of course, Causal Determinism is true, Free Will does not exist, and searching for proof is what people are compelled to do by forces beyond their control. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Causal Determinism \u2013 We Are Compelled to Be Free ",

            "answer_text": "What is free will? Wikipedia: \"Free will is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded.\" But everyone's actions are impeded or determined by the thoughts/ideas that come to mind, fears, habits, reflexes, instincts, traditions, obsessions, desires, feelings, senses, intelligence, memories/knowledge/experience, beliefs, morals, empathy, compassion, and/or conscience. Every choice is made based on these variables. Some of them are set by genes or during development, some are affected by disease or environment. Every action is determined by those factors. With schizophrenia I lost the feeling of intent/will; now it feels like my body is moving on its own all the time, including writing this text. It\u2019s not a delusional feeling, it\u2019s a lack of feeling of intent. On a few occasions my schizophrenia has made me feel like I did something, while I actually didn\u2019t (they were some strange things I would never do). This is how I realized that free will is merely a feeling. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a matter on which scholars have differing views. Only those who met with God or reached very near Him are blessed with the true knowledge on this. The research based on anatomy or observation or anecdotal or empirical Will not give the truth. Based on a new path to travel to God which is totally independent of any existing religion or faith or saint and on which I have successfully traveled (its 25 Revelations are given in link-3 in my profile), its Revelation 6 throws light on this matter. Gist is that ; God has not given any freedom of doing any physical action by anyone in His kingdom and that whatever happens (through anyone) is per God\u2019s Will and per His carefully crafted design. However, God has given power to not do something (planned per destiny) only where He permits. Such power does not change the overall destiny. I am quoting few paras from the commentary on Revelation 6 for further reading. \u2014-QUOTE\u2014 Revelation 6\u2014\u201cGod has given us freedom of thoughts and the power to not do a thing.\u201d R6.1-This is a very important Revelation which is self explanatory. There is nothing complicated which needs to be explained in this Revelation. Most people already know that they have this freedom and they do create several thoughts. Power to not do a thing is for physical things including writing and speech. The power to not do a thing also means that there is no power to do what one wants. This aspect would look unbelievable. It is true that a vast majority of people feel that physical things being done by them is their natural power. Frankly, it is of no concern to masses that what they are doing is God\u2019s Will. However, this knowledge would seep in their psyche slowly to reach the zenith towards the end of 21st century, when this path would be adopted by the masses, as already prophesied . This would actually bring about more peaceful and cordial times for the world because people will start realizing that it is not they or others who do things but it is God\u2019s design, so why quarrel. Though it may not matter much to masses at present but spiritual people wanting to realize God, earlier than the end of soul\u2019s life and thinking of meeting with Him, have to contemplate and traverse through this truth, right now, to get what they want. By using the freedom of thoughts, the one who keeps the mind almost full of good thoughts can get a lot of concession from God in repaying bad Karma (ref. R6.11.4) and in getting his prayers answered (ref. R25). The power to not do a thing can also do wonders. Since a person does things per God written destiny, this power becomes a powerful tool in his hands because, using it, he can refuse to do even what is destined. He can stop self from doing bad and take his destiny upward. However, God allows the use of power to not do a thing only where He gives choices. R6.5-It is worthwhile to understand that destiny-changing choices given by God are controlled and regulated like this : Two choices are offered to a boy after twelfth grade. The first choice is to join his father\u2019s business and expand it over time. He would do a lot of charity work, receive a lot of praise from society, and earn huge profits while still in his forties. He would donate to the campaign of a presidential candidate, and when the candidate wins, he would be invited by the President to come to the White House and he would be an invitee at few occasions. The second choice is to attend college where he would receive a Ph.D. in physics. He would invent new things, get a Nobel Prize, and be invited to meet the president in the White House. When both choices are compared, it comes out that alternate courses given by God do not change destiny, substantially, as already explained at R6.2 above. R6.7-The actual phenomenon of using the power to not do a thing is a technical matter and little complicated. God\u2019s normal signals go to the soul continuously which is the receiving station for it. The signal keeps the soul alive. This signal also lifts the part of destiny (destiny is stored in the soul) to be undergone at that moment, from the soul and carries it to the last outer chamber of the mind which directs the body to act. However, before any final signal goes out to body to get it to act, this part of the mind (the last chamber) also gets another signal which is the mixture of soul\u2019s stored experience coming here through the conscience and mind\u2019s own thought out of its freedom to think and the latest collection from the outside world. Two things happen. First is ; it is the moment when God comes to know as to what thought was going on in the mind. Second is that the soul comes to know, through conscience, as to what the destiny wants to get done. If God has given the choice, the soul may send a more powerful signal through the conscience to the last chamber of mind to overcome the influence of the regular signal from God which has carried the destiny and finally the signal going out of the mind to body has the superimposition of the soul\u2019s experience and thus, the person does not do what was destined. These matters shall be found mentioned again at R8.2 and R20.10 to 20.13. R6.12.3-When God decides the destiny for a new birth, He takes into account the accumulated Karma to the last day of the previous birth. His working after this is complicated. He looks at the upcoming birth and as to what all from the accumulated Karma and unfulfilled desires could be allocated to it. Based on this evaluation and balancing, God picks up a part of it which could be accommodated in the present birth, adds something new from his side, generally based on past prayers and then finalizes and writes the destiny for the present birth. Karma, therefore, plays the most important part and one should be very careful so that bad Karma is not made. R6.15-God\u2019s or Soul\u2019s Calling Previously, R6.7 discusses overruling God\u2019s written original destiny by the soul. One may get perplexed when it comes to determining if one is acting at the behest of God or if the soul is overruling the original destiny. Actually, it is not difficult to know. When a person does something as a matter of routine, without any debate in the mind, original destiny is at work. When he is about to do something but an idea occurs in the mind, resulting in his not doing it, then the trigger to not do it has come to mind from the soul via the conscience. In this case, the soul\u2019s signal was stronger than God\u2019s and could overpower God\u2019s signal. There may also be another result in this case. The person may reject the new idea of not doing the new thing and proceed to go with the original idea. When this happens, then the soul\u2019s signal \u2018to not do something\u2019 was weak and got overpowered by God\u2019s signal. \u2014UNQUOTE\u2014 Those interested to reach near God or in meeting with Him, may read Revelations 12, 14, 19 and 20.

The efficient cause of the combustion of cotton ensues through the intervention of God- either with the mediation of angels or without any such mediation\" The universe is in a constant state of recreation by God and God assigns accidental qualities to the atoms in each moment(may be 10^-43 of second or one Planck time) of time. it means in each moment the intervenes of God in the recreation of universe. So there is no free-will for humans. According to Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali all causation because of the will of God and man's will is limited. When we observe this universe we find some laws and pattern in this nature and think if God can do anything than why we find some pattern and laws in this nature. Because God's will lead's to events in a similar order.But in reality there are no laws to break. Sometimes we see miracles in this nature and we think this break the law's of nature. But in reality miracles don't break the law's of nature because there are no laws to break. Miracles are simply God acting in a way that appears unusual but is part of God's plan.  ",

Say that this history leads to choice A. Say the corresponding future is FA. Then would would happen if we decided to choose B? HA leads to choice A. So if we choose B, HA should be HB, with the corresponding future FB! So if there is free will, the choice you make will affect the future and the past. This affect could just be correlation or dependence in mathematical sense. That way determinism and free will are compatible.

            "answer_text": "Think about this; does the thing you did and the thing that happened to you most previously influence your next action or does your most previous action have no effect on your future? Is your next decision independent of any outside influence or is your next decision dependent on outside influence? Can any two humans think or act the same way at any point in time? Is procrastination just a natural process which will eventually lead to the one expected outcome, or is it a controlled process which can lead to any outcome? Let\u2019s visualize this. I woke up in the morning and had breakfast, I hate my job and I procrastinated for 15 minutes as to whether or not I wanted to go to work. Eventually during the procrastination, I realize that I need the money and therefore I must go to work. Subsequently I rushed out of the house to ensure that I am not late for work. At the very point in time when I made the conscious decision to go to work, all of the individuals that I will cross path with are in motion. John left his home at a certain time based on the circumstances that he is experiencing; independent of any coordination with me and so did I. Based on the circumstances I am experiencing at that point I walked at a particular pace which allowed me to cross path with John. Based on who John and I am, John sparked a conversation and asked me \u201chow is your morning going?\u201d and I responded. Being both talkers, the enticing conversation influenced us to slow our pace of walking; which lead to both of us being late for work. Could this event had happened any differently? Yes, only if the circumstances we were experiencing were different. One must now ponder if whether or not the circumstances could be different and while searching for that answer, you would realize that it would only be possible under one condition. This means that even circumstances are dependent on circumstances. The work day continued and based on the conditions and how my boss is, he approached me and asked \u201cwhy are you late today?\u201d I responded and while responding a co-worker was passing by and heard me. Moments before this event, some water spilled on the floor and while my co-worker was passing by inquisitively, this caused her to slip and fall. Being who I am, I rushed to her aid and the discussion with my boss ended. This event became the centre of discussion for most of the day for just about everyone. Everything I did that day was dependent on two things the circumstances that exist at each point in time and who I am. If you happen to travel to the woods and eventually got bitten by a snake, was this a coincidence? Or was this because the circumstances that both you and the snake were experiencing lead you both in the same direction which ultimately lead to both paths intersecting and based on the nature of the snake, it had no choice but to bite you? If you happen to be going on your way to the grocery store as a result of your circumstances and ultimately cross path with someone who previously broke into your house and you eventually hit them, was this a coincidence or was this because the circumstances that both you and the person were experiencing lead you both in the same direction which ultimately lead to both paths intersecting and based on your nature, you had no choice but to hit the person? One will argue that I the individual is both the origin and cause of my actions but this logic cannot be further from the truth. Every action has a motive, if I say I need a Job, this must be for a reason which originated outside of myself and it is this reason; circumstance which caused my action not me. One will also say that if I wake up one morning and say that I desire a house, then I must be the origin of the action to come. This is true, but even desire itself is caused by circumstances. In Genesis, Eve didn\u2019t desire the fruit in the garden until the serpent enticed her and being how she is, she decided to eat of the forbidden fruit. Even though it-self is dependent on circumstances. One\u2019s ability to think is dependent on the extent of their knowledge and understanding, which is dependent on their exposure which is determined by the conditions that exist throughout their life. By now you should realize the premise of these situations and by extension all situations. Everything that you or anyone experience is caused by circumstances. The effect of each circumstance is based on who you are. ",

But I don\u2019t assume that free will means I have to be able to violate the laws of causality in an instantaneous moment. In any case, I think it\u2019s more important for people to understand freedom in political terms. In my opinion people should recognize that real freedom comes in degrees: a slave is less free than a slave-owner, and a poor person less free than a rich person. Speculating about metaphysical free will is much more about entertainment than anything practically important. (And I freely admit that I derive entertainment from it occasionally.)

            "answer_text": "Do we have freewill? How are God and free will compatible? Yes, we have free will, consider your selection for lunch today.  See what I mean? Free will is a Truth. The human conceptualizations of an anthropomorphic god are incompatible with the reality of free will.  Therefore, all those conceptualizations are not grounded in Truth. Here is how you can grasp those two answers with more clarity. Seek Truth. (as Parmenides made clear, 2500 years ago or so) Without the Guidance of Another. [entity or individual] (As Kant made clear in 1794) This is how I am more fully grounding my decisions with Truth. I use unguided meditation, because Truth IS. I use focused mindfulness, because I want to experience just exactly what IS. Truth IS, regardless of what you, or another entity or individual (including me) thinks, says, or does. Seek Truth(.) Seek Your Truth. (without being guided by another) In consequence, all Truth will become accessible to you. You\u2019ll never get caught lying if you always seek to speak the Truth. That will produce happier-ness moments right off the bat. Aha, you say, and why would that be? Aha, I say, because Understanding your aha moments is how you re-discover that Truth exists, regardless of what you, or another entity or individual (including me) thinks, says, or does. The meaning of life is to pursue happier-ness: Gautama Buddha is quoted to have said; \u2018\u2019Happiness is the way\u2019\u2019. He was only partly correct, like in \u2018\u2019The Princess Bride\u2019\u2019,when Miracle Max said about Wesley; \u2018\u2019He\u2019s only mostly dead.\u2019\u2019 Since the definition of happiness is seemingly \u2018\u2019all-over-the-place\u2019\u2019, I have rephrased as follows; Happier-ness is the way. Happier-ness is the one simple motivational reason for any human thought, word, or action. This is how I got true happiness, and doesn\u2019t just become a hangover the next morning. This is how I am experiencing happier-ness. decided to live more deliberately, because, well, I read a Thoreau quote about living more deliberately, and it resonated. I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately. To front only the essential facts of life and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die. discover that I had not lived. Henry David Thoreau, Walden, \"Where I Lived, and What I Lived For, 1845-49 I couldn't afford to move to the woods, to the country, so I\u2019m doing it here. I sequestered Kirby's Garden because I wished to live deliberately. To live \u2018off the grid\u2019, as much as possible, while inside it, and see if I could not re-learn what my garden had to teach, and pass on some of its knowledge before it came time for me to pass on this life. Stephen Kirby (2015) What I am learning is My Six Point Plan for Living Deliberately, until you understand the meaning of life is to pursue your happier-ness, without the guidance of another: 1.Food: Simple foods, simple beverages. 2.Clothing: Simple clothing. simple shoes, simple accessories. 3.Shelter: Simply smaller but not tiny. 4.Transportation: Simple and reliable vehicle, bicycle, public transportation, walking. 5.Work: Simple, as only absolutely necessary to cover the outflow of cash for survival. 6.Recreation: Time to Think: Simply to use the ''genius'' capabilities of my intelligence, conscience, and common sense as much as I can manage on a daily basis. Why? Simply for the pleasure of knowing that by doing this I will experience more and more frequent aha moments of understanding, aha experiences of being, anytime, anywhere. And what did Einstein add to the mix, you might inquire? I call it the Whole Truth, Einstein said this about the phenomenon, and called it the \u2018\u2019cosmic religious experience\u2019\u2019; \u2018\u2019...there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of god; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought. He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance... The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor god made in man's image. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doctrines are based on the cosmic religious experience. It comes about, therefore, that we find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints...\u2019\u2019 Albert Einstein, Religion and Science (1930) Originally written for the New York Times Magazine (9 November 1930) When one understands every word of this quote (moderately abbreviated, (See Wikoquote)), one comes to understand the \u2018\u2019essence\u2019\u2019, the \u2018\u2019feeling\u2019\u2019, of the experience of which he speaks. The cosmic religious experience completely encompasses and expands the merely human concepts of a god or gods, spirituality, mysticism, magic, miracle, and a supernatural anything, into the Cornucopia of All Possibilities, thereby dissolving those heretofore mentioned human concepts into insignificance within the \u2018\u2019Wholistic Perspective\u2019\u2019 , within the \u2018\u2019Wholistic Feeling\u2019\u2019, gained by coming to understand the cosmic religious experience. (the Whole Truth) ''It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory, [not just scientific theory] is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.'' Albert Einstein, The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933) When one comes to the aha moment of understanding that the cosmic religious experience, the Whole Truth, is the Einstein's Razor regarding the entire religio-philosophical realm, then all other human concepts, by all the \u2018\u2019wise men and women\u2019\u2019, all the \u2018\u2019sages\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019seers\u2019\u2019, throughout all of human history, become admirably emulate-able, but incomplete, or misinformed, or misunderstood, attempts to elucidate the cosmic religious experience, the Whole Truth, for the benefit of humankind. ''...there are moments when one feels free from one's own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments, one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable: life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only being.'' Albert Einstein, Letter to Queen Mother Elisabeth of Belgium (9 January 1939) Einstein succinctly attempts to explain that the cornucopia of all possibilities accessible within the cosmic religious experience, within the Whole Truth, is BEING, is to BE in the NOW moment. These NOW moments are called \u2018\u2019aha moments\u2019\u2019 of knowing, of understanding. And as I get more practiced at doing this, I will be more able to extend my aha experiences of being into longer and longer durations of the human concept of time, timeless being, and those aha experiences will become the revelatory equivalent of zen, of moksha, of nirvana, of bliss, of catharsis, of revelation, of nous, of nekyia, the list is long\u2026and worth every moment elucidating it for the benefit of humankind. I am an everyman. If I can do it, anyone can. Stephen Kirby\t\t thehappierproject; understanding your aha moments of understanding.

You can reduce deterministic apology to the fact that only one thing happens.  Things have outcomes.  Therefore, what?  Some artifact of theology has got its claws in your self-definition?  Only one thing actually happened, so it must have been ineradicably determined?  And that's relevant to personhood?  Relevant to fear of existential responsibility is more to the point. Physical arguments may make nerds feel good but they do not limit the personal power we choose to possess. The universe is deterministic because we determine how it will be.  Since we both have potentially conflicting wills,  we should probably talk about how we shall require the universe to proceed.  So to speak. ",

However he put a limit on it for our own safety. So in the garden of Eden there was a forbidden fruit even though all the others were available! Man chose that forbidden fruit and since then he has always lived with a bias towards evil. In that sense he his will is not fully free. Never the less God has done something about that. When a person becomes a Christian he or she receives a new nature where we can freely choose to walk in a new way of freedom. This is not to say that the Christian always chooses the right thing. As long as he is surrounded by sin and evil there will always be a battle but in trusting in Christ for daily needs we can walk in a new way. Hope this helps. ",

Brainscans show the conditions of the brain when we consider various choices, and the point up to which we can choose between them. How we decide is not well-understood of course, so you could say free will is not well-understood. You could like Laplace say there is no free will since we are all made of sub-atomic particles with known characteristics, or you could say randomness is built-in to such particles' existence and characteristics, or you could say that \"free will\" is not a solvable philosophical problem. I'd say the latter is the most likely. We certainly act as if we have free will; that is probably enough.  ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of free will. It isn\u2019t obvious, and there are several definitions which contradict each other. The most common definition among philosophers and laypeople is compatibilism: you act freely if you do so without coercion. Compatibilist free will is, as the name suggests, compatible with determinism. This sort of free will obviously exists, and it is important that it exists. But some people, incompatibilists, don\u2019t think it should be called \u201cfree will\u201d. Incompatibilism is the position you are assuming in the question. The main problem with this is that it would not be possible to function if your actions were not caused by antecedents (which includes all internal and external factors). Normally, your actions are determined by your preferences, values, fears, anticipated consequences and so on. Think about what would happen if your actions were NOT so determined, or were only partly determined. It might not mattter if you were choosing a flavour of ice cream, but it would be a disaster if you were doing something as simple as crossing the road, or trying to feed yourself. Fortunately, we don\u2019t have this type of free will. ",

Who would want to live his or her life in suffering, misery & poverty throughout his life if it is predetermined and known? Will he not shorten his misery and kill himself and in the process prove his actions cannot be predetermined? Or would he be predertemined from not knowing his future and thus full filling his destiny? In all probability it is the later. One will never be able to determine the future even if life is predertmined Predeterminism goes against the basic life force and I strongly doubt if one can have both. To say we don\u2019t have free will and everything is based on causality, we should be able to predict the future. Also to predict, it will be humanly impossible even with all the number crunching devices to determine the future as the variables and possibilities are infinite (or nearly infinite). We don\u2019t even know if the universe is finite or what the smallest components are to even start the zillion iterations in the game of life simulation. So we can safely say we have free will. Then there is the other scenario where we have free will and determinism exists side by side (reasonably be able to predict). However since we will know all outcomes and possible scenarios based on the choices we make, but it will not be fun to have a free will. We would rather rather not live such a mechanical/programmed life. ",

Now, how can I prove to you that free will exists? Okay, Let me try Simple logical point I used to give to myself and the people around me who asked this question (mind you, very less people ask this) was that if there is no free will, which means that our life is purely destined and we came on the planet with a defined pathway, bore the fruits of our previous birth actions and then died. Now, if this is the scenario then you just ponder on below written question-: Why will the next birth happen then? But it happens, isn't it? That is what we have read in all the scriptures and in the Bhagavad gita also. So, the only reason for next birth to happen is free will. To have more clarity let's discuss, What is free will? Free will is the freedom given by the creator to us by which we can use our destiny. Another definition could be that-: Assume somebody locks you down into a close circular room and you have no means by which you can step out but you have full freedom to move inside it. The room mentioned above is destiny The freedom to move inside is free will So, yes definitely free will exists and it is one of the prime reasons for humanity to move forward otherwise we would have left this planet long ago. I hope you find the answer logical. Keep introspecting :-) ",

However, they often pop off to one side or the other for no apparent reason. The drop appears to do something that obvious physics would suggest it wouldn\u2019t. The drop is obviously not choosing to take a different route. it is acting on the complete sum of the physics, even though it appears not to be. Humans may well not have free will, it may well be simply we have the appearance and thus the belief of free will due to holes in our understanding of EVERY action that affects our \u2018decisions.\u2019 However, this matters little insofar as we must make decisions (not to decide is a decision) regardless. Perhaps these decisions are made based on something that happened when we were young, or because we read a book, or because an enormous chain of events that caused our brain chemistry to be a certain way, and also caused those things that happened when we were young.

The most striking thing in our brain is the highly connected neurons. neurons can talk with each other transforming and processing some signal or information. There is a theory, called Information Integration theory, calculating the conscious level quantitatively based on information theory. At least, I believe that consciousness is generated by highly dynamic activity of matter connection or information comunication. The connectionism lead to a wired conclusion: everything in the world have some kind of consciousness. I think it is just right. The mysterious remote correlation between quantum molecules could be a clue. This unknown correlation could explain what is consciousness and the byproduct of free will.",

            "answer_text": "Free will is an outdated concept. What we can observer is some kind of self-stimulation and self-observation of brains. That is probably a consequence of the evolutionary advantage of behavioural adaptation mechanisms preserving previous adaptations. This is a difficult task for a neural network because training with a new dataset would erase old training results normally. Apparently, brains replay old sequences of events and generate reinforcements preserving the previously acquired stimulus-response patterns. This is all very interesting. And it is only partly understood. There is a lot of research waiting to be done in cognitive science. But the myths of consciousness and free will should go to the museum, next to the Ptolemean spheres and the gods. ",

            "answer_text": "If you determain that you have free will when: You are the one choosing the decissions in your life.You have options to choose.It depends, if you are religious (Atleast when you are a christian) God made man with free will. However, when your religion doesn\u2019t cover free will, or you are agnost or someone that doesn\u2019t believe in a God, it is getting more difficult to tell. The main reason why is because of determinism and the physical closure of the physical world: Psysical closure just means that everything that happends within our world, is caused by only thing in our world (so no interference from God or anything). Determinism (which most scientists believe to be true, states that if you know the position of all particles in situation A, and you know all laws of nature applying to them till situation B, you can predict situation B (in short, A + Laws up until B = B) The reason why this gives difficulties to the question, is, when you take moment A, before you were born, and take moment B after you die. You can\u2019t influence moment A&B, because you don\u2019t excist, and you can\u2019t influence the laws of nature, so you don\u2019t actually have something to choose, thus, you don\u2019t have free will. This line of thought is supported by the incompatibilists. But this isn\u2019t the main conclussion. In short, because I think I have already written too much, you also have the compatibilists. Their main reason of thought would be, that the way we have determained what free will is, isn\u2019t the correct way. And they show you with a thought expiriment: Imagine, you have been put in a room, and the person that put you there, told you You could leave anytime, and that he will be back in 30 minutes. You decide, that 30 minutes isn\u2019t all too long, and you stay in the room. After 30 minutes, the man comes back, and you are free to go. Nothing strange this far in right? Well, noe comes the tricky part. Did you, as a person, decide to stay the full 30 minutes in that room, or did the door which was appearantly locked from the outside without you knowing, the reason why you stayed? What the compatibilists wanted to show with this thought expiriment, is that you don\u2019t need to have choice, to be able to choose. You only need to feel like you have choice. So for them free will is when you: are the one that makes the choice.feel like you have something to choose from.",

            "answer_text": "I am going to go with 'we don't understand'. The problem of free will or its illusion is inherently tied to the problem of consciousness, which is far from solved. To reject an idea outright it must first be understood. We can explain 2 kinds of events, 1)Random and 2)Deterministic. Free will does not fall within the realm of either. We might not have the cognitive abilities to comprehend it. But maybe it is only because we are intimidated by the current paradigm of science. Our conception of occurrence of events has evolved considerably in the past. Some of them used to believe that things CANNOT happen except according to someone's will, and they invented God. With the advent of science came fixed natural laws undermining God's authority, that then made it difficult for the discovery of true randomness to be swallowed.We are possibly constrained by our approach in this case too.

At the other end, perhaps, choosing to daydream about film star A rather than film star B.

Everything people do is consistent with the laws of physics, so if free will exists, it must be something that happens within physics, not outside of it. The question is what exactly that means, or if it makes sense to call it \"free will\".

Many people think it can be defined as \u2018Doing what you want to do\u2019 but that\u2019s a useless definition because everything that you want to do, smart or stupid, worthwhile or pointless is what you want to do at least in the moment of deciding to do it therefore it\u2019s a meaningless definition isn\u2019t it? The way I see it is the way the Philosopher Daniel Dennett sees it: Choices worth wanting because how can we define freedom as an ability to do things which really aren\u2019t worth wanting e.g. Self harm? From this perspective it\u2019s not \u2018all or nothing\u2019 i.e. Real or bogus, it\u2019s a question of degrees as is intelligence / wisdom which the more you have the freer you are of self constructed misfortunes therefore your well being is greater. Now unless there are extraordinary circumstances whereby self harm somehow benefits general well being so the net effect is that it would somehow be worth wanting it\u2019s probably not worth wanting is it? If that\u2019s the case I\u2019d call it \u2018reactive\u2019 behavior which isn\u2019t worth wanting & therefore you\u2019re not free to act appropriately i.e.wisely. From that perspective free will is an ability to see what\u2019s worth wanting & an ability to behave accordingly. If your not you aren\u2019t free from errors of judgement & therefore you are trapped by your ignorance to know any better. In conclusion I\u2019m not saying that people are free to be wise or otherwise because they aren\u2019t but I am saying that if they have any degree of genuine intelligence i.e. wisdom, they have that degree of freedom from error & what else could free will possibly be if not precisely that?

            "answer_text": "At the quantum level the universe is decidedly not deterministic, but it's also not entirely random, there are constraints. Random with constraints allows for probabilities to be given but still not be able to predict anything with absolute certainty. At the macroscopic level the universe DOES tend to be deterministic, but there are still some isolated situations where quantum effects can be observed at the macroscopic level (like the Bose-Einstein condensate superfluid helium-4). It's also possible (though extremely difficult and uncommon) for macroscopic stuff to have an impact on the outcome of quantum effects. Therefore it's possible, though fairly unlikely, that our macroscopic brains can both influence and be influenced by quantum (and therefore random-with-constraints) events. This idea is a purely philosophical one, and is pretty much entirely pseudoscience (at least until someone comes up with a way to test it), but it's how I am able, at least for the moment, to hold onto the possibility of free will.

            "answer_text": "No fatalism means there is no force or compulsion, whereby man may, in his good or bad deeds, be absolutely helpless like a mere instrument of the will of God; that he may not have any power or choice. Falseness of belief in fatalism is one of the self-evident truths, because every sensible person, by conscience knows that he is having a free will and that his voluntary deeds are not like trembling etc. which is involuntarily. Therefore Muhaqqiq Qummi in his Kitabe Qawanin writes: \"Even if the fatalists bring thousands of arguments in favor of fatalism, they are proved baseless and false before self-evident things.\" Moreover, this fatalism essentially falsifies the theory of reward and punishment in the Hereafter because, one who is helpless in the matter of obedience or disobedience (good or bad deeds), is logically not entitled to any reward or punishment. He does not deserve either to be praised or criticized even in this world. The fact is that if one commits a bad deed, all wise people consider him guilty and liable to criticism and punishment. No one considers him helpless. Free will is also not possible as it would mean that man is able to do everything he desires; that he has full and total authority and ability to do whatever he wants in every matter. This belief is also false according to conscience, like the falsity of fatalism, because every sane person has experience that in many matters, he desired something, but it was not achieved due to some hindrance between his wish and the deed desired by him. He failed to do what he wanted to. Sometimes he even faces the exact opposite of his wish. Therefore Amirul Momineen (a.s.) is reported to have said: \"I recognized God through the failure of desires and inability to achieve wanted things.\"3Is there any sane person who considers himself able to do whatever he wants? He knows very well that: \"Neither his profit nor his loss nor his death nor his life nor his rising is in his control.\"4 Also, the requisite of this belief of Free will adopted by the Mutazali is that they believe in 'associates' of Allah, because when they believe that man has absolute power to do whatever he desires, they consider themselves to have the rank of the Almighty Allah (Who alone is All-Powerful with absolute authority over everything). Some of the words of the Mutazalieven negate God's power vis a vis man 's. \"'But it is a matter between two matters.\" Man is neither totally without freedom of choice about what he likes nor does he has absolute power to do everything he desires. On the contrary, in all voluntary affairs, he requires the will of God to be in favor of his desired deed. Otherwise what he wants to do will not be done. Likewise, he also requires the will of God in every affair. Also in all good deeds, people are in need of the grace of God. Also evil and sinful deeds of disobedience are due to the allowance granted by God. Of course, both the grace and allowance depend on the wish of man. That is why Amirul Momineen (a.s.) said in reply to a person's question about the meaning of: \"There is no power or might except by Allah,\" that: \"There is no power in us in the matter of disobeying God, except under the allowance of God. Likewise we don't have any ability in performing good deeds except with the assistance of Allah.\" In another tradition, he said: \u201cGood is by the grace of God and evil is due to the allowance granted by God.\" Url Divine Justice (Adl) ",

Essentially, if you next action is predetermined by God, then you are merely executing his will, making your \"freewill\" non-existent.

Given we don't know whether or not causality exists, we don't know whether or not free will exists.  This doesn't deny free will (or causality), but places them out of proof and into theory instead.

If one has the power to make a *choice* that is determined by an unpredictable process, I would consider that a good enough practical definition of 'free will'. In this sense, I'd argue that free will exists. Imagine there is a true random number generator (RNG) that returns a 1 or 0, with 1 being take the red pill and 0 being take the blue pill, and I choose to take whichever pill is decided by the RNG. Then my choice is entirely explained by the result of the RNG, and thus my choice would be random and unpredictable. My impulses and desires might compel me to reach for the blue pill, but if the RNG returned a 1, I would exercise free will by choosing the red pill. My action would express my will to be free from all that happened before the result of the RNG. If this is not free will, I don't know what is. ",

The seperate self is in any case illusory, although a very persistent illusion in those who dream, so any apparent free will is also illusory.

We are no longer being run by the conditioned mind and the unconscious patterns and urges. There is then freedom but not \u2018personal will\u2019. There never really was a personal will in the way we have imagined it to be. Whilst there is egoic consciousness then you can go on picking and choosing and having the illusion of free will.

A recent article in Nature News (http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110831/full/477023a.html) discusses how research using fMRI brain scans seems to prove definitively that humans do not have free will. The research comes from the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin. Here's an excerpt:  The conscious decision to push the button was made about a second before the actual act, but the team discovered that a pattern of brain activity seemed to predict that decision by as many as seven seconds. Long before the subjects were even aware of making a choice, it seems, their brains had already decided. In the article, neuroscientist John-Dylan Haynes still expresses surprise at his own study findings. Nevertheless, it looks as if these brain scan tests produce repeatable and accurate results. Haynes' research has been covered in earlier in publications such as Wired (4/08) http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/04/mind_decision and Psychology Today (1/11) http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hot-thought/201101/how-free-is-your-will.

Contrary to popular belief, the Bible does not say we have free will. Free will does not exist. It is God who causes all things to happen. Isaiah 45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things. John 1:3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. God causes all things to happen and is in control of all things, at all times. Jeremiah 10:23 O Lord, I know the way of man is not in himself; It is not in man who walks to direct his own steps. Proverbs 16:1 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord. Php 2:13  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure Eph 1:11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: Pro 20:24  Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? I hope this has helped and is some use to you. ",

For us to have true free will in the way I think you mean, that being the ability to make choices without having the outcome be a result of influences we have no control over, we would need to be able to have thoughts about information we don\u2019t have. That clearly isn\u2019t the case. If our entire conscious experience can be reduced to matter and electrons firing off in our brain in a particular way, it seems pretty odd to say we somehow make decisions that aren\u2019t a result of things around us. our \u201cchoices\u201d and thoughts can only come from the knowledge we have, and our lives could be 100% accurately predicted if someone could have knowledge of the factors acting on us.

A compatibilist will say that even if the universe is for all intents and purposes deterministic, that fact that we feel free in our choices is what matters. A hard determinist will probably demur, saying that what is true is what matters, and so if the universe is deterministic, for all intents and purposes, then free choice is an illusion and we are merely acting out the messy but deterministic pathways of biology. Being a programmer by background, I tend to go more with the latter rather than the former and say what we have is probably the best possible scenario, in which we feel free within a safe and structured context, whereas total and real freedom on the other hand, were it possible, would be meaningless chaos - choices that were truly free of any determining factor would be just random events.

The Bible says \u2013 John 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. The Bible also says \u2013 Acts 2 37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. 47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. Acts 13:48 48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. ROMANS 9 10 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; 11 (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) 12 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. 14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. 19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? 20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? 21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: 23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, 24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? God is sovereign, and there is human responsibility also. The Lord commanded His disciples to preach the gospel. So it is the disciple\u2019s responsibility to preach the gospel as the Spirit of God leads. It is the Holy Spirit who convicts the world of sin and draws the sinner to the Saviour. John 16:8 8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: Only a sinner requires a Saviour. To make a man/woman to realise that they are a sinner, is the Spirit\u2019s work. With the Spirit\u2019s illumination, the sinner recognises the wretched state they are in, and realise they definitely need a Saviour who alone can help them out. No one can save them by themselves. They repent of their sins and accept the Lord\u2019s free gift of salvation. So it is God\u2019s sovereignty and Human responsibility (free will) both! ",

Therefore, what I ought to do is beyond existence for it determines what should exist or not exist.

Further, the experiments of Libet and theory of Daniel Wegner suggest that the feeling of having chosen to do something only occurs after the action has been set in motion. Thoughts arise and actions happen and that is the most that can be said. Unless you can choose to originate a thought, you are logically forced to acknowledge all of this.

Even if free will exists just as an idea, ideas exist. The questions then becomes, what does free will exist as? Some say free will is given and some say free will is inherent. The inherent human ability to make choices and act on them is pretty much self evident. The possibility that free will is given to humans by deities is vanishingly small. So because some people say this and some people say that, and the phrase free will is used in two very different ways, it is difficult to tell which way your question is about.

And others come from experiences which they come from our environment. And then on top of that we have biological programming. Our desires and needs like seeking status or mating or craving certain foods. So if you are programmed by your family and your biology then how can you tell you are free? You think you make decisions but they come from deep subconscious programming. You just don't aware of them. You just follow your feelings but you don\u2019t ask why do i feel that way, why do i think this way and that person doesn't. You can't escape from this. No one can control the environment, culture or family that she or he born into. You have no control. Self is an illusion. It doesn't exist. You are not even the same person with 5 or 10 years ago. When you make decisions you don\u2019t know what subconscious programs control your behaviour. When you think you don\u2019t know why you thought that way. So you don\u2019t even know what you don\u2019t know. Therefore how can you say you are absolutely free when making decisions? Because you are not. We all follow our feelings, desires and thoughts and those come from deep deep programming.

But these latter are focused on man's own efforts achieving some higher plane of understanding. I'm persuaded that a limited scope of 'Freedom of will' exists for mankind. We can make decisions about how we interact with nature and one another in the temporal. I can, also, see the argument for 'freedom' when it comes to how Christianity has described God's relationship to His creation [... several forms of government have realized examples in mankind's history (authoritarian = dictator or monarch; democracy; etc.).] I find that some believers tend to confuse the *type* of government with the actual *style* of leadership employed. These're not one and the same. Sovereignty is not synonymous with authoritarian dictation by leadership over the citizenry - it's only one of a matrix of four possible inter-relationship pairings. ",

And no government could control me on this, no Gods either, no one, I take no compromise about pizza. I could maybe think of some other example, but my mind has been plagued with that of the tuna melt pizza, so this conclude my answer. ",

But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.\" Genesis 4:7",

The next step is to develop an intimate union with the life energy. As the union progresses, our awareness on the universe begins to expand. Should there be any need for a free will, the awareness will channelize the life energy to that particular objective. The life energy will then attach to it and bring it back to the original observer, which is us (the awareness). Majority of the world population cannot believe in free will because it is very very very difficult to empty our mind and body of desires. Thank you.. ",

However, determinism at the universal level is not required to bury \"free will\". We already know that our biology [including our brains] operate at a deterministic level.  While this may not be 100%, it is sufficiently deterministic that allows us to live, survive, and predict with relative certainty how we need to respond to various situations. However, the irony occurs because \"free will\" requires absolute determinism.  It postulates that an individual can act specifically and intentionally to produce an outcome.  It doesn't get any more deterministic than that. So, determinism clearly indicates that \"free will\" cannot exist.  It cannot be salvaged by invoking the randomness of quantum physics, since \"free will\" itself must be deterministic in order to produce the desired result. \"Free will\" cannot exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophically speaking this question is still somewhat debated. On the one hand, some argue that whilst we are very complicated machines we are machines nonetheless and learn our behaviours through our interactions with our environment which makes them predictable. It implies that the idea that you are doing something of your own accord is actually an illusion and the real factors behind the decision are subconscious and influenced by other historical events in your life or by biological factors. To give a basic example of this, subliminal messages can give the illusion that you are making a choice of your own free will when in reality, your conscious brain is actually being tricked into believing it has chosen something when it has actually been influenced by external stimuli your subconscious has picked up on. The other side of the argument is that whilst we are undoubtedly products of our upbringing, there are still some things over which we do seemingly have full control and autonomy and therefore some degree of free will. For example, right now I can choose to bend my right arm and flap like a chicken. Whilst this may be something that has been learned previously, there is no specific causal reason that has made me do this other than my own volition.

(Note that a slight change within the definition of free will is the only way to allow for what is known as compatibilism, like Sean Carroll and Dan Dennett often refer to). The discrepancy is with the fact that we clearly feel we can choose freely between, say, different potato chip flavors. On the other hand we think nothing of it that a tap on the knee sets an automatic knee jerk in motion, which subjectively doesn't appear to have anything to do with free will. The most important thing to understand here, is that what we intuitively interpret as free will, is simply an enormously complex set of automatic reactions within our brains. A huge bunch of self interacting knee jerk reactions within our heads, so to speak. And the state of our brains at the moment of decision making can make all the difference in the result, here\u2026 ",

Fork the path though, and it become somewhat more complex. Add enough forks and it becomes very complex but still understandable. (e.g. a computer can model) Remove all the trees so that it's just a plain, and it becomes an incomprehensibly complex, where every position becomes a fork in any direction. The knee-jerk reaction to disliking freewill is the predictability of results. \"No point in trying to quit smoking because you'll relapse.\" Believing that everything in the world is caused by something is not the same as believing everything can be predicted, though.  When the probability space has more positions than atoms in the universe, I'd say that freewill is effectively achieved. The end result cannot be 100% predicted and that's all that matters. ",

That is to say that there are certain norms that  keep you a limited field of possibilities,  but you are always free to chose in what direction your life should go,  what new things to experience or to explore spiritual or religious practices which encourage patience and compassion (while they might not seem like much they are the ones that bring the most joy In our lives).   Also you should consider that you are truly free when you can empty your mind and connect deeply with your soul,  as the mind is the only one that is capable of generating the feeling of emprisonment (Jesus or Buddha would never do this).

The biggest implication of this discussion is morality, how to deal with people we think take bad courses of actions, and how much to praise people we think are taking good courses of actions.   The scientific evidence shows that people aren't making decisions at all.  On one hand, we need to redefine responsibility such that it means accepting consequences of our actions even though we had no choice, because the consequences also cannot be avoided.   It means that punishment/praise above and beyond what is needed to motivate the courses of actions we need from people is not justified.  It also means we have to draw a line eventually where we forgive incapable people (especially in cases of low iq). ",

Free will defined in that way is totally incompatible with every physical law we currently know of. So it is safe to assume that kind of free will does not exist. What we think and do at any moment in time is the inevitable consequence of a very complicated web of interdependent causes. Both inevitable and unpredictable. Which does not mean we cannot learn.

All of this happens quieter(?) and faster than we can be aware of, so it seems like we're standing there unable to \"make up our minds.\"  When the brain determines which choice, based on memory/imagination, is (I think Wilson says) the most \"evolutionarily positive\" it moves it into our consciousness and we say, \"I'll get Cheerios.\" The next question then has to do with moral responsibility.

This is analogous to how you can only see what your eyes are directed at right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean that what\u2019s behind you doesn\u2019t exist, even if you\u2019ve never seen it. How does this relate to free will? Well, objectively speaking, the future is predetermined, but with infinite alternative scenarios, each of which has the potential to be experienced by you. So free will is simply the perception that you are deciding which future you will experience. To be clear though, this does not negate the existence of the infinite alternative scenarios or futures, you (as you in your specific experience of reality) simply do not directly experience these different futures.

What does it mean for will to be \"free?\" Obviously you cannot effectively will the Sun to turn green. You can wish for it but that wish has no power to determine reality. (\"Is the thought of a Unicorn a real thought?\") But you can will whatever you have power over. You can will to *see* the Sun as green, though that would be willing yourself to a sort of insanity, and other aspects of your will would probably compel you to see it as yellow-white.  You *can* will two contradictory things, and most people have felt this conflict: that fact is one of the most compelling arguments, for me, that will is not determined by outside forces; if it were determined, it would be subject to the laws of physics, which do not permit of contradiction (only seeming contradiction, as when the dual nature of particle-waves seems to contradict our \"common sense\").

For those who haven't read it, in the novel the protagonist decides to live his life by the roll of the dice.  Randomly assigning multiple options whenever the road forked and proceeding in accordance with what dice decide.  Now that's not an unfathomable concept and the outcomes are certainly a function of your actions. In his case at least the chain of actions could not have been predetermined (provided you disregard the whole religious mumbo jumbo).  My conclusion from this single simple thought experiment is that the chain of outcomes is not deterministic.  Removing the dice should not make it any more so.  ",

Instead the outcome is either pre-determined (deterministic view) or results from indeterministic factors that are outside of the agent\u2019s control (indeterministic view; think quantum physics). Just to be clear, nothing said above prevents the experience/illusion of a free will by the agent. Nor does the ontological absence of free will - should you accept this assertion - has much effect on how we live our lives. As agents, we cannot lean back so to speak, and be an observer to our unfree actions. Whether we have free will or not, our deliberations cannot feel otherwise than an exercise of free will (even though this feeling is illusionary). Futhermore, given the complex processes that underlie our thinking and deliberations, and given the almost infinite variables that determine the outcome of these deliberations, we will never be able to predict them. The only practical consequence of accepting the non-existence of free will is that we should no longer accept revenge as a factor in punishing people who commit a crime. Deterrence would still be a valid argument, as would extracting a harmful indvidual from public life, but adding revenge-induced articles to a punishment would no longer make sense.

Unless they were also on to that. And if \u2026 You see how quickly this collapses into an endless chain of predictability and unpredictability.

The human is still shackled by nature (gravity, temperature, disease), the needs of the body (air, water, food) and the whims of society (laws, family requirements, social needs). Even with those limits however you still have great freedom. A library will have thousands of books and magazines for you to read. There\u2019s endless music to listen to, TV shows and movies to watch, places to go, people to meet. Or you can decide to sit in a hole and do nothing. ",
