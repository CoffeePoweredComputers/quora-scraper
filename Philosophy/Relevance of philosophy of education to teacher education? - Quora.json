            "answer_text": "Theoretical framework and philosophy about education are useful for informing the teacher how to prepare as a content expert and to tailor their presentation as a proficient educator with sufficient awareness to navigate what is happening within the student, and between the student and the subject matter and facilitator. Philosophy of education is necessary for instructors because what, why, how, when, where, who and for what purpose instruction is used as an instrument for making ethical-moral decisions for regulating ourselves, and the positive or adverse consequences to our neighbors (regarding the 100-year vision for society, family, and culture). Although a teacher may refine their philosophy of education overtime, it is important that a new teacher is prepared to view the domain and discipline of professional education beyond their personal world experience. Therefore, certification of teachers is necessary to include philosophy of education. Thinking about what has worked and not worked for the past 3500 years in the history of education is significant for examining our duty of care, level of accountability, and role-modeling as educators that is necessary when influencing the next generation of responsible citizens. Education is a very serious responsibility, i.e., the \u201cability to respond\u201d to the needs of a person in context of a civilization for the purpose of enabling that person in their season of life and within their given mental, emotional and physical capabilities, to become a responsible and productive citizen in the community. An instructor/facilitator\u2019s skills to apply various venues, styles, and techniques enable the student to demonstrate proficiency of knowledge, skills, and attitudes (abilities) (KSAs) and complete objectives that require various forms of transactional and transformational leadership awareness that is necessary to map-out what is happening, why it is happening, and to what extent is \u201clearning\u201d \u201cdevelopment\u201d progressing within the capabilities of that particular student. (By definition PhD students are abnormal). The human condition is measured in context to socio-cultural factors. Development of humans requires pre-requisite readiness levels to demonstrate KSAs for an accumulative purpose with an end-in-mind. It is important for the instructor to observe if the student is processing as an INTJ or an E, or S? Because the instructional style influences his/her word selection and use of examples to make the subject relevant for the learner. For example, is the student able to recall and construct abstract frames of thought to apply in practical (concrete) modalities of learning? To what extent does the student need active Cognitive Mediation, experiential anchor points, repetition and reinforcement exercises, and auditory-visual-kinesthetic signals to apply the concepts and precepts to grasp and comprehend a particular domain, such as math, music, physics, chemistry, medicine, law, history, literature, or scuba diving? Students are harmed by exploitive teachers with attributes of narcissistic, bully, power-control character deficiencies. The tax-payer entrusts teachers to demonstrate suitable, professional, licensed, certified skills, to lead and encourage the thoughts and learning experiences of students. Each of us can recall a teacher that helped a difficult subject make sense and enjoyable to learn, as well as those teachers who made an enjoyable subject a miserable torture to endure being in the room under their tyrannical incompetence. Telling someone what to do, is not teaching them\u2026 In contrast, going full-circle in the learning process in which the student becomes proficient at teaching someone else the lesson then is considered completing a teaching task. An example of this significant influence in education is evident in the Judge Kavanaugh Senate Confirmation hearing this week on WETA and C-Span. I have observed K-12 teachers, PhD supervisors, and attending physicians instructing medical residents in hospital situated learning, who are terrible teachers. I respond to this inquiry from the perspective of PhD research of comparative education, policy borrowing, and acquisition of best-practice situated learning profiles in 33 countries. Since 1979, I have facilitated, instructed, mentored, tutored, and coached students from elementary, middle, high school, college, military and agency levels in classrooms, labs, fieldwork, and seminars.

            "answer_text": "Philosophy of education has very little practical value for beginner teachers. The best way to learn to teach is to actually do it. When you\u2019re face to face with your first class of students, the only philosophy I\u2019d advise is contained in the following five principles: You\u2019re the leader. Whatever happens in your classroom is your responsibility.Do your best to love your students. All of them.Be passionate about what you teach. If you\u2019re not, you\u2019re wasting everyone\u2019s time, including your own.Always remember that you\u2019re there to serve your students, not vice-versa.Your students will teach you all sorts of things that will affect your identity and influence the way you teach, but you can only ever be their teacher.As you gain experience, you\u2019ll develop your own philosophy of education, and it will serve you much better than the theories and ideas of other educators, past and present.
