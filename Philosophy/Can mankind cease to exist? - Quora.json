            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat is the most likely thing to wipe humanity out as of right now?\u201d Whatever the most likely thing is to destroy humanity, its probability is close to 0. Why? Complex animals have been around for over 500 million years. In all that time, nothing has wiped out all the animals. Even the huge asteroid that hit the Earth 65 million years ago, that killed off the dinosaurs, ended up allowing mammals to flourish. Here is the single most important reason why it would be virtually impossible for humans to be killed off: we inhabit almost every part of the Earth that is habitable. This makes virtually impossible to wipe out everyone. Let\u2019s get specific. Overpopulation Below is a graph of projected human population. As can be seen, we\u2019ll top out from at around 10 billion people, up from the current 7.6 billion. There\u2019s more than enough room and resources for 10 billion people.  In many developed countries under-population is a big problem. The following is actually true: Japan sells more adult diapers than baby diapers. Natural Resources Because of the continued exponential growth in technology, we have access to more natural resources than ever before. Fracking has allowed countries to inexpensively obtain more natural gas than we thought possible. Technological advances have also allowed us to inexpensively tap into more oil reserves than before. We will not run out of these fossil fuels before we don\u2019t need them to generate energy anymore. Resources such as aluminum, iron, manganese, chromium, etc., never get used up - they don\u2019t leave the Earth. With advances in technology and robotics, we\u2019ll be able to recycle these and never run out of them. Similarly, water never leaves the Earth. It just takes technology and energy to make it potable. Energy Renewable energy is getting less expensive every month. We\u2019ll also need a steady baseload of energy. The only source of a clean baseload of energy right now is nuclear power. It is a bit expensive right now, but within 10 to 20 years, it should be competitive with natural gas or coal. This means that by around 2050, any new energy plants should be non-polluting and non-greenhouse gas emitting. Which leads to our next topic. Global Warming Are humans causing the Earth to warm? Yes. By how much? Here\u2019s a graph from NASA for you that has actual data, not projections from the hundreds of climate models:  Note that the dates start from 1979, about when we could accurately make projections because we\u2019ve had good satellite data since then. The red line is the running average. Starting at 1980 and going to 2017, we\u2019ve increased by about +0.41C in that 37 year period. Let\u2019s extrapolate that over a century. It comes out to a 1.2C increase by 2100. Other graphs show a bit higher, but they all show less than a 2C increase by the year 2100. Since we\u2019ll have clean energy, and energy that emits no greenhouse gasses before this century is over, there is not a chance that global warming will cause human extinction. Disease There is no conceivable epidemic that could wipe out humanity. As mentioned above, we are spread all over the Earth. With modern sanitation, the CDC, the WHO, quarantine, etc., no disease is likely to kill a significant portion of the developed world. Less developed countries would suffer more, as they have been, but not enough to make a significant dent in their population. Artificial Intelligence If some very bad people send up drones, or automated jets, or automated cars or trucks, they could do much damage. But this would not be a threat to humanity. What if AIs became conscious and decided to wipe out humanity? Yes, some scientists are actually concerned about this. Here\u2019s the good news. No one has any idea as to how to create self-aware machines. Watching too many Terminator movies is the cause of this fear. Nuclear War The chances of a major nuclear war are very small. Only the United States and Russia have over a thousand nuclear warheads. Neither country wants to die. But even if they did have a major nuclear war, it would certainly be devastating, but most of humanity would survive. (The fallout from a nuclear war is pretty minimal because the blasts are made above the Earth to achieve the greatest blast radius. This means not much soil will be irradiated). A few nukes from North Korea or Iran, while being terrible to those areas that are hit, will not make a dent in human population. A Giant Asteroid This, I think, is the biggest threat to humanity. A hit from a 20 mile wide asteroid might cause human extinction, if only because the result may cause the sky to darken for years. But the odds of such an asteroid hitting the Earth are millions to 1 in a given year. By next century, we should have the means to detect and then deflect these killer asteroids.  Humans are here to stay We\u2019ll be here until the Sun burns out in a few billion years. The important question is: Are we going to use our talents to create an Enlightened Civilization? I trust that this will be the case. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201cHow will our existence end?\u201d Your existence and mine, in the physical sense, will end when we have died and decomposed. The existence of the human race will end when the last individual member of the species dies. This could happen tomorrow, if all of the existing weapons of war were set loose. It will more likely be hundreds of thousands or even millions of years in the future, under circumstances we cannot currently imagine. The earth will eventually become cold and barren, unable to support life, before it is consumed by the sun, in a billion years or so. The observable universe may continue to exist forever, but the current understanding of physics indicates that it will probably, after many billions of years, either collapse into a fireball (or else a black hole) or expand into a lifeless void. Existence itself has no end. The existence of our souls\u2014if we accept the existence of the soul\u2014also has no end: And now concerning thy question regarding the soul of man and its survival after death. Know thou of a truth that the soul, after its separation from the body, will continue to progress until it attaineth the presence of God, in a state and condition which neither the revolution of ages and centuries, nor the changes and chances of this world, can alter. It will endure as long as the Kingdom of God, His sovereignty, His dominion and power will endure. It will manifest the signs of God and His attributes, and will reveal His loving kindness and bounty. \u2014Gleanings from the Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, number LXXXI. Thou art My dominion and My dominion perisheth not; wherefore fearest thou thy perishing? Thou art My light and My light shall never be extinguished; why dost thou dread extinction? Thou art My glory and My glory fadeth not; thou art My robe and My robe shall never be outworn. Abide then in thy love for Me, that thou mayest find Me in the realm of glory. \u2014The Hidden Words, Arabic, number 14. The reason for this is that the soul, unlike the body, the earth, and the observable universe, is not a composition: Every composition is necessarily subject to destruction or disintegration. For instance, this flower is a composition of various elements; its decomposition is inevitable. When this composed form undergoes decomposition\u2014in other words, when these elements separate and disintegrate\u2014that is what we call the death of the flower. For inasmuch as it is composed of single elements, the grouping of multitudinous cellular atoms, it is subject to disintegration. This is the mortality of the flower. Similarly, the body of man is composed of various elements. This composition of the elements has been given life. When these elements disintegrate, life disappears, and that is death. Existence in the various planes, or kingdoms, implies composition; and nonexistence, or death, is decomposition. But the inner and essential reality of man is not composed of elements and, therefore, cannot be decomposed. It is not an elemental composition subject to disintegration or death. A true and fundamental scientific principle is that an element itself never dies and cannot be destroyed for the reason that it is single and not composed. Therefore, it is not subject to decomposition. \u2014The Promulgation of Universal Peace, talk number 123, given on 9 November 1912.

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of possibilities of how humanity can be wiped out. Genetic engineering. It would be quite possible for scientists to create some disease that would be incurable, highly contagious, and fatal to 100% of the people who get the disease. It would also be possible for them to engineer something that caused all crops to fail leading to mass starvation. It would also be possible for them to engineer something that destroyed the ecosystem in other ways.AI. Computers are getting smarter and smarter. Someday soon everything in the world will be connected and artificial intelligence will get smarter and smarter until it is far more intelligent than humans. Someday these computers could be smart enough to decide they don\u2019t need humans sucking up all the resources and telling them what to do and decide to obliterate us.Nuclear weapons. The world has used a lot of restraint when it comes to nuclear weapons but should some crazed third world ruler decide to start the weapons flying it could spread to the point where the world is destroyed.Population growth. World population grows faster and faster. Like it or not we are leaches or more correctly fungus that suck the life out of the earth. We deplete the soils, chop down the rain forests, pollute the air and water and destroy the world we live in in many ways. With population growing at the current rate in another generation or two we will not have the capability to feed the population of the world. As we continue to destroy our planet we could get it to the point where life can not be sustained.Climate change. I have never been a big believer in climate change but I do notice our weather seems much more extreme than in the past. It seems like every night when I turn on the news I see reports of floods, forest fires, mud slides, sink holes and other extreme weather. What I see on today\u2019s news may just be a harbinger of things to come.Of course there is always a chance of a comet hitting the Earth or the sun exploding or the earth spinning out of orbit or biblical style floods or any of a million possible natural disasters.I will be surprised if the earth is a peaceful comfortable place packed with happy human animals in two or three centuries. I think human life is most likely in it\u2019s waning days but the chances are when humankind no longer exists the cause will be something we never could have forecast. I won\u2019t be around to see it and to know but I do wish mankind the best.",

            "answer_text": "Climate Change. And don't take my word for it: Final defense policy bill mandates Pentagon climate change study Climate change threatens half of U.S. military sites: Pentagon Effects of Climate Change | Threats | WWF Why is China\u2019s smog so bad? Researchers point far away to a melting Arctic Here's the simplest way I can explain it: every species and society has a sort of \u201cGoldilocks zone\u201d to them \u2014 the Earth is just far away from the sun to not be scorched dry, and not be deathly cold either\u2026 but on Earth, each creature has adapted to a specific place, without having to make and wear specific clothing for protection, or get food outside of where they live. Humans are a bit more complicated because we're flexible like that, but you still can't expect people to live in volcanoes or deep underwater for very long, because we still have our basic needs based on what we are: biological meat bags with sentience. When things change, it becomes harder for humans to survive. But it depends mostly on how fast the change is: a fast change like war is difficult to survive in, but natural climate change is normally slow enough that we can do something about it in our own time. Not anymore though. Climate change (specifically, Global Warming) as we know it today, is when the seasons and normal average weather patterns change: hotter summers, colder winters, and even the timing of each season changes resulting in late springs and early winters. And because our society depends on the weather and seasons being stable \u2014 our crops, our plans, our entire species as a whole suffers. Nevermind how such changes become blessings to the various insects and microbes that force people to use poisons and antibiotics on, killing even more wildlife and people, while teaching the mocrobes how to overcome antibiotics as a result of their overuse (out of fear for the microbes affecting crops). Nevermind the effects these would have on methane trapped in permafrost, or in melted ice diluting the oceans, making it harder for Earth to recover from the damage caused by runaway development. And the cycle only gradually continues to accelerate to a point where entire Earth can no longer sustain life. It's already happening, with deserts expanding and crops failing to grow in certain regions. As a result of the already-existing threats of reduced land area and supplies, people have become more violent and desperate. It's not surprising if this would fuel all the existing wars into a full-blown series of disasters. Climate change alone won't kill humanity. But it is such a powerful amplifier of everything that can kill us (weather, disease, famine, violence, war), that it might very well be the number one real method for initiating an Everyone Dies\u2122 scenario. Climate change doesn't kill people. People kill people\u2026 when they take climate change and pull the trigger that causes it to blow up into disastrous proportions. ",

Mega-subterrestrial explosion, which would launch lots of debris into the atmiaphere causing climate chanve too severe and too sudden to survive. Or asteroid collision with Earth (we barely dodged one a few years ago). Which would have the same effect. Or just hit hard enough to cause massive earthquakes\u2026 lemme clarify. Even with what we consider massive earthquakes, humanity might still survive, even if it is just a few thousand people that survive. I am talking tectonic plates overlaping massive earthquakes. Planet shape shifting massive earthquakes. That kind of stuff would exterminate us. Any less, humanity coukd survive. And an asteroid would have that effect, or the same as the mega-subterrestrial explosion. Depending on the size of the asteroid. All out sudden worldwide nuclear war. Like, all the nuclear bombs fired at the same time. Only like 0.01% of the population would survive the explosions and fallout. But, severe sudden climate change. Solar flare. Because severe sudden climate change. After 50% of the Earth has been completely incinerated and 25% has been scorched. . Then again\u2026 the severe sudden climate climate change already happened, and some animals survived. So, maybe even that wouldn\u2019t. Of these, I think asteroid hit and sub-terrestrial mega explosion would be most likely. . We could survive disease, we could survive many things. Now how the world will end. And lemme telk ya, its not too far. . God will destroy the world. He will save the wholehearted Christians and will create a new world where we will live happily ever after. ",

The Sahara desert was once fertile savannah, supporting billions of species. Today, climate change has reduced this fertile land to barren sand. The American heartland, the greatest producer of food in history, is running out of water because of climate change. The rain isn\u2019t falling, and the deserts of the Midwest are expanding. It is easy to imagine an American Sahara stretching from Memphis to Seattle. As humans decline into a threatened species as a result of climate change, they will also become more susceptible to disease. The further north you are, the less effective the atmosphere is at blocking UV rays from the sun. Those UV rays kill bacteria in the air and on exposed surfaces. Currently, cold temps in the north keep bacteria in check. With climate warming, the bacteria are no longer refrigerated and the UV can\u2019t kill them off. Expect the final survivors of humanity to die from staphylococcus infections. You youngsters have about 100 years to stop this. I\u2019m too old, and I\u2019ll be gone before it kills you. You can start at the ballot box. Elect educated, intelligent leaders, unlike the bunch of fools we have now. You might have a chance. ",

Happiness Box Collapse. A \u201cHappiness Box\u201d is a box you put your brain into, and a computer generates a virtual Paradise for your. Without a body to get sick, you could live for thousands of years. A Russian billionaire named Dmitry Itskov who wants to live forever is working on the brain-in-a-box part. The video game industry is developing the software. Herewith an article that describes the process in more rigorous detail: LIVE FOREVER IN A HAPPINESS BOX AND NEVER DIE https://futurism.media/live-fore... I estimate the first commercial Happiness Boxes will be available within 30\u201350 years. Hmm, it occurs to me I\u2019m assuming Dmitry will never have any help. That\u2019s probably wrong. I suppose as more and more people saw the potential, they would start pouring in more money, until in the end the brain-in-a-box project will be spending just as much money as the video game industry. The end result will be the total extinction of the human race, of course, but nobody\u2019s going to care about that.

According to the theory\u2019s original authors, this may occur about 22 billion years from now. The latter theory, which is slightly more plausible, assumes that if our current understanding of heat entropy is correct, that heat energy will be so spread out across the universe that life will be unsustainable. Of course, it is unlikely that humanity could survive long enough for either of those fates to matter. Nuclear war and the death of our sun are both much more imminent threats that could easily wipe us out, not to mention potential universal deaths that we are yet unaware of. ",

Then there is the possibility of a meteorite / asteroid. That would be pretty spectacular. Or we could just continue to damage our environment - our habitat. I suspect it will be the last noted here - global warming. ",

I feel like the atmosphere disappearing should be a legitimate concern for being taken out. Not to mention Fukushima is still leaking tons of radiation into the oceans every year and they still haven't found a way to take the fuel rods out. Whenever most ocean life dies that's also pretty catastrophic just based off my assumption. Considering humans caused all of this then yes humans will cause our own demise. ",

An answer from Joseph Schwartzman refers to bees and I would like to elaborate. The loss of bees may seem like a minor problem but I live in an agricultural part of the US and see how active the bees are in the spring and summer, going from one bloom to the next, constantly. These bees are carrying the promise of continued renewal of the plant and without bees there will be no renewal or produce made by the plant/tree. I would guess without bees the human race would have about 4 years to live. One small polination for a bee, one giant polination for the human race. ",

            "answer_text": "if you think of existence and the end of the body, the answer is obvious- death! I propose a different perspective- existence is that which is, before any concept arises and traps the mind into thinking. Existence cannot not be- it is positive, powerful, immutable, \u2018in your face\u2019; it has always been- eternal, beyond space and time, never changing. It is obvious when thoughts like death, life, existence, non-existence\u2026 entertained by the mind are simply ignored- of course any thought report to the chief thought \u2018I\u2019 which needs make no exception from any other concept to be ignored. Through practice the mind becomes weaker and the background of existence upon which any thought arises will \u2018swap places\u2019 with the fascination for thoughts and become the foreground of reality that is your true nature.

Kurt Weil describes this as the \u201csingularity\u201d in his book, \u201cThe Singularity is Near\u201d. Just as artificial hearts, arms and legs (prosthetics) replace their counterparts, so will artificial brains replace theirs, largely without any fuss or bother, and with far greater efficiency, longevity, and capability. Uploading a person\u2019s entire personality and consciousness will become not only commonplace but also desirable. The last biologically-based intelligence will fade out as the last of the humans choose not to participate in their own evolution. Spoiler alert: this evolution is happening right now; we are happily inviting it, accepting it, and no one is wasting time looking back. ",
