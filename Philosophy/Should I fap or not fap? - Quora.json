            "answer_text": "It depends on you, your mindset, where you are in life, and what you want from life. Some people fap and have a great life while others do not. Some people practice NoFap and experience a wonderful life while others try NoFap and realize it is not for them. Do what suits you and what you think is right. You are the ultimate guide and driver of your life and you will inevitably make the choices that steer you life towards it\u2019s conclusion. What I will say is if you are on the edge of this decision then try NoFap to see if it is right for you. If it is then great, welcome. If it is not then at least you tried first hand and you know it truly isn\u2019t for you. I should also speak to having the right mindset - whether you are doing NoFap, Semen Retention, saving Jing or conserving life energy - it all boils down to the same thing and this is MINDSET. You are changing you your mindset to focus on things that matter in life. There are many guys out there focused on getting dates, and being in relationships rather than focusing on building good credit, starting a business, furthering their education and bettering their health. The crazy thing is, if you focus on the latter things rather than the former then you find yourself in relationships a lot easier than just solely focusing on them as a primary objective. We only get so much chances to live our dreams and we only have one life to live so make your life the best as possible. Don\u2019t stagnate on being in relationships where you have no control over them. What you can control is your education, if and when you start a business, your credit and bettering your health. If you want to know the benefits of NoFap then look here. ",

            "answer_text": "To fap or not to fap? That is the question, fappers! I would fap, but there\u2019s a catch! Fapping prevents you from interacting with any mating partners that may come your way, or it will affect your school life, work life, or any other relationships in life itself, which wouldn\u2019t be very good at all. So, if I were you, I would dial it down by a few notches and get out of there, stop fapping with yourself and get a life\u2026 Plus, get a girlfriend!
