            "answer_text": "One is self-actualizing every moment of their life. At least, one can be. I commented at length to Aaren Cobb, and in short to Jane Chin, whose answers I voted for. Aaren's further comment/s to me compelled me to write more. I include it here, in a effort to offer what I can to others who seek answers/understanding re 'self-actualizing'. Aaren, in an effort to share what I feel re 'self-actualized' people: most I've met would not likely answer a question about it... perhaps it is humility; perhaps they know there is no one-and-only-right-way to get there. Perhaps they don't even 'think' in terms/semantics of 'self-actualizing'. Just a personal observation over the years. Also, some self-actualized people rarely answer, instead, they question. I am not young; I had no clue for decades what the term meant; I never sought to be 'self-actualized.' Your answer will help to enlighten some; I don't think one can define the steps, nor limit them to two. You wrote (in a comment elsewhere) something about an aha moment. (Depending on how one defines for himself an aha moment,) these, to me, can be 'what it feels like.' You write, \"I imagine viewing myself from a third person perspective...\" I think when one is self-actualized, even for a short period of time (a day/month...), it is like stepping outside a circle. Jane Chin has talked about advances in Maslow's theory; she suggests it's a circle, not a pyramid; I strongly agree. Reading more of Jane's writings might help some to see life differently ...relax, be less self-assessing/self-judgmental, every moment of every day which often becomes a trap, I think. A TED talk, with Jill Bolte Taylor \"My Stroke of Insight\"http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bo... I recommend to anyone inquisitive about peoples' behavior/thinking; her talk is engaging, entertaining, educational, insightful... (all things which appeal to me). Anywho--I mention this, because she, to me, demonstrates what/how it might 'feel like' to be self-actualized. (Self-actualization is not the focus of her talk.) Re this state of 'self-actualization' being difficult to maintain --I get that. I choose to be 'on' (alert/fast/smart/creative) approx. 20 hours a day for extended months at a time. Given sound/refreshing sleep; I enjoy it --but during those months I spend little/no time on-myself relaxing, reading, reflecting... sitting alone with oneself, being with nature/quiet.... Other months, taking care of myself is almost all that I do. I believe without 'enough' time to just 'be' ('suck-in' without feeling one has to 'expel'), it might be hard to feel 'self-actualized.' I so understand. However, some people 'balance' their life (time) differently than I do. More a turtle than a hare approach through life. One not being better than another. Each human is different, each path as well. It helps to know we each always have a choice. Always always have choice. Turn right, left, jump paths, fly.... My first extended feeling of 'self-actualization' came after writing (every awake moment of my day) for extended weeks, in depth, in my personal journal; I was working out a problem/un-easy feeling, I could not understand, nor address, nor shake. Journaling has always been helpful to me; YMMV (Your Milage May Vary). Sidenotes:  One might find How does one perform a \"cortico-thalamic pause? additionally helpful.You write,\"It also means being aware how your behavior affects other people.\" So so important-- and yet impossible to fully grasp. Each action/word/deed/movement... affects others. We never know to what extent. 'Do no harm' is a good refresher thought/self-spot-check --but if one focuses there only, it may stifle/constrict one's ability to reach out to someone....and sometimes, one word, one smile, to one person, lifts them more than any action of any other person they encountered in their day.Be fearless; be yourself; seek to understand. Or don't seek, just 'be.' Respectfully, ",

            "answer_text": "Maslow's model is nice and simple, an easy way to get managers to look at different motivations etc - but I recall one commentator pointing out that the model could be interpreted in over 30 different ways.  The price of simplicity and usefulness in this situation is any rigour - it can mean whatever you want it to basically. Psychology at the time was dominated by drive theory - but that created a problem in human behaviour - why don't we just fall asleep when we have everything we need.  Malsow's answer was the hierarchy of needs with an open ended one at the top (always interesting in students essays to read of people who they think of as having achieved self-actualisation!).  So someone is motivated by self-actualisation if they are not motivated by anything else.  Not necessarily related to happiness or perceptual ability or anything else. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are two steps for knowing when a person has reached self actualization.  The first step would be knowing what self actualization is and what it means. To me it means being able to assess yourself from an outside perspective. I imagine viewing myself from a third person perspective and analyzing my behavior and motives.  The second step would be contemplating the analysis of your own behavior and being honest about your motives and what may have influenced that behavior. It means being honest with yourself about why you have behaved a certain way or pursued a certain goal.  It also means being aware of how your behavior affects other people.  I think self actualization is a state of being that can be achieved sometimes. It's difficult to maintain a self actualization mentality at all times because there are so many other things to concentrate on just to engage in life. Those other needs that Maslow talks about require a lot of attention. ",

And the easiest way I can describe it, if you have to question if you are having one, then it may not be one. At least for me, I could see so many aspects of my life experiences connecting to a central focus point, and everything made sense, I lost any anger in my heart for anything that happened in the past, and I could see/understand exactly what the nature of my soul/spirit/energy/purpose was, and I felt connected to the world and universe in a way that I have never felt before. I actually felt this way for a while, and just happened to do a search to see what the \"definition\" was. At least for me, it is an intrinsic sense of knowing....and it feels unlike anything I have ever felt in my life. ",
