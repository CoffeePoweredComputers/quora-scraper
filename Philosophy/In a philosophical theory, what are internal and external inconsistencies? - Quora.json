            "answer_text": "Internal consistency refers to the argument presented. Does its conclusions logically follow from its premises? Can one generate any contradictions from the argument itself? This is usually measured in terms of validity. External consistency might refer to whether the theory is consistence with all the relevant facts. Is there some fact about the world which might be inconsistent, or incompatible with a premise of the argument? If any premises are propositions about facts, are they correct or not? This is usually measured in terms of soundness. Because a sound argument must also be valid, a critique of a theory will usually begin with an analysis of its validity. If the argument presented for the theory is not valid, then that\u2019s sufficient to reject or modify the argument or theory. Only when the argument is found to be valid will we find the need to proceed to fact checking. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s fairly simple: Internal inconsistency is when something does not meet the basic criteria for inclusion in a philosophical category. For example, if something is determined to be \u2018not logical\u2019 or \u2018not ethical\u2019. Logical consistency might be about completeness or reasonableness, for example, whereas ethics might be internally inconsistent when it fails external criteria. External inconsistency is generally failure in the real world. For example, the theory that all swans are white was famously disproved by discovering black swans in Australia. If it happens that we live in a simulation, a theory that rejects the role of technology might be externally inconsistent. \u2018Internal\u2019 generally concerns knowledge and epistemology, whereas \u2018external\u2019 concerns realism, practicality, and testing.
