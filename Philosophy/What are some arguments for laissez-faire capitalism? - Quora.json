            "answer_text": "$$$$$$$$$, success, easier lives, freedom, joy, the individual is the rules. The individual is king of the economy. Companies vie for the attention of the consumers, every day the consumer votes with dollars for what he thinks is best and the consumer is fickle. Laissez-faire capitalism operates bottom up. The people at the top of the food chain are about like janitors or night watchmen. They really do not do much and we don\u2019t want them doing much. Because then they would be wanting to go to war or raise taxes or pay off their friends. Laissez-fair capitalism is an advanced socio economic system. It is complex and only works because each human is as valuable as a king or a president. Each citizen owns himself; he is not owned by the state nor does the state own his wealth. Laissez faire capitalism respects the individual; it does not tell the human what to do nor how to live. A man decides that for himself. Laissez-faire capitalism makes it impossible for Sociopaths to lead the country. The prime examples of Sociopaths would be Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Hitler, Wilson. In the U S it appears select smug elitist Ivy league grads slithering about in the swamp and running the deep state tell us what to do or when to do it. We suffer because those morons don\u2019t really know what they are doing and they hate capitalism. They think individual Americans are too stupid to think for themselves so they will do the thinking for us. The IVY swamp dwellers must impeach Trump because Trump is draining their feeding ground. The smug elite are being called out and they are going to get even some way. They never admit it but the Ivy Leaguers for decades have made bad decisions that harmed our economy and end up killing American citizens. For example Prez Wilson, A Princeton Man forcing a draft on a million young Americans to go fight in a war on another continent and die. The result being WW 2 and then FDR another Ivy leaguer that funded Stalin and the commies and resulted in the deaths of thousands of Americans, Then there is Truman\u2019s advisors who Effed up Korea, then there is Vietnam war with the best and brightest mismanaging it starting with McNamara, and then the Flockers aka Bushes ivy leaguers that loved going to war. The result is huge debt and thousands of Americans killed and nothing to show for it except the impending islamization of London and the Democrat Party. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of arguments \u201cfor\u201d Laissez Faire\u201d capitalism. There is no shortage in that regard. The problem is that every single argument in favor of laissez faire, is utter, unadulterated, hogwash! What laissez faire means is: \u201cunregulated capitalism\u201d Think about that and let it sink in. We know that capitalists are motivated by nothing other than their own, personal, unmitigated, greed. The premise therefore of laissez faire is that this greed will ultimately bring about economic justice and prosperity, where all regulation fails to do so. John Maynard Keynes had a thought on that point:  The bottom line is that it is absolutely preposterous to believe that repealing regulations and oversight will somehow produce better results than properly regulated economies will achieve. It is sort of like saying that the best way to safeguard the money in the bank, is to leave the vault open and disable the lock on the front door. Where people get ideas like this is a mystery, but the fact that some folks believe this nonsense is frightening as well as astounding. Here is the truth. In the absence of regulation and oversight, hopefully by a government that is actually a democracy, representing The People, the greed and corruption inherent in capitalism will as a matter of practical reality, make the rules. And those rules will favor the corporations and the wealthy, while the rest of us get poorer and poorer every day. Which is sort of what is happening right now in the US, come to think of it. There are no magical \u201cmarkets\u201d that distribute wealth based on some universal and naturally occurring concept of merit. This magical thing just simply doesn\u2019t exist. If you regard the capitalist mythology with the same level of skepticism you would use if I were to tell you that a spaceship from Neptune had just landed in my backyard, you would realize that laissez faire capitalism is just a fraud and a con, designed to separate fools from their money.
