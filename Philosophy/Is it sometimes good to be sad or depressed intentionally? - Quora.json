            "answer_text": "Huh ? No. I can't even believe some people could actually want to INTENTIONALLY feel sad or depressed. Most of all, depression is not a feeling. It's a mental illness. You cannot imitate it or feel it on purpose. And even if you could, I wouldn't recommend it at all. Thousands of people deal with depression on a daily basis and for years. It's a struggle that leaves many scars for those who make it through and can stay alive. People who have the luck to never be depressed should respect that and not try to feel it intentionally. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh lots of dangerous answers here ,you cant intentionally feel depressed.but depression or feeling sad has a purpose,it decreases aggression and limits social interaction which may cause more distress,it signals others to keep an eye on us or to help us, medication stops the brain from processing the traumatic event,i wouldn't call sadness good ..i would call it necessary. Besides without the lows you wouldn't appreciate the highs. ",
