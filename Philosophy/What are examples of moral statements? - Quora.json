            "answer_text": "Moral statements are normative statements that are based on values. Normative means that they are prescriptive for a given action. Consider two statements based on different considerations: I will pick a cookie rather than a piece of cheesecake.I will help a wounded person rather than let him die.The first sense in (1) is merely a matter of taste, but it is not a normative statement. The latter is a prescriptive normative statement because it involves an obligation, which is missing from (1), which is a merely subjective preference. An obligation is, for example, achieved in (2) because the person values life as having intrinsic worth, which is moral value. ",
