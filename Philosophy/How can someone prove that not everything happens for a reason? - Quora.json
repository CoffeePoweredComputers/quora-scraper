            "answer_text": "This hypothesis cannot be proven by observation. For if we made zillions of observations, and each observation demonstrated that the observed event happened for a reason, we would still not be able to be absolutely sure that the very next observation will concern an event that happened for a reason. However, the hypothesis can be shown to be shaky by means of observations. For if an outcome happens for a reason, there is a cause for that outcome, such that the cause will ensure that a repetition of the initial state will produce the same final state, other things being equal. No observations of \u2018collapses of wave functions\u2019 in quantum mechanics demonstrate such repetitive behavior. The hypothesis can also be shown to be shaky by means of logical argument, as follows. Either the universe came into existence out of absolute nothingness, or the universe has always existed in some form or other. In the first case, there can be no reason for the initial state of the universe. In the latter case, there can be no reason for the universe always having existed. Now for a bit of philosophy of everyday life: Perhaps you should abandon the hypothesis. That will probably make you easier to get on with. People who just cannot accept that some things happen for no reason are apt to find reasons even when there are none, and are likely to blame some innocent party as a result. ",

            "answer_text": "You could delude yourself into thinking you found it if you looked \u2018hard\u2019 enough. Usually everything happens for a reason is accompanied by \u2018this one thing happened so that second thing could occur.\u2019 Edit: The reason being alluded to usually is the second thing. It's not the first thing(which actually happened before the second.) So I guess in someway you could say the second thing is the proof, which in Interstellar language is proving your own proof, which is nonsensical. It's always in retrospect and cannot point to a direct cause. So we have to reason why that thing happened. I find most of the why questions to this answer arise out of a need for validation. \u201cWhy did the asteroid have to hit at that particular moment in time when Dinosaurs were walking the earth? Because it had to clear the way for human evolution. Everything happens for a reason.\u201d *At this point, I am making forehead contact with the wall* You see the question doesn't make sense. The asteroid hit earth, plain fact. Why - because it was on a collision course. In a chaotic universe that happens. Statistically speaking, it is normal. We evolved because all other conditions including all past events were conducive to our evolution. That is all. We are not special. ",

If you live in a western country, you enjoy a standard of health and economic prosperity that has little to do with you personally or any deity you might pray to, and has everything to do with those that went before you in the scientific/industrial revolution that has transformed our world. Do you really want to prove that not everything happens for a reason? Visit a hospice. Say hello to a complete stranger dying prematurely from cancer. Buy some flowers and go and brighten someone's dying day. You'll come away with tears in your eyes and a newfound sense of respect for the frailty of life and the tragic waste that is death. Is there a reason that person has cancer? Sure, but it can be as mundane as the natural background radiation caused a minor mutation in their DNA. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. There is a scientific proof. And everything happens for multiple reasons. The main scientific reason? We are here because we are creating, developing, making, building up, constructing, erecting the Past of the Future. The Present is just the Past of the Future. And we all know that without present, could not there be future. And we all live only in the present.  Let\u2019s use the Fiction to explain a scientific reality. Imagine that this idea of fiction becomes true: Fiction: Someone, named Goddito, with immense powers, has a magic wand full of buttons. The magic wand has an amber button named Don\u2019tTouchMe, that, when pushed during 6,66 seconds all human activity is totally paralyzed. And Goddito pushes the amber button during 6,66 seconds because he wants to prove that I am wrong. And obviously, I can not be wrong because I am creating my own Fiction. And all humans will become petrified, fixed, motionless, but still alive without any activity, for one hundred years. It is a state of A Full Emptiness. Or An Empty Fullness. But time does not stop. Stopping Time is one of the ten things that God can not do. But Goddito, in the fiction, can do anything he wants. \u00bfIs fiction bigger than God? Ask God. One hundred years later the button is played again when Mellopsia, that famous mysterious planet, bla, bla, bla, and we resume our activity. We are not aware that we have spent the last hundred years petrified. What has happened during those one hundred years without any human activity? And there is no proof that one hundred years have passed through A Full Emptiness. Everything happens now, in the Present, for a REAL reason. And for many more reasons. AND EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR MANY REASONS AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS IS: WE ARE HERE BUILDING THE PAST OF THE FUTURE. OR: We are here formatting and giving life to the Past of the Future. And it's one more reason why EVERYTHING happens because there's a reason for it to happen. Even if we still do not know why there has to be a reason and what is that reason. At least from a human point of view. And humans have many points of view.  Thanks so much for your upvotes. I never thought they were important. They really are important.

But I suspect you mean a greater reason, a plan, that has somehow been put in place by someone, somewhere. The great Architect of the universe. The Director of the symphony of life. This may seem reasonable, but it falls apart when we look carefully. Let me choose one direction to look. You were once a baby, but that baby is dead and gone. Where is that baby? The baby that you once were is not. It does not exist. Period. There is no past. What is gone is gone, and it is irretrievable. Similarly, there is no future. There never has been and there never will be. Since there is no future, there can be no plan. Oh, we can make up fantasies in our head and suppose one future or another, but that is simply a game of our mind. There is no future. There is only is. There is only this infinitesimal moment, and when it is gone, we are dead and reborn in a new form. You have died and been reborn more times than there are stars in the heavens, and you are not the person who started to read my little answer. Whose plan was that? ",

As for a root cause, you could theoretically go back to the \u201cBig Bang\u201d; however, this is also in contention as we do not know what caused it. You cannot confuse causality with purpose or design however. Causality and its mistaken association with evolution moves people to think of it as a liberal theory. Causality is simply a linear progression of cause and effect without regard to what the cause is; therefore, every event is assumed to have some cause. With respect to there being a divine design or purpose for life, events, or the universe in general, that is a metaphysical concern that is answered by various religions and faiths. It is up to every individual to evaluate life for themselves and come up with their own answers. RAH ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Otherwise there would only be rapid descent into chaos. On a more technical note, there are DIVINE MAGNETICS at play resulting from the interplay of different levels and entities of consciousness at different levels. On reason this issue confuses people is because your FREE-WILL, one might, say is MULTI-DIMENSIONAL. There is a \u201cyou\u201d during sleep that is more expansive than waking you, and this \u201cyou\u2019 may agree to events and connections. etc. that conscious you is not aware of.. yet you agreed to them. These will-based agreements or contracts also occur per-incarnationally.. so many occurrences that appear bizarre or random.. are actually logical life experiences you planned or agreed to outside of your own waking awareness. Plus, along a similar vein, you have fractures within self in your sub-conscious (one might say) that also have magnetic power to draw events and people (good or bad) into your life. For example, if you feel powerless at a deep subconscious level, you will tend to draw into your life situations and people who appear to victimize you. Of course, that is only because you are a magnetic match to those looking to victimize. Get rid of that deep belief, and these people will auto-magically no longer target you. PEACE :) ",
