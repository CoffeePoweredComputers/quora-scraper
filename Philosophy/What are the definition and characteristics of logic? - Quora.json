            "answer_text": "Question. \u201cWhat are the definition and characteristics of logic?\u201d There are two main types of Logic, Deduction - from the general to the particular, and Induction from the particular to the general. Deductive Logic works only when an Argument is valid. For example; All \u2018a\u2019s are letters.All letters are Symbols.Therefore all \u2018a\u2019s are Symbols.We get a sense of our subjects being contained in our predicates, and it can be nicely illustrated using diagrams. This is how, I suspect, Set Theory begun. Nevertheless what drives this system is Validity; that is the link between each Premise and the Conclusion is necessary. So \u2018a\u2019s fall into letters, and those into symbols, so it is necessarily true that \u2018a\u2019s are Symbols. Validity then is as much about sharing a quality as it is about necessity. This simple model is called Deduction. Another yet more complex kind is Induction. It does not use validity but probability most of the time. Every time it rains my lawn gets wet.I arrived home last evening to find my lawn wet.Therefore, it probably rained sometime before I arrived home.There is another class of Induction which does not rely on probability, but on necessity. The best example is the proof that one should never divide by zero. Because doing so creates absurd results. So; Suppose we can divide by zero. 4 x 0 = 0; and 9 x 0 = 0 ( Because a bunch of nothing is still nothing!).Juggling . 4 = 0/0 ; and 9 = 0/0 ;Therefore 4 = 9.Which is absurd. No matter how many times we do this test the result is always the same; that is, we \u2018Induce\u2019 from the particular to the general that \u2018 One MUST not divide by zero\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Here is a quick aside about the building blocks of logic: Purpose/Role/GoalDataCause and effectPatternsDefinition and/or criteriaContrast and/or juxtapositionLogic as a practice also entails: ListeningSeeking purpose and/or reasonsSeeking contextUnderstanding and empathyMutual acknowledgement of perspectival approaches and/or biasesI think a true approach to reason and logic, must take into account the above principles. We in the West also assume that logic is mathematical, is in a syllogism, which I suppose is true. Not to mention, analogies and metaphors which are also key units of logic, assuming they are well used and understood, are mathematical too (think proportionality like A/B = C/D is the same as A*D = B*C). This explains why Miller\u2019s Analogy Test has in the past been used to test one\u2019s ability to do graduate level work. It\u2019s also why I believe the SAT and the GRE both have an analogies section (Blank is to blank as blank is to blank, which you probably either love or hate, I\u2019m not sure there is any in between). It also explains some of the role and purpose of Geometry and Algebra outside the traditional purview of mathematics. ",
