            "answer_text": "Reading philosophy won\u2019t make you \u201csmarter,\u201d in terms of increasing your native intelligence. That particular quality of you basically just is what it is. Read philosophy, though. Do it every day, and you\u2019ll find that you get better at thinking about complex problems. There is a reason for this. Philosophy teaches you two vital skills for thinking about complicated things. The first one is analysis. This is where you look at a problem, break it up into pieces, then take any of those pieces you can\u2019t understand yet and break them up into still smaller pieces. If it\u2019s good philosophy, it will also help teach you how those parts function together as a system. You\u2019ll learn how they work together. And you\u2019ll learn what they look like in isolation. The second one is contextualization. You learn to see the larger structure a concept fits into. If you see a key, you know that it goes to a lock, and the lock is probably embedded in a drawer or door or something, and that the whole thing is that way to keep people who shouldn\u2019t open that drawer or door or whatever out of it, so that only the person with the key can open them. Philosophy teaches you to do this with concepts. You can see not only the pieces of which a concept is made, but the larger systems it fits into. This is one of the real benefits of reading philosophy. Not for learning about age-old puzzles (although that\u2019s fun too) but for acquiring new cognitive skills by practicing on philosophical problems. And those new cognitive skills are worth a lot. You live better. You think differently. And things that were once hidden for you are now blindingly obvious. ",

            "answer_text": "An advantage to study philosophy You prepare for critical thought, appreciation of literature, intellectual challenges, and deep subject matter by reading philosophy, studying philosophers, and writing your own opinions, analysis, and critiques. You might not go through all these steps in any particular textbook by a known philosopher, ancient, medieval, modern, or post-modern. This time covers the ancient periods B.C. through A.D. Nonetheless, you exercise your interest and mental repertoire by studying these components in philosophy. A superior progression in philosophy puts you into rote and often mechanical feeling exercises in the basic into important subjects and philosophers. This introduces you to a practice of philosophy, in its reading and writing. You can also benefit from talking about philosophy, debating issues and arguments, or presenting your original opinions and positions with other people, who also like philosophy. It might start with a personal relationship, with friends or classmates, but you can also consider a formal education, academic relationships, or meeting people in larger organizations to study philosophy. You gradually increase the philosophical depth, and challenge of writing and ideas as you grow. You can plan more difficult readings from renown philosophers who have studied difficult concepts, ideas, or subjects. You need also to apply your own opinions and analysis when you study such philosophers. This makes you form your own opinions, positions, and how you approach the same subject. It reinforces your study of someone else, another philosopher who has studied the subject well, with your own authorship and how you approach the same subject. If you have developed enough philosophy, reading and writing, you can develop your own positions, interests, ideas to think about, and position on traditional areas of philosophy. This forms you into an independent, field acknowledging, and original contributor to philosophy. It does, with your mastery and recognition by other philosophers, puts you on study by students or other philosophers. You might, if your positions and ideas show compelling insight, quality, reasons, or meeting criteria of worthy philosophy, put you next to renown philosophers. An analogy about playing, creating, and artistic mastery You learn music by studying sheets and compositions by musicians, composers, or those who conduct orchestras. You decide on your instrument, read the sheet music and practice. You usually set up a routine to practice playing the sheets, getting in touch with your instrument, and hearing how you play the instrument. You can tell with experience and practice, if your playing sounds like music. This especially applies to hearing your playing in comparison to other musicians, in your class or at a production or orchestra level. This helps you grow as a musician, both in reading and playing music. To bolster your music, you also learn to write music on sheets. If you have acquired enough music skills and feeling, you can compose your own sheets. You compose your notes, arrange them in formal musical notation, and create your chords. This leads to how you create a song, composition, or larger music for an orchestra. This might require a theoretical study of music, abstracted from instruments, specific musicians, or the daily practice. This can help you form your musical style, original music, and present it in a musical language. But music theory cannot escape feeling music, playing music, sensing music, and acquiring a taste for music. This resides both in yourself, when you play and listen to music, and within other musicians, whose music you can hear and decide on its quality. A musician might or might not judge, critique, or teach another musician or student of a style. It depends on the nature of the relationship, the position, musical art, and achievements in the community during the period. And it depends on the student, acting as an apprentice, short term lessons, or another role without strong commitment. This defines how the musician passes their craft, musical style, and composition ability on the instrument. They pass their ability to play instrument(s), and/or the composition and music theory to communicate works. ",

The 21st Century is complex due to the amount of information readily available and the contradictions of our society, so I have decided to focus on life and not concepts but will make reference to ANY ideology that makes sense. Millennials get this and knowing is not accepting. ",
