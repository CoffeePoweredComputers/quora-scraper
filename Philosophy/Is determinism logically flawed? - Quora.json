            "answer_text": "Determinism is not as good a theory as many scientists would like you to think. To begin with with don\u2019t know whether the most fundamental theory of matter and energy\u2014quantum mechanics\u2014is deterministic or not. Some versions of the theory say it is and some say it is not. Physicists have largely ignored the problem of sorting out which interpretation is correct. So the idea that we live in a deterministic universe is an assumption. Another problem with determinism is that it assumes Laplace's Demon is realistic. In classical physics we have this idea that if we have perfect knowledge of the state of the universe and perfect knowledge of the way the universe evolves over time, we can predict the past and future with perfect accuracy. Laplace\u2019s Demon is a godlike being that has such perfect knowledge. The assumed possibility of perfect knowledge drives many arguments for determinism. Practically Laplace\u2019s Demon is problematic because information implies energy and energy takes up space. It turns out that in practice Laplace\u2019s Demon would be larger than the universe itself. So it cannot exist within our universe. And if it is without our universe then it cannot get information about our universe. So Laplace\u2019s Demon looks like an impossibility. Moreover, our knowledge of the universe is very far from perfect at present. We don\u2019t know how quantum mechanics works. We do know that quantum mechanics refutes general relativity inside black holes, and we don\u2019t know what dark matter or dark energy are. The standard model of physics is clearly incomplete because it gives the wrong answers under some circumstances even though it gives high levels of accuracy and precision under other circumstances. The assumption of determinism is that we can in principle have perfect knowledge. On the other hand the Schrodinger equation for a helium atom cannot be solved even in principle without making some simplifying assumptions. Of course there is a difference between being deterministic and being stochastic or incalculable. A double pendulum is unpredictable but is still deterministic: in a non-relativistic frame, with relative flat spacetime, only the known laws of physics determine how the pendulum will move. However, the trajectory is highly dependent on initial conditions and tiny initial differences can lead to very different pathways. But it is still deterministic in theory. We could still, in principle have a fine-grained enough view of the system to perfectly predict it\u2019s arc. However in practice the system looks stochastic after a very short time. The philosophical question is, do we have to accept the Laplace\u2019s Demon argument if perfect knowledge is impossible. In the case of the double pendulum we would have to have perfect knowledge down to the disposition of every single particle. And at this level Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle would prevent us from having perfect knowledge. We cannot both know the position and the momentum of the particles in the pendulum and yet in order to be Laplace\u2019s Demon this is exactly what we must know. I can see how determinism is a compelling myth for physicists. But I think the universe is unlikely to be truly deterministic in the way that physicists want it to be. And this leaves open many possibilities for emergence (though none that I would characterise as magic, supernatural, or paranormal). ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what logically flawed means here, but the burden of proof certainly lies on determinism. I would go as far to say that a belief in determinism is probably in-principle unjustified. There are a number of different reasons. Let\u2019s first be clear what we\u2019re talking about here. Determinism is the doctrine that combination of the initial state of the universe and the natural laws determines every following state of the universe i.e. given initial state A and set of natural laws 272, there is only one possible series of states of the universe. Peirce\u2019s objection or the objection from arbitrariness: determinists will tell you the world could have been different if we had a different set of laws or different initial conditions or some combination of the two. What they are admitting to here is that objective chance exists when it comes to what the laws are or what the initial conditions. They just think all objective chance arises at beginning. Once one admits there is objective chance, there is no reason, prima facie, to think that all objective chance has to be at the beginning. The burden is on the determinist to explain why all objective chance exists only at the beginning or any arbitrary locality, temporal or otherwise.The problem of induction: Hume\u2019s famous problem. Even tho Hume, more or less, identifies himself as a determinist, he means in a sense different from the one above. The problem is discovering what exactly makes it such that State of Universe B MUST follow from State of Universe A. Pointing to the laws will not help here because we don\u2019t discover laws directly. We infer from events what the laws are, or try to find a law that fits the phenomenon and then see if that helps us predict the future. Once you let go some kind of ontological necessity, it is difficult to see why there would be one possible future given the initial conditions and set of laws.Another answer suggest that the impossibility of Laplace\u2019s demon suggests the failure of determinism. We might live in a deterministic world even if it is no more predictable than an indeterministic one. However, it does mean that, in principle, it cannot ever be shown to be true.The objection from practice: we don\u2019t think like determinists. There are two kinds of possibilities for us: epistemic and ontic. Imagine something being in a box, some mysterious something. It could be lots of different things but we tend to think that whatever is in the box is whatever it is. It is already determined so to speak. We think of them as independent of our beliefs, desires, and so on. These are epistemic possibilities. But when we think what could end up in the box but isn\u2019t in the box yet, we tend think that all sorts of things could go into the box assuming the box continues to exist. We consider what what could go into the box, and how we might influence that. We act as if the future is really open. Given that we already behave like indeterminists, that\u2019s a point in indeterminism\u2019s favor all things being equal.Finally, determinism requires metaphysically necessity. It\u2019s difficult to say what a relationship between two states would have to be like such that State B necessarily follows from State A, that state B will always follow State A. This is clearly modeled on deductive logic but we have no reason to take deductive logic to be the appropriate model of the natural world. In fact, with the rise of alternative logics (deviant logics as theyre called), even deductive logic is not quite one of necessary relationships in the way we thought it was.",
