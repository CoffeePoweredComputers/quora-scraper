            "answer_text": "People are my passion, and I' very fortunate to  meet 100's of people every year, from every walk of life, success level, social status, nationality, education level, religion, and views on life. Among them are some very wealthy people, each of them as unique as their story on how they came to wealth. Below I'll describe their stories in one sentence for each one.  Money in itself has no power, but it becomes powerful when a person makes a god out of it. When money becomes the center of ones universe, it makes the person do strange things, their entire living revolves around it, their shtick explaining what it does is somehow paranoid, but nevertheless very convincing. When others join that universe they get swept up in the centripetal force of it, and usually end up in a black hole. Here are some of my aquaintences:  this person owns acres of resources rich land, but waits for the prices of land to raise to the maximum before selling, so lives in a home on wheels, getting by on food stampsthis person believed in getting a hefty inheritance, so he never married, never had children so he wouldn't have to share his money with them. In the last 20 years of his life he owned one outfit, lived on hand outs from others, the house was a shack, and he died without any inheritancethis person grew up in an a house the size of a shed, later in life made oodles of money, lived like a king, later in life got into drugs and lost it allthis person made his fortune playing sports, invested wisely, is known worldwide for his generous heartthis person was born into money, never worked a day in his life, thinks he is the most miserable man that ever lived, because has no real friends, only people who love him when he treats them to material things they themselves can't/won't buyI'd like to answer the question with a little twist, the perception of the people who have all the money in the world, but are still lacking something. So here it is:  money is not a substitute for a ugly charactermoney can't buy true friendshipsmoney can't buy sincere love/affectionmoney can't buy common senseor cultureor mannersor erase bad personal habitsor respector make someone truly like youCheers!
