            "answer_text": "Yes, \u201cnothing\u201d definitely exists\u2014as long as we\u2019re not confusing \u201cnothing\u201d with \u201cnothingness.\u201d All you need for finding \u201cnothing\u201d are two things: a specified location, and an unambiguous definition of what would comprise \u201csomething\u201d that needs to be completely missing from there. In short, unless we set our parameters\u2014which is the basis of definition\u2014we have no basis for sharing meaning, which is the basis of communication; we cannot answer the question. Now, that\u2019s going to be vague and subject to being misunderstood without specific illustrations or examples. So let\u2019s look at a few . . .  Nothing in the Box  This is simple enough. If you were unpacking after a move, and had taken everything out of a box, and someone asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s left in that box?\u201d you might legitimately say, \u201cNothing.\u201d And the person who asked you that, and likely anyone else in the room, would understand what you meant\u2014though you didn\u2019t count the air in the box, the dust in the box, the microscopic creatures in the box, or the tiny bits of styrofoam from the packing peanuts at the bottom of the box. There\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d in the box, because what qualifies as \u201csomething\u201d is readily understood by all involved. Sure, somebody trying to be a particular \u201cbody hole\u201d could take you to task on the air, the dust, the tiny critters, the styrofoam, and other \u201cthings\u201d still in the box. But then they\u2019re only trying to force the limited (and understood\u2014even by them) scope of what qualifies as \u201csomething\u201d in the apparent context of the exchange taking place. When people are honestly trying to communicate, they consent (either tacitly or directly expressed) to the arbitrary limits of time, location, physical presence, and purpose or intent. Only someone who is deliberately attempting to frustrate communication for whatever motives will remove all parameters and demand a definition that\u2019s really \u201cnothingness\u201d instead just \u201cnothing.\u201d But \u201cnothing\u201d is a whole lot more than \u201cnothingness\u201d!  Nothing in Braces  If you\u2019ve ever heard of \u201cthe empty set\u201d in mathematics, enough said. But you also have punctuation. We can write using certain marks thus: \u201c{},\u201d \u201c(),\u201d and \u201c[].\u201d These have \u201cnothing\u201d in them. And you can see it! I literally see nothing!  Nothing in Mind  You ever say something within earshot of another person and they respond, \u201cHuh? What did you say?\u201d and you answer, \u201cOh, nothing.\u201d Well, clearly, you said something. But you said nothing you meant for them to hear, or to hear clearly. Or you said nothing you\u2019d care to repeat. Or nothing you care to explain. Or maybe someone mentions or tries to teach you a concept from science or some other subject or discipline, then asks you what you understood. \u201cNothing.\u201d That lack of understanding\u2014though made of \u201cnothing\u201d tangible or persistent\u2014is comprised of the specific mental content not found in a specific locale: the person\u2019s mind. We all (at least in most English speaking cultures) therefore understand the idiom someone might use when asked a question they have no answer for: \u201cI got nothing.\u201d  Nothing Up My Sleeve  There\u2019s no trickery here. We all understand how language works. Nearly all words have multiple meanings and connotations. We are able to convey what we mean to others with enough care and effort. But people who have no problem understanding the latest slang, or the encrypted languages in certain subcultures (for example, rock and rap lyrics; fictional languages, such as Klingon, and elvish) will pretend not to understand the many mundane uses of the term nothing, in order to deliberately frustrate the communication process for one reason or another. We all know this, because we\u2019ve all done it, myself included. And I\u2019m not here to make any moral judgments about when and whether it\u2019s okay to do this. I can think of situations where I think it would be unconscionable, including on Internet sites such as Quora. I would ask What is the intent? or Is it being used for a selfish or harmful purpose? Is this one of those times when it\u2019s acceptable? I won\u2019t presume to say. I leave it to the Reader to judge these things for yourself. Will you pretend not to understand what this answer is saying and thus take me to task over it? Or, will you realize that what I\u2019m saying is nothing difficult or esoteric, and certainly nothing new?

            "answer_text": "I like to say \u2018the proof is in the question\u2019, and in this case that sentiment is made explicit. My point here will appear trivial, but it is actually a space in itself. I want to give a sense of how significance is sensed. I want to show how we show things. Geo-metria is \u2018the measure of the world\u2019 - I want to delineate what shapes that.  \u2018Nothing\u2019 is a seven-letter word in English, amongst other things. In fact, it is those \u2018other things\u2019 that matter most. Obviously, nothing exists as a textual entity - an object within the universe. Yet, however, \u2018nothing\u2019 obviously does not mean nothing. It denotes absence - the antithesis of everything.  Yet in doing so we see \u2018nothing\u2019 expose the significance of significance. If there is something other than everything then that \u2018everything\u2019 is only identifiable according to everything else. Thus, nothing is bigger than everything.  An eye making itself. This only appears to be so because it doesn\u2019t happen. It is a function of focus\u2026but that is an operation dependent upon an eye\u2026 See how the grammar begins to operate in parallel? There are two antithetical interpretations of \u2018nothing is bigger than everything\u2019. Similarly, \u2018nothing means nothing\u2019 expresses both a literal tautology and invokes a reference to an invisible metaphysics in which the meaning of the term which allows it to function resides.  One of my favourite definitions of irony. I suppose if a dictionary had nothing here it would undermine the entire enterprise. In one way, this world of non-sense is the Platonic realm. In another way, many different realms seem to coexist in this manner - some of which Plato might not inhabit happily, since they would correspond to interpretations of even his words which he himself would not recognise. Is Plato\u2019s vision of the Absolute absolute? Is the \u2018Form of the Good\u2019 unitary? That was, after all, Socrates\u2019 idea. Are Plato and Socrates one and the same? Hmmm\u2026  Listen to them. So, nothing most definitely exists because we can talk about it. Indeed, that existence is what facilitates our very discussion! There is freedom of interpretation in infinite senses, but only because nothing really establishes the effectiveness of relativity. There are always at least two ways to read things, and the reason for this is that reasoning can differ.  More irony. On both sides. Especially in the middle, given that it\u2019s an answer. The way reason itself can be reasonably different is that the rationality that renders it is actually present as nothing. This is the logic of logic and the truth of truth. It it were not there then nothing could really denote anything. Because this is not so, it is actually the case: Consider this matrix:  What colour are the points where the axes intersect? Are they changing? In fact, they are because they\u2019re constant. Significance is first and foremost an artefact of exclusion. As I began by saying (as if what I have said is sensible at all!) what is depends upon what is not. Nowhere is this more clearly seen than in photoreception. As Jess H. Brewer once remarked to me, photons can be their own antiparticles \u2018because they have no overt properties\u2019. How, therefore, would we know such things exist if their own properties are not necessarily evident? Well, those properties are revealed in the way that they reveal everything other than themselves.  Pictures of photons. They make me giggle. Mark my words (they cannot be defined exactly), light enlightens is in absentia. By the time we are aware of it a photon is no longer what it was - it has been incorporated into our mechanism of manifestation. Sometimes a physically-minded scientist will ask me how this applies to their laser instruments - I usually reflect on the question and ask whether the data is demonstrated on a screen.  The above image indicates phototransduction. To me, things like this are almost the epitome of abstract art. You are looking at what you are looking with. Can this really happen? So it is when we talk about nothing - the basis of belief itself becomes the standard of selection. Thus The Treachery of Images.  Nothing is the context of existence. In this way it is really everything and can refer to anything that is not the thing which is selected as \u2018it\u2019. Context is everything because nothing is contextual in itself. Nothing is a word defined by other words which themselves change as they adapt to different roles dictated by different contexts. In this way etymology is everything because nothing explains etymology - it is the blank page on which any script is set and the space for every sound.  Thus Truth is found in Paradox and revealed in Irony because \u2018finding\u2019 is active and \u2018revelation\u2019 is not. Everything is Ironic because nothing actually is. See what I mean? Possibly\u2026but if and only if you possibly don\u2019t. That\u2019s the nature of probability. When one is what everything adds up to then nothing within that sum can be sufficiently summary. If all this computes then you can count on the fact that the answer is still missing - just like the punchline to a joke that wasn\u2019t understood. It has already passed. But when I imagine something, or even actually see objects, I have got something which my neighbour has not.\"\u2014I understand you. You want to look about you and say: \"At any rate only I have got THIS.\"\u2014What are these words for? They serve no purpose.\u2014 Can one not add: \"There is here no question of a 'seeing'\u2014and there- fore none of a 'having'\u2014nor of a subject, nor therefore of T either\"? Might I not ask: In what sense have you got what you are talking about and saying that only you have got it? Do you possess it? You do not even see it. Must you not really say that no one has got it? And this too is clear: if as a matter of logic you exclude other people's having something, it loses its sense to say that you have it. Ludwig Wittgenstein - Philosophical Investigations When will we get it? I imagine the answer is \u2018in time\u2019. Ironically, the point at which we do so will no longer be the present.  ",
