            "answer_text": "Are you worth investing one hour in yourself? Great \u2013 I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re at least intrigued enough to read this article. I\u2019m going to very quickly outline some threads. This will only take you 10 minutes or so. Perhaps you\u2019d like to spend the rest of the hour considering if they make any sense to you. When you\u2019re ready to change from negativity to positivity, the books I\u2019ll suggest to directly answer your question would prove invaluable. So, in no particular order, consider these threads: Positivity or negativity is a feeling \u2013 an emotion. Their purpose is to prime us for what may come next. Negative events in our near future pose a greater threat to our wellbeing (therefore the likelihood of us passing on our genes to the next generation) than positive events. This is one (there are others) reason why negative thoughts, for many, are more powerful than positive thoughts. In our historic past, this served our ancestors well. In the context of our modern world, it serves us rather poorly. Thankfully our brains have an ability \u2013 plasticity \u2013 to develop and learn all through our lives. When we learn a little about this, we can bring about resourceful changes in our lives. Now, if you\u2019re still with me I need you to answer four questions about your favourite subject: You. 1) Are you able to be aware of how you are feeling? 2) Can you imagine things that don\u2019t exist in reality? 3) Do you have a concept of knowing right from wrong? 4) Do you make your day to day choices based on the above? If you are one of the overwhelming majority of adults who answered yes to all of the above then the only logical conclusion is that you have the capability to understand and influence how you respond to events \u2013 real or perceived. You can learn to use this capability with a straightforward process: 1) Become aware of the events that are triggering the negative responses 2) Consider what you believe about yourself to arrive at a negative outcome 3) Consider how you behave and feel having just arrived at a negative conclusion 4) Reconsider your thought processes. Ask what is the worst possible outcome, what is he best possible outcome and what is the most likely outcome. 5) Use this insight to decide what action you will take to give you the best chance of achieving what you want to achieve in the situation. OK \u2013 if you\u2019re still with me, you\u2019re nearly there. We can only experience emotions in the present \u2013 indeed, the present is all we ever really have: the rest is thoughts of one description or another. When we\u2019re experiencing the emotions associated with negativity or positivity, this may be in response to our present, to our perceptions of past events or our perceptions of future events. We may feel differently about these time horizons e.g. we may have been very positive in the past but spend or present feeling negatively about the future (believing the good things in our life have gone to be replaced with emptiness ect). Pulling these threads together gives us the opportunity to alter our perspective from negative to positive. It is an individuals\u2019 choice whether they do so or not. If, after reading this \u2013 and taking the rest of the hour for reflection \u2013 is resonating with you then you are ready to explore the work of Martin Seligman. He has been leading the research in these areas for over half a century. His books are rigorously evidence based and immensely valuable for those whose desire to change is greater than their desire to remain the same. In response to the original question, I would particularly recommend \u2018Learned Helplessness\u2019 and \u2018Flourish\u2019 with \u2018Authentic Happiness\u2019 being a great read for anyone at the serious end of personal development. For those who would benefit from a highly structured approach relating to these subject areas, my own \u2018A New Pair of Glasses\u2019 may be well worth a look: for less than the cost of a glass of wine or pint of beer (its even free on Prime) I offer a structured approach to applying the above (and other valuable concepts) to our daily lives.
