They ask questions that no-one else does such as :  - what is valid reasoning?- what can I know about the world?- how can I know about the world?- and what is the world really like, such that we can know it? - what is it to be someone who knows about the world? - what does \"to be\" even mean? - how *should* I think?- what does \"should\" even mean?  - here are all these other things we talk about in the world : art and beauty, ethics and morality, science and nature. What are these and how can / should we talk about or claim to know about them? ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy generally deals with truth. Both every day truth, and ultimate truth. Philosophers are the people who ask and attempt to answer questions about why things are the way they are. The answers philosophers come up with may be functional, such as \u201cliving a moral life leads to happiness\u201d or the answer may be non-functional such as \u201ctime is an illusion.\u201d Most of the time philosophy deals with subjects and questions that are beyond the ability of science to answer. Or if a question requires preference or subjective interpretation, then science is of no use. For example \u201cred is the most pleasing color\u201d If science can answer a question then it becomes a theory, or law as opposed to a philosophy. ",
