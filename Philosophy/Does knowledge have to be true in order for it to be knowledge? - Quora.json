            "answer_text": "This is a central question in epistemology, and I\u2019m surprised it hasn\u2019t received a more in-depth analysis. Classically, yes : knowledge is defined as justified true belief. There are however theories of knowledge who drop either the justification condition or the truth condition : knowledge is true belief or knowledge is justified belief. These theories can have interesting applications for different cases, so you might also simply conclude that there\u2019s no need for an universal definition of knowledge, but rather that a statement such as \u2018x knows that p\u2019, where x is someone and p is a statement, has different meanings in different contexts. When it comes to answering the question, there are a lot of things to consider. First, what is meant by the question? Is the question to be taken literally or is the question \u2018When we say that someone knows something, do we mean that this something is true?\u2019 ? It might seem like we\u2019re asking the same question twice over, but it is not case. The first question is : what should count as knowledge? The second question is : based on our use of language, what does count as knowledge? When answering the first question, philosophers usually answers that a known statement is indeed a true statement. A true statement is a truth. That leads to a lot of confusion. There is \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018Truth\u2019 : \u2018A truth\u2019 is not the same as \u2018the Truth\u2019 (if you suppose something as the Truth exists). I am wearing socks right now. The statement \u2018I am wearing socks right now\u2019 is true : it is a truth. But I don\u2019t suppose it reveals anything grandiose about the Universe. Now, \u2018true\u2019 leads to some problems of its own, namely the problem of defining what is true. A common explanation of truth is that a statement is true if and only if what is described by the statement is the case. In other words, it is true if there is a state of affairs that makes it so. That might work for everyday observable states of affairs, but it seems more complicated when you look at, say, physics. In physics, scientists try to explain observable states of affairs with theories. There are statements about unobservable states of affairs in theories. The problem is, more than one theory can explain the same set of observable states of affairs, so how do you pick among the competing theories? In other words, what is it that makes a theory true? The same goes for mathematics : what is the state of affairs that make \u20181+1=2\u2019 true? This is why I don\u2019t think replacing \u2018true\u2019 by \u2018factual\u2019 in the definition of knowledge really solves the problem. Van Fraassen has suggested that theories are not aimed at being true, but at being empirically adequate : a theoretical explanation has to fit the data, and more than one explanation can fit the data. In these cases, you might define the condition for truth as the common acceptance of a statement by a group of competent people. That makes your concept of truth fallible : what is true at a given time might not remain so in the future. It seems counterintuitive to consider truth as something fallible, but it does however fit with scientific practices. If scientists believed something to be true in the past and changed their minds later, how can we know that scientist today won\u2019t do the same eventually? When it comes to factual knowledge, some philosophers believe the truth condition is sufficient : knowledge is true belief (cf. Dretske, Goldman). Most philosophers believe the justification condition is required too : if I simply believe what turns out to be the case or an accepted theory of physics, I don\u2019t know about these things, I also need to give reasons as to why I believe them. If I believe that there\u2019s a car in front of my house because I saw it parked there this morning, then I have a reason to believe it. When answering the second question (based on our use of language, what does count as knowledge?), it is usually the truth condition that is dropped : knowledge is justified belief. We do in fact sometimes say that we know something and then realize later that we were wrong, even though we had reasons to believe it. If I say \u2018I know there\u2019s a car parked in front of my house, I saw it this morning\u2019, I might be wrong because the person who owns the car left hours ago with it, but I\u2019m still claiming that I know that it\u2019s parked in front of my house because I have reasons to believe it. The justified belief definition of knowledge fits well with scientific practices as well. In fact, some, if not most, would argue that the common acceptance of a statement by a group of competent people is no condition for truth : it is simply a reason to believe that statement. The justified belief definition is indeed meant to dismiss the idea that there is some sort of free-floating Truth out there that we are looking there and to which our theories match : what is true in our scientific theories is simply what is accepted as such (besides the less controversial statements describing observable states of affairs). So some philosophers defending the true (justified) belief definition and some philosophers defending the justified belief might turn out to be saying more or less the same thing. It\u2019s simply that they view common acceptance either as a condition for truth or as a condition for justification. Long story short, yes, by most accounts, a known statement is a true statement. But what makes the statement true still needs to be clarified. On an ending note, you might wonder why philosophers make such a fuss about defining things such as \u2018knowledge\u2019, \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018justification\u2019 in formal terms. The thing is, it makes it possible to discuss these questions more clearly. It is not necessarily that there is an unique right definition of knowledge to be found, but it\u2019s important to be clear about what we mean when talking about knowledge, otherwise we\u2019re basically just talking past each other.

            "answer_text": "Does knowledge have to be true in order for it to be knowledge? \u201cTrue\u201d is a slippery term, meaning different things for different people. I prefer \u201cfact.\u201d A fact is something that just is, like a tree or a rock. You can\u2019t dispute its reality. You can see it, touch it, taste it with your tongue (if you so choose), smell it, and hear a sound if you hit it with a stick. You can also measure it, weigh it, handle it, move it (with effort). In other words, a fact really is something. Let\u2019s reword your question thus: Does knowledge have to be fact in order for it to be knowledge? If something is not a fact, then it\u2019s not part of the human knowledge base. Some people believe the earth is flat. I understand they have amazingly convincing arguments. However, visual experience, fact of travel, and scientific measurement prove that the earth is more or less a sphere; it is round so that you can begin travel at one point and keep going in one direction till you get back home again. Therefore, the idea or belief that the earth is flat is not knowledge; it is a belief, idea, concept, argument, etc. It is not a fact and no one possesses such knowledge. In my opinion, the answer to your question is Yes. Knowledge has to be true (factual) to be knowledge. Otherwise, it is a lot of things but it is not knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "Central aspect of knowledge is whether it is known or not. This means that knowledge affects interaction between parties. Generalizing this, having or not having certain knowledge would be formative for the entity at hand (one party formed in one way, and the other party in another). Also not knowing at a more fundamental level may mean that something is almost impossible to achieve, whereas it may be readily and abundantly available to the other side. So knowledge is not as we are used to think something that readily percolates in the common space and is made easy to grasp. Well it is, but it is knowledge as related to our side. Taken more abstractly, knowledge is limited by what insights we may have and what we can prove, and what is provable at all. Truth seems more abstract and distant. For example we may say it is universal, but are we not assuming this, only because it is so far, that we may as well take it to be uniform to make our picture more coherent. So we should or can develop theories about the truth in some other way. We may say that when the parties interact with their pieces of the knowledge, the truth consists of the rules or the paradigms of the game, even if they are not grasped or recognized by the parties. For sure we may be inclined to say that truth are some fundamental properties of the existence, but this is all provisional and may be a facet of our knowing with its ability to abstract from its content and experience. That is, the truth achievable in this way is the abstraction of the knowledge content we have or are able to achieve. Even if we say that knowledge can be expanded and we may approximate the truth be it as a limit, the possibility of expansion of the knowledge may still be bounded by some other means. So we may break one cage, but not all of the cages. To return to the question, knowledge and truth seem to be different concepts. Knowledge may have internal validity, consistency, usefulness, correlation with certain phenomena, but there is no truth involved there. Approximate, imperfect and limited knowledge is possible and common. Also \u201cwrong\u201d knowledge is acceptable when it is formative for some behaviour, or if it serves as a stepping stone for some later improvement in the field, or in the selection of a partcular kind of historical process or coloration (i.e. still reached certain outcomes, but started with the insistence on some \u201cwrong\u201d perceptions, so even if two equivalently coherent end states are reached, one has the coloration of certain initial \u201cwrongs\u201d, and the other bears the sign of different \u201cwrongs\u201d). This gives us another insight, we may say that what is truth does not care about correctness, but it simply wants to be formative of the direction and the \u201cfeeling\u201d of the knowledge development. So having some spirit, which we have started with, all future knowledge developed will be affected by its influence. So it may turn out that truth is like a spirit. One remaining note to add. From a practical standpoint we may say that given a system, some total understanding of the design principles there is the truth. Hower we can't (yet) penetrate as deep into the nature of our existence to claim that it has such character or if it is a system at all. From what we have grasped so far, truth wants to be either definitive for the totality of the given game (existence), or formative to \u201cour\u201d types of game within. Does not seem like much, but it is difficult to penetrate into the nature of truth. ",

            "answer_text": "What is it to \u2018know\u2019 something? To know of anything we accept into our memory details, concepts, even just a purely abstract idea can be taken into a persons memory - something like mathematics might fall into this category, something without real substance or form can be known. We can, through language, spread our knowledge far easier than any species before us was able to do so, we are a species of knowledge that spans generations. Now, what is \u2018truth\u2019 ? I put forward that \u201ctruth\u201d, \u201cthat which is true\u201d, is something which is accurate to our observable world, by contrast that which is not true does not withstand much scrutiny and with investigation can be found to be a falsehood. Is all knowledge truthful? Let me express this answer through metaphor and understandable details; 1 - I know of unicorns, I can accurately describe one, I can recall how a unicorn would be expected to behave, I have quite vast and in depth knowledge of unicorns. 2 - I know how to build a computer from components, I can detail each part, tell you what it does and I can show you with some accuracy how it all fits together. 3 - I know some basic web coding, I can tell you some of the terminology used, what it does, and even give a practical demonstration of what bits I know of. In the first example: unicorns are a fantasy, their existence is a falsehood, it it not true, and yet I know of it. If I ask you to fetch me a unicorn horn.. you\u2019d never succeed. I know of such an animal, but it is not truth. In the third example, my knowledge of computers is based on my interaction with actual computer components, these things are true and real in the world, I can hand you a graphics card and you can inspect it, it exists. I know of these things and they are true. In the last example, my intangible knowledge of coding is true even though it has no substance (except perhaps the parts of my brain in which those memories are kept) for you to hold, I cannot ask you to weigh my CSS knowledge, but I can demonstrate it, I can perform tasks in reality which are governed by that knowledge. Although it is an abstract it is true. A small mind game for you: You and I have never met, nor are we likely to. If I now tell you that I always wear a lime-green t-shirt, I have bright, almost white, blonde hair, I can speak German fluently and I\u2019m an active participant of a local Tai-chi group. Is any of that true?Is some of it true?Is it all true? You now know these things, these details are now your knowledge\u2026 but is your knowledge the truth? My conclusion Not all knowledge is truthful, simply because we can know of something does not mean that thing is true within the reality in which we live our lives. We have incredible minds and sadly these incredible tools are capable of accepting lies as though they are truths. ",

A thing is true according to its reality, regardless of opinion. An opinion may happen to concur with the truth, but the truth would remain true, regardless of the opinion. We are oblivious to all that we are not aware of. We don't even know that such things exist. To be real, objects or phenomena must be manifest in reality, and outside of imagination. Ideas are only real in the sense of being mental constructs. They either concur with reality, or they don't. As to whether knowledge has to be true in order for it to be knowledge, as knowledge must reflect the reality of a thing, then it must be true. All else is error, or faulted perception. ",

You didn\u2019t just randomly decide to believe it, and accidentally were lucky and it happened to be true. Your belief instead, has to be causally connected to (derived from) the truth of the proposition. ",

And sometimes, for certain emotional dilemmas, there is no true or false game. We have to work with reasonable explanations and take decisions and march. ",

So their is this type of being honest/true in declaring what we observed. This is why we consider mathematics higher in being true than our normal subjective observations. But there is more in life than math. In non-numeric truth, that type of knowledge is always a result of subjective observation and \u201cthe truth\u201d can only be slightly glimpsed via observations. So when we say non-math true, it implies full awareness of the topic or item. That fullness is never fully known due to our limited observation abilities. So we can say math type knowledge is true but all other knowledge is not fully true. And when we use math to try to explain things that life forms have interacted with, we again face the subjective dilemmas that are part of all life forms (their unpredictability, free will, etc.). ",
