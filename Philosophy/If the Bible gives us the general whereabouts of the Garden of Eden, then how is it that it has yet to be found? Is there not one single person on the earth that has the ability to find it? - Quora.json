            "answer_text": "Many people have actually tried to give a green light to the possible true location of the Garden of Eden and my answer will contain much of their clues and pieces of evidence that they have left us over the years. I will name a few people whose work and insight has opened our minds to see the world from another perspective that is usually overlooked and ignored and because of that, we can now locate human's original Homeland that has alluded many people for generations and still continues to allude many up to this day because of what I call modern day ignorance! Moses: He wrote the entire book of Genesis. He was courageous enough to write the events of Genesis as they were passed down for generations until his generation came out of slavery in Egypt. According to the book of Genesis, there was a firmament/ landmass in the direction that we normally call heaven before the deluge. Stars seemed to have appeared after the flood! Where did that firmament go? We shall know that shortly! William Fairfield Warren: He was one of the founders of Boston University. He traversed the world in search of clues and pieces of evidence that may shed light as to the possible location of the original home of the human race. He finally traced the location of the original Homeland of human beings to somewhere at the North Pole. This location will make sense to you later! The information he gathered is found in the book he published titled,\u201d Paradise found: The cradle of the human race at the North Pole\u201d. In this book, William gave information about the Cosmogony of Ancient people about the world before the deluge. I will mention two prominent civilizations whose Cosmogony is similar to that of Genesis in many ways. The Egyptians and the Aztecs. The Egyptians believed that the water went outwards and then curved upwards until it reached the heavens. They also believed that one day, these water would come down to destroy man. You can clearly see that, these was the Cosmogony of the Egyptians before the deluge! The Aztecs believed that land went outwards and then upwards forming a cosmic house. They believed that their ancestors came from a land of perpetual light called Aztlan during the deluge on a boat. Since the Cosmogony of the earth after the flood is different from that of Genesis before the flood, we shall find out why! In doing so, we shall look at the insight of a few individuals who seems to have been forgotten by the world but whose thoughts, observations and research seems very relevant to answering humanity's most fundamental question about our origin that started in the Garden of Eden! Edmond Halley: He was a British Scientists, who proposed that the earth is made up of concentric spheres moving at different speeds. This proposal was to explain the anomalous magnetic field reading that he observed while doing research on the earth's magnetic field. Symmes junior: A lot has been said about this guy. He was ridiculed for proposing that the earth is made of concentric hollow spheres with openings to the inside at the poles. He asked Congress to fund him so that he could go to the North Pole and confirm his claim. He never got funding because no one believed him. Was he right or wrong or did he give us a clue just like William Fairfield Warren? We shall find out! Sit tight! More surprises are on the way! Marshall B. Gardener! He was an American citizen and thinker. He postulated that our planet is a spherical shell with openings to the outside surface through the poles. He also postulated that within the Earth's interior, there is a central sun illuminating the space enclosed by the planetary shell. He further postulated that many planets in our solar system are spherical shells with central Stars within their interior, remnants of the planetary shell nebula from which Planets were formed! Unlike the theory of Earth formation by acretion, he postulated that earth was formed from a shell nebulae cloud of gases and particles that had already evolved from solar nebulae cloud of gases and particles from which all planets were formed. According to Marshall, at geometrical centre of the shell nebulae, was a central star that illuminated the entire cloud that was cooling and condensing to form a planetary shell. According to Marshall, the theory of acretion can only hold true for the formation of the planetary shell not the formation of the entire planet to its geometrical centre where a central star exist up to this day. If Earth was formed from a rotating nebulae cloud of gases and particles which cooled and condensed while rotating, then I don't see why earth shouldn't be as Marshall B. Gardener postulated! If angular momentum of the rotating nebulae cloud of gases and particles was conserved, then the Centrifugal forces due to inertia prevented the shell from collapsing to its geometrical centre and since mass was concentrated within the shell, then there was no enough mass at the geometric centre to create gravitational imbalance within the planetary shell. Here are images of the earth according to Marshall B. Gardener.   If you go back to the book of Genesis before the flood, where it talks about the firmament/ landmass that was in the direction of the heavens and then place the events of Genesis before the flood within the space enclosed by the planetary shell, then everything in Genesis will fit exactly. This will mean that, when Genesis talks of the flood gates of heaven being opened and water flowing like rivers, it refers to the time in earth's history when continents drifted away from each other. The waters that covered the exterior surface of the earth moved to its current location during that period and that is why the seabed is much younger than predicted! The Aztecs and Egyptians\u2019 description of the earth before the flood will fit within the space enclosed by the planetary shell. I believe, if one was standing on the inner surface world of the earth and looked sideway and upwards, he will describe the world just like the ancient people did! If one tells you that North Pole has been explored and no one has ever found the world we are talking about, then Know that he/she is lying or she/he has no idea of the pieces of evidence gathered by Gardener and points to the presence of a tropical climate somewhere within the North Pole! Jan Lamprecht in 1998 published a book titled,\u201dHollow Planets: A feasibility study of possible hollow worlds\u201d. Jan, compiled evidence from both explorers and scientists which could not be explained from solid earth theory point of view but could be explained only if Earth was a spherical shell! For example when Dr. Cook and Peary were travelling Northwards, they saw unpright mirrage of a continent farther north, they all tried to reach this mysterious continent without success! One, the mirrage was upright instead of upside down, meaning the landscape and atmosphere did not confirm to our current understanding. This means that, the continent Dr Cook and Peary saw was very far away within the inner surface world of the earth and therefore neither Dr Cook nor Peary was prepared for the twist of events regarding their tour of the North Pole! Magnetic North is not a point but an entire rim encircling the geographic North or earth's axis of rotation. The icecap of the North Pole just caps this rim forming a ring around the earth's axis. From my research, I know that the Garden of Eden is on the inner surface world of the earth. Our science is definitely incomplete regarding planetary formation and shape! Besides gravity, there must be another yet unknown mechanism that determines the distance between stars and their Planets or planets and their moons. Earth's mass is definitely wrong! Maybe we shall invent a weighing machine for planets! Since we currently have no technology to measure the weight of the earth directly, we only use Kepler's law in which case centripetal force is equal to the gravitational force. But it seems that the distance between planets and their moons is as result of the Centrifugal forces rather than gravity. The distance between the planetary shells and their central stars is also as a result of the Centrifugal forces rather than gravii because the mass of entire planet is concentrated on the shell. Gravity's only role here is to maintain the integrity of the planetary shell. The rotation of the planetary shell around the central star within our planet is as a result of the centripetal force. I think if Earth was converted into a nebulae cloud of gases and particles in a computer simulation with its currently assumed and accepted mass, then allowed to continue rotating at its current rate, then allowed to lose its heat to space, cool and condense to its various constituents and finally allowed to form a planet, it won't definitely form a solid planet to the core! It is likely to form a much bigger planetary shell than now because the assumed mass is much more than it actually contains! Some people use seismic data and volcanic activities to justify that the earth is a solid planet to the core, yes earth is a solid planet up to a point but not to its geometrical centre. The Seismic activities and volcanic activities are confined within the planetary shell. For earth's magnetic field, it's not as a result of the earth having a permanent magnet at its core but it is as a result of electrical currents flowing within the planetary shell! ",

            "answer_text": ">> If the Bible gives us the general whereabouts of the Garden of Eden, then how us it that it has yet to be found. Is there not one single person on Earth that has the ability to find it? The Bible does not give us the general idea of where it was. And yes, you are right- there is not one single person on Earth that will ever find it. The world that was before the flood is no more. The topography of Earth was completely and utterly destroyed when God judged the world and destroyed it with a flood in the days of Noah. The Bible tells us this was not just a gentle rise in water level. It was a violent and catastrophic event. It says the \u201cfountains of the deep burst open.\u201d It says \u201cthe mountains rose and the vallies sank down.\u201d It was a tectonic upheaval that erased the entire world. We have absolutely no way of ever knowing what latitude and longitude of our present day Earth the Garden of Eden was at. I have heard the argument that the Bible speaks of the Euphrates river before the flood. That proves nothing. Newly discovered land and landmarks are often named after other locations. There is a Dover in England. And we have a Dover in America. The only similarity they share is their name. There is a Nile river in America. It does not connect to the Nile in Africa. Rivers and cities often share names. There is nothing unusual about that. The location of the Garden is gone. Even if any remnant survived, it would be buried under hundreds of feet of sediment if not under the oceans we have today. We read in the book of 2 Peter that people intentionally deny the flood destroyed the Earth. Why would they do this? Because it means that God owns the Earth. And He has the right to judge sin. So peoole would rather hide and pretend God doesn't exist than admit they are evil and are in need of a Saviour. 2 Peter 3:3\u20137 3 Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 4 They will say, \u201cWhere is this \u2018coming\u2019 he promised?Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.\u201d 5 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God\u2019s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 6 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 7 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.  People are no different today than in Noah's day. Up until the flood waters came, they mocked Noah and did not heed his warning. God gave them plenty time to change their ways. Finally He had enough. He shut the door of the ark and commenced His judgment on a sinful world. The time of grace was over and tje time for judgment began. Same with God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah for their sin of homosexuality. They denied it was coming and were consumed by fire for their refusal to repent. This is the same pattern of human stubbornness we are seeing in the end times. People have been warned that God's judgment is coming. Deny it all you want\u2026see how that worked out for the people in Noah's day. God is offering salvation. People are just too stubborn to take it. And like in the days of Noah and Lot, they too will perish. Luke 17:24-29 26 Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. 27 People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. 28 \u201cIt was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. 29 But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.  No one can say they were not warned. God has been more than patient with us. The day is coming where He will again judge this Earth. If you are not ready, you will perish. There will be no mocking or scoffing on that day. And it will be too late. Do you really want to be among those that refused to repent? Will your temporary pleasures on Earth be worth the eternal price tag sin carries? The most tragic part of this all is- God offers us salvation for free. All that is required to receive it is to acceot it by faith in Jesus. Yet himan pride gets in the way and people refuse to follow God. The hate those that tell of His good news. Read some of the comments people leave to my answers- there is more hated toward God on Quora than anyplace I have ever seen. It doesn't need to be this way. If you want to avoid hell, you can. God sends no one to hell. Only your own sin sends you to hell. God is not to blame- hell is what we deserve. ",

            "answer_text": "The garden of Eden cannot be found because it no longer exists. It was destroyed in the global flood.  Yet, here is the general area where it would be found according to the Bible. The garden was toward the east on earth. In other words it was in the eastern part of the earth toward all of the east, even toward the far east. It was in the Middle East. Notice that the garden was \u201cin Eden\", which means that it was within and part of the land of Eden, it was not Eden itself. \u201c planted a garden in Eden, toward the east\" Ge 2:8 There was a river that flowed out of the main land of Eden into the garden. Then from the garden the river parted into four rivers. Notice that Moses said there \u201cwas a river\" flowing out of Eden. So by Moses time there may not have been evidence of such a river, for the flood had changed the topography in the area, and it may have still been actively changing. \u201cThere was a river issuing out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it began to be parted and it became, as it were, four heads.\u201d Ge 2:10 Pi'shon was the name of the first river. It probably flowed down the middle of the garden. But change is evident because there was no river by Moses day in the Middle East with this name. Yet God inspired Moses to write about it in the present tense as if it still existed at the time. Perhaps Moses or people of that time knew the location of this river and it's old name even though it and its name had changed. Or perhaps God inspired Moses to record it in the then present tense From his perspective as he saw it then. But, could it be a waterway or river known today by a different name? \u201cThe first one's name is Pi'shon; it is the One encircling the entire land of Hav'ilah, where there is gold.\u201d Ge 2:11, 12 The Pi'shon river encircled Hav'ilah, which is traditionally known or thought to be the Saudi Arabian Peninsula. Perhaps this river was the combined waterways of today of the sea of Gal'lee, the Jordan river, the Dead Sea and the Red Sea. Because that would lead to a waterway that would encircle the Saudi Arabian peninsula. Perhaps, in the past, these waterways ran as one continuous river. They may even be linked underground today to some degree. The second river encircled Cush, which is known to be where Ethiopia is, and possibly Egypt. This seems to indicate a waterway from the Mediterranean Sea through the Nile river. \u201cthe name of the second river is Gi'hon; it is the one encircling the land of Cush.\u201d Ge 2:13 The third river is more readily identifiable, for apparently only it's name changed. But notice that the verse says \u201cit was going out to the east\". So it was going farther east away from where the garden was and from where Assyr'ia was then. The name, though, changed from Hid'dekel to what we know as the Tigris river. \u201cthe name of the third river is Hid'dekel; it is the one going out to the east of Assyr'ia. \u201c Ge 2:14 The fourth river, seemingly, has not changed in appearance nor in name. In is still called the Euphra'tes today. \u201cthe fourth river is the Euphra\u2019tes.\u201d Ge 2:14  Other scriptures give more clues as to the whereabouts of the garden. As far north as ancient Tyre, Lebanon to Syria: Is 14:13; Eze 28:2,13, 14, 31:16; Ca 4:15 As far south as ancient Egypt to Zoar (Dead Sea area) area: Ge 13:10; Where ancient Zion (Jerusalem) was: Is 51:3 Eze 36:35 So, basically, the garden was where the ancient promised land of the Hebrews/Iaraelites/Jews was. The boundaries as far north as Lebanon, possibly as far east as toward the Euphra'tes river, as far south as the Dead Sea and as far west as Egypt and Ethiopia. The Hebrew word translated as garden also mean \u201cpark\", so it was like a large national park the size of a huge country. The garden of Eden, which was a garden from God's perspective, no longer exists today. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a complicated question, there is no real answer until the lord returns. It all depends on the interpretation of the bible. But in my opinion the garden of Eden was never on earth. It was more of a spiritual place where sin and evil didn't exist. The garden was a spiritual place without sin. No man of flesh and blood will ever see this place. God made it clear that being flesh and blood man the kingdom of heaven is within us. I think Eden is a place between heaven and the physical environment. It is a place of free will and a place where we have the option to do right or wrong. Eden was lost to us for now until we return to a spiritual form, at that point we will not have sin or evil within ourselves. That's when we will be able to see Eden a place we will go once we are able to see our inner more pure form instead of our outer more physical form such as ego and evil also greed. We will go to Eden to eat the fruit of eternal life and as a pure form be able to remember or know where the garden is. We don't know because it's not a place we can comprehend, it's not a physical place we as flesh can see or touch. Only when God passes judgment on us will we know where and what Eden actually is. I think that's why we as humans fight and state where we think it is. Also as humans we tend to place something or make up something where in reality there is nothing. We tend to make things up to fit our need or situation. But who knows really, we will find out soon enough. I think that's another reason not to pass judgment on someone else. For all we know we are all wrong and that's a test to allow us to accept that everyone has a opinion and not to judge someone even if it looks like there is little or no evidence to support there opinion. I think that maybe Eden is a where we gather as sinless and pure forms. Such as church can be anywhere there are people gathered to celebrate and praise the lord. Basically though Eden is a place like faith to us. There is no evidence to suggest that God exists but faith is believing in something we have no hard evidence to support our claim. We still believe and we still continue to for generation after generation. Faith and Eden are kinda similar if you think about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look to the bible. After the Fall of humanity, the Lord took specific action, to wit: \u201cAfter he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life\u201d (Genesis 3:24, NIV). Note that God had to drive them out. They didn\u2019t want to go! Once they had some semblance of knowledge, they realized the Serpent was a liar, that they had lost favor with God (temporarily), and wanted back in the Garden. But God kept them and their offspring out physically but nevertheless provided for them spiritually. Note that the Garden was a physical paradise inasmuch as Adam and Eve had it made in the shade so to speak. They did not toil and they physically communed with God. Also, here is an important thing to grasp: The primary elements in the bible in Genesis chapter 3 consist of a tree, a curse, thorns, sweat and death. This parallels with the life of Jesus Christ when he was crucified. At any rate, subsequent to the flood, there would obviously be no need for the cherubim to guard something that had been destroyed. Consequently, there is no need to search for it. As believers we can be sure that there is a new paradise. Jesus told the thief on the cross, who did no works but believed in Christ Jesus thus: \u201cBut the other criminal rebuked him. \u201cDon\u2019t you fear God,\u201d he said, \u201csince you are under the same sentence? 41 We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\u201d 42 Then he said, \u201cJesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\u201d 43 Jesus answered him, \u201cTruly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise\u201d Luke 23:40\u201343).

            "answer_text": "Peace to you, No one can find the Garden of Eden because the Garden is in the spiritual realm. There are a couple items in the Garden of Eden that indicate this to us. God was there (Genesis 3:8\u201310), the Adversary was there (he is the serpent), and the Tree of Life was there. The Tree of Life The Tree of Life is not a literal tree. The Tree of Life is CHRIST. He is there in the Garden of Eden. \u201cI am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.\u201d John 14:6 \u201cI am the Resurrection and the Life.\u201d John 11:25 \u201cI am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. John 6:47\u201351 \u201cVery truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.\u201d John 6:53\u201358 Remember also what God said about the tree of life after Adam ate from the tree of knowing good and bad? \u201cHe must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\" Genesis 3:22 Man has not been given two different sources from which we may eat and live forever. Man has been given one source from WHOM we may eat and live forever: Christ Jaheshua, the bread of Life, the Tree of Life. So both Christ - as the Tree of Life - and His Father (who walked around in the Garden) are present there in the Garden of Eden. Christ and His Father are spirit beings. The Adversary (the one called Satan) is also present. He is the angel/seraph/spirit being known also as the dragon or ancient serpent. From Revelation 20:2, \u201cHe seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.\u201d Somewhere along the way, some of the scribes and teachers misunderstood serpent to be a mere snake, rather than serpent/ \u201cdragon\u201d/ seraph/ angel. But this was not a literal snake talking in the garden; this was an angel/seraph, the one called Satan. ** Just a side note because of some of the comments in the thread: The Tree of Life at the center of the Garden could not have been destroyed in the flood. Because the Tree of Life is Christ - the ONLY source from whom we may eat and live forever. If you are one of His disciples then I am sure you would agree that He was not destroyed in the flood. (For anyone who has been taught that the Tree of Life is not Christ, and is instead some literal tree: why would God have bothered to guard the way back to it and to the garden if He was just going to destroy them both a short time later in the flood?) May anyone who wishes them be given ears to hear, that you may know the truth of this matter from the One who is the Truth (\u201cI am the Way, the Truth, and the Life), Christ Jaheshua. May anyone who thirsts, come, as the Spirit and the Bride say to you, \u201cCome! Take the free gift of the water of Life!\u201d Peace again to you and to your households! ",

            "answer_text": "The only thing the Bible tells us concerning the Garden of Eden\u2019s location is found in Genesis 2:10-14, \u201cA river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold\u2026The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\u201d The exact identities of the Pishon and Gihon Rivers are unknown, but the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers are well known. If the Tigris and Euphrates mentioned are the same rivers by those names today, that would put the Garden of Eden somewhere in the Middle East, likely in Iraq. However, even a small local flood can change the course of a river, and the Flood of Noah\u2019s day was more than a localized flood. The Deluge completely changed the topography of the earth. Because of this, the original location of the Tigris and Euphrates is uncertain. It could be that the modern rivers called the Tigris and Euphrates are simply named after those associated with Eden, in the same way that Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is named after the town in Judea. If the Middle East region is where the Garden of Eden was, and if crude oil is, as most scientists believe, primarily decayed vegetation and animal matter, then it stands to reason that the Middle East is where we would find the greatest oil deposits. Many people speculate that the vast stores of oil in the Middle East are the result of the decomposition of Earth\u2019s lushest organic materials in the Garden of Eden. While the oil in the Middle East could be the dregs of Eden, but those who promote such ideas are simply theorizing. People have searched for the Garden of Eden for centuries to no avail. There are various spots claimed as the original location of Eden, but no one can be sure. What happened to the Garden of Eden? The Bible does not specifically say. It is likely that the Garden was completely destroyed in the Flood. What is the location of the Garden of Eden? ",

The angel and the sword and the whole place could be invisible so no one can see it, and the angel and the sword prevent anyone from getting there. More likely, it was visible, and perhaps people DID find it before the worldwide flood and were always unable to access it because of the angel and the sword. Indeed, Adam and Eve may have tried to go back many times and were prevented from entering. There are stories to suggest such. The worldwide flood probably mostly destroyed it. Any plants and landscape left there were battered by the flood, unkept for over a thousand years, and part of the later world, no longer a Garden of Eden. ",

The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. (Genesis 2:10\u201314) As far as I know, there isn\u2019t a clear identification for Havilah. But Cush is an ancient kingdom in Southern Egypt / Northern Sudan / Northern Ethiopia (i.e. a long way south of Israel), and the Tigris and Euphrates are in modern Iraq (and to travel there you go north from Israel, through Lebanon / Western Syria, rather than going east through the desert). The main geographic clues in the text itself point in opposite directions, and to different continents! That rather raises the question of whether the garden was ever intended to be understood as a literal place. Maybe it was, and the whole region was massively reconfigured by the Flood. Or maybe it was only ever meant to be symbolic. In either case, it\u2019s rather tricky to find. ",

East of the shire only matters if there actually IS a shire. We have satalites that have literally taken pictures of everywhere on earth. None of those pictures anywhere show the white tower of Minas Tirath. None of them show Mt. Doom, or Orthanc, or the Shire, and none ever will. Similarly, none of them show any signs of anything even remotely like the Garden of Edan, and there is no geological evidence whatsoever of EITHER of the Bible\u2019s mutually contradictory creation stories. Neither is there any evidence of a worldwide flood. Curiously, there were a number of great empires around all through the time when the world is supposed to have been flooded, and they kept very thorough records that somehow neglect to mention anything like a flood so the answer talking about a great flood erasing evidence is a little flawed. I find it highly unlikely that anyone will ever find Gondor so I see no reason to live in fear of the One Ring of Power. Similarly, it seems unlikely that anyone will ever find a Garden of Edan, so why would I worry about how many types of cloth my clothes are made out of or whether or not I\u2019m allowed to eat shellfish?

We had allowed Lucifer to corrupt us. The first born of heaven, the prodigal son, had wanted his inheritance. He wanted to be king, alongside of Jesus, in this heavenly creation. Heaven had grown so vast, that he thought (and we agreed) that it was big enough for two kings. This is the darkness that God separated from the light. God did not create darkness in the beginning, only after Lucifer defied God and we followed him did we create darkness. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. (Rev 12:9) And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. (Rev 12:4) How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! (Isaiah 14:12) The beginning in Genesis is the beginning our restoration to heaven. God separated us from the light and cast us into hell. He created a place called Paradise, in the highest regions of hell as a first test. Adam and Eve were two of the ten fallen elders, who had the strongest longing to go back to heaven. They were chosen as a proxy for all the fallen. They were told to follow one simple rule, follow only Jesus \u2013 The Tree of Life, and not Lucifer \u2013 The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. They could not be true to Jesus again, and were cast out of paradise. So, God gave them, and us, a second chance. After Genesis 3, He created the material world as a proving ground to bring all his fallen children home, including the prodigal son. The bible is a story of great loss and of God\u2019s love and redemption. God did not send his son to die at the hands of man. He sent Jesus to earth to show us how to resist Lucifer in our lives. Once Jesus showed he could resist Lucifer as a human, he could now confront Lucifer in the ethereal world. Leaving his body on the cross, Jesus descended into hell and fought his firstborn. Jesus\u2019 victory over Lucifer allowed him to pass judgement over Lucifer. We could one day go back to the Garden of Eden, once we are back in the ethereal world, but it is not on Earth, in the material world. ",

            "answer_text": "The Garden of Eden is considered to be mythological by most scholars. This means that even specialists consider the Garden of Eden not to be real. Considering that Genesis is derived from Enuma Elish and other Sumerian tales, it is likely that \"Eden\" comes from the Sumerian word \u201cedin\u201d meaning \"plain\" or \"steppe\" ( or the Akkadian word \u201cedinnu\u201d). Because the word \u201cEden\u201d is closely related to an Aramaic root word meaning \"fruitful, well-watered\" or to the Hebrew word for \"pleasure\", Eden may have evolved to become \u201cparadise of pleasure\u201d. Because of the \u201cwell-watered\u201d bit, the garden of Eden is usually placed where Tigris and Eufrat come together. If we look closer at the Sumerian myths, the garden paradise of Dilmun was probably inspiration for the Garden of Eden story. The city of Dilmun in the Sumerian story of Enki and Ninhursag, was located in the Persian Gulf, on a trade route between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley Civilisation, close to the sea and to artesian springs.

He states his reason for doing so, and it was an act of grace, because he was barring the way to the Tree of Life. How horrible to live forever in our sinful condition, perhaps with handicaps or disease and never be able to die. In their sinless state, Adam and Eve could have lived forever. In our sinful state, it is a blessing that we cannot live forever in corrupt flesh. The Tree of Life appears again in the Book of Revelation and will once again be available after Christ\u2019s second coming. But the Garden is unavailable to sinful humans until the rule of Christ and the resurrection of the dead into sinless and incorruptible bodies. ",
