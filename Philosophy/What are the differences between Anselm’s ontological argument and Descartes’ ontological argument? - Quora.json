            "answer_text": "The greatest similarity is that both start from ideally conceived notions, as opposed to arguments from reality like those by Aristotle and Aquinas. The main difference is that Anselm abided by the scholastic premise that the human mind comes into existence as a blank slate (tamquam tabula rasa), and therefore, the idea of a supremely perfect being enters the mind a posteriori, even though I don't believe he explains how that happens. Descartes instead, discards the blank slate scholastic idea and decides, with very insufficient explanation, that the human mind comes into existence with certain self-evident innate ideas, and one of them is the idea of a supremely perfect being. To be sure, Descartes was a man of faith, of religious faith, but with a pathological need for absolute certainty (probably a type of certainty that only a perfect, divine being can possess), and probably because he was gifted with a brilliant mind, he thought he could conceive of free of error conclusions using the philosophical method of doubting of absolutely everything (la doute m\u00e9thodique) allowing himself to doubt even his own existence, thus giving life to the skeptic school of philosophy that still endures, with catastrophic consequences. Once he allowed to doubt of his own existence, the door was wide open to doubt the existence of God. He solved the problem of skepticism about his own existence by resorting to the famous \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d (cogito, ergo sum). But he could not apply the same conclusion to God and that's how he comes up with the concept of innate ideas, God being one of them. His skeptic followers caught the glitch in his thought, and that's why they are all atheists. ",

            "answer_text": "Anselm\u2019s arguments (found in Chapters 2 and 3 of the Proslogion) involve no technical language. Gaunilo asked Anselm how he would respond if the fool claimed not to be able to understand his definition of God (\u201cthat than which a greater cannot be conceived\u201d). Anselm responded that the definition contains familiar Latin words, put together in a grammatical order - what could there be not to understand? I\u2019m not saying that Anselm\u2019s argument is easy to understand - in particular, any attempt to say where Anselm goes wrong is likely to use technical language that Anselm himself does not use. But the vocabulary poses no problem. Descartes, on the other hand, in Meditations III, introduces a distinction between objective, formal and eminent reality. This distinction does not correspond to any distinction that we make in everyday language. It requires a bit of study to figure out what Descartes means by these terms. If we accept the vocabulary, then do we have to accept the theory that goes with that vocabulary? This technical vocabulary does not necessarily make Descartes\u2019 argument harder to understand, but it is easier to think that you have understand Anselm\u2019s argument, because at no point in his argument will you encounter any unfamiliar words (assuming you have a good translation).
