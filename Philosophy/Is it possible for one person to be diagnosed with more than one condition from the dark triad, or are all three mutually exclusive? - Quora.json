            "answer_text": "Good morning It's an I terestng question as it still is being worked up to some fruition. If you think about the dark triad there are only two legitimate diagnoses to consider. Of the three factors, one factor works to one diagnosis, one to a second, and the third can belong to both or one at a time. From a diagnostic standpoint, the narcissism of the triad would belong to narcissistic personality disorder. The second factor, psychopathy tends to fall under the range or antisocial personality disorder. Machiavellianism can belong to both since cruel manipulation can be a hallmark of NPD or ASPD. I suppose if we were being exclusive it would depend how the manipulative efforts manifested. Either way that factor can belong to both or just one diagnosis. Now to the heart of the question. Knowing that we more or less broke down the diagnoses to their two parts, yes you can certainly be diagnosed with NPD and ASPD although it isn't as common. But if we are talking about just the factors without diagnoses, then there are plenty of examples of all three factors being present at once. ",
