            "answer_text": "No, experience and knowledge are not on the same level. Knowledge always trumps experience. Why? For the following reasons: Experience is not tangible, knowledge is - When i hear people talk about how experience as if it were law, i cringe. How much experience would you require for someone to be qualified? 1\u20133 years? 5 years? People look for experience as a qualification but tend to give flimsy and inaccurate standards for what they consider \u201cgood experience.\u201d You can\u2019t test experience to see if it\u2019s reliable. Knowledge on the other hand relies on facts and specifics. It\u2019s all about methods, discipline, learning, testing, creativity, and all sorts of things. The beauty of science is how it\u2019s true regardless of what people believe or experience. Experience is flawed - Memories and human senses aren\u2019t perfect. We tend to misinterpret many things. We are also prone to biases. That\u2019s why experiences aren\u2019t valid forms of knowledge. Let\u2019s say a white girl had bad experiences with black people then concludes that all blacks are evil. Should she then be justified in her racism because of her experience? If knowledge comes from experience then by that logic, you should agree with her conclusion. Obviously not the case in reality. Knowledge on the other hand seeks to learn using instruments, measurements, evidence, education, etc. It considers all sorts of possibilities but narrows it down to what\u2019s known to be factually true. Experience is subjective, knowledge isn\u2019t - Let\u2019s say you went to one part of Mexico to experience it. That\u2019s great but it\u2019s foolish to conclude that one person\u2019s experience speaks over everyone else\u2019s in the country. Probably worse to think you\u2019re a big shot scholar of the country when you know nothing about it\u2019s history. Knowledge doesn\u2019t play by those rules. Once again, it\u2019s about evidence and getting down to the facts. Everyone can observe and learn about any subject through education. It doesn\u2019t depend on one person experiencing it. In conclusion, you should seek knowledge above experience. Going by experience is a lazy way of thinking. I find people who say that are typically the ones who don\u2019t want to expand their minds. They don\u2019t want to put in the hard work that comes with educating yourself through books and deep thought. They don\u2019t want to consider other viewpoints. They just want to live in the moment and use experience to compensate for lack of knowledge. That\u2019s a dangerous way of thinking. That\u2019s how we get superstitious beliefs and all sorts of ignorance. We as a species thrived on knowledge, not experience. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I guess it will always be a debatable concept. Anyways it won't stop me from giving my opinion on this\ud83d\ude01 If we go through the literal meaning of these words, Experience:the knowledge and skill that you have gained through doing something for a period of time; the process of gaining this. Knowledge:information, understanding and skills that you have gained through learning or experience. As we see both of these terms are quite mingled. But the fact remains that you can get knowledge through an experience but you can never be experienced only through knowledge. Putting your skill into practice is very important. Just because you know something, A certain skill or acquired a certain degree, it does not mean this is all you need to be a wise person. Practical approach and experience plays a crucial role. If you know something, you do have a way of doing it. But you would never know what is like without jumping into the technicalities of the matter ( experiencing it) But if you experienced something before, you know what it is like. Therefore you would find more ways of doing that and will end up being successful. At the end I would say, simply acquiring knowledge about something won't get you anywhere. And just an experience would make you walk a long way to achieve something you want. Therefore I would say \u201cacquire the knowledge. Be informative and use that knowledge into your practical life. Experience. Do things differently. And succeed.  Thank you ",

On an average an umpire have better knowledge of game than players but lesser experience of the game than player. So the answer is no. If experiment and theory are not equal than it is also the same case. ",
