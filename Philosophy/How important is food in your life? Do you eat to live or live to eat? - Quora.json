            "answer_text": "Food is of course important in my life, in the sense it is for everyone. However, I don't love eating. I eat what I need to, and that's it. This is probably why I'm pretty skinny (I'm still at a healthy weight, no concerns of malnutrition). Another reason I don't eat a ton is because my stomache can't hold a ton of food. I eat the essentials, then other \u201cyummy\u201d foods, like cookies, but only if my stomache can hold it. So to answer your question, I eat to live, not the other way around. ",
