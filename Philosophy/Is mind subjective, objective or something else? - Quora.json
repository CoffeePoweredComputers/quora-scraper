            "answer_text": "Is mind subjective, objective or something else? Mind is both perceptive and imaginative. When we think of the mind, with its limits of perception and all its attendant biases, we use the term \u201csubjective.\u201d We only ever get what comes in through the senses. We only ever experience it within our mind. Our perspective is made entirely from what we experience, and limited by what we have not. To call this \u201csubjective\u201d is basically an admission of limitation, with perhaps an implied encouragement: to try to transcend it. To identify what biases we can, and correct for their effects. To see things from other sides, etc. \u201cObjectivity\u201d is one of the things we imagine. It is a fantasy view: the viewpoint with the viewer subtracted. No bias at all! Unfortunately, no view either - not without a viewer. Objectivity has never occurred even once within any human mind. It\u2019s something fantastic we talk about like invisibility, or telepathy - the view unlimited by the viewer\u2019s limitations? A superpower, surely - and a powerful one, if it weren\u2019t just daydreaming. Yet oddly, people take objectivity seriously as a concept. As if it\u2019s something they have, or could ever have. As if it\u2019s something useful. No. The unobtainable cannot be had, so cannot ever be used, and is therefore useless. Objectivity\u2019s a con. We pull it on ourselves and each other. It does wonders for our confidence, somehow. Meanwhile, the mind and its entire conscious contents are subjective. Some, however, do subjectivity a hell of a lot better than others! They examine their understanding of the world. They scrutinize it for consistency. Looking for the bad fit that sticks out, in the struts and spars and flanges of the conceptual structure they\u2019ve tinker-toyed up from all accepted truths. Looking for conflict where two held truths cannot both be right. Testing and trying each to find which is right, and discard the bad part. Upgrade to a better-proved truth, more fit to reality. When they\u2019re done with internal consistency check, they take it external: compare their understanding of reality ruthlessly and rigorously with observation of outside reality. Looking again for consistency, for conflict, for bad fit - and deciding in favor of reality every time. Testing, trying, discarding, upgrading. Keep switching back and forth, internal and external consistency. In a word, \u201ccoherence.\u201d And in all this scrutiny, a particular attention paid to one\u2019s bias. Spotting it by how its effect distorts each thing it touches. Correcting for it everywhere we can, scouring it out every where we locate its stain. We remain subjective. No one ever finds all their bias. New bias is always being made, just in consequence of our viewpoint\u2019s limitation. But you can do a pretty nifty job finding and correcting for bias in you, if you try. You can find tons of it. You can correct for most of the worst! A steady effort as you go. A rewarding effort: it increases your ability to deal with reality. To make the effect you wanted to make, because you can see more clearly how. You\u2019re not crawling into walls and falling down stairs so much. Now here\u2019s the funny thing. Some people make some level of that anti-bias conflict reconciliation effort, and they call it \u201cobjectivity.\u201d It\u2019s cool. Let \u2019em dream. Imagination\u2019s a wonderful thing. Objectivity is noplace any human has ever been, it is nothing any human has ever had. But if you want, you can imagine objectivity as a fixed star in the night sky - a point to steer by, and find your way truer. That\u2019s beautiful. Some imagination you have! And you\u2019re sure to do yourself some good, thinking that way. Really it\u2019s only just subjectivity, well-checked by reality. It\u2019s not even hard, man! Only continuous. ",

            "answer_text": "It is both. Subjective/objective. But recognising what is subjective and made up and what are the facts is a different matter. This created the concept of dualism in our minds. The consequences of this dualism are the reason for the chaotic nature of life itself.  The Subjective/Objective Mind How can the world be at peace when the mind is in chaos. I think I perhaps got this from listening to a lot of Jiddu Krishnamurti's lectures in the early days. The mind created the cityscape and hence the cityscape is a reflection of our own minds - it is chaotic unsafe and not fit for living in. The killing of George Floyd in the United States says something about our minds that perhaps most people do not realise. We all have a subjective mind. There is a nature of duality in our minds. Our thinking has this process of creating lies or illusions in our minds and then we store them in memory as if they are real. They call this subjectivity. The subjective experience. The subjective experience takes a fact and then spins it in our mind into something not at all like what we initially observed. We created a new thing in our minds and it remains a Lie in you and part of Truths or facts which are also sored in our mind. That is why they say that there is this sense of duality in us. The Truth in the Lie in You. We need to know this is this and that is that. This process of creating the Lie in you or the illusion in you is the main process of psychological thinking. But it is also the process for generating new ideas in the mind. It is the process that artist use a lot for creating new ideas for their artwork. You give an artist a fact or an observation and the artist can generate about 1000 ways he can represent that work in a painting. How he can turn his idea into 1000 different patterns is also the same process people use on observations in human beings. We can protest until the cows come home and things are not going to change until our minds are sorted. We cannot spin an idiosyncrasy in us onto another person and then store that lie in your head and live with it all your life. It only creates chaos in yourself and also on others. It is perpetual chaos guaranteed for a lifetime considering that same mind also created the infrastructure of the cityscape. So what we are really doing is creating a panopticon for ourself, all of us, around us. Trust me, it will be chaos forever for us. It will come in cycles and the mind forgets adapts to the Lies in us with the chaotic cycle on repeat.  George Floyd would have told you if he was still here today - cannot you see it? Unless you also include me in your plans what happened to me is always going to happen over and over again. He was thinking when he was in the ambulance phew I thought I was going to die, and then he died. I wonder what happened in the ambulance. Did they actually finish him off in the ambulance knowing what happened with the Cop? If a Cop can knee you until you almost died why cannot a paramedic also do it. We know that there are Doctors who also intentionally have also killed. In the UK it was the ethnic minority frontline workers who mostly died from COVID-19. They were all promised a promotion if they worked in the intensive care units. Good testimonials? We love you for the good work you are doing. All dead. All the bus drivers who died were ethnic minorities - because they had the best shifts when the buses were full. Remember we can make things up in our minds until the cows come home. None of it is, of course, true, but it helps to know what are the possibilities. Psychological thinking. We have to know that this is this and that is that. This is the Truth and that is just an illusion in my mind. Don't hide behind the illusions or lies in your mind. The subjective mind can be anything it wants to be but there is only 1 true self and that is we are all lined up to the natural laws of the Universe and the repository of the Universal Mind and that we know that this is the subjective personality here on planet earth and \"I AM THAT\", our TRUE SELF. We are all just a sliver of the Cosmic Mind but the body-mind has an anomaly for a reason we tend to make different things up about things which are not true. When it is done on a living entity it can be disastrous. If the external form is Kosher with a uni-form and the mind does not know what the mind is or how it works, then it means nothing. The external view is only deceptive. In fact intentionally defective like the Cop who killed George Floyd. 6th June 2020 ",
