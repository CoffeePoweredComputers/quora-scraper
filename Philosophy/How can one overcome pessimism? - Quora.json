            "answer_text": "Here I have small story to tell, which really helped me to cope up with pessimism.  There was farmer in a village with a dog and rabbits with him. Once he held a competition for them, he took a piece of bone and a carrot and hides them underground in a plot, the competition is? who will find it first, when dog hears this, it looks here and there and finds a good place and goes there and rests, saying it's a big plot how can we find? It won't be possible? it murmurs, my owner don't have any other work, it's silly who will find it, it's impossible like that. But rabbit without wasting any time, with 100% enthusiasm jumps on plot, starts smelling, starts digging, runs inn and around the plot, looking for carrot, but after all its effort it could not find, where's carrot is, but still it won't give up, by now it digged entire plot, at last it reached to the place where dog was resting, to its surprise, after digging there it finds bone and carrot. You know it was dog which first guessed of bone, I think May be because as it got good smelling sense than rabbit, if dog would have taken little bit effort of digging there it would have won this competition a long before. But because of its pessimism dog could not reach to bone, as you see, it sat on the same place but still could not reach, on the other hand optimism of rabbit, helped it to dig whole plot with hope of getting there. That's what we see these days, not so brilliant guys also reach higher places or positions, just because of there optimism than the more educated and brilliant. So Evan after you are not groomed that well, if you are a mediocre, dumb, no problem, be optimistic and work towards your dream, you will reach there. ",

            "answer_text": "At the root of it, pessimistic thinking is a form of conditioning. Conditioning is based on the idea that human behavior is learned via associations and responses in the environment. Simply put: If something is reinforced/rewarded, we are more likely to repeat that behavior again. And likewise, if we are punished, we\u2019re more likely to avoid that same behavior in the future. Unlearning this association and deconditioning the response takes just a little bit of practice. So, what you need to do is reverse this way of thinking/behaving so that you can grow positively and become more optimistic. One way to do this is by adopting an optimistic explanatory style. Let me explain what this is and how you can begin to do this: You need to first identify your characteristic explanatory style. This refers to how you explain the events that happen in your day to day. The patterns of this are tightly linked to pessimistic thinking. It all comes down to differences in optimism vs. pessimism. First, take this survey adapted from Dr. Seligman\u2019s book, Learned Optimism. This will tell you your baseline explanatory style. Don\u2019t read on until you\u2019ve finished the survey and gotten your results. I\u2019ll explain what they mean below. Done? Got your results? Okay great. Your final output should look something like this:  source \u2013 Stanford University Before diving into your results though, let\u2019s walk through the different features of the assessment. The main goal in unlearning pessimistic tendencies is to adopt a more optimistic explanatory style. Psychologists believe that you can change negative behavior by changing the way you look at the causes of events in your life. This is known as something called attributional style or explanatory style. Your attributional style can be categorized in three ways: Internal vs. external (Personal)This is how you explain the cause of an event, and where you attribute the \u201cresponsibility\u201d. A person who classifies an event as internal will see themself as the cause, rather than an external factor. For example, \u201cI\u2019m terrible at public speaking\u201d(internal), as opposed to \u201cpeople in the crowd always distract me by talking so I can never give a good presentation\u201d (external)Stable vs. temporary (Permanent)This is the explanation of the lifespan of an event and whether the experience of the event will have permanent effects or not. Example: \u201cI always get laughed at whenever I speak up in a meeting. It\u2019s happened to me since grade school\u201d (stable), as opposed to \u201cI didn\u2019t get enough sleep last night and my colleagues laughed at me when I mixed up a couple words when I spoke up about something today but it was only because I was tired and wasn\u2019t thinking clearly\u201d. (temporary)Global vs. specific (Pervasive)This is how we explain the context of an event; whether the situation is consistent across all environments or specific to one environment. For example, \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy meeting people at meet-ups\u201d (global), as opposed to \u201cI didn\u2019t really enjoy chatting with the people at the last meet-up we went to\u201d (specific).Pessimists fall into these patterns by seeing personal situations as: Internally related:\u201cSomething is wrong with me \u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m never good at \u2026 \u201dStable and long-lasting:\u201cThis will happen again, I know it \u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doomed to repeat this again \u2026\u201dGlobal and all-encompassing:\u201cI will botch all my pitches \u2026\u201d\u201cThis screw-up will be everywhere \u2026\u201dOptimists avoid these patterns by seeing personal situations as: Externally related:\u201cI didn\u2019t get enough sleep so I wasn\u2019t thinking as clearly as normal \u2026\u201d\u201cMy business partners missed a key point \u2026\u201dTemporary and short-lived:\u201cThis is probably a one-off occurrence \u2026\u201d\u201cIt happened once, but who knows what\u2019ll happen in the future \u2026\u201dSituation-specific:\u201cMy weakness is in this one area, not all \u2026\u201d\u201cThis setback is only related to X not Y \u2026\u201dNow let\u2019s go back to your personal results table. It shows you your style of optimism vs. pessimism for good/bad events based off of these three explanatory styles: PersonalizationPersonalization bad score: Optimistic score here means you blame bad events on external causes rather than continuously blaming yourself.Personalization good score: Optimistic score here means you internalize positive events instead of externalizing them.PermanencePermanence bad score: Optimistic score here indicates that you view bad events as temporary and tend to bounce back quickly from failure.Permanence good score: Optimistic score here means you believe that good events are permanent and happen for a reason.PervasivenessPervasiveness bad score: Optimistic score here means you compartmentalized helplessness and don\u2019t allow one failure to reflect failure in other areasPervasiveness good score: Optimistic score here means you allow the good things to brighten other areas in lifeThe total bad score will give you an idea of how you look at bad events in life (whether from an optimistic or pessimistic point of view). The total good score will give you an idea of how you look at good events in your life. And finally, the good minus bad score is the total difference score summary statistic of your baseline explanatory style. This baseline will help you figure out which of the three attribution styles you should work on in order to view events more positively. Each time you find yourself trying to make sense of a situation, take a close look at the patterns of your explanation. Aim for those that are rooted in optimism, not pessimism. There\u2019s obviously more to it but at least this will help you get started. If you want to learn about more tactics for becoming more optimistic, you can find more information here. ",

            "answer_text": " Appreciate your life Thank your God for giving you this beautiful life because things could have been tougher! ii) Understand the process You have to be matured enough to accept the fact that problems are an integral part of our life. Call it KARMA or define it by any other philosophy, the fact is that neither you, nor me can escape from this. Since it is futile to sit and cry let us stand and fight.  iii) Avoid Negative company There are some solid reasons to avoid negative company. Contrary to the laws of magnetism where like repels like, here negativity attracts negativity. People going through depression or any other negative phase often finds comfort in the company of like minded people. This is the point from where things take an ugly turn. iv) Do not feel shy to ask for a help If you feel you are suffering from depression, mental fatigue or negative thoughts it is wise to share this with someone you feel will understand your problem. Remember that there is nothing wrong to have negative thoughts. Abnormality lies in keeping it inside and watching it multiply with each passing day. v)Admit your flaws The most difficult part of counseling a negative soul is handling their arrogant nature. Often-a-times people find it hard to accept the fact that they actually need some help. I can testify this fact from my own experience! Many a times I faced strong reactions from people whom I tried to help in this regard. While some realized gradually with time, others preferred to stay adamant. So the point here is that unless you are ready to accept help, even a panacea cannot bring you out of your problems.  Smile for no reason Even medical studies testify the fact that smiling reduces stress. And do you know that you actually need no reason to smile? While you must be well experienced in flaunting calculated or formal smiles in your professional circle every day, these aren\u2019t the ones that give you real happiness. The smiles which give us peace are the ones that come from heart. Positive people discover their own ways and reasons to smile; sometimes in the company of good people, cool friends and ruminating old memories while sometimes doing something that they love doing. You can try this too! vii) Have no regrets Try your best to achieve what you want so that you do not have any regret when the opportunity goes. And as they say, It is better to try and fail then to sit and repent. viii) Join Self development courses and workshops A tired, exhausted or weak mind cannot house positive energies for long. If there are good self development centers around your area, please join them. Apart from the positive lectures from experts you can also make new friends who too are in search of a positive life. You can also try these exercises to kill negative thoughts or try meditation, which by the way, is a great negative energy buster Positive Mindset versus Negative Attitude Here is a brief comparison between two extreme levels of thinking. Check where you lie. A negative human being: i) Considers the life to be a burden ii) Finds pleasure in criticizing and finding faults.  Filter out the negative thoughts from life iii) Has the tendency to search negativity in every situation. iv) Has the tendency to blame others for all the troubles they face. v) Finds it hard to accept their fault. Gets irritated when challenged. I hope it will help you\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b ",

(a major no no) Why you ask?   If we recognize the fact that being a pessimistic person is a habitual response to the experiences around you, we can tackle the situation with simple habit correction techniques. One very effective way to to form a new habit is to start small. In the case of pessimism take just a few minutes each morning to think highly optimistic thoughts related to your plans for the day.  Likewise at the end of each day take a few minutes to reflect on the positives of the day's events. Even if something bad happened, that was unexpected. Look at it as a way to grow and reflect positively on it. In performing these simple exercises even for a few minutes each day you can begin to see positive changes in the way you react to situations.  One last thing. Pessimism isn't necessarily a bad thing. Without a little pessimism in your life to keep you grounded you could end up getting yourself into a heap of trouble.  The trick is to take the pessimistic thoughts that you do have and find  an optimistic solution. AKA \"If Then Planning.\" The trick is not to get stuck in the \"if something happens\" phase for to long. ",

            "answer_text": " Catch your mind in the act - Whenever there is a negative thought replace it with a positiv one. This requires high self-awareness and takes a while. Eventually your usual thought patterns will change.Look for all the Good in the World - We believe what we see, but we also see what we believe. This means that if you actively look for more positivity you will find more, making you believe in it more, which will in turn make you find more and so on and so forth.Reward yourself for more things - Every step you take, no matter how small, is a step away from the pessimistic direction. Reward yourself for that.Empower your actions - Making your actions prove to yourself they matter is the best way to fight learned helplessness, which is largely correlated with pessimism.Move - \u201cMotion creates Emotion\u201d - Tony Robbins. Move as though you are happy, optimistic and empowered and you will feel more like it.Do something - Even if you are not working towards something specific; as long as you work on anything it will make you feel better. Do this every time you are feeling down.Stay Consistent - At the end the best thing to do is pick one or more of the above and stay consistent with them. Certain thoughts, beliefs, and actions. Pick them and stay consistent until you change them where you passively apply them.",

If some combination of them works, you might settle for that.If they don't work for you, and there is no organic damage, then emotional blocks from the past make surface methods ineffective. There are 'inner child' decisions that are still operating below the level of awareness, and because you are so used to them, they seem to be natural laws. These blocks can be removed, yet require focused effort to replace them with clear, consistent rationality that lets the optimist in you take control. As someone who has been fighting a lifelong battle with some internal blocks, had much success in overcoming them, and been able to help many others do so as well, I offer you the Law of Subtraction. Law of Subtraction -of Common Human Problems What if you could simplify life, and increase happiness, productivity, and prosperity by subtracting problems?  With a reduction in problems, there would be more energy, room, time, and resources available for happy productive activity. If you are like most of us, many of the problems have been caused by ideas that later turned out to be off the mark. Human achievement blockages, and increased stress, are often caused by perceptions that are biased by upbringing, and wishes. So much of what we think we know, isn\u2019t so.  Progress in knowledge usually shows us that what was held to be infallible truth, was not.  Subtracting ideas that are inconsistent with reality, subtracts the problems they cause, and makes room for good influences. The difference in ones life can be dramatic.   There are a few concepts that are very common, and create many of the problems.What are these problem-causing ideas that can be subtracted?  1. I am unique, and independent, so I can do whatever I want.  \u00a7 If the whatever isn\u2019t consistent with physical laws, some form of failure will result. \u00a7 If it isn\u2019t consistent with human laws, persecution, or prosecution, can result.  \u00a7 If it isn\u2019t consistent with your basic nature, inner conflict will plague you.\u00a7 If it is based on the idea that your life ends at your skin, you don\u2019t understand how extensive, and interdependent, your life-support system is.  Even though each of us is unique, we depend on our surroundings to support our lives. It is not hard to think of some examples. We must have water. Where does that come from, and how does it get circulated? Oxygen is essential for our lives, and the whole planet plays a part in its production, circulation. We rely heavily on language, yet, no one person built the languages we use. They are a social construct.  The DNA that we carry has elements of evolution going back to stromatolites. When confounding idea #1 is subtracted, it becomes easier to build great relationships, open hearts to each other, and stop destroying our life support.  2. I can get away with harming others. Subtracting this erroneous idea will increase the well-being that results from understanding the effects of our actions.  Even when they are not obvious to our perception, effects result from causes. They can be as subtle as the changes in the motion of air molecules resulting from the wave of a hand, to death, and destruction, resulting from some form of implemented hatred. The effect may not be obvious, and could be unintended, yet the principle must be kept in mind before any action is contemplated. The effects resulting from harming others can be internal within the harmer, and the harmed. They can be gross, and manifest, or slow, and subtle. Nothing is lost, or disappears. It changes form.  3. Life is a one-way street. The effect of the human knowledge of the eventual end of any one life span is a great sadness, and pain, that won\u2019t go away. It is one of the main sources of the distractions, and addictions we create. They are attempts to compensate, or at least momentarily forget, the pain of the knowledge. That unrelenting knowledge is the suffering whose end is sought in so many ways. Wherever we look, life is a continuum. Sometimes it is visible to the naked eye, other times it is not. A person who accepts that lives change, yet Life goes on, has subtracted the problems created by Item 3. The ability to feel at one with the whole of life is a treasure for the whole life. Pain is unavoidable, but the suffering of limited life-spans can be healed by accepting the reality of life, and not being dominated just by what we see. Human understanding can trump the pain of temporariness. 4. I can\u2019t change my destiny, and others have the power to determine my happiness-misery. We breathe. We drink. We eat. Those actions keep the ever-present destiny of death at bay. We have changed destiny\u2019s imminence. We take care of our families, and take care of our communities. Those actions change the ever-present destiny of unhappiness, collapse, and chaos. We go to work to earn money, or glean resources by direct efforts, like farming, fishing. Those actions change the destiny of eviction, and starvation. It is clear that the idea of destiny has flexible limits. Yet, it often seems that the vey best efforts we make, in some particular aspect of life, are futile. There is much advice available on how to deal with those eventualities, yet we may have difficulty in applying good information. Resolutions, whether at New Year, or at consultations with a trusted adviser, or with someone who has been hurt by our actions, are often not kept, even when they are made with great sincerity. What can we do in those cases? What we can do is try to examine our assumptions, perspectives, viewpoints, knowledge, methods, and strategies to find the source of the weakness. That often works. When that doesn\u2019t work, it means that we have to dissolve the limitations by replacing the problem-causing inner drivers by engaging neuroplasticity. That can enable us to anchor good-results-creating drivers. How can neuroplasticity be engaged to do this?Neuroplasticity is a big word for an ongoing process that can be directed by activity, learning, and intention. The effects have been known for longer than humanity has had written languages, yet the scientific proof of it is only a few decades old. It\u2019s been known for a long time that practice improves performance. Just thinking about desired outcomes, is not enough. They must be practiced in order to make deep changes in the emotions that block us from carrying out our resolutions. What are the good results-creating-ideas? The first one is that life works better when you keep your brain in the game. There are many expressions for this respect, intention, focus, in every language. Perhaps the most succinct is the verb Namof Namaste. The second one is that life is inseparable from the conditions from which it emerges. The individual being is distinct, unique, and not separate from everything else. The most succinct expression of this relationship was derived centuries ago as the Chinese words miaofa. It is best known in the Japanese pronunciation of myoho The third one is that causes produce effects, and that a person can discard delusions at any time. The most succinct expression of this is the Chinese term lienhua. The lotus flower is the only flower that simultaneously produces the seeds. It grows in muddy water, yet is unblemished when it opens. Lienhua is best known in the Japanese pronunciation of renge. Life is both constantly changing, and a persistent reality, when conditions allow it. This is most succinctly expressed as the Chinese wordjing. It contains many concepts, and its root is the warp in cloth. The woof, or cross fibers, are stabilized by the warp, or jing.  This term is best known in the Japanese pronunciation of kyo. These four terms, together express the essential relationships of reality. When they are spoken together, with appreciation, the mind changes to become more consistent with what is true no matter the time, place, or circumstance. The entire expression of the essential relationships of reality is pronounced in Japanese because the man who originally put Nam together with Myoho Renge Kyo lived in thirteenth century Japan, and the group that has been teaching the practice, worldwide, since 1960, is based in Japan. The use of this practice systematically dissolved erroneous concepts, and enables the creation of lives of happiness, fulfillment, and harmony.

            "answer_text": "Unless you\u2019re suffering from an illness (like Parkinson\u2019s) where the pessimism is a symptom, it\u2019s a matter of changing your habits. You want to cultivate optimism while curbing pessimism. There are a number of ways to do this, so part of the process is considering the best ways to motivate yourself. The horrid thing about pessimism is that it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you\u2019re sure things will go bad, you\u2019re right. You will find yourself interpreting everything by your conviction that your pessimism is telling you the truth. For example, instead of seeing your boss\u2019s distraction as possibly some wrinkle in her personal life, you interpret it as something dire like she hates you. Then rather than appearing sympathetic to your boss, you behave in a way that erodes the relationship. Simply expecting things to go wrong helps them to go wrong. Now, how does that work? When you give yourself a message, your brain can dump the negative, focusing instead on the \u201cimportant\u201d words. This is why it\u2019s important to use positive rather than negative phrases when someone\u2019s been seriously injured and you want them to hang on. \u201cStay with me\u201d is far better than \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d \u201cKeep breathing\u201d is better than \u201cDon\u2019t die.\u201d You tend to ignore the \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d (If you\u2019re having a friendly challenge with someone, try good-naturedly saying, \u201cDon\u2019t miss, now\u2026 don\u2019t miss.\u201d Not a guarantee that they will, of course, but the likelihood increases.) The things you think about act like instructions to your brain. It\u2019s one of the most fascinating things about it, in my view. Our brain helps us think, but the thinking itself changes and molds our brain. This happens throughout life for humans because our brains are extraordinarily plastic. When you indulge in pessimistic thoughts, you\u2019re teaching your brain. You\u2019re aiming it toward failure. Now why would you want to do that? Not a silly question because if you use pessimism to set yourself up for failure or unhappiness, it\u2019s important to understand why you might find value in that. If you picked up the habit from a pessimistic parent, say, you might be attempting (unconsciously) to obey your parent, hoping to please him or her. Logically, we can see this doesn\u2019t make sense, but emotions and many deep drives don\u2019t care about whether it makes actual sense or not. You may find it much easier to combat the habit by analyzing when and how you started being pessimistic. Pessimism is closely associated with anxiety. Think about what makes you anxious or afraid. It might take some work to figure this all out because anxiety can feed pessimism and pessimism can feed anxiety. If this is a habit you\u2019ve carried from childhood, you might have some digging to do. The more you understand, the better you can demystify the process. One nice thing about pessimism is that it has an opposite which can help you chase it away. Optimism is definitely worth cultivating. It not only helps you feel happier, it helps you live longer. A negative outlook raises your risk of heart disease and contributes to many ailments. People generally appreciate someone who\u2019s optimistic because they feel better around them. Perhaps the quickest route to optimism is the practice of persistent gratitude. Train yourself to look for things to be grateful for. Like anything else, it gets easier with practice (you\u2019re changing your brain). It doesn\u2019t have to be big stuff; in fact, big events don\u2019t impact our character as much as repeated small ones. Again, bit by little bit, we\u2019re changing our brains. Gratitude sends this message to your brain: Look at that! I\u2019m so lucky! (I\u2019m so lucky that beautiful tree is right outside my window, so I see it when I open my eyes in the morning. I\u2019m so grateful I have these comfortable shoes. Oh, there\u2019s that old lady waving at me\u2014isn\u2019t she a peach.) You feel better because you feel lucky. That helps you continue to find pleasant things to be glad about. Slowly, slowly, you\u2019ll find it increasingly easier to turn pessimism on its head. Be gentle with yourself. When a pessimistic thought comes up, don\u2019t castigate yourself. Just smile and remind yourself you\u2019re not doing that anymore and doesn\u2019t your coworker have the most infectious laugh? Feeling grateful eases pessimism because you\u2019re beginning to see how many things are going right, rather than focusing on something that isn\u2019t. For those things that aren\u2019t going well, consider that failure is a part of the learning process. And isn\u2019t it lucky that it is? What if we either had to get it right the first time or relinquish our toys and go home? And because you start to see it that way, your analyzation of failures is better, which leads more quickly to positive outcomes. Now here\u2019s something to be really grateful for: you\u2019re not alone. Other people have dealt with the same problem and have been successful. Ask for help. And then ask someone with a natively sunny disposition to help. Both types will have plenty of ideas for you. Join\u2014or start\u2014a support group. This allows you to be of service to others, which is another way to build optimism. The message you\u2019re sending your brain when you help others is that because you have time and energy to help someone else, things must be going pretty okay for you. And you\u2019re realizing that chasing away pessimism is a pretty easy task compared to say, what Helen down on the corner is facing\u2026 both parents dead of cancer in a year? Maybe she\u2019d like a visit. Stop watching the news for at least a week. Trust me, if something truly important happens, someone will tell you about it. News is purposely set up to shock and agitate, and focuses almost exclusively on bad stuff (except for Sports, where it depends what teams you root for; Weather, which is at least vaguely amusing, depending upon the meteorologist in question; and the Lottery\u2014you almost certainly didn\u2019t win, but somebody did, and you\u2019re learning to be generous, so you\u2019ll just go ahead and feel lucky for them). If you\u2019re suffering from anxiety or pessimism, you need a break from news, and then you need to think about moderating your news intake so you don\u2019t get psychically hammered every day. I congratulate you for setting this goal. It leads to greater health and happiness. ",

            "answer_text": "Give everything a try but without expectation. Pessimism is all about the fear that your expectations won't be met. If you don't have any expectations (or perhaps less demanding ones) you won't be pessimistic. Personally I think it's important to have high expectations but if it's making you miserable then it is counter productive and perhaps your demanding too much. The other way to deal with pessimism is to shrug things off or create a positive outlook beyond the point in hand. For example, your team is playing the best club in the league, you 'know' they're going to lose so you are pessimistic about the game. Say to yourself 'if they lose it ain't my fault and besides, if we do lose we can focus on the cup instead.' I also think that pessimism is the result of a more pressing issue in your life that's not being dealt with. If something is making you chronically unhappy you look for fulfillment elsewhere but ultimately these are 'temporary fixes' which are not the magic solution to happiness you were hoping for so ultimately you feel let down. Pessimism is the logical part of your brain knowing that the 'positive outcome' of something will not solve your problem and it is trying to warn you that 'if X doesn't happen you'll still feel crap.' So, short answer: If you're feeling pessimistic all the time ask yourself the following two questions: 1. Am I demanding too much?2. Is there something making me unhappy that I'm avoiding dealing with? ",

            "answer_text": "I'm very familiar with not so much 'how to overcome' pessimism, but in identifying the feed-back-loops within me creating the condition: It's not like I have to wrestle with it, I can simply walk around and avoid it providing I can identify the catalyst...like simply changing the channel on my pocket AM radio rather than climbing mountains trying to get a better signal emitting from what I thought was 'something out there' when it is actually just a self generated feed-back-loop broadcasting from within.    It's like my AM radio does not discriminate between internal and external signal sources, and when I start hearing the 'room-of-mirrors echo' in my noggin (my way of describing the thought-processes I experience during episodes of pessimistic despair) ...I simply just tune the dial to another station.   The trick is: Identifying the source of these negative air-waves coming from within.    Example: When I switched from a 2ed shift position at the factory to work day shift, I soon began noticing that towards the afternoon my attitude really sucked and I became difficult to be around (even for me!)...this went on for years then one day I noticed something:    We only had 30 minutes to eat and if you ate off the lunch truck you'd have to deal with it typically arriving late...my purchases were ready-wrapped and off the shelf...I did not need to order anything and wait for it to be cooked. My routine was to grab what I needed and get out of the way so others arriving can order...I even had a tab so I did not need to deal with change...it should be a quick & painless process.   However; every other day the truck arrived late...30 second after the lunch bell, I'm in position to be first in line (I worked closest) and there would be a steady stream of hungry workers right behind me.   If the truck was 2 minutes late, I was no longer first in line because, like they say, 'lady's first' (in other words, if you knew the gals in assembly then you'd know why I'd gladly let them cut in front of me).   Then one day the truck was 5 minutes late.   I held back and waited till everyone ordered and the lunch truck guy was not busy...I paid my tab...and from that day forth I never ate lunch off the truck again.   There was a liqueur store across the street that served sandwiches and I started eating there instead. It took me 10 minutes to walk there and start eating (actually much longer than if at truck) however; rather than fighting for a position in line waiting for the lunch guy...I had no line...a much better meal (deli-style sandwiches instead of deep-fried crap)...and most importantly; this routine provided me with the 'consistency of process' a control-freak like me needed and that made all the difference in the world.   My attitude towards afternoons changed and, in noticing that, I let it 'over-correct' to the point that I actually started wearing a smile! Co-workers even started asking \"hey John, why such the good mood?\".   ...so, it wasn't like the lunch truck guy was serving me a meal of the 'afternoon groucheys'...it was ME; entering that feed-back-loop of anxiety every-time I stood where the truck should have been; standing and waiting, listening to my stomach rumble and thinking negative thoughts.    On the surface; it was just a small adjustment to a rather regular routine, but the effects of this minor change was absolutely enormous.    'Time' used to be the primary factor in establishing my personal routines.   ...but after adding to that; the importance of avoiding sources of irritation (even if it meant adding 5 minutes to the process) things started getting oh so much better.    I have since found other similar sources of irritation in my life that I've dealt with accordingly...and it is actually easy now that I know all I have to do is be more conscious of my emotions rather than trying to control external events. When I get uneasy, uncomfortable, grouchy etc... I do the checklist:   * Am I hungry?          ...if so; Eat! (I'm a grouch when hungry)         ...if not; proceed to next on checklist...   *Am I in a hurry?          ...if not; Relax!         ...if I AM in a hurry; take an assessment of what the situation is with the intention of removing all the things I am NOT in control of and get them out of the way so that I can deal with the things I can control; [eg; I can't control the cabs that I'm trying to catch, but I CAN position myself to be better seen and approached by one]   and finally:   *Am I really doing something I want to do?         ...I save this one for last for obvious reasons. If I were hungry but never bothered noticing, then pretty much everything becomes something I'd rather avoid. If I were in a hurry but did not address the fact that I can not control the cabs I need to catch, then I might have been more inclined to give up trying to make it on time rather than walking half a block where there's less competition for a ride.    It all pretty much boils down to 'personal management' and all that's required is for one to sit in the drivers-seat so that navigation can commence...rather than sitting there; dragging ones legs over the tail-gate while lamenting over all the things getting run over by their out-of-control pick-up truck they're riding in the back of because no one is at the wheel!

            "answer_text": "Pessimism is a \u201csubset\u201d of the second major emotion that drives most people. Fear. In life, you either come from love, or fear. If you live your life in fear, your ego controls the real essence of who you are and the trick for someone living in fear is to step into the other realm of love. Remember, you are not your body and you are not your ego. You are a spiritual creature using this physical casing called \u201ca body\u201d and your task in this existence is to remember that you are a perfect creation, having been created from the spark of perfection which we\u2019ll call God, or Spirit, or any other word that works for you. Because you are an extension of perfection, you have within your spirit the ability to do and be anything you want. If you believe and come from an approach of love, this will be much easier for you to do. If you believe and come from an approach of fear, that task will be much harder. To overcome pessimism, of anger, or guilt, or depression, or hatred, or jealousy, or any other dark or fearful emotion, you need to remember that your physical ego should be treated like a child and you need to tell your ego (yourself) that fear is not acceptable and as a perfect spiritual being, you will only pursue the path of love. So you have to reach into yourself, know that all the bad programming or \u201cevil\u201d thoughts that may inhabit you at the current moment are just illusions of the ego that are created to ruin your perfect experience of what living in love can be. You can choose to be happy and you can watch yourself (you ego) from a place I\u2019ll call \u201cThe Watcher.\u201d and make corrections in your thinking and behavior to the positive. Detach your spiritual self from your physical body, look at the ego and tell it that it has no power over you and you are choosing happiness and the way of love, not fear. You have a choice to live in fear or love. Choose fear and continue to live in pessimism, anger or depression. Choose love and experience happiness and joy. In Optimism\u2026 Bruce ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, pessimism is a function of your experiences and surroundings. I have heard before, and completely believe, that attitude is the key to success. How you respond to events and experiences ultimately shapes who your character. If you allow a failure, or unplanned outcome hold you back from success or growing as a person, you will forever be dwarfed in terms of reaching your potential. Every situation in your life is a learning opportunity, we all learn much more from failure than we do from success, so when failure arrives (and it surely will) respond accordingly. Learn from it, understand it, determine its root cause, and equip yourself to never let that happen again.  Tim Ferris, author of four hour work week and four hour body, often talks about you being an average of the 5 people you are closest to. I have found this to be 100% true. If you keep pessimistic people in your life you will inevitably become more pessimistic, and begin to permanently see the world negatively. Create some new relationships, seek people who are more optimistic and reshape the nature of your relationships with people who are constantly pessimistic.  These changes in your life can have profound affects on your attitude. ",

Being in the company of spiritually defeated persons can also lead you to a spiritually defeated life. It can be from your parents or friends.  If they habitually think about worst future possibilities and live on fears, and mostly think about how to stay away from such events, a person is susceptible to pessimism. how to stay away: choose the people whom you mingle with. stay in the midst of honest, positive thinking and mature people. people who live on truths. stay in a loving environment. where people love you for who you are.  (Bible verse 1 John 4: 18) \"There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.\" talk about your fears. face your fears. make your closed ones know about your thoughts and if you know they are pessimists as well, confront them and tell them what you feel. read Bible, know the truths about God, truths about human beings, truths about the world, truths about Jesus Christ.

            "answer_text": "There is a short story on positive attitude. Two seeds lay side by side in the fertile soil. The first seed said, \u201cI want to grow! I want to send my roots deep into the soil beneath me, and thrust my sprouts through the earth\u2019s crust above me \u2026 I want to unfurl my tender buds like banners to announce the arrival of spring \u2026 I want to feel the warmth of the sun on my face and the blessing of the morning dew on my petals!\u201d And so she grew\u2026 The second seed said, \u201cHmmmm. If I send my roots into the ground below, I don\u2019t know what I will encounter in the dark. If I push my way through the hard soil above me I may damage my delicate sprouts \u2026 what if I let my buds open and a snail tries to eat them? And if I were to open my blossoms, a small child may pull me from the ground. No, it is much better for me to wait until it is safe.\u201d And so she waited\u2026 A yard hen scratching around in the early spring ground for food found the waiting seed and promptly ate it. Source: Two seeds - Inspirational Stories Maintaining positive attitude is the main solution to overcome pessimism or negative thinking. Your negative thoughts will not vanish away easily. It takes time and patience.You have to challenge your own negative thinking and stop predicting unrealistic things. If you start thinking as, may be I cannot do this task. Ask yourself again, Why I cannot do this? I can definitely do this. Hold that positive thought and then your mind and energy will automatically help you to achieve your task.Have an evidence or proof to support your thinking and then form a conclusion.Sometimes you might develop negative thoughts by just sitting idle. Become conscious. Keep yourself busy, engage with the activities or hobbies which you like to do. This will divert your mind.Surround yourself with good people. Avoid bad company.Meditation is a powerful technique, it will shift your mind into positive thinking and helps you to focus towards positive aspects of life.Read \u201cBhagavad Gita\u201d, it will really help you to think positive.",

            "answer_text": " There is a flaw in the game of optimism and pessimism that we usually like to play. Your body has a certain amount of energy. To work efficiently means to not waste that energy and use it as judiciously as possible. Generating optimism, which is a tendency to look on the more favorable side of events or expect a favorable outcome, takes energy. Why? Because in order to be optimistic, your mind needs arguments as to why it should be optimistic. But the moment you put up an argument, there will be a tiny voice of counter argument, the voice of the pessimist, which will always be there, no matter how much you try to ignore or repress it. That\u2019s just how the mind works. It always creates the opposite, even if you don\u2019t want it to. Even if you make an effort and manage to remain optimistic for sometime, the moment something bad happens or a crack appears in your optimistic logic, you suddenly find the pessimist who was lying dormant till now, resurrecting himself. To get trapped in this game is a tremendous waste of energy which could be harnessed more purposefully. Instead of trying to think about outcomes, good or bad, focus on the work at hand. Make your work valuable and let your work be the reward, not the outcome. Image source : https://in.pinterest.com/explore/bhagavad-gita/ ",

Put your best of the effort and obviously you will succeed in the activity.Enjoy the success.Make it a habit to address easy and achievable activity in the morning. Once you win these objectives, ensure you cherish the success. Pat on your back all by yourself. You will see a smile blossoming in your sweet face.Now with this state of mind, address a diffficult task. Get engrossed in the activity so that you won't even have time to think. Two things can happen.You may win and your confidence level will get boosted further. There won't be any room for pessimism.You may not succeed. Here instead of feeling negative all you have to do is thoroughly explore the reason for failure. This should be done very rationally. You can do course correction to the activity and win.Now Once you are exposed to both type of activities you need to introspect these activities and make yourself convinced that whether you are optimist or pessimist you need to first phase the challenge. Then you have to address the challenge in a systematic way.The very knowledge of the reality and the habit of winning and loosing as part of your life will make you a \u201crational girl\u201d who is much more emotionally balanced. So from tomorrow go and face the world. Enjoy every success. Introspect every failure. Manu ",

Nine times out of ten its past experiences, your brain is avoiding hurtful or negative experiences that occurred in the past. Once you know its just your mind predicting outcomes it expects due to past experiences your off the hook. Your pessimism isn't bad or good its just your mind trying to keep you safe. From this perspective it is much easier to see beyond pessimism and decide what you want to experience. Remember to be nice to yourself in the process of working through it. ",

Seems the more I dig for the truth of what is going on around me and in the world, the more difficult it is to live in the bubble of ignorant bliss. From what I understand, it takes resetting the neural pathways of the mind. That requires cleansing from our life any and all negative thought or forces that constantly bombard us from all angles. Usher in and replace with positive energy and people who subscribe to the belief of a good outcome. They do exist and there are still those who actually care. By taking on a new way of looking at life, the laws of attraction will engage and you will find yourself surrounded by likeminded fellow humans of positive intent. It is the higher path and one that leads to Ascension. ",

GOAL + EFFORT = RESULT In this equation what you have is GOAL (PAST) and EFFORT (PRESENT) and RESULT (FUTURE) You don\u2019t want to worry about Future and waste your EFFORT( PRESENT) if you do so it ll affect the effort and end result. Imagine a Cricket player has to hit a six in his last ball here\u2026. GOAL (HITTING 6) EFFORT ( STRIKING) RESULT(?????) The ball is still in the air it has probability for a four, a six, and a WICKET nobody knows what will happen. So stop worrying about Future and put your effort in present sure your result will be good. The result not Either You WIN or LOSE ??? The result is Either You WIN or LEARN???  Hope it helped you!!! :) ",
