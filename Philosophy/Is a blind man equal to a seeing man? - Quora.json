            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean, as stated already, if it is as a human being then yes, if in terms of how society sees us then not always, in regards to jobs we often are seen as not the best option, because employers or people who are interviewing us, perceive that it may be difficult for them to manage us. In terms of freedom to get around, we cope and are resilient, we plan and prepare, but we can't just jump in a car and be spontaneous, we can't share the driving if it is over longer distances. Some people perceive that we fake our blindness and we get verbally and physically abused, others have taken to kicking our guide dogs, to see if we noticed, this has been evidenced by video footage. I don't believe that seeing people would be dealt with the same way. Some people perceive that we shouldn't be out on our own that we are a risk, to motorists and cyclists (we are if you are going to fast and you are not paying attention!) So to answer your question it is yes and no depending on your perception of a disability. ",
