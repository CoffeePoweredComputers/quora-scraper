            "answer_text": "Overview Well, Metaphysics has more to do with answering existential questions of philosophy such as 'Who/What am I?', 'What is this (reality/universe)?', 'Why do I exist?', 'What does it mean to live, to survive, to exist?' and such.Occult is basically knowledge hidden from the masses, you could call it esoteric.  Now, occult often seems to represent some sort of religious, semi-religious or philosophical pursuit, which is likely to be seen as an aberration by society in-large. While, I'm not saying this is bad or good, occult studies are clandestine so that the whims and beliefs of society do not affect the perception, mind and goals of the occult practitioner; at least while in the middle of trying to decrypt the metaphysical question Some of the prominent individuals/ societies you may want to check out may be Helena Blavatsky, Charles Webster Leadbeater, Aleister Crowley and Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Learning about them and the myriad other figures that populate this thought-space should get you started   How are they connected? Often, occult practices have a metaphysical question they are attempting to answer. And, I guess, most of the time the approach can seem quite obtuse to the uninitiated person. This is by design - an element to ensure that only people who are truly dedicated to answer such questions, be allowed access to methods that may (or may not :) ) spur them on a path towards such answer.  When several individuals come together in search of an answer to a common set of  metaphysical questions, they often form organizations such as societies, occult lodges and occult orders. At least one order of old (that I know of) is even recognized today as a religion in the UK viz. Thelema   Conclusion To conclude, metaphysics is basically a large set of questions while occult practices are tools used by certain individuals trying to answer these questions using occult approaches.  Let me give you an analogy. The answers to metaphysical questions are traditionally thought of as leading to the exposition of the secrets of the universe.   Then lets imagine the secrets as an oceanAnd the actual metaphysical questions as source glaciers for rivers. These rivers are the occult practices (well some of them, others could also be labelled as mainstream science (take a look at Philosophy of science if you wish to learn more on it)The river waters flow outwards as they try and make their way downhillSome merge with other riversSome evaporate and disappear, a fraction of their water becoming lakes and pondsOthers become distributaries, which gain a life of their ownSome meander and meander, at the end finally reaching the oceanI do not claim that occult practices actually get you to the answer. It's just that some people believe that these practices help them get closer to the answer. Hope this helps! ",
