            "answer_text": "Think of the old style pinball machines.  You could control how far you pulled back the spring-loaded plunger that fires the ball into the colorful array of lights and bumpers.  Some kids didn't use the spring and just socked the plunger forward with the heel of their hand.  There are a seemingly infinite number of kids running around the planet, so that provides quite a few possibilities of how the plunger will be initialized.  I'm sure that temperature and humidity inside the machine, and how long the machine has been turned on, and a whole host of other factors help determine the point accumulation after one particular push or pull on the plunger.  After the ball is in play, \"fate\" seemingly controls much of the subsequent scoring, but then the ball comes shooting toward one of the flipper paddles.  Now the player has to perfectly time pushing the flipper button to maximize the subsequent string of point collections.  Does his friend walk up at that moment and throw his coat on the glass obscuring the player's vision?  Does a car accident just outside the arcade result in a local power pole being knocked over and all the lights going out?  Does the player's parent suddenly show up and grab him by the scruff of the neck and yell at him to get home?  True randomness certainly exists, and yet, I suspect that the single track of collective randomness our universe subscribes to, was predestined to happen the way it does simply from the size, shape, and original  physics of Big Bang's blast.  Had some portion of the original hydrogen bubble been distributed differently, our universe might have assumed a completely different trajectory, and we, if we existed at all,  might subscribe to an entirely different track of pre-programmed random events.  The problem, as I see it, in invoking any kind of god into the equation, is that god's are supernatural and supposedly aren't limited to the rules of nature.  Until you are completely familiar with the nature of the supernatural, how can one proceed with a lucid conversation on the topic? ",

            "answer_text": "My studies over the years has led me to an idenity of the body of God. Since we individually would natuarlly be spirit in His image.  Collectively and singularly through our Godness we also create utilizing cooperative inclusiveness of the whole.  Just as each of our body cells are individually creatively and response defensively.  Individually we express randomness and collectively omniscience as the body.  God experiences via all of the parts of the whole, as I see it complete holographic beings of the whole yet with an active particle of free will thus ensuring true evolutionary progression.  Without this variable we would all be clones. ",

            "answer_text": "If  by true randomness you mean variability that no-one can  control/predict/generate not even God, then as I see it, by definition  those two terms are incompatible, if by true randomness you mean  variability that no-one can control/predict/generate except God then I  don't see why they couldn't co-exist. Maybe the question is: assuming  that there is true randomness, what is causing it? The Universe? but to  those who believe in God, who created the Universe? maybe this is not a satisfactory answer. but I think that that question is awesome! ",

If the god is omnipotent, then the god has power over events, then yes they can co-exist. The god makes some events, not random. Other events happen anyways, random. If the god is omnipotent, and the god drives every event, then they cannot co-exist.  The god makes all events,  randomness doesn't exit. If the god is omnipotent, and the god has power over time, the two statements above still apply. The god might be able to go to the future and learn an event that is yet to happen in the present, but the event will still occur. ",

In a branching multiverse, like the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, physics is entirely deterministic so an omniscient being (and even some lowly humans) can predict exactly what will happen in each world, but they will be unable to predict which outcome an observer embedded in the multiverse will see.

In fact past-present-future co-exists according to some and God may see it as one still picture at once at all times, while time moves us along to observe this picture slowly. In other words, the concept of time, past present, future apply to us and not God. ",
