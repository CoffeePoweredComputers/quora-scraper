            "answer_text": "Here's one critique I've seen in a couple places: Philosophical arguments based on contradictions or extended chains of implication can appear rigorous and logical, but when carefully examined they may turn out to rely on poorly defined intuitions. Seemingly contradictory statements not infrequently turn out to be compatible when defined rigorously.  For example, in his article \"The Role of Mathematics in the Sciences and in Society\" Von Neumann points out that the Lagrangian, and Newtonian formulations of mechanics sound incompatible when explained intuitively, though they are provably equivalent. The Lagrangian formulation says that to determine the behavior of some system (for example a pendulum) we need to make the action integral stationary, and to do that we need to take into account the entire path taken by the pendulum. In contrast the Newtonian approach lets us determine the motion of the pendulum by considering the force acting upon the pendulum at particular points. In philosophical terms one might say either the motion of a particle is determined by the forces acting upon it immediately before (causal), or the motion of a particle is determined by its entire trajectory (teleological): they seem contradictory.  Similarly, in his book 'Quantum Computing since Democritus' complexity theorist Scott Aaronson criticizes Searle's Chinese room thought experiment. The Chinese room argument relies on the intuition that a machine following rules from a book could not know the language in the same sense we do. In fact if we consider what such a Chinese room would look like in practice it becomes clear that Searle's use of the words \"book\" and \"room\" are highly misleading, since such a language speaking system would require a \"\"rule book\" at least the size of the earth, its pages searchable by a swarm of robots traveling close to the speed of light\". Another critique: physicist David Deutsch dislikes analytic philosophy, see \"The Beginning of Infinity\". I can add something about that critique tomorrow if anyone's interested. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a physics guy who minored in philosophy and then got an MA (for fun).  Feynman used to say that \"philosophers were always standing on the outside making stupid comments\" (or something like that).   Here are a few things I think: - Jacob Pfau is right that some philosophical arguments rely on intuitively acceptable premises that break down under scrutiny.  I actually wrote a paper during my MA about the Chinese room experiment saying essentially the same thing he mentioned Aaronson said: that the rule book would be arbitrarily long, and searching it would take an untenable amount of time.  An examiner on the outside would quickly know they were not dealing with someone who understood the language, because it would take so long to respond to questions (indeed, it could take arbitrarily long as there is no strict upper bound on Chinese phrases).  When you first read the Chinese room thought experiment, you probably don't notice that, and that pattern is common in philosophy.  Thought experiments in philosophy regularly break the laws of physics and then draw conclusions, which is worse than useless.   The philosophical zombie is another good example of one of those. - Philosophy has gone into a sort of pseudo-scientific direction in the last decade or so.  Most of the work coming out of that is pretty misguided, IMO.   - I think the strength of philosophy is that it teaches critical thinking and argumentative reasoning better than any other academic discipline.  However, when those techniques are misapplied, as they are when philosophers use superficial understanding of science to formulate arguments, it goes awry, and physicists notice that very quickly. ",
