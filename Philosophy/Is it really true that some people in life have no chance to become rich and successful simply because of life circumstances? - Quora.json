            "answer_text": "Upon receiving her Emmy award for Best actress in a drama series, Viola Davis said in her speech,\u201cThe only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity.\u201d This is true for everyone, not just women of color. Every rich and \u2018successful\u2019 person attains their level of success because they have been given adequate opportunities. You can read more about that in Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s book, Outliers: The Story of Success. The book explains the role of opportunity or \u2018life circumstances\u2019 in achieving success. It plays a bigger role than one might think. A person can not get rich by simply working hard, investing prudently, and making the right choices. The right opportunities must also be present to transform the hard working person to a successful person. That is the difference between children born into wealthy families and the poor people in a remote desert village. Don\u2019t get me wrong, hard work and prudent investing are really important to success, however they mean nothing should there be a lack of opportunities. Take for example, Martin, a computer science major in a small community college in Kenya. Besides a demanding school schedule, he also has to work two jobs to support his aging parents and five siblings because he is the first person in the family to get college education. His parents were not well of. They were both farmers their own little farm that grew maize. As a result they couldn\u2019t afford computers or even books for Martin to practice on. On the other hand is Luther, a computer science major at an elite university in London. His parents connections got him accepted into the university. His parents are both well-to-do, respected entrepreneurs so growing up he had all the support from his parents as he got his education. He got books and books and even his own personal computer to practice on. Supposing both Martin and Luther are hard working software developers but ten years down the line Luther is the CEO of his own company after developing high quality computer programs that he got to pitch to wealthy investors. And Martin is still struggling to hold down a job in a small time computer firm. Would you say that Luther simply worked harder than Martin? No, they were both brilliant minds and hard workers but Luther was dealt better cards; wealthy parents, elite university, access to books, connections with wealthy investors, and a PC. ",
