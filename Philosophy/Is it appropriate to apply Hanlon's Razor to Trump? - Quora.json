            "answer_text": "\"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity,\"[1][2] or \"Don't assume bad intentions over neglect and misunderstanding.\" From Wikipedia Hanlon's razor - Wikipedia As an accountant, I take fraud detection classes. One of the aphorisms we are taught is this : Fraud and stupidity often look the same. This is why I will not advocate for leaders that make seemly misguided decisions that are difficult to examine due to lack of transparency: I have no confidence that fraud was not somehow involved. All of our leaders, including Mr. Trump, should be consistently held to the ideal that, to the best of their ability, they lead lives above reproach. This allows the benefit of the doubt if something slightly hinky falls out. Like crappy comments about women. Or email servers (trying to be nonpartisan here - and the inanity of this controversy really, really bothered me). ",
