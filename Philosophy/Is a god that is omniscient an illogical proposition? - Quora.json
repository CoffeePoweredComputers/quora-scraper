            "answer_text": "Supercomputers don\u2019t have knowledge; they have very fast access to data banks. We can imagine a god that has instant access to every fact about the universe, but that wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean that every true fact about the universe was stored in a propositional form somewhere in its \u2018mind\u2019; in fact that can\u2019t be the case, because there are an infinite number of true propositions about the universe, and an infinitely large subset of them change from true to false and vice versa every instant. So the only way I can see to make sense of omniscience is to regard it as an offshoot of omnipotence. When an omniscient god wants to know something, it uses its omnipotence to find out that fact instantly \u2014 or even to have found it out at some point in the past. The information that kind of god has about the universe would be stored in the universe: it wouldn\u2019t need a separate repository. So if we interpret \u2018omniscient\u2019 as \u2018being able to instantly provide the correct answer to any question\u2019, I don\u2019t regard that as a logically inconsistent property (unless you view faster-than-light communication as logically, rather than just physically, impossible). But of course there\u2019s no reason to think that any such being exists. ",

            "answer_text": "Only if you assume that God must be natural, which is an illogical assumption. As far as evidence, it's all around, especially in all living organisms. DNA is a complex coding system, which is a sign of intelligence. Attempts by naturalists to explain it away are storytelling, not science. Granted, it doesn't necessarily mean God is omniscient, but it does mean his intelligence is far superior to ours. God has this to say about himself (in comparison to idols): Isa 46:9 \u2014 Isa 46:10 \u201cremember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,\u2019\u201d ",
