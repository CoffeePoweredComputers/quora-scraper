            "answer_text": "Human extinction is a tall order, unless the buffalo start shooting us from trains. November 21, 1963. JFK is still alive. Young, photogenic, knockout wife, the first 20th century-born President. Oozed hope. Yeah, the world was getting better. The Cold War was threatening and fears of nuclear war were omnipresent, but we were going to the moon, and then the planets, we were going to fix poverty, we were going to end injustice. Because that\u2019s what was going to happen. That\u2019s just the way history was headed. Next day\u2026. I don\u2019t see global thermonuclear war., or a global pandemic. But we may have some really ugly regional wars, and resource problems will make them worse. I love the concern over the environment, but it bears an ominous resemblance to the renewed affection a child has for an old toy just before giving it up forever. If we have to sacrifice some material thing we want, versus tigers and bald eagles, I can see a lot of people saying that experiencing them in virtual reality is good enough. We are making good progress on renewable energy and we may just dodge that bullet. But we are still encroaching on the environment at a disastrous rate. We will control our population or nature will do it for us. One absolutely critical lesson about which most people are in total denial: You cannot put an infinite amount of anything (like people) into a finite space. You cannot get an infinite amount of anything (like resources) out of a finite space. Growth is the ultimate Ponzi scheme. Everyone reaps the benefits until we hit the wall and the suck\u2014 er, investors at the tail end get left holding the bag. For 500 years, now, we\u2019ve been expanding. First into colonial empires, then industrially by tapping resources, then intellectually. And with that expansion has come a huge growth in freedom, because the world is not a zero sum game. Bill Gates can make money and he doesn\u2019t care if you do, too, because it doesn\u2019t interfere with him. I\u2019m not totally sure freedom as we now know it can survive in a no-growth world. If we have some kind of benign police state, what\u2019s to stop the rapacious and exploitive from gaining control of the regulatory apparatus? Trump is only a symptom of the real problem facing America, a perversion of democracy that says \u201cMy uninformed opinion is as valid as your expertise.\u201d I see us acquiescing in a slow decline as long as we\u2019re comfortable. Meanwhile\u2026  Shanghai in 1990. Looks like an American city from the 1950\u2019s.  Shanghai in 2010. If China ever uses oil at the rate of the U.S., the world will need seven more Saudi Arabias. While the Chinese were unrolling an LED screen the size of a soccer field at the Beijing Olympic opening ceremony in 2008, we were groveling before people who wanted to see Obama's birth certificate and still insist the earth is 10,000 years old. I watched the opening ceremony and contrasted it with the sorry spectacle of the 2008 Presidential election and thought, they are going to mop the floor with us. And we won't even have to learn Chinese, because they will do it in perfect, unaccented, idiomatic English, because unlike Americans, the Chinese are not too lazy and stuck up to learn foreign languages. Yes, I used the \"L\" word. Regardless of what groups middle class Americans like to stereotype as lazy, the harsh reality is that the rest of the world increasingly sees Americans in general as lazy. I have no idea how many Americans died in Iraq and Afghanistan because we had to rely on local interpreters of questionable loyalties. Certainly some. I don\u2019t care about your flag pin or how you feel about sitting during the National Anthem. Don\u2019t call yourself a \u201cpatriot\u201d if you don\u2019t speak, or are at least learning, another language. So I don\u2019t believe humanity is doomed, but I think we are in for some serious unpleasantries if we don\u2019t start listening to the people who know what they\u2019re talking about. We always seem to function in crisis mode, or maybe Scarlett O\u2019 Hara mode: \u201cfiddle-de-dee, I\u2019ll think about that tomorrow.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Questioner, I noticed your question having just responded to a similar question. It comes from a slightly different angle, but still deals with the underlying question, providing a rationale for transforming a negative perspective about our current state of affairs, and thus potentially a pessimistic future perspective, into a basis for positive perspective that has some justification or substantiation to it. (Also, I am often asked questions involving positivity and optimism, so maybe also check my answers for more.) Podcast: Ask Biella - \"With all of the negative media, how do you stay optimistic about the future?\" Excess Breeds Excess \"With all of the negative media, how do you stay optimistic about the future?\" Dear Michael, Some problems have been around for a long long time, since recorded history. Problems such as bullshit. A difficult problem to deal with through the ages. The public simply did not have easy access to the facts, or even readily available alternative opinions, perspectives or counter-arguments. Bullshit had to be determined via gauging the truthfulness of the speaker. A difficult task. Accomplished liars and those willing to deceive without qualms could fairly easily mislead. (Stay with me, I will get to answer your question directly, but first I have to lay some groundwork.)  What would have, or could have, been the remedy in olden times? There really isn't any. Mass education, mass dissemination of information, mass access to information, all of those were not realistic options. They persisted to be ideals, and in the last century with access to libraries and free public schooling, much of that ideal was realised. But it still wasn't enough to deal with the covert cancer of bullshit. With the coming of the internet age, and easy access for anyone with access it seemed the problem of bullshit would once and for all be banished. but that has not happened. Why not? A few reasons. One, the problem is not seen as a pressing problem. Bullshit is a word we are not even really allowed to use in polite society, we have to say BS, with the implication that it's not really a big deal. How often don't we hear, \"Oh, it's just bullshit,\" said with an indulging smile? By implication, \"It's nothing serious.\" Another major problem is the entrenchment of opinion and attitude aggravated by clinging to mis-beliefs because of the utter bullshit of not wanting to be seen as having been \"wrong.\" So bullshit persists. However, the growing negativity is increasingly bringing our Attention to the common cause of all the negativity, which is bullshit. There's not yet a common Awareness of this common cause and root of all the rubbish and negativity, but that too will come. But, it needs a catalyst, it needs some emphasis, the problem of bullshit needs something to illustrate just how severe a problem it really is. Typically we only tend to wake up and take significant action when a problem moves from being a non-pressing problem to one we can no longer ignore.  Looking Ahead It's by looking to the future, and by extrapolating what is currently transpiring that I maintain my Positivity despite it all. When I look at how things are playing out, look with an Overview Perspective, look within the context of seeing how the current excessive negativity might be necessary, I cannot help but be Positive. That problem of bullshit is coming to the fore. Bullshit is a pressing problem that can no longer be ignored or not taken to be the extremely serious problem it is. It might seem like we are in overwhelmingly negative times. But just look at what that negativity has led to, has caused to happen. The largest protest ever took place last year. Massive movements resulting in the rapid removal from office or position of power of those who have used their status to abuse. An increase in social consciousness an awareness that is unprecedented in history. The youth have become mobilised in ways they never have before, could have before, all because of the pressing problem of the mounting negativity and problems. We need that pressure to be motivated to take action. Without action, it's all meaningless. But, to get a large mass to move, and it's a large mass that is needed to change the entrenchments of societies, we need significant pressure. That's the Overview Perspective logic to the current negativity. Yes, it is negative, but it's necessary. The negativity has always been there. It's not really more negative now that at any time in history, there's merely more attention on the negativity, and that's a good thing. It will lead to significant change and the evolution of societal structures and interactions. That to me is most most Positive. Systemic Change A bit More... Changing the specific problems is one thing. Yes, it's good, but it's much like treating the symptoms and not curing the disease. The patient may be pain-free and seemingly okay, but the disease is still there, continuing to cause a problem. Societies are much like this. To truly deal with the problems, we often have to change the underlying system. A particularly difficult problem as it needs massive support, support that typically only comes when matters are seen by most as extreme. Long-term problems that have become entrenched typically need radical change to get rid of them. Radical change requires severity to galvanise the populace to act. Looking at the current state of affairs this understanding makes me exceedingly Positive. I foresee not only changes which will lead to solving specific problems, such as the changes which have come about when dealing with abuse by those in power. But more is needed, because the entire system still needs to shift to deal with the underlying causes that led to those abuses. That's what I see coming, large systemic change. I fully see the kind of radical overhaul, that comes along rarely, happening as a result of all of this accumulated negativity that is so in the forefront of our Awareness. We have to deal with it, or be drowned by it. We can no longer continue to treat these problems as not really serious. We are too acutely aware, and that is massively Positive. To stay Positive despite the negativity we just need to zoom out a bit and focus on the longer-term Goodness of it all. When we see that Goodness, see that longer-term Goodness, it shifts us to a Positive Perspective.

It\u2019s been 3+ years since the Dooms\u2019 day was supposed to happen, and Mayans were horribly wrong in predicting that. Did they expect the world to end on 21-12-2012? (I hope it\u2019s not because the number sounded cool to repeat) That shouldn\u2019t be the pessimistic question here, the real question \u201cWho would\u2019ve given such importance to their calendar, if they hadn\u2019t ended it?\u201d Look back, every year we used to buy calendars (monthly or daily sheets, unless you\u2019re a total digital savvy and prefer our phone instead) and all we do is throw the empty ones at the end of year. Would you have done it, if you had received a calendar for 2020 that ended with December 21? Nope, but what in their right minds were the Mayans thinking while making their so called calendar? Was it a strategy to keep their calendars safe until 2012? Given the number of people whose names became trending since they thought it is easier to be infamous rather than famous, I hope the Mayans didn\u2019t resort to anything of that sort. Not being a history buff, there is no point of even remotely trying to explain that. Should we really be pondering on the \u201cWhy\u201d with this ideology? The Presumption The real deal is that at least the Mayans, or at least some gentle man or woman from the Mayan community had the thought to make a calendar that would last their life time (most of the people\u2019s lifetime, until 21/12/2012). I am optimistic that with every optimistic view there will be a pessimistic view (even if they do not juxtapose) ",

They also sport different fertility rates, which would cause the progressive societies to disappear, faster. One may say, human race is just passing through the crest of accommodating nature, tolerant behavior, and progressive outlook. If we consider the world to have passed through, Archaic period, Middle ages, Machine Age, Atomic Age, Space Age and Information Age, to reach the present, the future can undoubtedly be termed as The Age of The Irrational. The prospect of the human race, notwithstanding the multitude of theories in this regard with imaginative predictions, looks quite bleak. (Maybe, human beings of the coming eras will be better used to it?) The future, with the disappearance of moderate societies and with the growth of the orthodox ones, beckons us with very hard times.

There are various scenarios that could play out in causation: we could have release of gigatons of methane sufficient to push warming past survivable climate; we could have warming past the point where we could grow wheat crops; or we could lose all sea life due to ocean warming killing off plankton, the foundation of the oceanic food chain. Best case from the doomers is nine years, or around 2026.
