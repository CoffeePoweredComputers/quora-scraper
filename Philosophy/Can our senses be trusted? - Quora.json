            "answer_text": "If we have nothing else to believe, we will always have our natural abilities to listen to what our senses tell us. We have become too accustomed to modern tecnology to tell us what to do or when to do something. We were born with natural animal senses to warn of danger and to know that something is wrong. Health issues and even our surroundings, people who we arent comfortable with are all things our senses tell us about. If we listen to them and act upon them it could in some cases save our lives. ",
