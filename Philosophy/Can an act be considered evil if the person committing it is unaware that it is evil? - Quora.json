            "answer_text": "This gets a lot more complicated than simple awareness of consequences and intention.  Take Vietnam, if any of you young folks remember it. Set aside the goal of keeping the military industrial complex humming and take only the stated intention of limiting the spread of what the United States considered a dangerous ideology.  Then consider the carnage - loss of human lives regardless of nationality - plus the destruction of families, irreparable disillusionment of Americans in our government, and the rippling physical and mental diseases that drastically destroyed surviving veterans' quality of life and how many families?  Does that qualify as evil? Was it predictable? If not at the outset surely at each point of escalation.  And the good that was at stake? National hubris and the way people half a world away would be governed.   Here's the point: even when the intention is defensible though certainly not righteous at what point does the means used to achieve it become evil? Did the wholesale slaughter of Americans on  9/11 justify torture of innocents at Guantanamo? Or even the guilty? Or was that evil?  I can't answer either of these but I think the hypotheticals being offered fall short of helping us recognize or deal with evil in the world.  The worst evil involves masses of people and invisible government bureaucrats; intentions that are invisible or well disguised; consequences which decision-makers like to say are unpredictable.  But given the collective intelligence and technology of this country, that's becoming harder and harder to accept.   It's not hard to point to the Oregon shooter, Cleveland's Ariel Castro, ISIS, and see evil. But that's evil concentrated, condensed down to concrete stories we can all relate to with universal horror.  But what about the Arkansas Congressman (Jay Dickey) whose legislation 20 years ago cut off  funding for research into gun violence at the behest of the NRA. His intentions were clear: curry favor with a rich and powerful lobby that could help him keep his job. Even he admits today that the consequences of his amendment have been lost lives.  Is he evil? Did he do an evil thing?  How about opponents of the Affordable Care Act? Do you really think they understood this massive overhaul of health insurance?  Surely they understood that its goal was to get everyone covered, especially those with preexisting conditions - the people whose lives likely depended on it.  But opponents had something more important to achieve - block the country's first black president and Democrat, from accomplishing what veteran politicians had failed to get done for three decades.  That was their intention. Consequences? Widespread death and disability for tens of thousands plus the demeaning experience of groveling to social welfare agencies for many others.  So, balancing intention and consequences were their efforts evil? ",

            "answer_text": "Franklin Veaux posts the obvious reasonable answer that actions can greatly impact others no matter the intentions, but here's another view. Someone is dying. There is a medicine that can cure them. Someone else walking past takes the medicine for themselves, and the person dies. Situation 1: The person who took it did not know that taking it would kill someone. They took it to cure their sick (but not dying) kid.Situation 2: The person who took it knew taking it would kill that person. They also knew that their kid wasn't that sick and wouldn't have died even without the medicine, but selfishly wanted it for themselves. Obviously 1 is not evil, and 2 is and the difference is awareness. UPDATED: Misguided intention vs. no intention at all The man in Franklin's answer is deluded and forcing his delusions on other unwilling people. Delusion does not equal innocence. Misguided good intentions can cause great harm. However complete ignorance of causing any harm at all is yet again different. For example: There is a switch when flicked will kill 100,000 people instantly.  Situation 1: Man doesn't know what the switch does and flicks it. Situation 2: delusional man thinks cleansing the earth of people is good because the earth is overpopulated. Flicks the switch.  Both actions killed 100,000 people but man 1 is less evil than 2 because 1 had no intent at all, while 2 intentionally flicked the switch- on misguided beliefs. Misguided beliefs is the real evil. Believing something and believing it is right to enforce that belief on other people even in extreme magnitudes is the real killer. When power gets into the hands of someone misguided like that is when real evil happens (eg Hitler).  They have all the passion and self-righteousness to fuel their efforts, and lead others astray with their steadfast determination and belief. They are incurable and will continue to perpetrate evil to any lengths, at any cost- because they believe they are doing the right thing.  \"Evil doers\" with no intention whatsoever are less culpable. They did it out of complete ignorance, but when confronted with the fact, will not do it again.  Misguided people are another matter. They believe they are changing things for the better, so why stop? Thus they are most dangerous and capable of evil. ",

            "answer_text": "For a tl;dr, just read the last paragraph. The defenition of evil will help us to answer this question, that is: \"Profoundly immoral and wicked.\" Two other things we must consider when considering evil, in specific context to human beings, are both extremely important when considering wether a human act is regarded as evil, in any situation. These two things are, firstly, that essentially nobody regards their acts as evil whilst doing them. There are exeptions, as with anything. However, for the most part, people don't conciously choose to do evil, they do so either through the lack of realisation that their acts are evil, or through their lack of choise, such as the things soldiers or people living in extreme poverty have to do to survive in aweful circumstances, often through no fault of their own. (On a side note: this is something the privaleged often don't take into account. We simply assume all drug dealers, murderers and other unlikables are evil, and chose to be evil. This is frequently true, but just as frequently, is the possiblilty that these people are doing these things through lack of choice and/or education.) The other, is that the defenition of evil doesn't change, however,  our perception of evil does. Our idea of what 'evil' is not set in stone, it changes from generation to generation, a great example of this is our changing perception of gays, which were publicly executed at one point in time, but now, have their own Parades and ceremonies dedicated to the recognition of the LGBT community, and are in the process of being given the right to same sex marriage around the world. To answer your question, evil is a perception, a label we put on things based on our own beliefs of what is acceptable and what is not, so what is evil to you isn't necesserily evil to another. Therefor, if you don't perceive your own action as evil, then it isn't evil. As stated before though, nobody thinks their own actions are evil, so try to stop yourself, as often as you can, and say to yourself, \"is what I'm doing, evil?\" ",

            "answer_text": "As I understand it, you're pressing on a distinction between a Utilitarianism and deontological ethics.   In deontological ethics, the intent is key, and so if the committer does not intend to do evil, then the act is not evil.   Utilitarianism on the other hand states that the ends are more important than the means, and so whatever the intent, it is the result which defines the act as evil.   The problem I have with Franklin's Doctor example is that the doctor had no intent to harm, and his judgement that the doctor's actions were evil is based on the morality of modern times, not of Victorian times.   As a modern poser for you.  The majority of the planet are meat-eaters.  Say that in 100 years our morality may have shifted to one of veganism, does that mean our acts today are extremely evil and twisted?  If Frank's argument about the doctor is to be carried forwards, then the answer is yes, but if evil is defined by the morality of the masses, then the answer is no. ",

            "answer_text": "None of the answers so far (as of Sunday morning, Jan 24), represent a Christian perspective, so I'm going to chip in. Short answer: yes. Intention is irrelevant to whether something is evil or not. It seriously affects the degree of evil inherent in an action, but that isn't the point. If we posit, as all Christians ought to, that God's character is the standard that defines good and evil, then we can safely say that something can be evil even if the person is unaware that it is evil. Humans are not the source of morality, and thus our intent doesn't change the evil or goodness of something.  Here's a metaphor: driving on the wrong side of the road is still illegal whether you knew it or not. The outcome, whether good or bad, does not determine whether you are breaking the law. You are breaking the law, because the standard has nothing to do with your perception. As someone once said, \"ignorance of the law is no excuse.\" You may get a more or less severe ticket if the cop finds out that you were oblivious, but that has no bearing on whether your actions were illegal. Thus, good and evil reference an outside standard, God's character: a universal and unchangeable law that does not bow to our own perception, or the outcome of our deeds. ",

In Victorian times, a doctor named Isaac Baker-Brown became convinced that masturbation caused all kinds of maladies, so he began \"curing\" masturbation by surgically removing the clitoris of many women. As a result of this genital mutilation, he said, \"intractable women became happy wives; rebellious teenage girls settled back into the bosom of their families; and married women formerly averse to sexual duties became pregnant.\" His intent was not evil. His actions were extremely evil and twisted. There is a reason for the saying \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\" Evil can come from the best of intentions. Outcome matters, no matter how \"pure\" the motivation. ",

Some people have read it one way, some the other. Once this is established the answer is pretty easy. So my answer would simply be to point out that that clarification can and should be made. An evil person is one who intends to do harm. An evil action is one that causes harm. So a well intentioned person can unwittingly commit and evil act, or an evil person can unwittingly commit a good act. You can (and should) judge the person and the act independently. Just because a good person unwittingly caused harm does not make the action good, nor the person evil (or vice versa). A misguided person who performs and evil act with good intentions is, well, just that. I don't think we need to make it any more complicated. The question is not asking what exactly constitutes an evil act, so I won't go there. ",

There is no sure way to understand the line between good and evil in the minds of different people. Evil is viewed differently by everyone. ",
