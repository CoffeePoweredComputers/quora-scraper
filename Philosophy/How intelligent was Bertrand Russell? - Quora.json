            "answer_text": "He was fluent in many languages, and he had the working equivalent of a bachelors or masters degree in many areas, able to converse as an expert. In several areas\u2014philosophy, mathematics, and logic\u2014he had the equivalent of a PhD. He could quote all the great literature of the world, from the Greeks to Shakespeare and beyond, at the drop of a hat, always finding something appropriate for the occasion. But beyond all those achievements (which are really in the realm of knowledge) he had much more: an almost unique talent for taking any aspect of this knowledge and whittling it down to its simplest possible explanation \u2014 understanding that while there is always more to know, things are rarely as difficult or obscure as the experts insist on making them. After all, there is no Nobel Prize for either mathematics or philosophy. Instead, Lord Russell achieved his Nobel Prize in the area of Literature\u2026 specifically, his essays that made his knowledge accessible to others and taught the human race all it needed to know about survival and compassion.

            "answer_text": "In many ways he was extremely intelligent. His mathematical skills were extraordinary. His Book Principia Mathmatica with Alfred North Whitehead is a classic. He also had a gift for writing. He was fluent, very clear and humorous. Unfortunately many of his ideas were weak, and some were just silly. He was a pacifist through both WWI and WWII, yet he later took the position that the USA should direct a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. He maintained this position for 3 years and then changed his mind. He then claimed he never said any such thing. When faced with innumerable newspaper, newsreels, and TV interviews he claimed he was just kidding. No one who viewed these materials believed it. He also went from position to position in Philosophy. Many of them flatly contradicted his previous position. He was, I believe, an inventive, but not a deep thinker. ",
