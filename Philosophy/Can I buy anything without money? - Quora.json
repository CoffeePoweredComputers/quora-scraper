            "answer_text": "The barter system goes back before money was invented. One thing that has value is given for another thing of value, and no money is exchanged. There are some cities in America that give out City usable bucks Barter is nothing new. Some people have always traded goods and services instead of buying the things they need. Today, with high taxes and a deepening depression, many modern Americans are rechecking barter opportunities. Paul Glover's article \"The Ultimate Barter\" demonstrated one system: trading hours of labor for a homemade currency, which is trad able for another participant's own service hours. As a MOTHER reader, I've benefited from several tips over the years, and I'd like to give something back. So I thought I'd share additional ideas on setting up community bartering systems based on my own experience. First of all, most barter systems take one of two forms. Some systems trade through a headquarters, where each member has a \"house\" account-updated with \"debits\" and \"credits\" from trades. Other systems, such as Glover's, print and utilize their own currency\u2014eliminating the need for a central agency. Both have advantages and disadvantages. The centralized system is expensive to operate but is more secure than a currency system. However, the security problem is the same as Uncle Sam's: counterfeiting. If the barter currency becomes valuable, enterprising individuals will no doubt attempt to counterfeit. Modern photocopiers can even produce colored documents by laser technology, making the problem an even larger threat. Many people view homemade currencies with suspicion. However, the laws that govern an auxiliary currency are not hostile. Remember, the money in your pocket is your private property, to do with as you wish. Contrary to popular belief, it's not against any law to spindle, fold, or mutilate currency\u2014as long as no fraud is intended fraudulent. The law simply requires that imitation federal currency be 25% smaller or 1 1/2 larger than the original size. In Myrtle Beach, SC, we've created a homemade currency called \"Beach Bucks.\" The purpose of this currency is to invite vacationers to stay an extra day. Typical visitors stay an average of 4.2 days. A hotel owner who persuades guests to stay an extra day can significantly increase profits. So hoteliers try to keep guests by offering the extra night at a reduced rate and offering 40 Beach Bucks. Each Buck is equivalent to $1, and is exchangeable with cash at a few of the stores in town. All totaled, you're not spending extra money. You're getting an extra day at the beach for free. By next year, we hope several more local stores will start accepting these bills. Since local hotels average approximately 66% occupancy, extra room nights sold bring in profits. The value of Beach Bucks makes a difference helping vacationers accept the offer. If they don't bring enough value to a vacationer, there is little chance of extending the visit. For starters, we insist that discount offers made for Beach Bucks exceed all other advertising deals available. Also, they are aimed at our particular market. The Myrtle Beach economy earns $2 billion per year of tourist money, so there's a definite use for a currency aimed at the vacation industry. ",

            "answer_text": "Everywhere we turn, we are surrounded by advertisements telling us that our happiness lies within the product they sell. However, numerous consumer studies have shown that the stuff we buy often fails to deliver on that guarantee. Regardless, we find ourselves caught in an infinite cycle of longing and purchasing, constantly searching for the items that, if the price is right, will bring us absolute joy. Retail therapy isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cut out to be though. It turns out that happiness lies in the desire for stuff and the journey it takes to acquire it, but wanes after the actual acquisition. The novelty of new purchases wears off over time whereas the happiness derived from experiences lasts much longer. Why should we continue to spend money on all this stuff if it\u2019s not improving the overall quality of our lives? While we may be able to provide anecdotal evidence to support the claim that shopping does make us happier, that pleasure is unfortunately short-lived. Take a moment to scope out your recent purchases around your house and ask yourself how much of that still ignites a feeling of excitement and joy. Whether or not the fact that shopping doesn\u2019t make us any happier is news to you, we are well aware of the financial implications of our shopping habits. Money spent on items that don\u2019t improve our quality of life can be money spent to pay down overbearing debt or put into savings to pay for experiences like vacations or hobbies \u2013 purchases that do retain their value in happiness over time. Even when we realize that ongoing joy can\u2019t be found at the bottom of a shopping bag, we still get that yearning to head out to the stores. The next time you get the urge to spend money at the expense of your financial goals, harness that desire and try these four ways to hack the exhilaration of shopping without actually spending any money ",

            "answer_text": "Hi fellow being, Lets rephrase the question, \"can you own something without money.\" Because when you use the word 'buying' it basically means exchange of one good for another good.But then again you can further say, \"can you attain a service without paying for it.\"Eg. You are a temple and a priest is giving a discourse on a topic, you just learnt something without paying for it. But there's a catch you gave your time, not money though! If you are income is less, and you are not paying taxes. Well in that cases you are availing different services available to the citizens of the nations! ALL FOR FREE! You are using the bridge, the roads/streets that you travel on. There are numerous examples that we can keep on going with.Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Surely the word \u2018buy\u2019 implies the exchange of money or some other payment? There are websites where you can trade items or services for the things you want. In the UK we have many freecycle groups and websites where you can ask for things, or post things you want to get rid of or no longer need. This is a way of getting stuff for free and I know a few people that have got some really good things. ",
