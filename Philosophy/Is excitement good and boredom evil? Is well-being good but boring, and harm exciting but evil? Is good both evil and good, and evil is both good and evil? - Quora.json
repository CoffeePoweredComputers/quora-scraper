            "answer_text": "Thank you Salem for the A2A! Please allow me to answer in terms of Tolkien\u2019s fantasy literature, specifically The Silmarillion. Myself excepted, most Tolkien fans seem to find F\u00ebanor\u2019s rebellion against the Valar and flight to Middle-earth to be exciting and similarly Ingw\u00eb\u2019s refusal to participate in the rebellion to be boring. My own perspective is that the consequences of F\u00ebanor\u2019s actions were boringly predictable, unwise and counterproductive whereas Ingw\u00eb\u2019s noble restraint and deliberate decision to refrain from unwise action in the face of extreme provocation was exciting to observe. But who am I to judge who is exciting or boring, unwise or wise, good or evil? After a life of tremendous suffering and experience Alexander Solzhenitsyn warned us of the perils inherent in seeking simplistic labels: \u201cIf only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?\u201d  If I\u2019ve learned anything from traveling to 20-something countries and living among human beings of many races and classes, it is that there is no objective standard by which to label anything \u2018boring\u2019 or \u2018exciting\u2019, \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018evil\u2019. But I\u2019m no logician so perhaps I would be best served by ending my answer here. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, everyone has some good in them, everyone has evil in them. These modules are present in our brain because or evolution as they were needed from survival. So, good at a subjective level is good and evil. For example take bullying, you target a person, make fun of him, crack jokes, you enjoy it with your friends, you do that sometimes to show your sense of humor in front of girl and try to impress her by cracking jokes on the poor fellow. Now from your perspective, its fun, entertaining, something that helps improve bonding with your friends. Even helps you get a chick sometime. But from the victim\u2019s perspective, its horrible, painful and isolates you and makes you feel alone and helpless. Proper behaviour, working hard, helping others all these are boring stuff, but making fun of something, cheating your way to complete the tasks, not helping others and getting engrossed in your own life. These are easy compared to former but they are all bad. Good has never been easy to do, that is why we see few good men/women around. Easy to move along and ignore the problem, hard to intervene and try to solve it. But that is an ideal thing. Real world has no place for good and evil as the subjectivity for it made it impossible to distinguish one from other. Everyone is cut from different cloth, everyone has different limits, everyone thinks in a different manner, so pondering on this would take you nowhere as the world you see is something only you can see. Others see different world that you can\u2019t. ",
