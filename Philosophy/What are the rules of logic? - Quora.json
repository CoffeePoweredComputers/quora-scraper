            "answer_text": "Re: Basic rules of logic. I assume you are referring to the ways in which we seek to discover truth. So far as I have discovered, truth may be claimed through Empirical, or scientific means,Legal presentations,Theological discussion, orLogical argument.Perhaps the only way to reach absolute truth is through the latter method. We all are well aware of the modifications, corrections, and often tragic overdue realizations accompanying other well intentioned proclamations of truth. Logical argument is based on the strict application of agreed upon rules to predetermined axioms, or premises. A good example you may be familiar with is the syllogism method you may have used in the study of geometry. Indeed, when correctly applied, geometric rules will build you a dandy home. And who will deny that alternate interior angles are equal? Other than the many logical fallacies, the most serious problems enter through the selection of axioms. Is the shortest distance between two points really a straight line? Or, is it a geodesic? Are there any axioms we may judge to be absolute? Only one: Everything is relative. Keep that in mind when you assume the pedestal of authority. Except for me, of course. ",

            "answer_text": "'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean \u2014 neither more nor less.' 'The question is,' said Alice, 'whether you can make words mean so many different things.' 'The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'which is to be master \u2014 that's all.' This is from the Alice books by Lewis Carroll, and Carroll\u2019s day job was as a mathematics don at Christ Church College, Oxford - he was an early pioneer of symbolic logic. The words he puts into Humpty\u2019s mouth are correct as far as they go - in logic you can define a term any way you like. But to be useful it has to be a \u2018good\u2019 definition, by which we mean a definition which is not self-contradictory in the logical system we\u2019re currently using. Often you can prove that a definition is \u2018good\u2019 in this sense, and you get questions in degree-level maths exams which ask you to quote a standard definition and then prove that it it a good one. Something to avoid is using \u2018loaded\u2019 definitions. Workers in competing schools of statistics sometimes use terms like \u2018admissible\u2019 or even \u2018good\u2019 with technical meanings, and if you take these at face value you can be led to assume that a particular approach is the only reasonable one. Quoting dictionary definitions in an attempt to settle an argument is poor practice, because in contentious areas words often have technical meanings which may not be found even in the most authoritative of dictionaries. A common example is the apparently startling statement \u2018black people cannot be racist\u2019 which is perfectly correct under a technical definition of the word which is used by social scientists and writers on race.
