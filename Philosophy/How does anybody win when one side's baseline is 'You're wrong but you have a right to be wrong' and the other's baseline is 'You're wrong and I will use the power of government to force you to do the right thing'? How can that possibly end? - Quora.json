            "answer_text": "This question is phrased in a way that would interpreted in one way by conservatives, and in another way by liberals, because its terms and assumptions are vague and require interpretation. In particular, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong and I will use the power of government to do the right thing?\u201d is phrased as a leading question, implying that to do this will have bad effects, even though it is necessary to use the power of government, and even armed force, to safely police a society, to defend it, and to maintain civil order. Of course, liberals and conservatives would draw the line where it is necessary for the government enforce laws in different places. In addition, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong but you have a right to be wrong\u201d would be interpreted differently by liberals and by conservatives. In general, they would draw the lines of \u201crights\u201d in different places. For example, conservatives would make an exception to this proposition in the case of abortion, while liberals would not. To actually answer the question, in a harmonious society, the tension between these two propositions, which is certainly real, is resolved by each side treating the other as rational beings with whom a compromise can be reached. If it has no longer become possible to compromise, then each side will see the other side as less than rational, and thus deserving of restraint, and what is more, by their own lights, each side will be quite correct in this. In history, this usually ends badly. ",

How can that possibly end? (Thanks for the \u201cask to answer.\u201d) The situation that the original poster has described is essentially trench warfare. However, it does not accurately reflect the facts on the ground. To wit, the reality of modern democracy is that the vast majority of citizens are perfectly happy to periodically cast a ballot for the proverbial lesser of two evils, after which the oligarchical collective of government picks up the ball and runs with it. Right and wrong are consequently redefined as what the representatives of a majority or a gerrymander-empowered minority say it should be. That is to say, most people believe that when they lose at the ballot box, they lose the right to say what is right and what is wrong until the next election. As a lifelong libertarian, I do not in any way acknowledge the right of other people to be wrong, but neither do I appeal to the power of government to force other people to do what I think is the right thing. Rather, I seek to peacefully coexist with the vast majority of people who usually know the difference between right and wrong, but who choose to defer to the anonymous authority of the crowd, or to the supposedly legitimate powers that be of government. Meanwhile, I choose to speak truth to power, like a voice in the wilderness, and preach to the choir of like-minded libertarians. ",

How can that possibly end? What celebration do you plan for Constitution Day, this Thursday, September 17, 2020? Fellow citizens can win---with reform to the proffered preamble to the U.S. Constitution and its potential to control chaos under the ineluctable evidence to actual-reality. Neither humankind\u2019s struggle to constrain chaos nor admission that it is humankind\u2019s non-consignable responsibility is new. The 2020 summer of chaos and the Democratic Party\u2019s policy of public crisis for vain promise to control everything is a strategy to increase their power. The ineluctably good people of the U.S. can stop the loss of constraints on chaos by taking bold action. Individuals must accept that they are human beings and therefore responsible to constrain chaos in their sphere of control. Individual responsibility has not happened, because the U.S. inherited from Great Britain the tradition that a higher power will eventually relieve \u201courselves\u201d of personal concern for the unknown future \u201cour Posterity\u201d faces. Leaving relief from chaos to higher power is contradictory to the ineluctable evidence: no higher power will usurp the individual\u2019s responsibility to accept being human and accept the power, energy, and authority humanity entails. This proposal was abstractly proffered by the 39 of the 55 framers of the 1787 U.S. Constitution. Their 5 person committee of style captured in the 52-word preamble the essence of the constitutional debate. The preamble has two thoughts: 1) announcing the draft U.S. Constitution to be ratified by 9 of the 12 states with delegates and the thirteenth, dissident, state and 2) proffering the people\u2019s proposition tacitly reached for signing on September 17, 1787. I studied the preamble, which I call \u201cthe U.S. Preamble,\u201d to comprehend if I want to be a U.S. citizen and how I want to develop my civic, civil, legal, and private conduct according to my preferences I would happily debate with fellow citizens. Over 70 people have, in library meetings and other discussions, helped me develop my interpretation today: This appreciative citizen practices the U.S. disciplines---integrity, justice, peace, strength, and prosperity, \"in order to\u201d develop responsible human-independence \u201cto ourselves and our Posterity.\u201d Please read the original preamble to consider some subtleties underlying my experiences and observations. First, the citizen must want to comprehend the preamble before he or she can use it to manage their civic, civil, legal, and private way of living. Nevertheless, the citizen who neglects civic collaboration invites subjugation to law enforcement decided by other citizens. Second, the notion that \u201cthe founding fathers\u201d hold sway in the continuing public debate is crushed by the objects of the proposition: \u201cto ourselves and our Posterity.\u201d We are the twelfth generation after 1787s \u201courselves\u201d and the 2020 ourselves to the coming generation. No way will we allow so-called founding fathers rule our children. Third, ratifying the U.S. Preamble terminated the 13 states under the Confederation of States and established a Union of states held accountable by the ineluctably good people of their states and the USA---the citizens who accept responsible human independence under the U.S. Preamble\u2019s proposition. Fourth, \u201cliberty\u201d is the text\u2019s erroneous purpose, because humankind cannot escape the constraints of physics and its progeny---each person must develop responsible human independence. Therefore, the best a nation can provide is freedom from tyranny. Fifth, there are no standards for achieving either the disciplines or the purpose, and thus, there is no usurpation of human responsibilities to self: Posterity\u2019s posterity will discover how successful the proposal will be. Religion is a private rather than civil human interest. Sixth, there are no discriminations against gender or responsible factional societies within humankind. Fellow citizens happily segregate themselves based on individual preferences within physics\u2019 limits rather than submitting to someone else\u2019s preferences for them. However, fellow citizens who think crime, violence, tyranny, and alien-ship pay invite constraint by the willing citizens: \u201cWe the People of the United States in order to . . . .\u201d Statutory law-enforcement provisions are in the Articles of the U.S. Constitution. Thursday is Constitution Day, 2020; Constitution Day and Citizenship Day. Unfortunately, Congress represses the U.S. Preamble as a secular sentence. Some officials pretend that they need not conform to the U.S. Preamble. Fellow citizens cannot accept their civic, civil, legal, and private powers to hold public officials accountable unless they comprehend the sentence under which \u201courselves and our Posterity\u201d assigns power to the officials. Considering these insights and your use of the U.S. Preamble might be an excellent way to celebrate Constitution Day on the eve of the 2020 elections, November 3. ",

How can that possibly end? It has to end by making sure the younger generation realizes the situation, and for most issues, that is what happens. Take a look at abortion. The anti-abortion position is \"You're wrong and I will use the power of government to force you to do the right thing\". They believe they have a moral imperative to force people to conform to their religious beliefs. There are plenty of people who think abortion is wrong, but are pro-choice, because they believe \"You're wrong but you have a right to be wrong\". They understand the concepts the USA was founded on, that everyone has their own individual rights to make up their own minds. A long time ago, oposition to abortion was more or less universal. Now, as generations have gone by, it is the opposite, Sixty-six percent of adults say they don't believe the Supreme Court should overturn Roe v Wade. Poll: Majority of adults don't support overturning Roe v. Wade  Even Republicans are almost evenly split. It is just not an issue for most Americans, only for a vocal, and theocratic, minority. It is exactly the same with same-sex marriage. There are people who have their own opinions about homosexuality, but they acknowledge that other people have the right to live their own lives with the same legal protections they have. ",

            "answer_text": "See, I'm not saying that it is necessarily always right for the government to force the \u201dright\u201d thing, but before we discuss that, we've gotta know what is the \u201dright\u201d thing and how do we know it's right. I agree with your answer Michael Williams's answer to Do you agree that there's no such thing as right and wrong culture?that morality is objective. That's why I asked for your source of objective morality. You can't just say something is wrong because it is wrong without giving a proof or else it will be subjective, there are many subjective morality systems out there, like utilitarianism which bases it's morality on increasing the amount of pleasure and decreasing the amount of pain. Or like liberalism which is mostly based on the harm principle.Each one of these systems have benefits and cons. Either way, what we are interested in is not just the usability of the system, but which system is TRUE. Or else everything is subjective. You could have a moral system where the strong people kill the weak people to survive, or use them as slaves, and that too has its benefits ,when your goal is the contiuation of the human race . I don't know what believe background you possess, but the only way someone can claim that there is objective morality is by claiming it is from God, he then has to prove that it is from God. For example, a jew or a Christian has the right to claim they follow objective morality, but they've gotta prove that there religion was not altered by humans. However, from an atheistic/agnostic standpoint, nothing could be proved right or wrong, it is all subjective. To atheists, humans are just a combination of chemical particles that has no worth whatsoever. A person and the fieces that he excretes are equal, just a combination of chemicals. I as a Muslim believe that Islam is the truth, objective morality comes from what god ordered us to do and not to do, as well as the teachings of the prophet Mohammed peace be upon him. Unlike Judaism and Christianity the teachings of Islam is still preserved and will still be until the day of judgement, as prophet Mohammed is the last of prophets, peace be upon them all. So for anybody to criticize Islam\u2019s morals he\u2019s gotta have a source of objective morality that he judges based upon, not just what he thinks is right because that is just an opinion not truth. I , from your question ,(link above) can see that you have a wrong idea about Islam, and I don\u2019t blame you as Islam is always being attacked by media which tries to make people hate islam. You\u2019ve gotta understand that Islam is pro women rights and what the media ingrains in you about Islam is not always true. Yes some of the points that you mentioned (in your answer) have some truth in them but not totally . When you understand the wisdom behind some of these rules you will have a different opinion. So brother , learn about Islam from the correct sources not from the enemies of Islam . Read the Quran and ask Muslim scholars about it . Study the basis of Islam before you move to the branches, You will find that it IS the truth. Finally, may God guide you and I to his straight path. Here are some links of YouTube channels which I advise you to listen to some of their stuff. iERA Subboor Ahmad Darwinian Delusions Mohammed Hijab Edit: btw I just realized that you are a different Michael that the one who I thought you were. Anyways I hope you got my points. I'll just tag him too so that he can see my answer. Michael Williams ",

Consider a scenario where someone has the belief that they have the right to practise paedophilia. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong but you have a right to be wrong\u201d implies that they have a right to be a paedophile. We could go further and invoke neuroscientific reasons for such people\u2019s practices: Decreased activations were seen in the hypothalamus, dorsal midbrain, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right lateral parietal, right ventrolateral, and right occipital cortices, as well as in the left insula in 13 hetero- and homosexual forensic pedophiles when viewing sexual stimuli as compared to emotional stimuli as compared to teleiophiles (Walter et al., 2007). Based on these findings, it was suggested that the missing sexual interest toward adults could be explained by impairment in subcortical regions associated with the autonomic component of sexual arousal, i.e., lack of activation seen in hypothalamus and dorsal midbrain in pedophilia. Additionally, using a regression analysis approach, the activation in the left DLPFC was inversely correlated with the score on the child abuse subscale of the multiphasic sexual inventory (MSI), indicating also possible alterations of cognitive processing of sexual stimuli in these subjects (Schiffer et al., 2008a,b). The Neurobiology and Psychology of Pedophilia: Recent Advances and Challenges Now, to do so would be an abuse of science, but nevertheless there is a wealth of literature that does exactly this - creating reasons from case-control studies which imply \u2018people are the way they are because that\u2019s how they are\u2019. Such determinism removes all responsibility. For anything. Do paedophiles have a right to be paedophiles? Why not? We can suggest all sorts of public-good arguments, but all of those then begin to apply to all sorts of more protected scenarios. I, as a Christian, personally found the satirical discovery of the Christian Gene very helpful.  Do religious zealots have a right to be wrong? Do Totalitarians on both sides of the political spectrum have a right to be wrong? In a more potent example from history, do the Athenians have a right to be wrong in their dialogue with the Melians? The fact is that societies have standards. Contravention of those standards constitutes (among other possible designations) crimes. Societies by definition use the power of government to force cohesion and orthodoxy. It\u2019s literally why prisons exist. If we are to take the attitude that the right to be wrong is absolute then all corrective systems - from schools to supermaxes - are automatically corrupt. ",

These three questions would put - the correct side above the other. The playing field has to be fair. Then, we can discuss both sides. But when one side is totally bending the rules, cutting corners and even making the Department of Justice, which is supposed to be \u2018impartial\u2019, a puppet, what fairness and what rule of law? So, first we have to bring the fairness, honesty, ethics, rule of law, above that Democracy- \u201cA governance, for the people, by the people\u201d. Only after that, there is any fairness or point in discussing the baseline of two sides. When, the balance of Lady Justice is very slanted and there is no blindfold or above that not even her eyes, what baseline and what debate about right or wrong? As of now, Ethics has flown out of the window. If we are not careful and bring it back to truth, \u2018Democracy and rule of Law' also will follow! So, let us be very vigilant and aware!

Getting the government involved is contextual, certain decisions affect society as a whole, are necessarily made on the governmental level, and good government is responsive to the wishes of its people. What matters is how one chooses to deal with that disagreement: You can fight to promote a narrative or you can seek truth.You can seek to reinforce your beliefs or you can expand them.You can treat people who disagree as the enemy or as people who have a different understanding of how the world works and, as a result, make different predictions regarding the future impacts of various policies.You can obsess over ideological purity or you can search for overlap between opposing sides and, when that fails, \u201ctrade\u201d policies that are trivial to yourself and a big deal to someone else for policies that are a big deal to you and trivial to someone else.You can respond to people choosing the former path with despair\u2014a false choice between \u201cgiving in\u201d vs. matching their vices\u2014or by setting firm boundaries while also holding the door open for a more healthy relationship in the future.You can be consumed by hate for the things you wish to destroy or you can work to create the world you want.",
