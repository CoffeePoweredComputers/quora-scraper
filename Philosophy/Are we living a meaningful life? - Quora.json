            "answer_text": "Are we living a meaningful life? Yes. Every life we have is meaningful, whether we believe that or not. Why do I say that? Because the only mission or meaning we have here on Earth is to live and to experience. That\u2019s it. Nothing more. So we can\u2019t fail. We can\u2019t not have meaning! (Apologies for the double-negative.) In my own case, my meaning also comes from my nearly-exclusive focus (outside my family) on becoming more present. I\u2019ve been focusing on this for almost 17 years now and still have a ways to go. I may never make it. But the process is rewarding by itself and is \u2014 very slowly \u2014 making my life better by the day. I\u2019d encourage others to do this too, if you\u2019re drawn to it, but it\u2019s not easy and, honestly, the first and single most important step is very simple\u2026 That step is learning to breathe properly. I\u2019ve posted many descriptions of how to breathe here on Quora and I invite you to read through them. Once you learn to breathe properly, and you start breathing that way daily, the rest becomes possible. B. ",

I love humanity especially young people because they don\u2019t have all the answers they think they do so being able to teach them is always a plus. I didn\u2019t have the answers I was seeking and I needed when I was younger so they have a soft spot in my heart because they are so young and have a whole life ahead of them to have experiences and learn. They need tools and I think me talking to them and advising them is me fulfilling purpose. I have pages of poetry where I share my thoughts and poems with the world and I truly believe that my words help many. This world needs an overhaul!! ",

            "answer_text": "Life is the summit of the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago. We are the imperfect rendering of Chaos into order. We are stardust. I believe we have a destiny when it comes to the universe, to play our small part in making it a better place- more ordered, more predictable and safer for life. It also includes beauty and love. Love begets more life. You are composed of the remnants of exploded stars billions of years ago and billions of light years away. For the briefest of moments- far briefer than flash from a lightning bug- you grow up, find love reproduce and die. Your stardust is returned to the universe. \"If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed. The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge. - Albert Einstein ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very nice question. In this case, it looks like you use this word \u201cmeaningful\u201d in the sense of satisfaction obtained. As opposed to a more literal sense which implies the kind of meaning that symbols have, you know, this means that, but I feel confident that isn\u2019t what you mean (sorry). It\u2019s not a remarkable life from what I understand is the common measure for that, great fame, great wealth, great contribution to the welfare of mankind material or artistic. It\u2019s just another life, filled to the brim with moments of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and a lot of neither. But there is one thing I might be able to convey, in words of all things, about this life, which is, it is probably a lot like yours in most meaningful ways, so if you were to just take a minute every day to look into yourself, sooner or later you should obtain a meaningful answer to your question.

Most of our actions are based on our future or our family and society. It makes our lives mechanical and lifeless. For example, a girl wants to join military... And their parents and society doesn't accept it as it's not safe. She becomes a completely different person. In my opinion it's definitely meaningless life. ",
