            "answer_text": "Yep. You can\u2019t write a program that can tell whether another program will stop or carry on forever. This is called the Halting Problem. Here\u2019s a nice video which explains why:  Although the proof of the uncomputability of the Halting Problem is often attributed to Turing, his proof was more general (in a way): he showed that a general computing device will always have some problem it can\u2019t solve (Church did this too, slightly earlier, but Turing\u2019s proof had deeper repercussions and is a bit easier to understand).

This does not give you the ability to effectively compute all your life decisions for you, unless it was supplied with all the data and an algorithm existed that allowed you to tell it how to compute the result, and that the computer have useful input/output capability for your problems.
