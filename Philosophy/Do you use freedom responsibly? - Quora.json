            "answer_text": "Mayyyybe? I support my (poly, extended) family. I provide new ideas and inventions to the world. I participate in various community activities (like this one.) A few decades ago I helped save some lives at sea. I invested in a good education for myself and my loved ones. I\u2019m not perfect. I chase women. I make foolish choices. I support Libertarians. I \u2019m politically incorrect. Responsibility sort of (to me) implies meaning. Meaning is personal. It never lands on you (although sometimes responsibility seems to.) That means responsibility is individually defined. At least as I see it. And establishing meaning is perhaps the greatest responsibility one can shoulder. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Freedom of speech has always been important to me, and freedom of assembly is rather new for me, but I like it. Freedom from religion is a good one, although Walmart has been selling Christmas trees for several weeks now (glad I won't give the Waltons any of my money - I don't get to see them in the stores.) I take my freedoms very seriously. ",
