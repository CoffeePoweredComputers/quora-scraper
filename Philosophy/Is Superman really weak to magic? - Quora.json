            "answer_text": "This is a very long held misconception regarding the man of steel. He is not \u201cweak\u201d against magic he is merely as vulnerable to it as everybody else. *Warning graphic content and images below* The best way i have heard it described (in canon no less) is thus. Superman and Wonderwoman face off, On the face of it the pair trade blows, sadly Diana is overcome by Clarks massive strength advantage suffering a broken wrist and concussion, but she has a trump card in the form of her magically empowered weapons.With her lariat she can restrain Clark as she could any other man, the rope is empowered and despite Clarks massive strength he cannot break it any more than a mortal could snap a strong braided rope the magic within the antithesis to his alien biology. Regardless she cant keep the maddened Kryptonian bound forever she draws her sword and prepares to strike\u2026 \u2026but knowing that Clark is still a good man she cant bring herself to take the killing blow knowing that the magaical blade will cut through his flesh the same way it would cut through her own or any other being, tossing the weapon aside she looks to the man controlling her fiend and makes a decision, momentarily freeing the mad Kryptonian she wraps the golden rope around the being using her friend like a weapon and asks him to stop, demanding to know what will free Clark from the control this man has him under.He claims he will never stop, the only way is to kill him and with that begins the assault anew having Clark charge Diana\u2026  \u2026taking the tiara from her head knowing it is empowered with the same magic as her blade and sharpened to a keen edge she tosses it more swiftly than any bullet aimed at the neck and throat of one of her closest friends knowing that it will cut him as keenly as it would cut any being and praying to the gods that the sun will allow him to heal once she does what needs to be done\u2026  ..a flash of gold, a spurt of crimson and the man of steel clutches at the ruby fountain erupting from his neck momentarily stunned\u2026  \u2026before a sickening wet crack fills the room followed by the slump of as mans corpse lands heavily upon the floor.  You see Diana knew that despite Clarks known vulnerability to magic even a large cut would heal as soon as whatever caused it was removed from the wound.Consider this for a moment in the form of two razors, both are magically enhanced to never dull and Diana presents them to both Clark (superman) and Bruce (Batman) as gifts. Despite the fact that one is a mortal man and the other is capable of cracking the planet in two both can shave with the razors because the magic within will not allow the blade to dull both men end up clean-shaven with a few minor nicks because shaving sucks\u2026 ..the difference is once the blade is no longer being used a moment of sunlight causes Clarks nicks to heal instantly and Bruce is left to use small pieces of toilet paper and some aftershave. Now I will point out that there are some points when the magicly empowered Diana has used her inherent mystical gifts to bypass Clarks incredible durability (such as when in the presense of one of the Greek gods) allowing her to hit him in the same way a unpowered (highly skilled warrior) human woman could strike against and unpowered human(oid) male\u2026  \u2026The results are unsuprising and Clark did NOT have a good day but once again as soon as he got away from her and into the sunlight he healed up pretty quickly. lesson of the day, do not annoy Diana Prince.

            "answer_text": "One of the posters below put a lot of effort into demonstrating Superman\u2019s weakness to magic, including a lot of scans. It is a difficult thing to refute - Superman does have a \u201cweakness\u201d to magic, relative to, say, fire, electricity, telepathy, blunt force trauma, etc. It really comes down to how you define \u201cweakness.\u201d Do you have a weakness to fire? On one hand, sure - you\u2019re human and fire will kill you. But that\u2019s not typically what you think of when you speculate on what your weaknesses are. What you typically think of as a weakness are things that negatively affect you that don\u2019t negatively affect most of your peers. For example, you may have a weakness for Australian volleyball players. If you meet one s/he may have unusual power over you and convince you to do things you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do, because they\u2019re just so damn hot\u2026and that accent. Mmmm. Uh\u2026anyway\u2026THAT is a weakness, because it is specific and uncommon. Australian volleyball players ARE hot, but they don\u2019t typically have as much influence over the average person as they do you. You want to know another great example of a weakness? Kryptonite. Why? Because Kryptonite affects Superman in a way that it doesn\u2019t affect most of his peers. If you put the JLA in a room full of Kryptonite, only one person is going to pass out and eventually die - Superman. That\u2019s a weakness. Now let\u2019s talk about magic for a second here. The poster below gave some incredible examples of Superman being hurt by magic. So, if we think about it the way we think that \u201cfire is your weakness\u201d, then yes - magic is a weakness for Superman. But if you were to put the JLA in a room full of magic KO gas, anybody who didn\u2019t have a specific defense against magic would be knocked out, not just Superman. Batman would go, Flash would go, Martian Manhunter would go, Aquaman would go. Green Lantern is iffy. Wonder Woman would be fine because she is specifically fortified against magic. So if an attack is successful in taking out most of the league in addition to Superman, should it be considered a Superman weakness? Do we say that magic Batman\u2019s weakness? Is it Martian Manhunter\u2019s weakness? They\u2019ve been hurt by it too, plenty of times. And yet, when we list Martian Manhunter\u2019s weakness, we only ever list fire, not magic. Martian Manhunter hasn\u2019t shown greater resistance against magic-based attacks than Superman. That\u2019s the thing we have to consider here. In most of those scans posted below, if we were to substitute Martian Manhunter or Lobo or Gladiator or Hyperion with Superman, would they have been unaffected where Superman would have been laid low? I don\u2019t see the evidence of that. Still, I think that\u2019s mainly arguing semantics. Whether you consider magic a weakness for Superman in the \u201cit\u2019s also a weakness for most people\u201d sense or in the \u201cit\u2019s not a weakness, he\u2019s just not as invulnerable\u201d sense, if you\u2019re going to build an anti-Superman team, you\u2019ll probably want a mage or two! Make of that what you will. ",
