There are no multiple souls, just one.Take an empty ground you can build many rooms, you can name them all, you can decorate them each in different way,   but if you break all the walls, remove all decorations, attributes, what remains is just one emptiness.As a small room you always want to get bigger, you always seek the source and one day you will break your wall and realize you were never a room always been that emptiness within that room and outside of it.And there is no outside or inside anymore.

            "answer_text": "As Kris Iyer replied, the same soul is present EVERYWHERE, but in a body there is localized consciousness because of it. This consciousness knows itself as say \u201cAshish\u201d in my case, and is also called Ego and expressed as \u201cI\u201d. When this consciousness knows that it is not only a localized \u201cI\u201d but an omnipresent soul, we call that conscious entity as enlightened. That localized perception of self as \u201cI\u201d limited to a body is broken as one sees/realizes His/Her omnipresence\u2026 ",
