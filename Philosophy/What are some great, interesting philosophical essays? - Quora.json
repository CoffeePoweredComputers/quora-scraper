            "answer_text": "I like Isiaih Berlin\u2019s: Two Concepts of Liberty It\u2019s an amazing essay about the idea of \u201cfreedom\u201d that everyone likes to claim as the highest value but most people have a very murky idea of what it actually means. Although the essay\u2019s title claims two concepts of liberty, in reality you get a bonus and he throws in two more concepts of liberty for a sum total of four. And all this is done by a writer and thinker of the highest caliber. Deals don\u2019t come better than that. ",
