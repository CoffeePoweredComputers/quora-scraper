            "answer_text": "Of course. That is done during an execution by lethal injection. When done right, the first medication will get the person asleep (exactly the same way you go asleep during a general anesthetic) and the other 2 medications will get your heart to stop beating. In a non-lethal execution scenario, carbon monoxide poisoning comes to mind as you just fall asleep and never wake up. Also, any major injury to the brainstem like a shotgun or large caliber bullet will take care of that. ",

A person will die painlessly but... If he/she is lucky enough to survive, he/she will wake up with a very painful headache. I'm telling this to tell you it's possible but please do not kill anyone. =) ",
