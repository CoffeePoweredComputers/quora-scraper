            "answer_text": "Which should I believe in, luck or faith? Blessings in this life and salvation in the afterlife depends on faith (not on luck) God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God has enabled people to choose their own destinations. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Jesus taught that when we obey God and do good works; we will pass the test of this world and will become qualified to receive God\u2019s rewards in heaven In Matt 5:13-16, Jesus taught that the believers should act as the salt to protect against corruption and as a light to guide others to the truth The same is also written in mark 9:50 and Luke 14:34-35 Qur\u2019an 7:96 And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah, We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning.\" Qur\u2019an 30:41 teaches that Evil and the curses are the results of disobedience. Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free.

            "answer_text": "It is like this. What will you choose: accept a promise along with your cooperation and obediemce or just do things your way, undirected, by chance or randomly? Faith and luck can be compared to that of a promise and to do things our way, randomly or undirected\u2026.. When we accept a promise, we will wait for it, no matter how long will it take. We will also trust, be cooperative and obedient to the person who give that promise. It is like accepting a contract with detailed benefits to received at a specifc time when it matures.. We expect/ hope to such thing to be realized in the near future though unseen while keep doing the things to be done Faith is like that. Hebrews11:1 Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen. What about luck? Luck is undirected, random like gambling. Nothing and no one promise of anything, not even to expect any or hold any tangent items you can keep for good. Luck is non-negotiable, yet most people hold that for some reasons; some for easy gain, some seemed to have no choice or been pressured and others. The book of Isaiah warned though that states; \u201c But you are among those forsaking Jehovah,Those forgetting my holy mountain,Those setting a table for the god of Good Luck,And those filling up cups of mixed wine for the god of Destiny\u201d-. Isaiah 65:11 Having some insights of these, both will not decide, but the person itself. To cultivate faith in. God through personal reading of the. Holy writings or to believe in a wish of luck from the lips of our fellowmen. The choice\u2026.. Is ours to make not faith or luck. Have a wonderful and safe day. ",

            "answer_text": "Faith, or luck? As a formerly religious person, I have seen many people of faith whose faith sustained them in hard times\u2026but I have also seen the effects of their faith that are not so positive\u2014for example, depression, religious wars, discrimination, and so on. I\u2019d recommend you stay away from religion and \u201cfaith\u201d in particular gods. As for luck, I don\u2019t admit the existence of any such thing if by that we mean that some people carry within themselves something, whether positive or negative, that somehow allows the universe to give them positive or negative things that they have done nothing to merit. Rather, I find it helpful to think of the concept of chance. That is, there is an element of arbitrary randomness to the universe. There are, of course, the laws of nature, and furthermore, we can see that quite often, hard work, careful planning and investing and so on can produce positive results in life. But quite often, people are trapped in poverty with no way out. Now, let\u2019s say one such person somehow meets a wealthy person, who falls in love with them, marries them, and makes them rich. What happened to them was not \u201cluck,\u201d it was a combination of blind chance, together with their personality and their choices that combined together with the personality and choices of the wealthy person to produce a (supposedly) happy outcome. But for every person who rises from the lower classes to become wealthy, whether by marriage or through business or work, there are many tens of thousands who never will have such opportunities\u2014not because they are less hard-working, or less intelligent, or even lesser planners\u2014but simply because they haven\u2019t been favoured by arbitrary chance. I use the word \u201cfavoured\u201d because it is convenient to speak this way, and not because I see chance as a force in itself, much less one that can be personified (except in poetry!). In short, I don\u2019t believe in luck at all, although I still find it helpful to say things like \u201cgood luck!\u201d What I am really saying when I use this expression is: \u201cI hope you will do well and experience a happy outcome.\u201d Saying \u201cgood luck,\u201d though, is much easier and more efficient! Similarly, saying \u201cthey\u2019re lucky\u201d is shorthand for saying \u201cthey have experienced happiness as a result of arbitrary, random chance.\u201d To sum up: I do not believe in religion or in fate, or luck, or any such similar concept. But I do believe in keeping a positive attitude and making positive choices amidst the random chances that we experience in our lives. And when enough people make positive choices together, they are more likely to experience happiness and wellness. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither. What is luck? It is nothing. It is not a power, substance or person. So when you \u201cbelieve\u201d in luck, you are believing in nothingness. What is faith? To help you understand what faith is, I suggest you read Hebrews chapter 11. It starts out with (ESV): Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.For by it the people of old received their commendation.By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.Believing in faith, in and of itself, is fruitless. Believing in the One that can and will deliver to you what is best for you is what faith is. Trusting in God is faith. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that he is some genie in a bottle that will bow to your every wish. Why? He truly loves you, and will always do what is best for you. Even though we think so, we don\u2019t always know what is best for us. To illustrate, let me tell you a quick story about my firstborn son: When he was a toddler, he crawled into the kitchen and saw me cutting vegetables with a long, shiny knife. He crawled over to the counter in which I was cutting, and pulled himself up, trying to reach the counter. I thought originally he wanted a veggie, so I gave him small one. He threw it on the floor. So I continued cutting the veggies, and he kept insisting he wanted a veggie. So I chose a different kind, and again, he threw it on the floor. When I went to pick it up, I left the knife on the counter (out of reach), and I noticed it was the knife he wanted! When I told him, no, it would cut him, he threw himself on the floor and cried. I obviously knew that the knife was no good for him. As a loving father, there is no way I would give him the knife. To him, he just saw a large, shiny object, and he thought it was good for him. As Jesus said, \u201cAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!\u201d Matthew 7:7\u201311 ESV So believe in the One that can and will save you, if you choose to believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, and rose again on the third day. That is faith. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither. Both are myths and thus outside of your control or influence. Take control of your self/mind and your behaviour because THOSE are the only things anyone can exercise any control over. Neither does \u2018arbitrary randomness\u2019 explain anything as that is an attribute that you have assigned to the entire universe or all the multiples of universes that we have barely identified. That attribute implies intent and cannot possibly be within our knowledge. Science has never come up with anything in its long history that can be called \u2018arbitrary randomness\u2019. It has, however, come up with tiny bits of explanatory phenomena and will continue to do so, self-correcting along the way. The rest of your thesis appears to seek out an empathetic explanation of others\u2019 circumstances. There lies folly. You cannot possibly come up with any explanation of another\u2019s circumstance since you do not live them or are them. You seek to understand that which you cannot understand. As if somehow if you could account for another\u2019s situation, you will have an external explanation for it. Why? People are different in all things including intelligence, genetics, emotional control, physiology, upbringing, resources, etc. All of these and more circumstances contribute to different outcomes in individual lives. To think otherwise is to fail to take responsibility for oneself and to put the responsibility for one\u2019s choices squarely where it belongs - on them and their unique circumstances. We are not created equal, period. If we were we would all have the same or at least similar outcomes in life. None of that has anything to do with luck or faith. ",

Faith is important. Faith can be blind faith, for instance faith in God. No-one I know can prove or disprove the existence of one or more Gods. I see no reason in my existence without human values and virtues which all come from Messengers who claim to speak for God, who have attempted to guide us throughout human history. They caused humanity to progress, though not to the extent it would have progressed if their teachings had been more widely accepted and practiced, particularly by clerics, who have been more interested in their own privileged positions, than evaluating later Messengers. What do I see for the future? Most scripture foretells a world society of love justice and unity, but the world condition suggests it will not be soon. Our primary concern, at all levels, including our personal goals and the goals of government should be to bring about that heaven on Earth. Most of us will expire well before this happens but will grow spiritually as we spread unity and justice and become better prepared, fulfilling our purpose to be ready for the spiritual worlds to come.

Or, results are reliant upon a nebulous concept that an ill-defined Fate will select in ones favor. Neither of these are reliable concepts. Faith is trust placed in anothers actions on ones behalf. Trust is an essential ingredient for successful beneficial social transactions. A society cannot survive if its missing. Economics depends upon trust. In short, civilization (assuming we want one) depends upon it. ",
