            "answer_text": "Materialism posits that nothing exists except physical matter. No, it doesn\u2019t. Consider a baseball game, jet flight, Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony, the Windows Operating System, or American citizenship. All of these things exist, none is a physical object or made of physical matter, yet their existence does not refute materialism: Materialism - Wikipedia Materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that Matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental aspects and consciousness, are results of material interactions. Consciousness, among other things, is immaterial Not in a sense that refutes materialism. It is no more immaterial than the Windows Operating system. thus cannot be seen or measured physically Sure it can. We know that other people are conscious through observation. And not only the presence or absence of consciousness but to a considerable degree the contents of consciousness can be observed via fMRI scans, and can be manipulated via electrical probes. There is overwhelming evidence that consciousness is a product of physical brains. so it's either consciousness does not exist, or materialism is false. Which is it? Well, you already claimed that consciousnessness is \u201cimmaterial\u201d \u2026 but all you have is a circular argument. If materialism is valid, then consciousness is necessarily not immaterial in the sense that would contradict materialism. and considering all the other \u201cimmaterial\u201d things, like the rules of chess, the proof that the bisectors of the angles of a triangle meet a point, the boiling point of water (or any other number), etc., it\u2019s special pleading to single out consciousness.

            "answer_text": "\u201c\u2026nothing exists except \u2026 \u201c what does that mean? Take for example a colour that we perceive eg red - we see it- does it exist? We know that light energy with a particular wavelength (700\u2013635) nm is detected by the cones in the fovea of the eye and we somehow convert that to a perceived experience in our minds - I describe this experience - which is entirely in my mind - as seeing the colour red. What happens in my mind need not be the same as in your mind and even if we see the same object which happens to be red and we agree its red - the internal perception of that colour can be unique to each observer. Such internal perceptions are called qualia by the philosophers. Does red exist? does every observer see a different red? all we can say is that we can agree the label red by means of shared experiences but accept that we can never know another observers perception of seeing red. Can I now say that red is false or should it be true? Consciousness is in the same vein \u2026 if we call it a property and not a thing\u2026 for example the number of legs on a table might be four so leggedness of tables is a property and it can be described and agreed in shared experience. Energy is a property we can account for it, descibe its consequences but it has no material form (eg the light and sound of a spark is a consequence of changes in energy) . You offer an either /or in choices both being couched in terms of either existence or truth - but what about all of the other possibilities particularly the ones with no names yet\u2026? Langauge/text and even logic are also suspect as they are invented and so need not be real. The real nature of proof is observation and consistency and even that might change \u2026 we just dont know when. ",
