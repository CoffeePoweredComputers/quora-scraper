            "answer_text": "It has exceptions. Like eating dead people. In general, it\u2019s sick as in you\u2019ll get sick. On the other hand, if you are stranded in a plane crash you have to eat something. So it takes a little thinking about the context. In general, eating dead people isn\u2019t really a sound practice. When in the plane crash, it would be moral to feed others the dead body to keep them alive. Here you have a virtue of life. Life is more important in this context than the immorality of eating the dead. You have to look at the constraints that people had to deal with in valuing one virtue over another. We have to weigh all our virtues and it gets kinda relative (the people are relative not the morals) but some morals trump other morals in context. It doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t exceptions to a moral, but it also doesn\u2019t mean the moral has no reason and is relative. It\u2019s a way to conduct yourself. How about what the British did to American that caused the American Revolution. In absolute terms, freedom was way more important than paying taxes that they\u2019d never see. So breaking the British law was more valuable. Ask, \u201cAt what cost?\u201d Is it moral to kill someone\u2026 generally no, but if they are a serial killer and doesn\u2019t want to stop and wont stop\u2026 you are constrained and need to value the greater good over that person. It\u2019d be immoral not to act. Morals are tentative. Just like truth is. It\u2019s a human element though, so it\u2019s not an exact science, yet anyway. Would you kill a baby if it\u2019s crying will get the group killed? I mean the baby will be dead either way\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The God who created people has empowered them with original gifts; the gifts of minds, intelligence, and the conscience are internal personal Prophets for each human to guide him to the basic measures of the good things to do and the bad things to avoid People who never heard of Prophets are not forsaken because God has equipped them by internal prophets and they will be guided to the wisdom by their original gifts The person can have morality based on the gifts of reason and conscience if he likes for others what he likes for himself (applying the golden rule) The person becomes immoral when he does not make use of the gift of conscience and allow himself to be wicked and unjust. We have not created the gifts of conscience and reason. Morality and good deeds are not enough for salvation; salvation requires obedience and repentance in addition to the good deeds. We should remember that the true religion teachings will not change Feeding the hungry is a virtue as taught by all prophets and it will remain so until heaven and earth pass away Defending the oppressed is a virtue as taught by all prophets and it will remain so until heaven and earth pass away Self-constraints, patience, and resisting temptations are virtues, and will remain so until heaven and earth pass away Abortion is a sin because it means killing an innocent soul and it will remain as a sin until heaven and earth pass away Homosexuality is a sin as taught by all prophets Premarital sex is a sin as taught by all prophets Sex outside marriage is a sin as taught by all prophets and it will remain as a sin until heaven and earth pass away Creation of male and female is one of the signs of God; marriage is the recommended relationship between male and female. Qur\u2019an 30:21 \u2018And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who think\u2019 The common ground of all religions and all different sources of wisdom is \u2018the golden rule\u2019 What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others. Confucius Do not do unto others whatever is injurious to yourself. \u2013 Zoroaster, Shayast-na-Shayast 13.29 \u201cDo not do to others what angers you if done to you by others.\u201d - Socrates \"What thou avoidest suffering thyself seek not to impose on others.\"\u2014 Epictetus (55-135) \"Do not do to others what would anger you if done to you by others.\" \u2013 Isocrates Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor cause another to kill \u2013 Buddha One who, while himself seeking happiness, oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness, will not attain happiness hereafter. \u2013 Buddha, Dhammapeada, 10 \u201cResolve to be tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and wrong. Sometime in your life, you will have been all of these.\u201d Gautama Buddha No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path \u2015 Gautama Buddha, Sayings Of Buddha \u201cRemember always that you are just a visitor here, a traveler passing through. Your stay is but short and the moment of your departure unknown.\u201d Dhammavadaka \u201cIt is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways.\u201d  \u2015 Gautama Buddha Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule Buddha One should never do that to another which one regards as injurious to one\u2019s own self. This, in brief, is the rule of dharma. Other behaviour is due to selfish desires. \u2013 Brihaspati, Mahabharata. Hinduism Analysis of those teachings show that they are similar to the prophet\u2019s teachings, similar spiritual fruits from similar gardens watered by the same spring, inspired and gifted by the same great creator He who sows the ground with care and diligence acquires a greater stock of religious merit than he could gain by the repetition of ten thousand prayers Zoroaster (c.628 - c.551) It is o.k. to question the purpose of life; that is a wise thing to do. What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? \u201cIt is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day...for the unexamined life is not worth living\u201d - Socrates ",
