            "answer_text": "No, you cannot know. There is absolutely no golden rule which helps you make the right decisions all the time. The only way to find out is to actually make a decision and see how it turns out. Life always goes on by taking risks. You cannot avoid this risk in life and there is no way out. However, there is one trick which you can follow. You can make an informed decision. The best you can do is to predict the consequences and then judge for yourself. The first step is understand that decisions are based on what you know at the moment of making the decisions.  Here are certain things I do for informed decision making -  Note down exactly what the decision is. Form a question in your mind with limited choices and pose this as a question. \"Should I accept this job, or should I not?\"; \"Should I break-up with him, or should I not?\"; \"Should I buy this phone, or should I not?\" It is important to know exactly what decision you need to make. Don't leave open ended questions like \"I like her but I wonder if she is the right girl\"; \"This job is nice, but wouldn't it be better if I had more money!\"Write the consequences of both sides. Understand the implications correctly. Have a thorough clarity of all the aspects of both the choices. It is important to understand that decisions in life are based on the given information. Hence, if you take time to understand the implications and give it a thought, you are more likely to make the correct choice.Make a decision by picking one. This is the most critical thing. We must understand that we cannot have everything and that life is essentially a compromise. Choose one over the other based on the information available to you. Make a rational decision based on your experience, knowledge, impulse, wit - anything you prefer. But remember - choose one.Don't mull over a decision once made. If you have decided something, stick with it until new information is available. This is a very critical thing to understand. As long as you have made a decision, don't keep thinking about it if the information has not changed. There is no point going over and over again \"Have I done the right thing?\"If the information has changed, revisit the decision. When you come to face with a new information (such as a better job than earlier, or a clarification of a doubt etc.), then you can revisit your decision and see if it makes sense to do something differently. Remember that this is now a new decision altogether.Have no regrets if you fail. In spite of whatever we discussed above, it is likely that a decision may not turn out as good as you thought. Don't worry. Take satisfaction in the fact that you did the best you could do at the given point in time. With a benefit of hindsight, everybody can say if a decision was right or wrong - but that's meaningless because making a decision is about at the moment of deciding.  The basic thing to understand is that all decisions are at a particular point in time and with a given information. If any of this changes, it is possible that the decision would have been different. However, the next time you think back and realise you made a wrong decision, always ask yourself \"Was this the best I could have done at that time and with the information I had then\" If yes, you've made the correct decision. No need to regret it.  This is how life is - full of decisions. Over time, you get better at it and ultimately you have a knack of making the correct decisions. But this will happen with experience. However, the basic essense of decision making will not change.   Notice that I always say decision making and never decision taking. The reason is because an informed decision is always constructed by the person deciding it (a decision is made), and not borrowed or copied from some other person (a decision is not taken).  But whatever, the point being - make your own decisions; and accept them with grace.    ",

            "answer_text": "That which makes the soul feel good is right, and that which makes the soul feel bad is wrong. But then, a bad person may feel good doing wrong.  Therefore, the 'feeling' good or bad on a superficial level, is not what is meant by 'soul feeling'. What it really means is that on a deeper level, whenever you do wrong, you would feel bad. And when you do right, you will feel good.  You are the judge and the jury of your deeds and thoughts. So, unless you are a wacko and a nutcase, at heart, within the soul you would know the correctness or the incorrectness of your doings, and thinking.  Again, we all know killing is wrong. Yet, many a culture and cult teach killing people of another faith, and permits its people to kill animals, and eat them. And even feel good about it. Because their tradition or religion not treat it as a sin. On the other hand, it encourages them to do it. All in the name of their sky god, who though, metaphysically speaking, is not! Hence, one man's wrong maybe another man's right.  The only way to overcome this lacuna, is to correct one's screwed-up wacko ideas. Alternatively, gather the right knowledge.  Then again, one's inherited ideologies or theologies may be passing on the wrong ethical information - all in the name of a trumped up and a touted ancestral mad dog of a cultural god.  It's a vicious cycle. Wrong ethical values, passed on as right, over time, may make a people sadistic idiots.  Thus, doing wrong, a person may feel right. As say, the warped up wacko, Hitler, felt. He actually believed, and said so in Mein Kampf, his autobiography that \"I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.\"  Such wackos exist at all times. Therefore, to be right, and do right, one must have the right 'knowing'. And pray, what is the right knowledge? How does one get it? Well, metaphysically speaking, the Right Knowing stems from being established in the Absolute of All That Be. Yet, who knows the Absolute - the Alpha and the Omega!  The religious dogma of most of the religions of the past and present, is simply nuts. Thus, we have innumerable religious nuts at all times in history. Leading astray the already screwed-up nutcases, the ill situated human heads. Only by getting right what the sages of past did, awakened to 'It', humans can decide what is wrong or right. And the Awakened Ones tell us a simple truth. It is also, more or less being verified by modern scientific mavericks - that Whatsoever Is, a single Immanent Indivisibility and Unity is.  Thus, we are all one universality.  In short, the other whom we may do wrong to or against, is quintessentially our very own self. On a quantum level, we are all One sans a second. It is not a figure of speech, but a metaphysical truth and reality few reach. Who understand this Oneness and Unity of the Cosmos - of each and everyone of us - learn to live accordingly. They hurt not another being. They hesitate to do wrong. Not even to the 'lower' things, like the animals. As also to the environment etc., the insentient things and matter, they do right.  To them hurting another earthling or the earth, is but hurting their own self.  They are the closest to what could be termed a perfect thing. We must all aim to get 'That', which, reveals to us and makes us not different, but in essence one with each other, as too with everything. From 'It', right 'knowing', we shall at all times do the right thing. ~_~  ",

            "answer_text": "The determination of right and wrong is the source of all conflicts in the world. What is right for one person is wrong for another person. Your concept of right and wrong depends on who you are. 1: Philospher According to the perspective of a philosopher, there is nothing right in this world. Everything is relative. The concept of right and wrong is human creation that changes with time and space. What is right for one person may be wrong for another person. Hence, there is nothing like universally truth in this world. 2: Politician According to the perspective of a politician, the world is clearly divided into black and white; right and wrong. What is done by him or his party is always right while what is done by the opposite party is always wrong. 3: Spiritual Person A spiritual person believes that there is nothing wrong in this world because everything happens in this world according to the will of God, who can do no wrong. There is always a right hidden in every thing what people perceive as wrong. 4: Believer A religion person believes in his God and his religion. According to him what is written in his Scripture is right and everything else is wrong. 5: Secular Person In the eyes of the modern secular people, everything that is described as right in the law is right and what is described in law as wrong is wrong. Their sense of right and wrong flows from the law books. If the law is changed by the government, they change their conviction. While there is nothing which can be said to be universally right or universally wrong, we must develop our own self of right and wrong based on our culture, transitions, laws and profession. A man who have no sense of right or wrong not only is confused himself but also confuses everyone. Please read this story. Mulla Nasruddin was sitting as Judge. A case was brought-up for hearing. \u2018You are right,\u2019 said Nasruddin after hearing one side. \u2018You are right,\u2019 he said after hearing the other side. \u2018But both cannot be right,\u2019 said a member of public sitting in the audience. \u2018You are also right,\u2019 said Nasruddin. We can\u2019t afford to be Mulla in real world. We have to take sides and decide what is right and what is wrong for us and for the world.

            "answer_text": "There is only one way we can know whether we\u2019re making the right decision. It is by trusting ourselves (our intuition/ gut feeling, our knowledge/ data, our values and our priorities). I think it\u2019s very important that we understand the difference between knowing whether we\u2019re making the right decision (we can\u2019t know the outcome so we have to find a different way to evaluate our move) and knowing whether we made the right decision (when we tend to judge our actions based on the outcomes they produce). The question is not How will I know that I made the right decision? (looking back on the situation), but How will I know that I\u2019m making the right decision? (while making it). This distinction is super important because analyzing things looking back on them is usually not the same as pondering our move at the very time when we\u2019re making this move. If we want to base our judgement on the outcome, it\u2019s pretty obvious that we can do it only after the action has been taken (and sometimes we have to wait quite a long time). There is no way we can predict/ know in advance whether our actions (which follow our decisions) are the ones which will produce the favorable outcomes. I mean, sometimes we can (when it\u2019s not very complicated), but important life situations tend to be more complex. We can do something thinking that we are making the right decision but it can turn out later that there was something we didn\u2019t take into account, some important data. We simply overlooked it (because we were biased) or we couldn\u2019t possibly have known about it (the circumstances have changed). And even when we look at the outcome immediately after we made the decision and we conclude that is wasn\u2019t the right decision (because the outcome is undesirable), it may happen that a day/ week/ month / year, or even years, later we will change our mind and think about this decision differently. For instance, we will see how this seemingly wrong decision actually led to a whole avalanche of desirable things that happened later. Or that the decision which appeared to be right at the first glance proved wrong/ fatal when we looked at the bigger picture later. So paradoxically, it\u2019s much easier actually to know whether we\u2019re making the right decision (when we can\u2019t possibly know the outcome and thus we have to evaluate our move regardless of the outcome), than it is to know whether we made the right decision (looking back and trying to evaluate the decision based on the outcome). In order to know whether we\u2019re making the right decision all we need to do is trust ourselves (our intuition/ gut feeling, our knowledge/ data, our values and our priorities). And to find out whether we made the right decision sometimes we need to wait many years, because our initial evaluation/ conclusion may be premature. So it might be a good idea (healthy way of looking at our actions) to evaluate each our decision (the one we\u2019re making right now, as well as the one we made in the past) the way we\u2019d evaluate a decision at the very time when it is being made.

            "answer_text": "Great question! Some really great answers given already, so my two-pence might be redundant or repetitive. A great challenge demands for great players. Often we do not know what the future will bring. How do you know if you have made a bad decision? Usually, we get upset upon making wrong turns. But should we rely on our emotions? Remember the times when feeling good did not result in a positive outcome. So who knows better than you, if decision X is right or wrong? The right decision will be meaningful to you and your family, and maybe even society at large, today and day after. (borrowed from Jordan Peterson\u2019s book \u201c12 rules for life\u201d - helped me with my decision making for sure). Think about your values. Here is an example: sharing food with a starving person on the street can be seen as right (helping ones in trouble) and wrong (you are not helping them to be independent), also it can be ignored totally. For now, let us forget the ignorant ones, and concentrate only on good and bad cases. So, you have decided it is right to share food and you did. Who can take that moment of proud away from you? And will you act the same way next time? Sometime later, you have learned it was a wrong decision, while the homeless man you have shared food with was a thief, who went and stole something from you that night. So you caught the thief and now you recognize it was the same person who you shared your food with. What can you learn from that? Most probably you will regret doing favors. And yes, the decision was wrong, but it was wrong to go to steal, rather than to share food with a hungry person. If you are alive and have learned something from your decision, then probably it was not a bad decision after all. After all, we are only humans, who can learn or not. And then you can think of millions of decisions people have made and their outcomes. Think of someone who decided to conform, instead of being themselves. Think of decisions: changing a job, moving to another country, finding career or education direction, setting personal goals. Some of them might be wrong, and we need those to understand the good ones. To conclude: Decisions help us discard the unnecessary options and to concentrate on the better options more efficiently. Deciding upon things that bring meaning and are consulted with your values should make it more stable, more real, more solid, and more lasting. I hope this helps, Kind regards, A. ",

            "answer_text": "I thought about this a lot last night. If a decision has a clear set of actions attached to it you can be certain you are fully responsible for anticipating the possible consequences. If a decision has a less obvious sequence of actions and less predictable range of consequences then you can only take responsibility for the end result, own it, and move on from there. A decision was \u201cwrong\u201d if you don't like where it took you or if it carried you somewhere you never imagined. Part of the fun of getting older is life becomes like Groundhog Day. Mostly repetitive but with opportunities to tweak and adjust things. So for example, trying a different route to work and home again, or making your coffee slightly differently, or buying a new jar of sauce you've never heard of for making dinner. The big stuff can become like our own personal moral code but even that should be flexible according to our needs. I gave up smoking for five solid years and then started again. I am very happy with both those decisions and believe each decision was correct for the context of each moment in my life. If a decision feels wrong, don't ignore it but don't beat yourself up over it. Just figure out your next steps. One of the most valuable church sermons I ever attended described our conscience like the dashboard of a car. Seatbelt light goes nuts, you fasten your belt. Oil light goes on, you plan a time to top up the oil. Radiator overheating? Fill that up and check for leaks. Or you can just smash all your dashboard lights with a hammer and drive until the car breaks down. ",

            "answer_text": "Unleess you are using a system, such as religion or ethics or law, the way to know is by being in your heart. Many people have difficulty with this, prefering to be and accustomed to being in their head, or their power center or emotional center. People who are in the survival center (base of the spine) for long are generally out of control. But, note that people who are living from their power center or chakra, are also not exactly in control,  as they are, as they all of necessity are, dependent upon external factors such as relationships (who is in control, who holds the purse strings, who is in the stronger negotiating position, ad infinitem). The same is true of the emotional/sexual center of consciousness. Live there, and you live dependent on external factors as they affect your emotions, and you see life in terms of emotions. There is no emotion that is independent of the environment or external factors. None. Same with people who are into control. Live there, and you see life and relationships in terms of \"power\" (so called, since it is illusory). Lose control, and most such people will of course, immediatel try to restore it. Lose it for long, and they become stressed, or simply more obsessed and doggedly determined to restore control, unless they opt to move into one of the upper chakras.  The chakras I described are the animal chakras - associated with instincts. For animals, breaking free of them is impossible unless they have experience of their heart, as many obviously do, especially through interaction with people. I am certain however, that dolphins, whales, and other marine mammals, as well as, interestingly enough, the octopus, judging by researcher's accounts of ctual play with their uh...subjects - hide and go seek and other games - are born with a heart chakra, or it is developed in the wild, independent of human loving contaact.   Dealing with situations from your heart charkra, located you know where - over the sternum or heart, is one way to become independent of one's environment, and will give you the true answers you seek. You can also become independent of the environment by being in your throat chakra (#5), your third eye (#6), or your crown (#7), which is the chakra of identity - with whom, or what, do you identify. However, from those chakras, you peceive yourself and the world from a perspective other than the heart. The third eye has to do with clarity of perception, both worldly and more subtle (psychic). Your question sounds like you truly want to experience the truth of your heart. Do it, and if you are new to your heart chakra or seldom perceive yourself and the world from that chakra, you will find major positive changes occurring. ",

Until you are not involved in certain kind of life threatening event or you do something which comes under the legal circumstances, it is just an neutral action. And by the way all the actions you perform in your daily life is solely subjective. Whatever you are doing is just being done, once you label your actions as right or wrong then you fettered yourself in this concept. Try to understand this that there is a single lady who has nothing live on or anybody to rely on, now what she should do in the three of age. If she follow the morality and ethics of the society she won't be alive; now for her daily expenses of life she inters in the prostitution she is just doing for living by using her body. Now can you tell her that this is wrong. How you are going to convince her, it is not the matter of right or wrong it's just her own way for living. You are imposing the lebel of the right or wrong. No understand the subject on one hand you are there saying prostitution is wrong but it is right for her, on the other hand you are wrong in the subjective aspect of that lady because you are danger in her business. So this right or wrong business doesn't exist. There are only the existence happening on it's way we just jump in between and label on things. It depends on the country, culture, and time and things fall in its place. This is not a simple problem its huge disaster for the humanity in every aspect of life, you may see this corrupted idea of right or wrong which comes from our moral values, religious value, social, culture, and several codes of conduct. When you try to compare humanity with all this values by setting up a scale or method then every one will fail in some scale and once you change every one will pass. Now where is your concept of right or wrong. Its better you forget it and things happily without harming other people it is ok. If still you have some doubt take a journey around the world then come to any conclusion. It is fact that you won't be able to hold on to any sort of concept of right or wrong, good or bad. Ultimately what matters is life, concepts are just an illusion as for as life is concerned. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes there is no right or wrong. When you take a decision there are so many things which are not under your control. Sometimes the cards you get are decided by destiny. The key is never quit and always learn. Some more to the same question: There is no magic. You fail you learn, anywhere any field. Whether it's personal life or professional life. Your ability to take the right decision depends on how experience you are to take the decision. Let's say you are taking decision about choosing a life partner, probability of choosing right partner in the first go is very less. To choose the right partner you need to know what qualities you have to look for. The same goes while choosing the right profession, you need to have knowledge of the opportunities you have and the field of your interest, otherwise you will have a career path like Chetan Bhagat, I mean doing engineering and that later on realising what is your real passion. (although you can do that but if you want to be a writer just pick the pen and write.) That's why they say experience matters. Now, what if I have no experience but I have to take a decision right now only! This can be the case. In that case you can go and talk to someone who is experienced about your situation, make sure the person is trustworthy, not biased in opinion, non judgemental and open minded. As you haven't mentioned what kind of decisions you have to take I am taking some cases as follows: If you are choosing career you can make your own research on the Internet and youtube. Search about different field and what you actually learn in different courses available. You can also search for scholarships.If choosing a life partner then read the work of Gotman as he has done research over thousands of couples and have made conclusions worth reading. I tell you His work is awesome.If taking decision to some other problem then choose to share it with someone you trust or at least think will understand. Sometimes while being stuck in a problem we get overwhelmed and don't realise that our emotions are influencing our decisions, sharing with someone who can help you when you are emotionally not stable helps a lot.Have a great day :) ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There\u2019s no easy answer to this one. Some people are quite happy to follow for their whole lives whatever they were taught as children, especially in religious matters, never questioning any of it. They generally do very little harm unless they were taught harmful things as children (which does happen), so there\u2019s no reason why they shouldn\u2019t go on believing that what they were taught is right if it makes them happy. Others need to question everything, and we are the people who enjoy Quora and other discussion groups. There isn\u2019t really any absolute right and wrong when discussing ethics. Most cultures and religions have some version of the Golden Rule: Treat other people in the way that you would like them to treat you. This is what allows society to run smoothly; when it goes wrong, as it has lately in the US, the UK and some other countries, the society starts to break down and the people forming that society are unhappy. But it\u2019s still not an absolute in the sense that mathematical proofs are absolute; it\u2019s just a consensus opinion that seems to work. I guess the most practical guideline is: If it feels wrong, then it probably is wrong for you and you shouldn\u2019t do it. That has no bearing on what might be wrong for somebody else. In case the question changes, the one I answered was: \u201cHow do I really know if I'm right or wrong about some idea? Five years ago I was Muslim, I never thought twice about the validity of Islam, I was believing that I'm following the absolute truth, but if I did not challenge my belief, I'd have not ended up discovering that I was very wrong. How to know that I'm wrong about something if I believe it's right?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "We cannot. Defining something right or wrong literally means you are comparing, comparing with what your mind think what is right and what is wrong. But it does not ensures that whether you are right or wrong even at you base of comparison. Taking example of sex, for some community, sex before marriage is considered as a wrong doing and for some other communities, it is of mere significance. The difference is not of what is right or what is wrong, the difference is that what you think what is right and what is wrong. It is a relative phenomenon. Because it depends on us. But from your question it is certain that you are in the search of absolute truth, not the relative or dependant truth (what we call truth but not in actual case). Now your answer, For the word of absolute truth, we have no base to compare the action with. Because comparison literally means scaling it down to the relative truth(myth). Everybody has different versions of the truth. In real world, in absolute world, there is nothing like right and wrong. Something happens and if we just don't judge from a fixed prospective but from a wide view of life then only we will know that that happens just because it happened. There is not reason to give, life is then become a beautiful play of infinite force. Life will be blissful without judgement. You judge, you holds relative truth, relative truth is not truth at all, you will be pseudo, your life will be at misery.You just watch without judgement, you catch the absolute truth, you become real, you will be at bliss.Just get out of judgement and you'll see your answer coming from within and not from outside.My words might have no efficiency to deliver what is want to tell you, pardon my English. Truth must discover by self, not from others.  This was my one of the responses given to the similar kind of question earlier. ",

And what are these powers we utilize? There are steps to it: Thinking about ways to achieve this goalDeciding on the path to be taken for the sameExecute what we have decided to doWhen at the end of this process, we achieve what we set out to do, we feel we took the right decision. But, if we do not achieve this desired result, we start doubting ourselves and our choices or decisions. But remember: Even though we may not have achieved what we wanted, doubting our decisions is not the correct approach! If you had followed the three steps of decision-making, then you could not have done anything differently, even if the end result was not as desired. Sit and analyse the result you got through your decisions. it may so happen that things have turned out to be better that you had planned, but since you had your heart set on one thing, you were not able to comprehend the situation differently. It has been said that if you get what you want, then it\u2019s very good, but if you don\u2019t, then its even better. Because that way, you will get something that God wished for you. That doesn't mean that every decision you make is absolutely perfect, but things can be modified afterwards. Though after a period of time, you will realize that the decision you took was good for you. Be patient and positive to get the confirmation of this fact. Because when sometimes you don\u2019t achieve what you set out to but something different, that something different turns out to be better than you thought! ",

            "answer_text": "It can sometimes be tricky to know whether you made the right decision. Some questions you can ask are : Did you achieve the desired outcome by making the decision you made? This can be a good starting point, however, keep in mind their are some situations where the ends don\u2019t justify the means. Did anyone get hurt by the decision you made? If you hurt someone unnecessarily by the decision you made, it may not have been the right one. However, sometimes this can\u2019t be avoided. For instance, if you were in a relationship with someone who was bad for you and you made the decision to break up with them. This was probably the right decision even though the other person may have been hurt. Is the decision in line with your morals? How do you feel about the decision? You can\u2019t base everything off of feelings, but sometimes this can be a good question to ask. Being a christian, one thing that guides my decision making is the Bible. I try to make sure that the decisions I make are in line with my biblical values, and if they are not I know I did not make the right decision. However, the Bible isn\u2019t black and white about every decision and in these cases I try to go with my conscious. ",

But it doesn't mean you don't take your chances. And like Amy Poehler says in her Harvard Commencement speech: Listen. Say \"yes.\" Live in the moment. Make sure you play with people who have your back. Make big choices early and often. Don't start a scene where two people are talking about jumping out of a plane. Start the scene having already jumped. If you feel scared, hold someone's hand and look into their eyes. And when you feel brave, do the same thing. But I have a slightly different take on this. In my opinion, if no one is coming from the future to stop you from taking that decision, then how bad of a decision can it be. It's got to be the right one. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Very easy. Monitor the result of that decision (action). What does the world look like now? Did you achieve the goal you set out to achieve when you made the decision. In other words do you now think the world is the way you wanted to see it. If you achieved the goal, good for you, it was the right decision. If you didn\u2019t then it was the wrong decision. I know some people will argue that you can make the \u201cright decision\u201d and still not end up where you want to be. Now I would ask you to define what you actually mean by \u201cthe right decision.\u201d If you end up in the wrong place, I can accept that you \u201cthought\u201d it was the right decision, but in reality it wasn\u2019t (what was \u201cright\u201d about it). Therefore, there would to be a logical disconnect in the argument for me. There is a large literature on Perceptual Control Theory (not a crank literature I would hasten to add, but a well constructed theoretical position) that suggests all decision making is part of a closed loop system. We are goal driven, we compare our goal with our understanding of how our world is (our perception\u2026not necessarily reality), and if there is a difference, we form some action (decision) that is aimed at making our world match our goal. If our first action doesn\u2019t succeed, we modify our decision in the direction we think will achieve our goals, and continue until we either succeed in achieving the goal, or we give up because the cost is too high. Sometimes we try to control things that are not in our locus of control. You will never control that loop, so move on (world peace may be one such goal). Now let\u2019s talk about your goals. I make take issue with what you were trying to achieve, but that is a whole different argument. ",

            "answer_text": "It would help to clear any confusions so that we all come to the same understanding. The question involves our perception of right or wrong. In the traditional world, no two people would agree on every single issue involving what is right and what is wrong. So, we need to first formulate a scenario where everybody agrees and accepts what is right, and what is wrong. If we do that, then the rest of the answer is already made available, because we all will do the right thing and avoid the wrong thing. The right and wrong are always from a single perspective. A hungry lion killing and eating a deer is right for the lion and wrong for the deer because the deer is willing to live and not die. If after a long chase, the lion is unable to catch the deer, it is wrong for the hungry lion because he has two more kids to feed who will die of hunger. But the same situation is right for the deer who gets what he needs - a life. First learning from this situation of opposing forces in action leads us to a simple fact. Our decision of right and wrong is from our angle. We should not bring confusion and conflict by bringing in other people\u2019s perspective. This will result in an endless confusion between conflicting rights and wrongs.What is right? What is wrong?A person is hungry. Eating food is right.A person is hungry. Not eating food is wrong.A person is in pain. Removing the pain or running away from pain is right.A person is not in pain. Going towards pain is wrong.A right or wrong is simply what is in direction of \u2018life\u2019. Any action that the life wants naturally is right. Any action that opposes life forces is wrong. There is nothing right in right or wrong in wrong. They both are essential features of life sustaining to keep itself running. Whichever is stronger wins for that particular situation. In the end, a harmony of rights and wrong is the nature of the universe.So, how do you know your decision is right or wrong? Why do you care? You just do what is needed to be done in any moment. Then on the next moment, just do again what is needed in that moment, and don\u2019t worry about the quality of decision that you took in the past moment, because by nature, that is always going to be \u2018RIGHT\u2019!

I chose to get the job by my own over my brother-in-law recommendation or suggestion. (Actually he is an Assistant Manager[H.R] in a giant MNC company and it's not a big deal for him to get someone a job with zero percent realated skillset)  I chose to spend my first month salary to get a laptop over spending on anything. (Actually I'd invested my few month salaries and not spent)  I chose to join the part time job over self destructing after my first breakup.  I chose to repay my educational loan (which is nearly 5L INR) over expecting my dad to pay. (Actually he's all capable to pay my debt. But I don't want him to pay. Let me repay)  I chose to plan for joining the product based startup companies over the service based companies which is not a big deal for me. (Actually I'm quite confident that I can easily get into the another service based company)  I chose to minimalise my circle over the decent friends circle. (Actually I don't give a fuck to the people who is not that loyal)  I chose to reply to the critics by my works over shouting at them that I'm not that stupid. (Actually I\u2019m not that good at playing with words or arguing with anyone. I believe silence can be the best reply)  I chose to depend on myself for my expenses over my dad\u2019s pension. (Actually still I\u2019m dependent on him. But very less. In future I won\u2019t)  and so on... So, coming to your question I really don't know that I'm making the right decision. But if you come to me yell at me \"you're a mad man, you're all making the fucking wrong decisions in your life!\", my reply would be \u201cI don't think so\u201d. Just because I feel responsible, wise, confident, proud, good for my decisions. Oh let me take some pride of me. Thanks! - Naren ",

            "answer_text": "Before taking any decision, we have to think about its consequences after 5-10 yrs. I am unable to discuss on this briefly. Hence i am coming with one example. For example, when i was in 12th standard, i was interested in both sports(state player) & education(average student). Was in ambiguity on choosing the path (sports or education). How i solved this. First i started calculating - my family long term issues, financial status, family members mind standards, who are the supporters for my goal & how much they can support. Also how much i can bare for my own. Secondly, started measuring the consequences (after 10 yrs) which i have to face if i succeed or if i failed. And in both (sports/education) case which one is having the more alternatives to settle down. Finally, through this way how many are the benefiters? Like parents, me & society. At-least 2 must be benefited here. Cinema which runs in my mind, at that time: My family was middle class, but my aunties (3 members) can support me. And yes, my parents & aunties(2 are govt. employees) are educated, so they can support me in education than in sports. Sports has very less opportunities and also very much efforts to do without guarantee. But in education minimum of 3-5 yrs of course is enough with minimum guarantee. I can do part time in both the cases, again that part time job must benefit to my goal. Hence i joined as a computer faculty. Here is the turning point. Believe me i did a paper work for this solution. Which leads me to take computer course, now i am a software engineer. So, as per my estimation of 5-10 yrs is happy now. Of course, many hurdles,pains,efforts i faced in between these years. But yes, still i am happy now. Not depending on anyone \\ for anything. Finally useful for my parents, me & for the society(Oh! My God! i benefited for 3 out of 3). Only one thing i am missing is my sports but i can encourage many. Note: Never discuss about your plans directly with others until you succeed. But gather information related to that as a thought process. I am not interested to publish my private life. But for clear clarity, which can help you/many to take any vital decisions in their life, today i am publishing a part. Yet i follow paper work, so that i came to know about my pros & cons. Still effort-ting to reach my Aim. Bless me and pray for me. And all the best! ",

Very simply put - if any action of body speech or mind leads to suffering to oneself or to others then that action can be constituted as \u201cwrong\u201d. So what are the actions of body speech and mind that should be avoided? About 2500 years ago a great seer was born whose teachings reverberate throughout the world even today. He was called Shakyamuni Buddha. He showed the peerless path of living. He clearly explained how out own actions create the world around us - the world of both suffering and happiness. Knowing what is right and what is wrong leads to eliminating the \u201cwhat is wrong\u201d which leads to happiness Body - Wrong: Killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. Right: Giving life, practicing generosity and maintaining morality Speech - Wrong: Lying, using harsh words, creating enmity and disharmony through speech and idle talk. Right: Speaking the truth always, using kind words, re-conciliatory speech, making meaningful talk Mind - Wrong: covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views. Right: Being content, having a heart full of loving kindness and maintaining right views(of how all phenomenon exists) Much more information is available if you google \u201c10 non virtuous actions\u201d or \u201ceight fold path - Buddha\u201d or \u201cthe middle path\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "We will never know until we create robots which are programmed with exactly our genes and then we can use them to tell us for every situation, what are the possible decisions and what would be the outcome of each decision. Then we can choose the decision that has the most desirable outcome to us. It would be also interesting to fast forward the different choices and compare what each decision chain would lead to in let\u2019s say 10 years time. I believe that whatever decisions we make in years to come would take us to the same point, so the different decisions are only different routes to get us to another important crossroad. I feel that certain cross roads are compulsory and they will be reached whatever decisions have been made. Recently I met someone who has been at the same cross roads as me, but she has taken the opposite decisions to me, 12 years ago. And we ended up meeting on the same job, doing exactly the same job, despite the fact that 12 years ago we had taken completely opposite routes in life. And interestingly after this cross road where we met, we continued in our opposite directions. She was a professional dancer, decided to give up dancing and to become a Psychologist. I was a Psychology student at the time when she was a dancer, I decided to give up Psychology and to take up dancing. We were amazed at our encounter and as it happens our working together was cut short. She is now continuing with her Psychology degree and I\u2019m continuing with dancing. I\u2019m curious to know where we would be in another 12 years time. Since then I\u2019m convinced that each decision we make as serious as it looks at the time will take us to the same cross road we are destined to reach. These cross roads are unavoidable and we will reach them regardless. So be brave and experiment in your life and in the worst possible scenario if you see that the new situation is not working for you - wipe the slate clean and go back to the previous position. I can always go back to working as a therapist. She can always go back and work as a dance teacher. She actually gives private dancing lessons and I give private therapy, although both of us are not full time employed in these professions :) As long as you are not committing crimes, most decisions are quite reversible and the outcomes are reminders that life is a game to be experimented with and played and when we don\u2019t like where the play is going, stop the game and start another game. Life is much less serious than we think. ",

Suppose you just got out of school and don\u2019t know which career to choose and suddenly you see your smartass classmates choosing a profession like they already know what is going to happen. . But you don\u2019t know what to do, That was me. For example\u2014 Suppose if you choose the career of an engineer after school, then think first, Why are you even pursuing it. As Chanakya once said that \u2014 Before you start some work, always ask yourself three questions - Why am I doing it,What the results might be andWill I be successful.Only when you think deeply and find satisfactory answers to these questions, go ahead. But, if still due to some unexpected circumstance if you feel that you have made a terrible decision then you probably need to change your thinking, because \u201cHow can you be so sure that \u2014 Not choosing a career apart from engineering would have been a good choice? And to be clear, how can you know that the other option would be a good decision? \u2014 . So my friend there is nothing known as the right or wrong decision it is only choices that build your life. Think 1000 times before you do something as Hitler says, but after making those choices don\u2019t turn back to feel sorry for yourself. .

            "answer_text": "I think the most practical way to address the question is to take the dilemma and turn it into a mathematical word problem. It\u2019s an already established way to determine ethics which I found to be most useful. It can be tricky though since it is subjective and everyone will assign different values according to their life experiences and backgrounds. However, most people can agree on the basics of what good morals are. Basically, you want to dissect the scenario or situation and turn it into a point system and assigning a numerical value to the outcome. So take for example, if you are contemplating if it\u2019s wrong to cheat on someone you are in a relationship with and they have cheated on you in the past. You would break it down like so on a scale of -10 (worse negative impact) to +10 (best possible impact): -9 Potential emotional distress caused to partner +6 Act on and give into cheating impulses -7 Feeling guilty about lying and sneaking around -6 Effort needed to hide the cheating +7 Potential that the new partner is a better match -9 = Net positive/negative outcome \u2014\u2014\u2014 > Don\u2019t do it! The above is just a very simplified example. Certainly, in real life, there would be more things to consider and the values would be different depending on the person\u2019s unique personal situation. However, even though the values can be different, the end result will very likely be a similar negative outcome because most people would agree that sneaking around and lying to your current partner is a negative thing to do from an ethical standpoint (you can\u2019t make yourself an exception!).

Or is that just a manifestation of society\u2019s marketing telling the youth they want to be these things? For many, shedding what society tells you what you want never happens. There is an area of psychology called \u201cCognitive Distortion\u201d, it\u2019s the study of how people lie to themselves, and by extension how social groups create identity based on falsehoods, and how they maintain identity even when faced with the truth of their situations. I suggest looking up \u201cForms of Cognitive Distortion\u201d and look for the list of 10 forms of self deception. However, be aware the \u201cInternet Party of Con men\u201d has taken this area of study and exploited it with all kinds of pop psychology bullshit. So, use careful judgement choosing which source you use, but the area of examining your own self deceptions is a grand step towards understanding your own choices before years have passed. ",

Be careful of overly optimistic thinking: if you get in over your head and are not able to drive the results to the desired conclusion, then the decision will turn out to be wrong. Here is where your belief structure comes into play: a decision not in keeping with your beliefs will be very difficult to support post factum, should the consequences yield an unexpected result. Your faith is a tool you can use to fuel your actions in the face of uncertainty; leaving it behind is almost never necessary and almost always results in a position of weakness when it comes time to put in the effort to support your decision later. Even if you are not religious, you must cultivate your powers of faith in whatever belief structure you have chosen for yourself, to give you the power of follow-through.  ",

The magnitude of right in a decision is proportional to the magnitude of underlying knowledge \u2013 provided you are a noble person. One may appreciate the fact that there is a basic uncertainty about own sensing of the magnitude of own knowing. More authoritarian a person is, greater will be the uncertainty about his/her sensing of the magnitude of knowing. To wit, the most authoritarian person, while making a decision, will mistake least knowledge for highest right. So, we have to see how much conceited you are inherently. Your decision-making will be affected by your inherent conceit. Summing up, even if you think that your decision is fully right, it will be right only in inverse proportion to your inherent (genetic) conceit. ",

Since the outcomes of a decision determines how right or wrong the choices have turned out to be, lets ponder on how to control the outcome and emerge triumphant. Note:-These are my personal views and opinions which I usually implement for making vital decisions. Warren Buffet once said: \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you're doing.\u201d # Before making choices make sure you have accumulated and assimilated enough knowledge over the subjects, irrespective of the outcome be it right/wrong; at least at the end of the day you have a threshold of wisdom in form of knowledge which will help you in future. Remember: \u2018Journey is more significant than Destination\u2019. # Start taking more and more crucial decisions in life as early as possible so that you have enough time at your disposal to secure and raise yourself again in case of failures. Taking more and more decisions by making introspection will reduce fear for failure.Moreover it provides you a feeling of self reliance; it constantly reminds you about your accountability to yourself. # Your emotions will tend to betray your better sense of judgement and you are more likely to take a wrong turn.Never trust yourself during such phase. Remember; sometimes not taking a decision is also a decision. # If I find myself caught in a dilemma; This is one way that helps me make my call :- Presume that you are absolutely alone, with no family, friends and loved ones with you in your venture.Whatever are the ramifications, its a YOU VS. LIFE scenario.Being alone makes you responsible for your actions and inaction. #Finally, its not only your decisions but your commitment and persistence to them that molds the outcome of your decisions in your favor.

It may happen that logically you are right but morally you are wrong or vice-versa. It may be right in short term but wrong in long term. It may be right for you but wrong for others. If you think so much before acting on something then you may never be able to act on it. The most important thing is your satisfaction and agreement to the decision. It may go wrong or right but this will only improve your decision making ability or I say right decision making ability. Both Animals(including Human Beings) and Machines learn in the same way. They learn from the past events. The brain trains itself on the previous knowledge it gained from the successful as well as failed decisions. Right decision makers learn from their wrong decisions/mistakes and make sure not to repeat them.  Make decisions and learn from them whether it proved right or wrong. This will enhance your decision making ability. Experience is the currency to good decisions. Don\u2019t forget to earn it by fearing failure. ",

            "answer_text": "For decisions that are irreversible, and involve any meaningful stakes and some degree of uncertainty or risk, the answer is that you can never be sure that you have made the \u201cright\u201d decision. If \u201cright\u201d corresponds to some desired outcome, then the uncertainty you face renders the \u201cright\u201d decision unknowable at the time you make it. However, you can be confident, in most circumstances, of making a good decision. A good decision is one where the decision-maker has made an effort to apply principles of decision quality to his or her decision-making process. In short, these principles are 1) framing the decision appropriately, 2) generating a set of creative and compelling alternatives to consider, 3) seeking out reliable and unbiased data that informs these alternatives, 4) conducting a rigorous and logical analyses of the alternatives, 5) selecting an alternative (or a hybrid of multiple alternatives) that maximizes your value measure of choice and 6) committing to the actions necessary to realize the value of your decision. Following these principles will help you achieve the highest quality decision possible. Bear in mind, however, that a good decision does not - cannot - guarantee a good outcome. A good (high quality) decision can only increase the likelihood thst the outcome you experience is a good one. ",

First of all make a decision. For Ex- you have a choice whether to go for a picnic or to sit and study at home. And you decide to study by quitting the idea of picnic.Wait for few days According to the decision you need to make. Here in this example given above, 2 days are enough.If you find even a single movement when your heart is wavering i.e. thinking or repenting for earlier decision then the decision you had made earlier within these 2 days then it's not worth taking and going for a picnic is a better option.Then you should shift your decision. Follow what your heart says\u2026.you may not succeed immediately but you will succeed definitely!!!!!! There will be no regret for any failure.",

            "answer_text": "Hey!! For me, never a decision is wrong. Each and every decisions or choices that you are able to see in front of you are right. The thing is, we have to put the required efforts to make some good results out of it. Actually, every decisions or choices demand a minimum efforts and hard work to be done. If a person is able to do appropriate hard work which his/her decision demands, then he/she can never fail and if anyone doesn't meets with failure, obviously, his/her decision was right. So the point is, do proper hard work and put proper efforts because some decisions and choices will demand you more efforts and hard work while in other cases, you may succeed with less hard work. And obviously don't let anyone decide your future moves. Hear to the inner voice of yours and do as per the voice says you to do. Never hear and obey anyone unless you find any profit in his/her suggestion.

When noddy could deny joining them, when they call for something wrong. understanding the act of bell, they will stick bubble gum on the bell. When they call the next time, the sound will not come from the bell, but noddy has understood that it is for something wrong, he will run back to his guru saying the bell did not work. The guru will look at the bell, will take the stuck bubblegum away, and now he will not return the cap to him, saying, the bell inside you has started ringing. The moral is \u201call of us have a bell inside us, which will alert us, before we were about to commit a wrong act, and all of us have the bubble gum too stuck in our bell, which will subdue the noise and make us believe whatever we do as right\u201d. We need to clean our bell and keep it nice, by removing the bubble gum, this way we will do the right thing. ",

Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions even if someone said it is a stupid question. There are no stupid questions but stupid people. I suggest you read Lateral Thinking by Ed De Bono and other self help books. It is very important to seek out good advice from the right people. Mentors, teachers, relatives, and high standing leaders in the local community may give good advice. You would never ask a plumber about surgery or mental health issues. Just as you would not ask a doctor to fix your electrical wiring in the house. ",

In order to feel more confident in your decisions you make them by looking at all the possible outcomes of the decision carefully and compare them to I guess the outcomes of making an opposing decision or not making any decision at all and you just decide what is it that you want, Will this decision bring you closer to what you want, and if there's some bad that comes with making this decision are you willing to accept it? Once you've spent the time to make the decision and then you make it\u2026 you stand solidly behind it and you do not second-guess yourself. You can't be wishy-washy once you've made the choice because well for so many reasons but just trust me stand by your choices as long as you make them very carefully. You will find that you learn to have a whole new confidence in yourself when you realize that you can make choices that you believe in and put them into play and bravely deal with the outcome whatever that is. Overtime you'll make better choices from learning what you did wrong the first time. There's no way to tell if another choice would've been a better choice because you can't go back and make that one to see what happens so there's another reason not to be wishy-washy or doubt yourself.

If our behaviour is absolutely in coherence with our mental models, we live at peace. There are times when our behaviour is not in coherence with our mental models, then we use our capabilities to rationalise our behaviour. We use arguments like-- This is acceptable.- Everyone does that.- This is the first time I did this. Others do it so much.- I promise I would not repeat it. - Giving in to temptations is right at times. Basically, we find an argument to convince ourselves that we are right. And in case we are not able to convince ourselves, we change our path.  Bottomline is - As humans, we want to be able to stand and look into our eyes in the mirror. We are fine doing anything that does not hamper our self image. . Thank you for asking Vinay. ",

However, those codes invariably set up confrontations with themselves, because not everyone lives by the same moral code. The most obvious rule, for example, of not killing other people - what if you encounter people that don't abide by that code? Do you let them kill you and members of your family/tribe/community/state/country? If you mean \"right\" according to legal codes, you have the same problem as moral/religious codes. They change over time, and not everyone abides by the same legal code (for example, the Mob). If you mean \"right\" according to outcome, then you can look at whether you achieved the outcome you hoped. Sometimes, this assessment is impossible, because you cannot see the alternative universe in which you made a different decision. ",

However, the thing that applies to me most is that I often come to a decision based on its interest to me on a long-term basis. Long term implication is much more important because long term benefits provide much more long lasting impacts. Therefore, if you make a decision and have lingering doubt over your capability, don't do so. Accept your decision whatever it is and work hard to make it possible. The dilemma whether a decision is right or wrong depends on its consequence to your family and the society as a whole. Hence, a conscious mind will know whether it is right or wrong based on its affect to the liberty of people especially in an individualist as well as collective community. However, if Bill Gates would not have dropped out of college and stayed their concentrated on his collge curriculum vitae, he would not have been what he is today. However, he made that decision to drop out and work out his plans as he thought it to be and most importantly he worked hard for it.

But secretly, I wish I would have married my current wife 20+ years earlier (we dated 20+ years ago) and gave her the opportunity to have children. Now we are older and it really isn\u2019t in the cards, but again, \u201cright/Wrong\u201d, I will never know if my decisions were right or wrong, just different than what hindsight and my own current views would have had me do\u2026 Our life is pretty awesome but what would have been?

In other words, there is no right or wrong, only that which benefits the most with the least ill consequences. The fact that you ask this lets me know you are afraid of making decisions. You will need to make more and more, forcing decisions \u2014 big and small \u2014on yourself to get used to making decisions and realizing the consequences were not so bad. This will both toughen you up and allow you to move to the ultimate goal of deciding and never looking back. Be thoughtful in your deliberation of what to decide, then decide, and don\u2019t second guess once the decision is made. You will learn to trust yourself by doing this. ",

Let it be a good or bad idea following the advise, but we definitely come to an answer. Mine advised me \u201c Never doubt yourself in any situation!! If you feel terrified of doing something then avoid it, because you are not up for it yet and you might get hurt doing it. So, consider it as a wrong step until you have the guts to do it, until you make the WRONG into RIGHT\u201d. I took that seriously into my life and based on my petty experience over decision making, it helped me a lot. When you are learning something failures are common. When I say \u2018avoid it\u2019 i am not saying to not attempt it, but to be ready to accept the result. If you are not prepared enough to accept the result then you are doing it wrong. I just want to say that RIGHT or WRONG, all depends on the way you accept it. To be short, \u2018Just follow your gut\u2019 and never doubt the decision you made. It is my personal advice, i can\u2019t say if it really helps anyone in everything but it surely does in most of the problems. Please excuse me for my English, i hope you get my view and all the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking. The whole world is being upgraded and degraded at every stage by the decision of every single person. So decision is a act that leads every life in this universe by eliminating thousands of possibilities and take us forward every step ahead. Our own existence is the decision made by our parents and grandparents possibly. The right and wrong of the decision is relative to the person, environment and the people getting affect by it. So before making a decision we have to ask few question to our self. Did I make this decision as a need or a want? Did I make this decision thinking only about me? Who all will get affected by this decision? Will this decision contradicts the Law of nature and humanity(universal), Law of society(based on the country, ethnic and tribe)? Does it welfare me, family and society equally? These questions are generic, if these question answers appropriately according to conscience then its right. But there are situations where your multiple decision contradicts one or more question. This is described as Dharm sankat. Example, you have multiple responsibility towards many people. Pithru, Mathru, pathni dharm etc. If making one decision contradicts dharm of other is called dharm sankat. During this situation. Try your best to keep up the basic. \u201cDoes the decision supports compassion to a living being irrespective of any relation with them?\u201d Compassion is the root of all righteousness. Anything that goes against compassion is wrong. ",

As far as life changing decisions that aren\u2019t necessarily about right and wrong\u2026. I always listen to my instincts.. even if it means not making the decision quite yet. Anytime I\u2019ve been coerced into doing something I wasn\u2019t sure about, it didn\u2019t end well. And sometimes you just make decisions and they aren\u2019t right or wrong, you just have to live with them, take responsibility for them, and learn from them. Your instincts and your values are a great compass. ",

When you are unsure and unaware of what you are about to or have done then its obvioisly wrong. In life we do good things and we do bad things and we do right and wrong things aswell its human nature to do this. You will probably always do stuff that is wrong so you can learn from your mistakes so you can get right next time. This is what makes life interesting and keeps it ticking over. If you never do right things then you need to address how you are living your life. If you always do whats right then life is boring and theres nothing to learn so you must balance it. In order to learn we must do wrong and even if we are always right there is STILL something to learn. ",

If we take our decisions in calmed, meditative, self-controlled , and well poised state of mind, they will always be right decisions. Decisions should always be according to our capacity, ability and need. Never make haste to make decisions. There is a proverb, \u2018Haste makes waste.\u2019 Specially when we are in the grip of emotional excitement, anger, lust, greed etc., we must never try to make any decision at that moment. Wait until uneasiness and restlessness is gone and mind becomes quiet and calm. Decisions taken by a calm, quiet and balanced mind are always right decisions. ",

Even if it seems as if the decision was a bad one, you can view it as \"right\" because you learn something from it.  You learn how to look out for certain things and keep certain things in mind, or the opposite and ignore false warnings/learn to spot false warnings.  You learn how to just carry on with life after that decision has been made, and you learn how to make do with things.  You learn that whatever decision you made - whether it's a decision or a no-decision, because that is a decision too - can me made right if you don't regret, learn your mistakes, and move on. ",

In life we come across a juncture where you need to choose either \u201cRight where nothing is right\u201d or \u201cLeft where nothing is left\u201d. Sometimes we are forced to make hard decision in life which cannot be judged as neither right nor wrong because we did what we felt was right at that moment. If you ever feel that what you are doing is wrong , just close your eyes and ask the inner YOU because it can never lie . After getting the answer you can contemplate on future steps to be taken. \u201cWe are what we are by the choices that we make\u201d.So before getting into this juncture where we start doubting our choices, let us take some time before we make any choices in life. Even if you have take a wrong decision don\u2019t worry because - \u201cIt\u2019s never too late\u201d. Hope this is helpful!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.   I believe what you are trying to explore with your question is the process of rationalization.  We humans are very adept at justifying any decision we make with elaborate reasoning that \"convinces\" us of the rightness of our choice.  This rationalizing seems to be mainly emotionally-based process, where we override what may be a more rational choice with felt convictions.  According to some researchers (Antonio Damasio et al) this is just how human beings are wired:  what we believe to be \"rational\" is actually framed and actuated by emotional responses.  That said, there are other ways to approach decision-making that allow us to integrate multiple input streams and avoid post-justification of a primary emotional impulse.  For example, you might consider reading my essay Managing Complexity with Constructive Integralism, which offers a way to frame decision-making that may circumvent rationalization to some degree. My 2 cents. ",

The best we can do it trust ourselves and know that we made the best choice we could at the time, and recognize how it has served us in some way. Life would be a lot more enjoyable if we took the phrase \"What if..\" out of our vocabulary. We don't need it. Living in the moment is all we have when it comes down to it.. trust your gut, go with that pull.. it will ultimately lead to the 'right' choice, or at least, what works for you in that moment in time.

But when you use your conscience more often it becomes louder and you wont be tempted to listen to the other voice.

Or will it be a moral decision? Or perhaps maximize economic gain? Or even will it minimize pain and suffering.The decision maker is responsible for all these assessments, which is the reason that most people don't bother, and just flip a mental coin to decide.I recommend that you read a basic text on decision making to obtain further explanation.

Lay out the information that you have with you that can help with your decision making, reach out to others whose advice you value, and determine your decision making criteria - everyone\u2019s process is going to be different, but its important to have one.

            "answer_text": "So, one day we friends, in our hostel, were having a gossiping time. And suddenly the talks turned towars Mahabharat and stuffs. Then one of my friends told us about a discussion with his father. Friend: Dad, what is the definition of paap. Dad: Son, always remember what I say now. Paap is anything that your conscience stops you from doing. For example, killing is considered a crime or paap, but killing to save your family or yourself is not. From Mahabharat point of view, killing Duryodhan or Dushashan is not a crime, because they are wrong and they plan to cause harm to Pandavas and their family. See, you know that a decission is right, if and only if, you conscience doesn't stop you from acting on that decission. You can steal from someone, if that stealing is not a burden to you. People are stealing to feed their family. Then how can stealing be wrong to them. It is a way of surving to them. I hope I am able to make my point clear. Any other point of view on this, is welcome. I am always ready to know new stuffs. Thank you. ",

I call it situational morality. What is worse, is what one may consider right or wrong will change based upon how it affects them or another person and their like oo dislike of another person. Without an ultimate authority, one who defines right and wrong justly, without change, who is more than a mere person with mere opinions and limited experience, it is impossible to define right or wrong in a manner that is truly best. This is why appeal to God (and not man) is the only reliable and safe source for defining what is right and what is wrong. And so, I go to the source of creation who knows us and is omniscient - God; the God revealed in the Bible. That can be the only safe, consistent, true, reliable, and unchanging source. ",

If you want to make sure that you always make the right decision then you also have to see how do you define the right and the wrong.  Ideally, there is no point in evaluating the decision you took. May be you can learn from it. But to decide whether it was right or wrong is not straightforward. The result of the decision you take depends on many factors which are not always in our control. What we need to ensure is that the intent we have/had before taking the decision is right. That's what matters. ",

As a journalist who has visited with many of the top executives in the US financial services industry, I can tell you that the best leaders bring a lot to the table when its time to make the hard choices. Experience may be the best tool, but we don\u2019t have a lot of that when we\u2019re young. Leaders have the experience they need to make good decisions because, in part, they\u2019ve made lots of bad decisions. We can learn a lot from making the wrong choice. What can younger people do to make better choices? Talk to more experienced people who have been faced with similar choices in the past and see what they did and how it worked out. Don\u2019t ask them what you should do. They are not you and they can\u2019t know. Ask them what they did and what the results were. Learn from their mistakes and you get the experience for free! Ultimately, you just have to make a choice and know that some of the choices you make are going to be wrong. It\u2019s okay. Stick with it long enough to be sure, but not so long that you make things worse and then make a new choice. Life is a messy game and things don\u2019t look very neat while we\u2019re doing them, but if you do your best you will look back on a life well lived and those that come after you will assume that everything was as easy as you made it look.

Other principles may come into play depending on the situation, but the key to them all is goodness. ",

That means that other people made incorrect decisions about you, as it would be if you are found guilty of a crime when you are innocent. Or do you mean \"make\" the wrong decisions? That means that when confronted with the choice, you chose one that, in retrospect, seems wrong. My experience in life has been that if you \"get\" the wrong decisions, you are somehow presenting yourself to the world in a way that makes them misunderstand or misjudge you. If you are \"making\" the wrong decisions, you should engage in some self-examination or dialogue with your friends or a professional, to try to discover what assumptions and philosophies are leading you to making poor choices. A simple, nonjudgmental example is that I spent a lot of time eating multigrain breads, oat products, and other heart healthy foods, because there is a history of heart disease in my family. Little did I know that multigrain bread is death to the diabetic (nor did I know that I was diabetic!), and when a blood test for another reason included a blood sugar count, I was forced to radically change my diet. I made a wrong decision because I assumed that my biggest health concern was my heart, when in fact it was my blood sugar. ",

            "answer_text": "This is very very important doubt of practical spiritual knowledge. The same question was put by Arjuna to Lord Krishna in the Gita, \u201cWhy I am forced to do the sin even though I do not want to do the sin (Anichchannapi\u2026balaadiva\u2026)?\u201d Before explaining the answer given by the Lord, I will give some initial clarification. All of us shall agree that the sin is done by a living being with awareness only and not by mere inert item like a stone or statue. A living being may also have the inert materials as body, but the doer of the sin is only the awareness and not the inert material of the body. There are three stages in the process of sin: i) Wish (sankalpa) to do the sin by which one becomes doer (karta) ii) The inert process of deed (karma) iii) Enjoyment of its corresponding fruit by which one becomes enjoyer (bhokta) In these three stages, 1 and 3 are related to awareness. When one throws a big stone on a person and kills him, the middle process of killing by stone, which is 2, is inert process only because even a stone slipping from the hill by force of wind falling on a person kills him in the same way and here, there is no agent of awareness. But when a person throws a stone with intention to kill somebody, the intention initiating the inert process is related to awareness. Subsequently, the fruit of sin given as punishment by death-sentence pains the killer and hence, the enjoyment of fruit is again related to awareness only. Therefore, the sin starting with 1 and ending by 3 is totally related to the awareness only. This awareness is stored in the soul in the form of several impressions of thoughts of violence existing as a specific functional mode called as chittam (one of the four internal instrumental modes of awareness). These impressions were done in the past millions of births (which may mean even previous days of this birth) and this stored psychological pattern of violent thoughts forces any soul to similar sins in the present birth. Such storage of thoughts provokes the sins with unassuming force. Hence, Lord told that the storage of thoughts (chittam) called as para prakruti is responsible for the sins (mind, intelligence and ego are categorized under apara prakruti and hence, the fourth instrumental mode is inevitably taken as para prakruti). The Lord said that the awareness as functional mode of storage (para) or prakruti is provoking the deed of sin by creating the wish with tremendous force (prakrutim yaanti..., prakrutistvaam..., prakruterguna sammudhaah... Gita). The Lord said that there are three main gates to hell, which are the main sins: i) Violence in killing living beings for food, killing human beings including terrorism, etc. (krodha) ii) Greediness, which is stealing others\u2019 money by corruption, etc. (lobha) iii) Illegal sex other than wife or husband (kama) The Lord also said that kama and krodha are responsible for the main sins (kamaesha krodhaesha\u2026). You may doubt that the Lord missed lobha here. It is not so because the word \u2018kama\u2019 stands for two senses: i) sex and ii) general desire. Therefore, the word kama as general desire indicates lobha also. What is the solution to control this? The only solution that Lord suggested is divine spiritual knowledge, \u201cThe spiritual knowledge burns all sins (jnanaagnih\u2026), all the sins can be crossed by simply knowledge (vrujinam samtarishyasi\u2026), the inert deed ends without fruit by the spiritual knowledge (jnanee parisamaapyate\u2026), nothing other than jnana is pious to purify the soul (nahijnanena\u2026).\u201d I am explaining this. We have already seen that the sins are related to awareness and its thoughts only, which is wrong knowledge. The wrong knowledge can be smashed by right knowledge only. A diamond can be cut by another diamond only. The spiritual knowledge gets impressed very well by its force and frequency of memorization called as \u2018manana\u2019. Other than this, there is no second path to control the sin. The right and complete divine spiritual knowledge given by God alone can bring you the success. You are already in the path towards success. You are only lacking some patience. You must realize the force of this wrong knowledge stored in your memory about which you are not even aware and such memory is called as subconscious state of awareness. This will be destroyed by the power of right and complete knowledge given by human incarnations like Krishna, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Mahavir Jain, Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Sai Baba etc. Seeing the duration of the stored wrong knowledge, you must maintain some patience, which is the first requisite of a spiritual aspirant as told by Shankara (Shamadamaadi\u2026).

Justice is the divine system created by God, to maintain the balance of the society so that the spiritual aspirants can do their efforts with peace. The justice is related to your colleague soul. The essence of Dharma is not to hurt anyone in anyway because the law and order is in the hands of God. Atleast you should not harm any devotee. But punishing the students for their welfare is exempted because the welfare of the student is the main aim. What is injustice and immorality? What is the punishment for this? You may hurt your colleague souls in several ways. All these ways are injustice and immorality. For example by corruption you are hurting your colleague souls. Atleast you are not exempting the poor and devoted people. If you do corruption in the case of unjust rich people, you should spend it for divine purpose. If you spend it for yourself or for your family, all of you will be completely destroyed. The path of justice is mainly characterised by 1. Ahimsa (not killing any living being for food), 2. Asteya (controlling the corruption of others\u2019 money and wealth), 3. Akaama (controlling the corruption of illegal sex), 4. Aahara (not burning the food materials in the name of sacrifice and donating the food to poor and hungry living beings) and 5. Artha (sacrifice of money to deserving receivers). ",

Well, decisions are something we take right from the point we wake up till we sleep adding that to the decision either. Decision can't be said to be right or wrong, depends on the perspective and the situation. A decision made wrong at a time may prove to be right at other moment. It also depends from person to person. But what matters the most in the \"decision making\" is \"wisdom\". Being an optimist saves us from the guilt we have after realizing a bad decision. Therefore, a positive approach is required towards the situations we face and the decisions we make!  ",
