            "answer_text": "Banks do this all the time. They will buy a form a currency in the hopes (or educated guesses) that the currency will rise in value and then sell the money to someone else at a profit (or sometimes a loss). You cant say buy a US dollar a US dollar, you\u2019d buy something like a euro or another form of currency. If the exchange rate of the currency increases in favor of the currency you bought, you could then convert it back into the original form for a profit. For example if I went into canada, or a bank that is able to exchange my US dollars into canadian dollars, then waited for the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to improve, i could then go back to the bank and exchange the canadian dollar back into US dollars for a profit. its a lot like playing the stock market in a way ",
