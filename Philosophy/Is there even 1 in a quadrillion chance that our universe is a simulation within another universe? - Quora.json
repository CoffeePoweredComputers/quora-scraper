The problem with constructed realities is that either they do exist and there\u2019s no hint as such that they are constructed, either because the \u2018residents\u2019 are incapable of perceiving the meta world around them.. or those realities just simply don\u2019t exist. Ergo.. this is not a 1 in x chance question. Flat out, either the world is a simulation or is not. Either way, what difference would that make to us who are forced to live in it? The results would be the same, crossing the street blind is still liable to get you ran over, simulation or not. ",

By the complex rules of quantum stuff, if you look up and see a faraway star, the simulation would have to calculate the powition and energy aand momentum of every point between here and there and every possible Feynman Diagram between here and there. That would require knowing the info about each and every subatomic particle for millions of light-years. easily a trillion to the trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion power calculations to simulate one photon hitting your eye.
