            "answer_text": "Love is a philosophy. Philosophy is a discipline in science. So, no, love is not a direct science, rather a branch in philosophical argument. If love were easily a science, we would have found a cure for heartbreaks like we have a cure for various diseases such as, malaria or a flu. Love is not to be understood but to be taken as it comes. It is like energy, we cannot form it but we can harness it. Love is wild and can not be held in bonds. It has to fill both parties to it and just like energy, lead things on, only that we channel it toward all good. Welcome. ",

            "answer_text": "Love is a feeling. It is not a science, or a philosophy, but it is easier for scientists to understand, as they can relate to the biology, chemical and physiological reactions. Oxytocin is released as a hormone in love. Increased heart beat is part of the sympathetic nervous system response. Pheromones, pupil dilatation and biological attraction are all scientific recognised phenomena. Philosophers get so lost in their thoughts they can have too much doubt to feel emotions. ",
