            "answer_text": "No. Post-modernism is a distinct and fundamentally different philosophy of thought. Here are the two compared in their most BASIC definitions. Modernism arose out the the industrial revolution and spread globally after WWI. Modernism is principally founded on the idea that traditional thought, art forms and cultural frameworks were outmoded. Modernists didn\u2019t believe that \u2018the way it has always been done\u2019 was necessarily \u2018the right way.\u2019 This may seem like a natural position to someone today, but in the 19th century this was NOT a commonly held idea. This idea was a product of the Industrial revolution, as factories popped up (filled with automation) the way we defined the world was rapidly shifting. The idea spread to gain mass acceptance in the wake of WWI when our writers, artists and thinkers struggled to find ways to describe horrors which had never before been seen on this earth. Post-Modernism arose because after 75 years of modernists looking forward to the novel ideas which defined their movement, people started to realize that there are powerful lessons to be learned from the past. What post-modernists do is re-examine pre-modernist ideas in the context of contemporary society. Post-modernists believe that all viewpoints can be made valid through contemporary exploration, even if those viewpoints are outmoded. In this author\u2019s opinion, post-modernism is a direct response to the Atomic Bomb. \u2018The bomb\u2019 was a distillation of modernity \u2014 that new and ever better weapons could be created through the vehicle of progress. The threat of global thermonuclear war forced us to reconcile traditional thought in a modern world. \u201cWait a minute\u201d we said \u201c\u2026maybe this progress thing has gone a bit too far.\u201d That is is in a nut shell. Modernist philosophy was organized around the idea that the future holds the key to enlightenment through new thoughts and ideas. Where as Post-modern thinking contends that Modernism needs to reconcile with the traditional philosophies it\u2019s ethos rejects as being outmoded. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cModernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent; it is the one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable.\u201d Charles Baudelaire\u201cTo be modern is to find ourselves in an environment that promises adventure, power, joy, growth, transformation of ourselves and the world\u2026It pours us all into a maelstrom of perpetual disintegration and renewal, of struggle and contradiction, of ambiguity and anguish.\u201d Marshall Berman\u201cBerman goes on to show how a variety of writers in different places and at different times confronted and tried to deal with this overwhelming sense of fragmentation, ephemerality, and chaotic change.\u201d David HarveyI don\u2019t think postmodernism is fundamentally distinct from modernism if you understand modernism\u2019s complexity rather than its caricature (bureaucratic, utopian, authoritative, objective). Many of the adjective used to describe modernity in the quotes above (transient, contingent, fleeting, disintegration, contradiction, ambiguity, and ephemerality) are ones that many theorists of postmodernity claimed were specific to postmodernity. Where modernity (supposedly) saw things as eternal and fixed postmodernity saw things as fluid, contradictory, and ever-changing. Many postmodernists merely shifted the emphasis in the content of modernity, while others simply removed the transformative aspect (\u201ctransformation of the world and ourselves\u201d), that is, they gave up on progress. This is not to imply that modernism was without its problems, but as a way of thinking and being, it is flexible enough to deal with the complexity of life \u2013 flexible enough to transform itself into postmodernity. It is, however, for me a problematic transformation when you give up the idea that we can change things because it naturalises the status quo. Paradoxically, this is something that postmodernists accuse modernists of doing. A more critical reason for seeing post-modernism as just an extension of modernism is its relationship to capitalism. Postmodernism could be understood as the shift that cultural production and ideology took when capitalism evolved into neoliberalism. The way in which power through control of the economy is exercise is different in its specific mechanism but the intent is the same \u2013 to maintain, increase and then narrow that band of power. But if you want a concrete example of how the caricature doesn\u2019t work just look at the work of Le Corbusier, the modernist\u2019s modernist, the character to wanted to wipe away a whole segment of Paris and replace it with a brand new vision of what a city could be, and understand how his built work is built on tradition, historical archetypes and the classical tradition. The supposed neglect of tradition and history on the part of modernists is not universally true. If anyone has turned their back on history and tradition it is the postmodern artist and designer (e.g. Gehry, Hadid, Libeskind, Emin, Hirst, etc.). ",
