            "answer_text": "The website that was linked is very good at pointing out that mathematical objects are not part of our physical world. I don\u2019t think that anyone would argue that. However, the website that was linked has a serious flaw: it confuses various meanings of the word truth together, and conflates various meanings of the word \u201creal\u201d together too. At first, this seems okay, because most people don\u2019t seem to need to discern the minute differences between how the words are used.  The problem with \u201ctruth\u201d (and with \u201creality\u201d and \u201cexistence\u201d) is that people use \u201ctrue\u201d to mean one of several things, as listed below, and then attach the word truth as some \u201ctrueness\u201d of it: Mathematical TruthOne of two (or more) mathematical (and programming) values, in contrast to false (a Boolean Domain, or a larger poset, used as a future selector between values) - [Hint: the word \u201ctruth\u201d is almost never used with this definition of \u201ctrue\u201d]A statement that \u201cfollows\u201d from previous statements. For instance, by saying \u201cWhen it rains, the ground gets wetter\u201d, and recognizing that it is raining right now. This the meaning of \u201ctruth\u201d in logic, but typically requires that one use the meaning #1 for the axioms. Often times, the association of \u201ctrue\u201d with an axiom is implicit when it is \u201cassumed\u201d. The intuitive notion of \u201creachability\u201d as \u201ctruth\u201d should connect the logic of statements as a directed graph (specifically a category).A intuitive statement of \u201cbeing inhabited\u201d or \u201ccontaining\u201d something. In sets and types, this meaning of \u201ctrue\u201d is that it is not empty, or contrastly, that a value inhabits such a container.A Property of Universals - A \u201ctruth\u201d is some property that can be stated about universals, and is measured as either: exactly descriptive of the universal, or better or worse approximating the universal property. Many black-and-white thinkers associate with \u201canything not exactly descriptive is wrong\u201d vs having \u201cmore exact\u201d and \u201cless exact\u201d descriptions. It is measured by \u201ccloseness\u201d to an ideal.A testimony - which is measured as \u201copenness\u201d, a dual concept to the \u201ccloseness\u201d measureAccounts and feelings associated with an experience, for which people use the phrase \u201cmy truth\u201d to indicate how the experience affects their perceptions and beliefs.An observation (a fact), which often includes measurements, statements about the location and how the observation was obtained. In this sense, the testimony is done by a device or person.An agreement - in this sense, whether we agree that words like \u201cbachelor\u201d can be applied to animals that don\u2019t participate in marriage is based on agreement. This is where definitions come from, and arguments for or against truth are based on agreement of the definitions.We can argue whether mathematical structures are universals, which would necessarily imply that #2 applies to #1, but the problem of universals and the realism/nominalism divide is still not solved. So, mathematics does not exist in the physical world, but has a reality in the conceptual world, and that reality can exist in multiple minds as well, meaning that if it is subjective, it is nearly universally subjective. Subjectivity; however, does not have anything to do with \u201creal\u201d or \u201ctruth\u201d. Something can be subjective and true, just as things can be objectively false. In the end, the usage of the word \u201ctruth\u201d in regards to mathematics does not have any bearing on the usage of the word \u201ctruth\u201d in regards to the physical world as they are separate meanings altogether. Additionally, there is no \u201creality of mathematics\u201d, unless one includes \u201cconceptual reality\u201d. In the same sense that Harry Potter lives in a world that we can all discuss the laws of, and recognize discrepancies and inconsistencies of those laws, mathematics lives in a world that is also conceptual, but significantly more rigorous than any (other) work of fiction. This rigor is due to agreement, but more specifically when we agree on the truth (#4) of the definitions we use in mathematics, then we must agree on the truth (#1) of what that implies. ",

            "answer_text": "I read the whole article, and it was a delight to me. Because, honestly, I agree with most, if not all of the statements (less than five statements are not about mathematics per s\u00e9). In my own discovery process of mathematics, there was a phase where I accepted that mathematical truth was the only truth that was worth pursuing, because the \u201creality out there\u201d can not objectively be observed, yet mathematics is open and clear about its assertions, definitions and consequences. In short, it\u2019s a logical unit that can\u2019t be broken. The pursuit of truth and certainty was a strong motivator then. I have to admit that over the years, my observations became more accurate, my thinking more sensitive to details, and I noticed that the question whether numbers exist took on a different flavor. At first, it was obvious to me that they existed, from when I was 3 years old. I played games with dice and the numbers were always there to guide the way the game would be played. We had four family members, squares had four sides, cars had four wheels, a hand has five fingers, etc. But it took a while, until I started studying mathematics, that gradually I started to appreciate the intricacies of the real numbers (those with infinite expansions, such as Pi, e, [math]\\sqrt{2}[/math], etc.). There came a time that it wasn\u2019t so clear to me that these numbers exist. Is it true, for instance, that between two points in physical space, there are in fact an uncountable number of other points, as the mathematical model predicts? If that is true, how can we prove that? How can an object that is actually moving from A to B go through all these uncountable numbers (ratios of traveled distance to the total distance between A and B)? Does the passing of this object through each point constitute an event that could be observed? I have great doubts that this is anywhere near the truth of the reality. Up till today I do not know the correct answer, but I strongly suspect that space is quantized, and that there are only a finite number of points between any two points in space. Perhaps the number is huge (obviously, considering the size of atoms compared to our bodies and what we call a \u201csmall distance\u201d is not that small in terms of atoms), but if we zoom in with more accurate instruments, that number might become visible! In any case, even as numbers are of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, I must agree that their existence is far from obvious or self-evident. In fact, I don\u2019t think it matters whether numbers \u201cexist\u201d. Perhaps that indicates that the question itself lacks some coherence (unexpectedly). Because if numbers can\u2019t exist, how can any statement about them be true, and if it could, in what sense is that truth related to the physical reality? Perhaps truth itself is also a problematic concept? Consider the idea of a unicorn. It\u2019s perfectly fine within a fictional setting. What if I were to ask if there exists a unicorn of which its horn is grown in a knot? If we know that unicorns are fictional, why do most people have a problem with such a question? Truth about reality is indeed considered truth. But if we can talk about numbers, what does it mean that a mathematical statement about numbers is true, if the numbers themselves do not have a counterpart in reality? We have shifted the meaning of truth to the imaginary world of mathematics and forget that we compare different things. The truth about numbers has a different quality than the truth about reality. Where the truth of about numbers is constructed and imaginary, the truth about reality is based on observations and measurements, FAR from imagination. That sounds reasonable at first. But now we find there is a problem with the truth about reality, as it turns out to be imaginary as well. Because, it is only the part of which we become aware through many filters (senses and the implicit limits of our minds) that we can probe into the nature of reality. And it can be defended that whatever it is we think about reality is not true either in any objective way. The truth about reality is just as subjective and imaginary\u2014as much of a human endeavor if you will\u2014as the truth about numbers! Yet, these two types of truth may still be of a different quality. I am starting to think that it doesn\u2019t matter whether truth exists. Where does it leave us? Perhaps it leaves us with the one attribute that started this: curiosity. Our endeavors are driven by curiosity. As such, truth is the end point of curiosity, not the beginning. As to claim a truth is to abandon the idea that it could be different. Said in another way, if truth were agreed upon, we could never admit we disagree with it! And so, mathematics is a play field of curious minds, who ultimately don\u2019t mind about truth, because truth is just as abstract as the mathematics that claims to derive or study it. And as such, mathematics remains a useful tool, for which the most fantastic applications can never extinguish the curiosity that gave birth to it. Hence it will never be able to deliver any truth; for that would be its death. ",
