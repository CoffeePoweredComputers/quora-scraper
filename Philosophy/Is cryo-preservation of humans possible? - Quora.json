            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know. We know that we don\u2019t currently have the ability to restore cryopreserved bodies or brains. We have no way of knowing whether in the future it will be possible to restore the bodies and brains that we have frozen. Neither do we know if there is some better preservation technique that will make restoration possible. For the second time this week I have reason to quote Clarke\u2019s First Law: When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong. Arthur C. Clarke ",
