            "answer_text": "It depends on what you plan to do with your degree and why you want to pursue sociology in the first place. Sociology is a fascinating subject. You will learn about how societies are formed and how they function. You will learn a lot about the world around you. You will meet a lot of interesting people and learn new perspectives that you had never thought about before. Is sociology marketable after college? I will be honest with you: in most fields it is not. If you plan on going into social work then obviously an undergraduate degree in sociology will be helpful but to actually practice, you will need to get a master\u2019s degree at least. (By practice I mean actually take case work). Social work does not pay very much. It\u2019s usually around $30,000-$40,000 a year. Depending on where you went to school, you might have a lot of student debt. Plan to be paying that debt for a long time if you are a social worker (however there is student debt forgiveness for government workers after a certain period of time). Most social workers don\u2019t get into this field for the money: they do it because they love the job. If you have a passion for social work - sociology is the degree for you. But it can be depressing, stressful and a lot of people end up getting burnt out quickly. You go in expecting to change the world but the reality is that the laws surrounding social work in America are very constricting. There is only so much you can legally do and there\u2019s never enough funding. Do not have too high of expectations. If you are not planning on pursuing a career in social work then I would strongly advise not getting a degree in it. Take a few classes if you like the subject, but the degree itself is kind of worthless on its own. You should plan to get a degree in something that is in demand and that you will be able to find a job quickly after graduating. Obviously all the science majors are great candidates - pre-Med would probably be my top choice if I had the money to do it all over again. Education is also a great choice - teaching has some awesome benefits (summers and holidays off, great health benefits, pension) although a teaching salary is quite low as well. But schools are ALWAYS looking for new teachers - especially in the sciences! I did love my sociology classes and my professors. The courses I took were all engaging and I really learned a lot. But I had so much trouble finding a job after college and while part of it is because I am not the best at marketing myself, a lot of it was probably due to my degree as well. Do your research before picking your major. Know what\u2019s in demand, know how many jobs are in that field available now and what the projection is for when you graduate. Know how much the average salary is. Know how people in that field feel about their job: do they love it? Is there a good work-life balance? Even find out what the top companies are so you\u2019re prepared to start applying a few months before you graduate. The more prepared you are, the better off you\u2019ll be. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for this question. You have forced me out of my closet. I have a degree in Sociology. It took many years for me to accept that was such a foolish decision. Now it is great that some of the responses are positive. Good for them. But I am going to tell you the truth. You can go to about any four year gov. U and study Sociology. But you cannot go to any four year gov. school and study capitalism. Capitalism will teach you how to live and achieve and find value you in yourself as an individual. Capitalism regards the importance of the individual. Sociology is only a continuation of statist indoctrination that had been going on from K through 12. Sociology is the science of the group over the individual. I do NOT care what any prof in Sociology will tell you. Decisions in life are made by individuals. Groups do NOT make decisions. Sociology demeans the individual and praises sacrifice of the individual to the group. How could it be otherwise? Worthless sociology departments exist in universities because universities are giant bureaucracies that live off of tax payers. Sociologists produce no wealth but they do promote Socialism. The U Wyo Sociology Dept. in the middle of nowhere promotes the Frankfort School of Education. That is what is more commonly called \u201ccultural marxism\u201d today. You study Sociology you will learn a lot of absolutely backward primitive approaches to life that the soc. profs will promote as new and cutting edge. You won\u2019t make a living at Sociology because sociology is worthless. The profs are going to be resentful because they know they are inferior to those who actually produce value; I suspect some are a bit misanthropic. I had to go back to study engineering. I accept that I made a mistake; I thought the subject could be interesting and it fit my indoctrinated thinking. It has taken decades to understand what is wrong with socialism and why the U will never teach capitalism. Mainly because universities are not capitalist and do not create wealth. The profs are bureaucrats that live off the wealth of capitalists. And that bugs them. You will not only be wasting your time in Sociology you are going to be more ignorant of the real world when you get out. You are going to have less self respect as a human being and be more resentful of those who outperform you in the market place. You are going to learn that individualism and property rights and freedom and capitalism is bad and that communism and socialism and statism is utopia. I suppose Economics would be an improvement over sociology. at least you would know about central banking and how the government screws its citizens. Uh maybe not. I am pretty sure economics could be a fabulous worthwhile course of study except most economics departments are going to make sure you don\u2019t gain an appreciation of capitalism. There are a couple of exceptions. But you won\u2019t learn anything useful in economics at U Wyoming. The primitive professors there do not even believe that a free market in education is possible. Good luck!!! ( if you like the idea of sociology go read a book on it.. spend serious time learning about capitalism. That will make you wealthy and happier and successful and you will finally learn how the real world turns. ",
