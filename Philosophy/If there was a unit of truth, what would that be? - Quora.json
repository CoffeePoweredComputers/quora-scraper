            "answer_text": "The unit you are looking for is the \u201cverified statement\u201d - a sub unit of the bigger mass of possible statements in your language. A statement that makes sense, can have values and these can be true or false. That is why \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d options can do the job - that\u2019s why we can digitize things. Ludwig Wittgenstein - Wikipedia spoke of atomic statements, since you can usually break down bigger statements into smaller ones. This is a typical diagram of a chess match - a visual depiction. It consists of atomic statements:  \u2026you can break it down into these statements. If the diagram is a true representation then there is a black rook on a8,black queen on c8black king on g8black pawn on a7\u2026The number of verified statements is not infinite. Your descriptive language decides how detailed, how granulated your description is getting (like the language above does not qualify what pieces we are using - could be Bauhaus chess or usual tournament pieces - but that again could be done in a more sophisticated language).

            "answer_text": "The single unit of truth is an agreement between two conscious life entities. A single life entity, like Adam, in the Garden of Eden, can hypothesize about truth, but without anyone to agree, it's only half true. One Eve arrives in the garden, Adam and Eve might agree on something, making it true for both of them, a single complete unit of truth. Of course and truth is subjective, and when more than two people search for truths, there will be many found, and many in opposition as well. That's how truth works. By agreement, and by disagreement. To your health, Tracy Founder: Healthicine ",

            "answer_text": "There are two major theories of what constitutes truth, the correspondence theory, where claims are compared to their real worl referents and the coherence theory, where consistency with other knowledge is key to determining the truth. Given this rubric a unit of truth might be called an \u201cent\u201d to suit either of those conditions. You could imagine counting up some number of verifiable cases where claims correspond and treating those cases as correspondent units or a similar process for coherent cases. ",
