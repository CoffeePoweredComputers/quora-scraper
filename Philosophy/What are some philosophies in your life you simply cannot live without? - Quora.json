I have everything I need.It's beautiful but I can't possibly own all the beautiful things in the world.But the biggest question I keep asking myself constantly is: Is fear stopping you? Are you making this choice out of fear? If the answer is yes, I choose a different path. To sum it up: No fear. No regrets. Let it go. ",
