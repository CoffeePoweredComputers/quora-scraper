            "answer_text": "To me it seems problematic if Comte is saying that science is the key to understanding, while attempting to do philosophy and sociology (Perhaps political science, anthropology, and I believe all while using history.). All of that seems to run afoul of fundamental principles of scientism which limits us to the hard sciences (biology, chemistry, and physics). The only way out of this contradiction is determining how Comte defined science. At the very least, it makes it difficult for someone to integrate Comte as a justification for positivism or scientism, given Comte\u2019s admitted understanding of the value of other branches of inquiry.  There is also the issue of ethics and metaphysics. An internal debate reveals the following: Positivism dispute - Wikipedia  There\u2019s also this: The antipositivist tradition continued in the establishment of critical theory, particularly the work associated with the Frankfurt School of social research. Antipositivism would be further facilitated by rejections of 'scientism'; or science as ideology. Which continues: J\u00fcrgen Habermas argues, in his On the Logic of the Social Sciences (1967), that \"the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only hermeneutically ... access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone.\" [10] The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman argued that \"our innate tendency to express moral concern and identify with the Other's wants is stifled in modernity by positivistic science and dogmatic bureaucracy. If the Other does not 'fit in' to modernity's approved classifications, it is liable to be extinguished.\" [11] Source: Antipositivism - Wikipedia To be fair, this deserves a deeper exploration and unpacking. Finally, Jonathan Swift, CS Lewis, and every dystopian sci fi novel and movie points to significant problems with this as well. Brave New World certainly come to mind and speaks to the problems and collateral damage of a society run on the principles of behaviorism. Oh\u2026and critiques of behaviorism in some sense answer \u201cpositivism\u201d and \u201cscientism.\u201d Those who left the positivist school when the verificationist principle turned out to be a failure, also highlighted its problems.
