            "answer_text": "You cannot do that just by looking at the outcomes. If you look at some dice on a table, there is no way telling which ones are normally rolled showing a random result and which ones are deliberately placed in their positions. To make the distinction you have to investigate the history of the outcomes, whether they are products of a random process or decided by someone. ",
