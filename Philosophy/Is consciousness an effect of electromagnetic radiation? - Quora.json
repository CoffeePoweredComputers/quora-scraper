            "answer_text": "Almost certainly not. Some philosophers think physics, including electromagnetism, could be an effect of consciousness. That aside, all we know about consciousness is that certain patterns of atoms which we call human bodies come with self-awareness. These patterns are dynamic and include flows of ions but it is unclear that charge, carried by ions or other particles has anything intrinsic to do with consciousness. ",

            "answer_text": "If we define consciousness as awareness as no body really knows what it actually is, then we can say electromagnetic fields will be used to create noise that will disrupt our awareness. In otherways it can improve our awareness. Really it will affect your consciousness depending on how you choose to relate to it, and whether you develop a healthy relationship to it. ",
