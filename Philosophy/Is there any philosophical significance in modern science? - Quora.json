            "answer_text": "Not really. Not in a literal way. Philosophy does not apply, except considering that the scientific method itself is a form of philosophy. The scientific method is a means of using foundational understanding to furthering our understanding through developing creative hypotheses (which must be testable and falsifiable [as in being able to be shown either true or false]), developing a means to test the hypotheses, then predicting the outcome of the tests. Once an outcome is achieved it is compared to the prediction and accepted or discarded. You might notice that the above description is a philosophy in a way. \"We vow to adhere to these certain mannerisms for the sake of our ____.\" But alternate philosophies competing with science can only corrupt the pure and proven scientific method. Once cannot apply a Buddhist \"this is sufficient\" philosophy to genomics, for example. Each branch of science may have a varying tolerance for alternate philosophies. Mathematics has zero overlap with philosophy, as far as I know. But psychology, anthropology, and similar sciences have quite a lot of overlap. In this case it may be detrimental to the accumulation of understanding if a philosophy inhibits it in whichever way. People being human, though, we are always never free from applying bias, personal whims, past experience, assumptions, and personal belief structures to the scientific method. Although the risk is present, it can be reduced through diligence and reinforcement from the scientific communities. This is why peer-review, diversity of personnel, and globalized, crowd-sourced science communities are valuable. There's never a shortage of people willing to tell you to \"get your head out of your ass!\" ",
