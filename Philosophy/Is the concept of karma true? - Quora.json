            "answer_text": "There have been several questions about karma in the Quora forum. While different questions have been worded differently, you will find your answers there. For your immediate curiosity, let me tell you that the concept of karma is absolutely true. Only the interpretations may be different, confusing readers and making karma appear as a hypothetical idea. Karma is a law of cause-effect, not only for the individual but for the collective. When we try to understand karma, many people imagine it to be a law of nature that governs individuals, and ignore the collective. It is never a tit-for-tat law, though that\u2019s exactly how it is if you are able to see all the \u201ctits\u201d (causes) and all the \u201ctats\u201d(effects). The impact of collective cause-effect is also suffered (or enjoyed) by the individual, because an individual doesn\u2019t exist in isolation. It is perfectly mathematical and works in clockwork precision and in an absolutely fair manner, if one can see all the intervening forces in action. Effects give rise to further causes, and so on, unendingly. It acts over the time dimension (obviously), and over three worlds of nature (not so obvious, as people do not recognise the existence of so many worlds of nature). They are the physical world, the astral world and the mental world. While these are the fundamentals stated very briefly, the way different individuals visualise or understand karma can vary a lot. It may help if you can read through all my answers to karma-related questions in Quora listed below. You may read relies of others too, as they present their different view points on the subject. Make your own judgment, come to your own understanding about karma. The karma-related questions I have answered are: How true had karma been in your life?If everything has to be decided by karma, then what is the role of God in our life?Why does Godnot help me in destroying my bad karmas?Will Karma eventually punish those who have wronged us?\"Howpeople treat u is their karma, how u react is urs\" what if their treatment hurts/disturbs me?

            "answer_text": "The word karma means activity. The Law of Karma is the law that governs activity. The law of Karma states that for every action there is a corresponding reaction. In simple words, Lord Jesus Christ said, \u201cAs you sow, so shall you reap.\u201d Newton\u2019s third law of motion is also similar, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law that governs, the reactions to our actions in this world, is called the law of Karma. According to the law of Karma, we have the freedom to choose our responses within a given situation. But the reactions to those responses come automatically to us according to the law. The situations are out of our control and our attitude to that situation is within our control. We have no freedom to choose our situation and we have the freedom to choose our response or our attitude in that situation. Once we have made our choice we have no control over the reaction we will get. The reaction comes by the law of Karma. We can choose to sow our seeds, but then we have to accept the fruits of what we reap. We cannot sow one seed and expect to get another fruit. That is beyond our control. The law of Karma controls that. If we sow a mango seed, we shall surely get a mango fruit. If we sow a neem seed we shall surely get a neem fruit. It is foolish to sow a neem seed and expect a mango fruit. As you sow, so shall you reap. Thus, whatever we get in life is because we have sown those kinds of seeds in the past which are fructifying now For example, we have the freedom to choose to jump from the 10th floor of a building. However, once we jump, what happens to us is beyond our control. Once we have chosen our response then the reaction is totally out of our control. We are sure to get our reactions based on cumulative result of our present response and our previous actions. It is wrong or incomplete to see law of Karma as an isolated case of action reaction. Law of Karma is a continuous chain that keeps track of all our actions and responses of all our past births also and gives each person the exact reaction at the correct time, place and circumstances. One can only begin to imagine the mind-boggling data and execution performed by the law of Karma involving all the countless living entities in the material world! Let\u2019s consider a less-known incident during the tsunami disaster that happened in the Indian subcontinent a few years ago. On the morning of that disaster, just before the tsunami struck, some scuba divers went scuba diving into the ocean to look for jewels. When they went under water, they suddenly felt a force pushing them upwards. They struggled to resist the force till it subsided. Then they went deeper under water, did their work, came back to the surface of the ocean and swam back to the coastline \u2013 only to find that there was no coast line! While they were under the water, the tsunami had devastated everything. Just consider, the tsunami killed those who were on the land, but those who were under the water were unharmed! If these Scuba divers had ventured into the ocean a little later or a little earlier, they would have been on the surface when the killer wave hit. But by their karma they were not supposed to die at that time, so although they were closest to the tsunami, they did not die. Another even more amazing example: During an earthquake in Gujarat, there was a mother who had a small baby sucking on her breast. Suddenly the earthquake struck and a column of the roof fell on the mother. The mother died on the spot. Almost twenty-four hour later, when the rescue workers worked their way down to the debris, they found the mother dead and the infant moving his hands and legs holding on to his mother\u2019s breast. The infant is so tender that one small blow can prove fatal for him, yet there it was safe amidst a quake that proved fatal for many healthy adults. What we learn from incidents like these is that although natural calamities kill in mass, they don\u2019t kill blindly. Only those who have the kind of karma for which they have to die at that particular time will be killed. This is an example of mass karma. Mass karma involves a group of people who have done different kinds of bad karmas. The reaction of their karma is that they are all supposed to die. But material nature gives that reaction to many people efficiently in one stroke through a calamity. For example, all such people may be brought together in one airplane and that airplane will crash. The person who is not supposed to die will not be on that flight perhaps because his car broke down on the way to the airport and he missed the flight. In this way, karmana daiva netrena \u2013 the law of karma acts under the divine supervision of the Lord. Even in a mass calamity, not one person is killed blindly; everyone gets the reactions of their own karma. ",
