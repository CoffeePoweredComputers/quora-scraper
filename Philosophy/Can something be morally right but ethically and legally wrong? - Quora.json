            "answer_text": "This question is very tricky. I feel it depends on an individuals code of ethics and morals. The legal part we have no power to change. I guess I would say yes a person can do something that is morally right but legally and ethically wrong. The example I will use is the when the chemist for Big Tobacco Jeffrey Wigand told the world that the owners were lying and they knew that smoking kills people. I would say he did this from a moral point of view. He felt obligated to tell the world the truth about how cigarettes cause Cancer and a host of other diseases. He did worry about his confidentiality agreement which was lawfully binding. Wigand chose to disobey his agreement to keep his research findings confidential. He felt morally obligated to keep the public informed of the inconsistencies with what Big Tobacco failed to report about the hazards of cigarette smoking. Wigand had to not only decide to break his lawfully binding agreement I assume that he felt ethically responsible to adhere to the terms of this confidential agreement. Confidentiality agreements are put in place to protect. In this case his contract was to protect the integrity of Big Tobacco. If one is to look at the case between Jeffrey Wigand and Big Tobacco it clearly answers this question. In this case the answer is YES someone can do something that is morally right but in fact ethically and legally wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Moral action and ethical action are related, but are not the same thing. For example, it may be ethical under common business practices to evict someone who does not pay their rent, but one may feel that evicting a single mother in the time of COVID-19 is an immoral act. An action may be legal, but unethical and immoral, such as refusing to serve a black person at a lunch counter in 1957. Morals are often rooted in culture and religion. Sex before marriage may be considered immoral by Catholics but not by Jews (I don\u2019t actually know if this is true; I\u201dm just making up an example). A man of 24 years may legally have sex with a 17 year old girl, because both are over the age of consent, but most people would argue it is unethical for the man to do so, because of the difference in age. In some US states, this would be illegal anyway. Morality, ethics, and legality are so complicated it is difficult to do them justice in a Quora answer. Even in daily life, morals and ethics can be complex. I have found that one way to follow a moral and ethical way of life is to follow some Buddhist precepts. These are similar in content to the Hebrew (and Christian) 10 Commandments, but they do not carry the weight of the concept of sin or the threat of hell (or reward in some kind of afterlife). Your mileage may vary. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it depends on situation to situation Morals are very firm and . any non legal works done for a good reasons and pure heart For that even if you are ethically and legally wrong , at the end it must not harm the laws Is exceptable in this world. I remember when I was young about in my mid twenty . A old person was walking in front of me ,while crossing the signal he was hit by a bicycle and the cyclist peddled of and ran away.I saw the blood from his elbow and helped him , but the wound was deep and needed to be hospitalizations I did not wanted the situation to get worst and it was late around 10.30 pm I request many cars to stop and help this person who was injured but no one came to help Out of frustration I stoped a BMW and I was shouting for help and I forced my self and the old man into the BMW and requested the driver to take us to the nearest hospital to get this injured person some medical aid. So morally I was in a helping mode but legally I was going against the law by stopping and forcing some one else against his will. I was stanger to both the injured person and the BMW owner . Hope dear you got the point ? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes there are many professional cases. Firstly let's discuss whats the basic difference between these two - so ethically correct means which in terms of profession is correct it mayb wrong also ; and morally correct means which actually is correct, which our pure values teaches us things which are correct. Now taking up the example - Let's take up the example of law profession. The ethics of this profession teaches that the lawyers have to defend their clients wheather the clients are right or wrong. Like in case of criminals and corrupt politicians the lawyers already know about the inside story but still they support their clients (criminals ;corrupt politicians). So here lawyers are ethically right that they are defending their clients and saving them by presenting them but it is morally wrong because criminals and corrupt politicans should not be saved or defended. In case of euthanasia the patients are in dread of suffering of a long period so it's morally correct that doctor allow them to die by giving them certain drug because the suffering is so painful that it is unbearable but at the same time it is ethically wrong because for doctors is their job religion to save someone. Moreover in India euthanasia is not legally accepted. ",

As for the possibility of something being legally right but morally wrong? And vice versa? Slavery was once legal, but was and still is immoral. On a much more trivial level, it's illegal to walk through a pedestrian stop light, but not, unless dangerous, immoral. ",

But here are some that work for me: Abortion(in some states)Cannibalism of someone already deceased if necessary for survivalThese are lot harder to generate than I thoughtHelping others on non-curved tests/quizzes in primary and secondary education; the negative effect on others was negligible to nonexistent(at least the way my schools operated), and the positive effect on those helped far outweighed it.Giving a random stranger potential homework answers :P",

Ethics has to do with complying with social norms, legality is supposed to reflect social norms but often doesn\u2019t, whereas morals are about breaking universal laws pertaining to behavior. For example, it is ethical to give to charity. It is objectively morally wrong to hit someone with a baseball bat for not giving to charity. When breaking moral rules becomes custom, and an entire society is say committing genocide or whatever, then to be moral, one must be unethical. ",
