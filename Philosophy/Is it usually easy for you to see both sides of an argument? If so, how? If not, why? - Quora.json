            "answer_text": "Yes, I easily see both sides of an argument. BTW, Aristotle was famous for that. Often he explained the other side of an argument better than the opponent could! How can one get better at seeing both sides? Let\u2019s concentrate on arguments where you favor one side, but want to understand your opponent better. First, read good thinkers like Aristotle, to see how it\u2019s done.Suspend judgment while reading the other side. You may hate their premises, but ignore that. Don\u2019t let it interfere with following their logic. Often, BTW, they\u2019re not being logical; do your best to make sense of it anyway. Give them maximum benefit of the doubt while reading.With most important issues, there are millions of people on each side. They can\u2019t all be crazy and stupid! The other guy\u2019s view must make sense, even though ultimately it\u2019s wrong. If you firmly believe that, it makes finding that sense a lot easier.If you can talk with them, don\u2019t try to convince them they\u2019re wrong. That\u2019s almost always impossible anyway. Suppress your disgust and disagreement. Instead ask sympathetic, non-judgmental questions, and you\u2019ll get useful information. Later on you can tell them exactly what you think of them :-)Humans are all fundamentally the same. If someone believes proposition X, then so would you, in their circumstances. Usually there\u2019s really only one way to make sense of someone\u2019s \u2018wrong\u2019 view. For example, suppose people think it\u2019s ok to torture animals. How can this be? Clearly, they must not realize animals feel, just like we do. I mean, just one person might be a psychopathic sadist, but not millions. There has to be a logical reason; it can only be that they see animals as objects: chairs or tables. Probably because they\u2019ve never gotten to know any animals. See how easy it is? No matter how disgusting or weird an opinion might be, there\u2019s always some way to make sense of it. If you were in their situation, you\u2019d have the same \u2018stupid\u2019 opinion. If you firmly believe that, you\u2019ll find it a lot easier to put yourself in their place. ",

Practise using your brains and imagination to consider at least 4-6 sides to every argument. Take apart the data and the narrative as suggested (beautifully) earlier by Paul Shunamon. We always have a choice and and we can make better decisions and better choices if we have alternatives to choose from. Insist on alternatives. Push yourself to create 4-6 reasonable alternatives, then you can make good choice. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any choice\u201d is the single most popular rationale on the planet for doing stupid, vicious, hateful and destructive things. We always have a choice. That\u2019s \u201cresponsibility\u201d and you can exercise, practise and develop \u201cresponsibility\u201d by developing alternatives to choose from. ",
