            "answer_text": "The short answer is no. The longer answer is based on the question: \u201cwhere do I start to find happiness?\u201d Happiness is a fuzzy concept at best and have different meanings to different people. That is why there seems to be so many different answers to such a simple question. The fact that so many answers are on offer does not mean that any single one is incorrect, or exclusively correct. All of them are probably correct, some may simply be more applicable to a certain person or a certain set of circumstances than others. Would it then be helpful if we can define happiness? Then at least we would know where to start? I don\u2019t think so. We do not need a rigid, universally accepted definition of happiness. We don\u2019t even need a permissive definition and the reason is twofold. Firstly, happiness is not a destination. It is not a place where we can arrive after doing something specific, or after we have completed a set of tasks. It is not something we can acquire from outside, we cannot buy it online. We cannot receive it as a present. Secondly, happiness is simply a state of mind, an emotional state of wellbeing. It is represented by a range or a combination of emotions such as joy, contentment and love. Happiness exists within the mind. And this is where the journey starts - the understanding and accepting that happiness exists within the mind. The lack of pain will probably make our pursuit of happiness easier, but it cannot \u201ccreate\u201d happiness. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the ancient Greek philosophical schools called the Stoics and the Epicureans thought so. Epicurus said that when you were undisturbed in thought and suffering no pain or fear you were \u2018as happy as Zeus\u2019. They sought out an undisturbed state of mind, seeking spiritual disciplines that would allow them to overcome fear and face whatever suffering came with equanimity. For me, though I value lack of fear and would value lack of pain especially at this moment because my left sacroiliac joint is again giving me no end of bother, there is something more to true happiness: a sense of joy, not just absence of pain. For me that sense of joy comes with purpose, with creative effort, with moments of beauty. True serenity is more than the simple absence of pain. ",
