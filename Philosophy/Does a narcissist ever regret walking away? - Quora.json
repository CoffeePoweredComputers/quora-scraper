            "answer_text": "I feel like there is an implication in your question that regret is accompanied by personal loss and shame, or something deep. One of the hallmarks of NPD is an inability to face blame. The reasons for this are kind of complex and little bit outside of this question, but rest assured, shallow as it seems, they can\u2019t help this, it is a disorder after all. Interpersonal interactions have a very different purpose for narcissists, so their version of regret is much simpler: i.e. anger at a loss of control, boredom due to withheld supply, etc. They can\u2019t experience love like more neurotypical folks can, so they never feel a deep sense of loss from not seeing someone. The fix they get from any given person, even a prized primary supply, is always predicated on maximizing self-serving benefits. They don\u2019t empathize, etc. If a narcissist walks away from anything, a couple things (and any combination) are possible: They are boredThey have met someone they perceive as more interesting, or someone who will make them look and feel betterThere is some sort of specific benefit available for them, anything from familial, personal, professional; those things are generally not compartmentalized for narcissists the way they are for others.They are initiating a trauma part of the trauma-bond cycle and plan on hoovering the person back, causing psychological instability they hope to take control ofThey don\u2019t care either way about the person but are banking that their powers of manipulation will be able to get the supply back if necessaryThe last thought I have about narcissists in regards to ending of relationships is that, despite the way their actions seem to indicate a cavalier attitude, they actually really fear abandonment. For narcissists, pretty much all relationships are assumed to be an open door; other people are supposed to be perpetually available for their enjoyment, until those people, likely sick of abuse, make it clear that they aren\u2019t. This is when the narcissist experiences a bruised ego and uses it to endlessly siphon supply. They milk every bit of it they can from playing the victim, even after they\u2019ve abused. In this case, the person they\u2019ve split with is basically \u201cblack\u201d to them (I\u2019ve heard a few narcs use this expression). This is a result of the lack of whole object relations that is a cornerstone of the disorder. If they\u2019re the one controlling the discard and they walk away, the only way they might maybe \u201cregret\u201d things (momentarily) is if you move on to bigger better things and you're still on ok terms. I can guarantee the narcissist will be back if you let them, to benefit from being in close proximity with your success. But they\u2019ll be gone as fast as they came when something else comes along. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "In my personal experience.. Never seen that. Their world is very pinched closed and so focused on themselves they can't think that far. What's far??? One person in particular of the six who have crossed paths with me apparently dosnt care even a leeetle bit.. And in 9 years I havn't even had a birthday wish or even a note when Mamma died. Nil contact. Quiet. Silence. Not even a question or a comment of interest about my mother's estate, of which she is a co-inherited receiver. (sorry \u201ctaker\u201d) (purely by grace, double -digit DEMANDING it as a right). . I would give my eye teeth to know what goes through that mind these days. The person has left (immigrated) leaving behind the remainders of her blood family including her sister who is terminal and has gone no contact there as well. (passed on the responsibility to the sister\u2019s children.. Gone!). So then I asked a relative if Madaam intends ever coming back again even for a visit and was informed \u201dnooo! The situation is far too stressful\u201d No. I think self-ishness is is THE problem . All about self. Thinking about it I funnily enough actually,, still being silly enough to care a bit for her, I feel sorry for her because I put myself in the suppose situation (faint possibility) that, say just oneday she would look back and see the psychological damage she has caused and come face to face with the sin-guiltiness of her negligence of her sister\u2026 then how will that feel.???? I wouldn't like to have to go through that horrendous condemnation. In fact I doubt I could deal with it\u2026 I'm too sensitive for that. But then if you arnt then you arnt and then you would remain none the wiser. (I did read yesterday thst they actually switch off the guiltiness psrt in their brain as if it's been disabled) Narcisissists are pretty resilient on the whole. Good also at constantly creating new friendships they stay with just long enough to use and short enough not expose their true selves and won't hesitate to spit in the eye of anyone who sees through them (little social shining lights that attract others) but seem happy with the flightiness of temporary friendships, so long as the friendships leave themselves at the top of the tree.. Or they're gone. This person was a middle child and suffered from rejection all her life. That's the only reason I feel sorry for her. That reason. ",

I recall my ex-wife \u201cregretting leaving her agent\u201d after her new agent dumped her after two months\u2014when the reality was her previous agent left her! If they walked away and their circumstances turn, a narc will easily try to win back it\u2019s previous victim to fill the need. They get a high from duping their victim into believing their false narrative and promises of changing, only to repeat the abuse even worse afterwards for making the narc work so hard in winning you back. It\u2019s all a never ending cycle of abuse, love bombing and more abuse until you finally give up\u2026 or wake up and walk away\u2014and go NO CONTACT. ",
