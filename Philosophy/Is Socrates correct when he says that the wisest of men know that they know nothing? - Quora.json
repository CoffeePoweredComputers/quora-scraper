            "answer_text": "Socrates was referring to the idea that everything we believe is simply an opinion based off of our subjective perception of life. Perception is not reality, and none of us can say with conviction that we can define what reality truly is. All of our data and facts are, at the core, a series of highly educated guesses and theories that we've yet to disprove. However, this doesn't mean that they are true. This is a very wise way to see things, as it is common to see individuals blindly trumpeting beliefs that were passed down to them without even questioning themselves first. It's better to be open-minded enough to always allow for the possibility that some new information can invalidate everything we thought we knew. *Note: This answer represents nothing more than my interpretation of what Socrates might have been thinking. Obviously, I was not alive thousands of years ago to speak with him, verify that he did say this, and that this was the context he wanted the quote to be used in. I can't even prove that a man named Socrates ever existed. See what I mean? ",

            "answer_text": "This is not the kind of thing that a person can know. To the extent that Socrates holds that opinion, he holds it because that is the only way he feels that he can understand the Pythia\u2019s answer to Chaerephon\u2019s question concerning who is the wisest of men. The Pythia answers that Socrates is the wisest, and he struggles to discover the hidden meaning of this because he knows that he is not wise at all. Socrates reasons that the Pythia speaks for Apollo, who cannot be lying, as that is not in his nature. So, it must be true in some way that Socrates is the wisest of men. He concludes that the only thing he knows for sure is that he does not know anything worth knowing. Ironically, this is a thing that other supposed wise men do not know. So this is the area of knowledge where Socrates surpasses all others: he knows that he does not know, and he feels he knows this because Apollo has informed him of it. In order to discover if Socrates is correct in this, we must ask the Pythia ourselves. ",
