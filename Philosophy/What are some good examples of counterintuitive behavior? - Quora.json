            "answer_text": "I'm going to take \"counterintuitive\" to mean \"it doesn't seem like it should make sense, but it actually does\".  (most people answering seemed to take it to mean \"counterproductive\") Say I've got something to do that is high priority and prone to procrastination, like paying my bills which are already late. Instead of going straight to the task at hand, which I might finish in 15 minutes, I will instead do something lower priority, like cleaning and organizing my desk and office, which might take a couple hours.  Only then, will I pay my bills. By one measure, I'm being illogical...I should do the high priority task first.  However, I know that if I feel I have to start with the task I like least, I will instead procrastinate even more, and the bills will go unpaid for another day. Instead, I get started on the lower priority task, and when that is done, the sense of accomplishment, newly-cleaned work enviroment, and inertia makes me more inclined to do the less-pleasant task I would have otherwise procrastinated. It's counterintuitive (and might drive people crazy who observe me doing this), but it is actually quite effective. ",

            "answer_text": "Business sized envelopes marked URGENT or IMPORTANT are usually urgent or important...to the sender. Not me. Basically, \"Bill inside\". That's all it means. The more false sense of urgency is imparted in such communications, the less seriously I take it. It is a gimmick meant to play on fear or the sense that one must take care of such business IMMEDIATELY. Well, I'm sure the payee would appreciate that.  Thing is, they can't fool me because I've pulled the same stunts over the years when it comes to special offers and pricing promotions.  I'll pay, but Mr. IMMEDIATE URGENT goes to the back of the line.  ",
