            "answer_text": "The answer to this is the answer to which religion in essence is or has been founded on.If one delves into the two major aspects of human life that one begets to live from day one to the end is religion and science. Religion as lived even if one sees is subjective in nature, and science is objective in nature. The simplest division of subjective nature is selfishness, here selfishness is not to be confused with what religion harps about as a negative quality of human nature, but simply SELFIE as commonly seen in modern day world with the use of mobile/cell phone cameras This SEFIE ISHNESS is what is to be take as SUBJECTIVE NATURE or SUBJECTIVITY and rest all in being, irrespective of the quality of is being is OBJECTIVE NATURE or OBJECTIVITY. Science the knowledge of objective nature in being is what is clicked by the SELFIE-SHNESS ,subjectivity through out life, and what so ever may be the scenario in objectivity , the SELFIE will be different by nature of being, to validate this point, if one sees, no two voices, digestive systems, heart sizes etc etc are same, they may be but still some difference is there, the same goes for i.q, and other types of quotients in modern day parlance.The privy of a human being lives every thing else in nature as its SELFISH , SUBJECTIVE nature in being, the image of self included as seen and found in the MIRROR. No human being ever would have ,or could have seen his or her own image without a reflective medium , may it be water eyes of others etc , but without reflection the image of self, with its color, shape, size, features etc will not exist in human privy, the psych of a human being. Therefore all this clicked IMAGED SELFIE of a human form in and from objectivity is enlivened by human being. This IMAGED SELFIE-SHNESS is reciprocal , its in relativity ,with or without actions between two objective natures of being, is as diverse as diversity itself. This unseen circle , as a dog trying to catch its tail, goes on and on in life, the circle here can and encompass the whole world, whole universe in being. Hinduism says SAMSASRA , this world in being, in its circulation will always have the SAM- same SARA- summary or compendium or epitome in being, The subjectivity in being is objectivity in being, and objectivity in being is subjectivity in being, Hence end result zero/SHUNYA /one alone.
