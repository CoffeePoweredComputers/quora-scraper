            "answer_text": "I dont know how to measure how spiritual i am. But i want to do the next right thing. I obey the word of god. There are people who cry after sinning during repentance. They want true forgiveness. They really look for it. I want to be like them. I want God. I want to love him with everything i've got. But i'm unsuccessful in doing that. So tonight is the second night that i will spend fasting and praying so that my heart softens and i'm able to repent fully. Fasting and praying really helps. I have gotten many insights from my first fast and other things too. I forget some of these. This was my question a few days ago: At what point can we definitely say: yes, I'm not a lukewarm Christian. Since we are not saved by our own efforts, there is always something that needs to be worked on.how can we ever know that we have reached that level where we will be saved by Jesus's grace? I know for a fact that the holy spirit is within me, because I have had a vision of it. It is a super polite and super loving me and glitters like ocean waves and speaks several languages at once. Anyways, my point is I still lust like a normal person(20-40 times a day, i commit adultery in my heart) And many other sins. So I think that having the holy spirit doesn't mean that you are saved. Mon, sept 21,4.15 pm Has My Sexual Sin Made Me Unsavable? After reading this, i confirmed my thoughts, that i'm lukewarm. I tried to tell God(actually i do this everyday): God i want to love you with everything i've got. You are the most amazing and the most desirable being in the entire universe. Why dont i love you? If not love then i want to be completely devoted to you. I thought that we could never escape being lukewarm, that there will always be something to be worked upon, so stop worrying. After reading the above article, i prayed: God dont leave me behind ever. Dont let me go to hell. I want to be faithfull and i want to love you with everything i've got. Please please please please(like a fanatic). Then as i read esau's story in the article i realized i just wanted the gifts of God, the kingdom of heaven, the security. I did not want God. I mean i could live with not being with God if everything was alright. Not a bid deal for me. So i dont know how to repent. I dont really feel truly sorry that i lusted. So how can i repent. I really want to repent. I want to be good. Once or twice this year i got emotional for a second or two, by imagining that Jesus, died for my sins. Thats a super great sacrifice and i thought, i will never abandon him. But that was it. I think it was not a mere crucifiction. Haven't there been more painful events on earth? Why is the devil frightened of the cross. I think it was great because of the great wrath God poured upon him on the cross when darkness fell i think on the ninth hour. Also There almost happened a great seperation when jesus cried out: father why have you forsaken me. All this is still a great mystery in my mind. I digressed. Why dont i want God. I mean i can do without him. Why? There was a certain sincerity that i felt when i was a kid that is now gone i think. I felt it a day or two ago when i sang along with hymns playing on my laptop. I think that is it. Singing the hymns will give me back that sincerity? Maybe then i will be able to do true repentance. In my mind true repentance is feeling sorry and sad for having sinned and then asking god for forgiveness and deliverance. I dont feel sad at all. Thats a problem i think. Does anyone know what i shoud do? These were the answers i got after fasting: Through the blood of jesus, i have been redeemed out of the hands of the enemy. Through the blood of jesus, i am justified,aquitted,not guilty,reckoned righteous,made righteous, just as if i had never sinned. I should be fasting my mind from the internet too. Gtg. ",
