            "answer_text": "Correlation is a description of the linear association between two variables (perhaps controlling for another variable, or perhaps not).  A correlation goes from 0 to 1 and can be positive or negative.  We can say correlation is -1 to 0 to +1.  The correlation can be squared (which makes a minus sign disappear) and then if you multiply it by 100 it gives you the degree of association between the two variables.  But you must not forget what the sign was (negative or positive) before you squared it, because that tells you the nature of the association, namely positive or negative.  If an association is negative it means that high values of one variable go along with small values of the other variable (and vice versa).  If the association is positive it means that high values of one variable go along with high values of the other variable (and low values go along with low values). So there is a high positive association between salt intake in your diet and blood pressure - let\u2019s say 49%.  So high values of salt intake predict high blood pressure, and it is reliable 49% of the time.  (The correlation is +.70) Lets look at exercise and blood pressure - there is a high negative association.  Let\u2019s say it is 64% (so the correlation is -.80) and that means that lots of exercise predicts low blood pressure and it is reliable 64% of the time.  Why only 64% of the time?  Well because there are other factors affecting blood pressure too - such as genetics, stress, diseases. (Later on in statistics you\u2019ll discover that when we say one variable predicts another, we are talking about a regression equation.  So correlation tells you how well linear regression can predict a variable). I hope this helps you understand that correlation describes association - telling you how reliable the association is (predictability) as well as the direction (nature) of the association. One final note - correlation does not mean causality (there may be causality or not).  Storks like to nest in nice, warm chimneys and therefore in high population centres you might see a lot of storks!  But that does not mean that storks bring (cause) babies to appear!  It is just an association between seeing lots of storks and the place having loads of babies!  You can make experiments to help you decide if a correlation involves some degree of causation or not.

This word has been widely used in academic, research world. Whereas, the word \u2018relationship\u2019 means the relation between two persons or things. This one talks about the bondage, connection or relationship with each other. It talks about the intimacy or closeness between two persons or things. This one is often used in general context.
