            "answer_text": "None of us sees the world as it is. One example: An average atom occupies about 4 trillion times the space of its nucleus. For perspective, if this atom were about eight blocks across (about 2/5 of a mile), its nucleus would be the size of a tennis ball, and each electron (and each of the quarks that makes up a proton or neutron) would be the size of a small grit of sand. Thus, all the \u201csolid\u201d material of the world is mostly empty space, and its actual mass is tiny in size. We don\u2019t see the world this way, but that\u2019s how it is. More than this, everything I know about a rock is perceived as reflected light (entering my visual receptors) or a tactile/kinesthetic reception, both of which pass through my perceptual mechanism, then enter my brain, where I form a mental \u201cpicture\u201d of the rock. Then, there\u2019s an added complication. My brother loves liver and it makes me retch. We both perceive the same thing differently, although we agree it\u2019s liver. Same thing with the rock. There\u2019s no way to know how differently you and I actually perceive anything about the world. We may agree on a name for something, but that\u2019s not any indication that we \u201csee\u201d it the same way \u2014 just like liver. So, no, I wouldn\u2019t say I am fooling myself. What I am saying is that, whatever the world is, it is \u2014 but I\u2019m under no illusion that I know fully what it is. Here\u2019s the interesting part \u2014 we still have to do the laundry. We still live, and our awareness is awesome. I watched a brilliant and windy sunrise this morning. All the atoms aligned and showered upon me such beauty that I was speechless. Then a cat sat in my lap and purred as my wife and I drank our morning coffee. These things are as real as it gets. So, to paraphrase Heraclitus, it is and is not a morning in the world. Now, you tell me. Am I fooling myself or not? ",

Since I study such things, and write about them, I know this is True, but also deal with waves as though they were hard matter-like bits of Energy and thoughts as though they were not mostly aspects of Pure Information fields (more Spirit than anything). In a world where some are trying to come to grips with the apparent reality that we have data and equations to describe only about 4.6% of the Energy and matter that must be in this universe, for it to behave as it does; we still have blockheads telling us that they know just about everything there is to know (well except for the unimportant 95.5% that is irrelevant! LoL! How can 95.5% be irrelevant? From that, and more troubling understandings, yes, we are fooling ourselves! Trust me, for a while, however; it is way worse than it sounds! So laugh a lit! ",

            "answer_text": "I see the world roughly the same way that anyone else with human eyes and senses see it; that\u2019s part of the bargain a soul accepts when it incarnates. The animal body the soul bonds to has sensory functions sufficiently accurate to keep that species of animal (in our case, H. sap sap) around as a successful survivor. That\u2019s all the \u201creality\u201d that\u2019s required. Is that \u201cfooling ourselves\u201d? I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s an example of accepting the conditionality of existing on the physical plane, which is all about conditions: under these particular conditions you can light a fire; under those, you cannot. Exactly what constitutes those conditions, apart from your senses\u2019 apprehension of them, is interesting and often useful to think about, but the pressures challenging our survival determine how our senses work to preserve us. IMO, souls come here via incarnation exactly to experience the power and beauty of conditionality, which may not be encountered anywhere else that souls exist except on the physical plane. ",

I did have few unusual dreams, and few unusual things happened in real life also (few times other people also saw them, not just me).. I'm not fooling myself with my perception, why would you think I am? for example, I see USA as new Hitler, and I know very well that most people in USA would disagree, so what? I don't claim my perception of USA, and USA role in the world to be the absolute truth.. many people outside of USA, especially people from countries affected by sanctions and wars initiated by USA, would agree with my perception.. etc.. we don't have to have identical views, but we do need to have tolerance while discussing our differences.. all the best to you!!!
