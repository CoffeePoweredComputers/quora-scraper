            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A: It depends on redeemed by whom. Our justice system says X number of years in prison has redeemed them in the eyes of society. It does - I have some problem with people who have paid their penalty having further penalties. If that isn\u2019t enough, it should be more, but it isn\u2019t so it shouldn\u2019t be. Someone very wisely pointed out that there is almost always motive. This is why there is first degree murder - that person has had time to soberly consider what they are about to do. Otherwise, it seemed like a good idea at the time. And, a more qualified person could answer this better than I, but nobody ever thinks they are going to get caught. Likely a lengthy prison term has disabused them of that notion. I think that the redemption within whatever belief system they hold is very true. If you have changed your ways, then your circumstances change too. People just love to make fun of god forgiving someone, but I think this holds true period. The hardest part is likely forgiving yourself. That\u2019s the hardest, and is always the hardest. As far as making it up to society (which helps in making it up to yourself, in forgiving yourself) I have had a number of things in my life that I have done that caused me great guilt and disquiet. I can\u2019t speak to having murdered or raped anyone, because I haven\u2019t. But I have been very surprised that there are often other ways that we can make it up, feel redeemed, and as best we can, actually even out what we have done. Maybe we have come to understand that we had terrible anger issues - we can help others who have anger issues. Maybe we stole - and I mean white-collar crime - and we can somehow devote our time to giving away, pro bono, whatever white-collar skills we have to the community. Maybe we beat our wife - we can dedicate ourselves to treating women, and helping others to learn to treat women, in a mature adult respectful real fashion. And last but not least, in knowing that there is at least something that can be done to redeem our own selves, we can help guide others to know that possibility even exists. If there is a silver-lining, if we are a murderer we have credibility at having been there. That means people are open to listening to us, and maybe we can help them have a better life. You\u2019d be surprised. It may take an awful lot, but I do not believe there is such a thing as being beyond redemption. There is always hope and possibility. ",

            "answer_text": "When a person kills someone there is normally something called a motive. That is to say a reason that the killing happened. Depending on the situation a person may become sorry for what they did and eventually released from prison once their sentence is served. After that it is up to them to live a better life. I do think that the sentences for murder should depend on the situation like all other crimes. However even if a short time after the murder they are truly repentant for their actions that doesn\u2019t mean that the person should not face the legal consequences for what they did. When it comes to the death penalty I don\u2019t believe that it should occur. Instead the people that kill another should be permitted time to understand how horrible the act they committed was. As well as ensuring that no one is put to death wrongly. These days there is a lot of stories of falsely accused people in prisons due to wrongfully being convicted and then DNA testing proving their innocence. In the future there may be further situations involved a greater knowledge then we have now that can help prove or disprove a criminal act. Then what if the system killed someone innocent? I don\u2019t think we are sorry is really good enough. Furthermore there is already cases in which people may have actually been innocent and put to death. ",

            "answer_text": "The punishment of the sin gets cancelled in two ways. One way is to rectify the sin if there is possibility of rectification and repent followed by no repetition of the sin. The other way is to repent for the sin and not to repeat it again in case there is no possibility of rectification of the past sin. In both ways, repentance and not repeating are essential. If there is possibility of rectification, the punishment of the sin cannot be totally cancelled by mere repentance and not repeating. If you keep the sinful money, you should return it to God. If the sinful money is lost, mere repentance and not repeating are sufficient. Ravana killed Jatayu, the bird. He cannot give life to Jatayu. Rectification of the sin is impossible. If he repents for the sin and does not kill any living being after this, the punishment for killing Jatayu gets cancelled. Ravana stole Sita. He can return Sita to Rama. This is the sin with the possibility of rectification. After returning Sita, he should repent and should not steal any lady again. By this, the punishment of this sin gets cancelled. Some people repent and do not repeat the sin without rectification even though the possibility of rectification exists. Such repentance and no repetition become useless to some extent. If you do not repeat the sin after repentance, the punishment is partially reduced. Some people go on repenting but repeat the sin again and again. They think that the confession and repentance cancel the sin. It is totally false. Rectification of the sin if there is possibility, confession and repentance and not repeating the sin will totally cancel the sin and its punishment. Mere confession and repentance are theoretical and have no value. They should reflect in practice. Even if you don\u2019t rectify the past sin, at least not repeat the sin in the future, will partially reduce your sin and punishment. Without the practical aspect, there is no trace of concession. Regarding the hard earned money also, you can sacrifice to God not by rule but by love. In fact, you should sacrifice to God here also as per rule. If you sacrifice your hard earned money to your family members, who serve you, how much service is rendered by God to you? You cannot even imagine. However, you will not get any punishment for not donating to God from your hard earned money. If you give your hard earned money to your family members, you will be rewarded with the temporary heaven. If you follow the rules of pravrutti, temporary heaven is the fruit. But, if you donate to God from your hard earned money, the grace of God on you shall be the fruit, which is permanent. Therefore, at least you should partially donate to God from your hard earned money to get some grace of God. Kannappa earned the food by hunting, which was not given to his family members and even he did not eat it in spite of intensive hunger. He donated all the hard earned food to God and attained the permanent grace of God. In fact, God does not need anything from you except to test your love to Him. Even though God is also your first family member, avoiding God in practice in the case of donation of hard earned money, you will not acquire any sin. If you do not give your hard earned money to your family members, who serve you with love and affection, it is a sin. But, this is a sin with respect to the human beings in this world, which is pravrutti. If you bring the case of God, even according to the rules of pravrutti, God stands in the first place. Instead of giving your hard earned money to ungrateful outsiders, who often cheat you, you should give to your family members. If you do not give to your family members, it is a sin with respect to the other human beings and not with respect to God. Once the case of God is involved, nivrutti appears and all the pravrutti disappears. You should vote to your family and not to the outsiders. But, you should vote to God and not even to your family. The first is called as pravrutti and the second is called as nivrutti. If you violate pravrutti, you will earn sin. If you violate nivrutti, you will not earn any sin but will loose the eternal fruit. ",

            "answer_text": "When you say murderer, that includes a very broad spectrum of people that have actually taken another persons life. There are many types of murder. Murder in the First Degree, Murder in the Second Degree, Manslaughter, Murder as a Crime of Passion, Mass Murder, Serial Murder, etc\u2026 So, when you ask if a Murderer can be redeemed, I would say that depending on the circumstances, yes they can be! Obviously, someone that kills for the thrill of the kill, would not be. Someone that killed someone accidently, absolutely\u2026 Someone that kills as a crime of passion, sure, someone that kills after committing rape, sodomy and torture, absolutely not and these are good candidates for the death penalty. So, I believe that there are some that truly feel remorse and when they say they would never kill again, I would believe. Others, that show no remorse and say in no uncertain terms that they would kill again if ever given the choice? Hah, you tell me! ",
