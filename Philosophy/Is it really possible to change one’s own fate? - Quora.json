            "answer_text": "A PERSON WHO NEITHER PRACTICES CULTIVATION OF MIND AND CONDUCT NOR PERFORMS VIRTUOUS DEEDS, SHALL LEAD HIS LIFE DESTINED BY HIS FATE Caller: Master, if a person neither practices cultivation of mind and conduct nor performs any virtuous deeds, does it mean that he will lead a predestined life? Master Jun Hong Lu in guanyincitta: That\u2019s right. He will have to take what fate serves him. For example, if you are fated to die at the age of 33 and even though you are not aware of what cultivation is all about, you have been consistently performing virtuous deeds. When you encounter the karmic obstacle at the age of 33, you may be able to escape death, but end up being disabled. On the contrary, if you are fated to be doing fine at the age of 33 but you have been doing numerous bad deeds, when you encounter a karmic obstacle, you might not be able to survive the obstacle and you meet your fate. As such, it is highly dangerous to just leave life to fate, because you have absolutely no control over what is going to happen to you. As for us, being Buddhist practitioners, at least we are able to have control over our bad fate and destiny. That is why leaving life to fate is dangerous. Caller: Yes. There is a fellow practitioner who repeatedly dreamed about a traffic accident on the day before and on the day after his birthday. He then started to prepare himself by performing daily recitation of additional Little Houses and scriptures. Three days later, his car skidded on \u2018black ice\u2019 (a thin coating of glaze on the road surface) and crashed into the roadside. He escaped unscathed. The impending karmic calamity was averted just like that. Master Jun Hong Lu: You see? If you do not practise Buddhism and just let fate dictate you, you will end up meeting your fate in a traffic accident, just like how it appeared in your dream. Who is manipulating fate?  Over the history of mankind, how many people have cried, \u201cI want to strangle fate by the throat\u201d but after many hardships, admitted defeat to fate, and gave up on working hard? A netizen expressed in a letter, \u201cI became more negative after reading Liao Fan\u2019s Four Lessons, since my destiny is set, why do I need to work hard? It will happen if it is meant to be and if it is not meant to be, any work done will be useless.\u201d Many tragedies in history were attributed to the word, \u201cfate\u201d. It seems that fate is the root cause of mankind. Humans have simply blamed all our hardship from our careers, frustration from love, children\u2019s illness, family disputes and etc., all onto fate\u2019s account. It seems that we have become innocent victims teased by fate. Do we really have no control to what is happening to us, and have no ability to change it? In fact, we are the true writers of our own destiny, and only we can change it for ourselves. Fate is a cycle of fragments of process of this life, and in each reincarnation; we start a new stage play, in a new environment and as new character, with a new script, forgetting what we have compiled on our own, and mechanically following the requirements from the script and act on.  The basic law of fate Fate is the life of cause and effect strung together to form a road. Whether it is reincarnation or destiny, how it works is by following two basic rules, everything exists as a cycle and all living beings are included. These two laws are the basics of reincarnation, and in front if it, all living beings are equal and have no difference.   The first law of universe: The law of cause and effect, is one that everyone is familiar with, with a cause there is an effect, if you plant a melon you get a melon, if you plant beans, you get beans. The law of cause and effect is the iron law that thousands of nations all follow. There is no power that can block the cycle of cause and effect. If you plant an evil cause by treating your mother-in-law badly today, your consequence may be in your next life where you might have a bad relationship with your spouse. If you killed too much in the past life, you will be sick ridden this life. Because when a cause is created, there will be an effect. Even if you have superpowers, you will not be able to erase what will happen in your next life. So if you did a lot of bad deeds in the past life, you will be served with a blood disease, with no power to prevent this from happening. If someone or power is willing to help you remedy the effect, this will involve your blessings, and will create another cause and effect. The algorithm is complicated but it still follows the law of cause and effect, and ultimately, you will have to pay for the cause that you plant.  The second law of the universe: Justice; karma, vengeance is bitter sweet, it cannot be simply explained. Justice is a set of management system, detailed regulations states whatever that cause will leads to whatever effect, how much cause leads to how much effects and when you will get the effects. Justice not only regulates the cause and effect of one person, but also regulates a region, a dynasty, a country and even the world\u2019s karma. Natural disasters and manmade disasters are the causes due to the evil that societies have created; the greenhouse effect is one of the best examples. Everything is assigned into category by heaven. So if a person does a bad deed at one time, an evil idea has created, heaven will automatically arrange the effect due to the cause and create an effect that will affect the next life at a certain time of day. Similarly, good deeds and good merits will be rewarded at an arranged time.  So an effect is planted by our every thought, idea, and action; heaven will automatically transfer the effect to next life and schedule it to happen accordingly, this will become the \u201cfate\u201d of the next life. We would often say we have not done many good things or bad things, but there are many blank spaces in the timeline, this is why we will always feel like we have a lot of time in our life spent on waiting; such as waiting to go to school, waiting to take a test, waiting for graduation, waiting to meet the person of interest, waiting for change in career, waiting for the opportunity to come, waiting for child to be born\u2026 endless waiting, wasting the time and wasting life.

            "answer_text": "This is how the dictionary defines the word fate: the development of events outside a person's control, regarded as predetermined by a supernatural power:In the same way destiny is defined as: the hidden power believed to control future events; fateIs it possible to change one\u2019s own fate you ask? It really depends on one\u2019s own philosophy of life and what you believe in. Personally I truly believe in fate and destiny, and I do not believe we can change it. Of course every minute of every day we are making choices in our lives, but whether we make this choice or that, I think our fate is predetermined. Let me give an example. A bus came along and it was quite full, so I made a quick decision to miss it and wait another 20 minutes to get the next one. The bus that I missed was in a very serious accident and lots of people got critically injured. Was I saved because I made a really good decision, or was it my fate to be saved? What is to say that if I had got on the second bus, that would have been the one in the accident? How are we to know and change our decisions accordingly to live a care-free and incident-free life? It is impossible. There was a very good film out in 1998 called \u2018sliding doors\u2019. It was actually set in two halves, and it was about a woman, Gwyneth Paltrow was the actress, who was on her way to catch a train to return to her loved one at home. In sequence A she got on the train and it told the story of what happened. In sequence B she missed the train by a hairs breath, and it told a completely different scenario. And that basically I believe is the story of our life. Sometimes we live within the dynamics of a hairs breath. Sometimes we make the wrong choice, but it is a choice. Sometimes our choices are taken from us - we would have wanted to get on that particular train but were prevented. We can, after all said and done, change an awful lot about the way we live our lives, but we just cannot change our destiny. ",
