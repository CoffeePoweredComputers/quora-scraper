It would take 2 weeks for the aid to come but somehow they\u2019ve managed to collect some food from their wrecked ship. However, the food will only last them for a week unless one of them is dead. Peter realized it first and proceeds on killing John.  Doing everything for survival is naturally right. Killing is morally wrong. Peter is right and wrong at the same time at different viewpoints.

If someone finds it on YooToob (sic), please drop me the link! Anyhow: It\u2019s three camera angles of the same scene. Scene one: You see a guy running around the corner of a building and sprinting out of the image along the sidewalk. Scene two: Same situation, but you see how a car pulled up behind the guy, pointed at him and then the guy sprints away. So it looks like he\u2019s running away from the guys in the car. Scene three: Wide angle. You see what\u2019s happening. The guys in the car are not pointing at the sprinter, but past him, at a crane palette of bricks about to crash to the pavement, with a pedestrian underneath. The guys in the car point that out, shouting a warning. The guy sprints away and manages to save the pedestrian by tackling him to the ground. Three perspective. Three stories. Which one is \u201cright\u201d? All of them. ",

Some act give me lot pleasure , so I do which is right foe me. . But , it may be wrong as religious point of view. I am not much religious , so I don\u2019t bother. I never do any fast. Nothing wrong to me it is. But, some religious people do fast regularly. For their point of view , I am wrong. So ,Right or Wrong is in mind only. We can do whatever our heart convinced to do. Don\u2019t do any thing which heart doesn\u2019t agree to do. Follow your heart & keep mind open. You are always Right. Don\u2019t bother if others feel it wrong. ",
