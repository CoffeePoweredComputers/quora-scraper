            "answer_text": "Yes, it is ok when an object symbolizes 2 or more things. What is most important in these cases is recognizing the multiple meanings and then applying the correct meaning to the symbol in its current way of use. I know this can sound confusing but an important tip in these cases is to always keep in mind the timeline and historical timing involved with the symbol. ",
