            "answer_text": "You construct a statement with an assumption that has a conclusion which makes its assumption false. This is generally due to the introduction of paradox with a statement that includes an inconsistency as an assumption in the conclusion that negates an assumption. As an example the null set as a collection of empty sets. Empty sets which contain no members and thus can not be sets. If one defines an empty set the assumption is a contradiction. If a paradox results, assume it is inconsistent until proven lacking paradox. Other tricks which qualify as magic, such as, conjectures which become beliefs which are not fact, qualify as magic. ",

            "answer_text": "A (well-formed mathematical) formula is either true or false. The only way to know if a formula is true or false is if there is a theorem proving it to be true or else a theorem proving it to be false. Kurt G\u00f6del was able to prove that there are more formulas than there are theorems. Therefore some formulas can neither be proven true or false and such a formula is called undecidable. In particular finding a counter example amounts to finding a theorem and again, there are not enough theorems to do this in every case, nor could you prove there is no counter example because that\u2019s a theorem too. Note that there are an infinite number of formulas and an infinite number of theorems so intuition might suggest that there is no way you could run out of theorems. It turns out that the number of formulas is a bigger infinite number than the infinite number of theorems. There are mathematicians who reject this kind of argument, but nevertheless G\u00f6del\u2019s proof is accepted by mainstream mathematicians and logicians. ",

            "answer_text": "If it is undecidable, then the question of whether it is undecidable must, itself, be undecidable. It cannot be \u201cproven undecidable\u201d for the reason you state: if it is false, that means a counterexample exists, and the proof that it is false would consist of writing down the counterexample; therefore, if it is undecidable it is true, but there will never be any way of knowing that no counterexample exists.
