            "answer_text": "The best arguments aren\u2019t good enough. You have a constant sense of self which can\u2019t be simulated. We don\u2019t know what it is or how to model it. Consequently, the simulation hypothesis must presume that someday, your \u201cI\u201d-ness will be shown to be a resultant. By resultant I mean that your \u201cI\u201d-ness is a derivative, that it emerged from \u201cthe simulation\u201d over time in a process we don\u2019t know about, and for reasons we don\u2019t know. From the assumption that a \u201cyou\u201d just emerged out of the material of which that simulation is comprised, the hard problem of consciousness is sidestepped in the simulation hypothesis. To whom is the simulation delivered? The simulation hypothesis can\u2019t model you, the observer, the knower, the spectator in the audience whose life is lived on stage. The simulation hypothesis has to sidestep the question of how it is that a \u201cyou\u201d would exist in the first place. It\u2019s sidestepped because no body knows. Why is life lived in the first person? Why should there be a first person in the mix at all? The question is: why are you there both on stage and in the audience? It is paradoxical, but it is a fact. A fact is a self-evident datum. We don\u2019t know why there are facts, facts don\u2019t have a complete rational description. Consequently, we may term facts as objective irrationals. They just are. They just are. Gravity is action at a distance, we don\u2019t know how, it just is. Gravity is an objective irrational, a fact. Don\u2019t drive too fast in your car because the G forces will get you sooner or later. Science can say how fast to not drive in order to minimized G forces. There are 25 other such objective irrationals in the standard model. The standard model therefore rests on facts for which there is no rational explanation. So the question is: How is it that you came to also exist in the audience? Couldn\u2019t all the action on stage occur without your \u201cI\u201d-ness, the you that is the same from moment to moment, year to year over your entire life? Neuroscience terms \u201cI\u201d-ness the narrative self. That\u2019s a little bit of a bad term, it should be termed the narrating self. The big talker. What we talk about varies, but the talker at core doesn\u2019t vary one iota over the course of a lived experience. What we talk about changes. But (s)he who does the talking? That simple sense of self-hood knows 1) that (s)he exits, and 2) that sense of self is always the same regardless of time and place. The whats of our existence are variable. [1] How is it that a narrating self should even be there? It\u2019s a mystery, the hardest question before science. David Chalmers posed the question of the hard problem of consciousness and spoke about it in a Ted Talk. How do you explain consciousness? From Chalmers\u2019 Ted Talks address: We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation, we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains parts of psychology. But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture. On the one hand, it's a datum that we're conscious. On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world. So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly, one that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how. Faced with an anomaly like this, radical ideas may be needed, and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically. It isn\u2019t \u201cconsciousness\u201d that won\u2019t fit into science\u2019s picture of nature. It is the observing self that doesn\u2019t fit. Explaining consciousness isn\u2019t a hard problem until science attempts to explain self-awareness. Now, our body\u2019s perceptual mechanisms deliver discrete information to our stream of consciousness. Our stream of consciousness is a \u201cReport of Variation\u201d, variation that is perceived from interception and exteroception. It is a report of what is going on up upon the stage. You\u2019re on the stage, but you are observing yourself from off that stage too. The \u201cstage\u201d of variation is an interpretation of variable sensory signals. Those signals in turn are produced by sensory stimulation from an objective reality. Our stream of consciousness is an effect that has causes. Understanding those causes and effects are not easy problems. The so called hard problem of consciousness is that our stream of consciousness is reported to a you, a narrating self, the self you\u2019ve been all your life despite all the changes that maturation entails. You may change your mind on an issue. But it is still you that changes you\u2019re mind. You didn\u2019t change when you changed your mind on an issue, your mind changed because you let it change. Who is that you? Your mind can change, but the you observing all the choices before you are not necessarily a product of the brain. There is no good reason from science to think that you are a product of biological processes. A good reason would be a theory of sentience. \u201cTheories\u201d of sentience are hotly contested in science because there is no \u201ctheory\u201d of sentience that science has yet embraced as scientific. The hard problem of consciousness is to answer the question \u201cHow is it that I do exist?, How is it that there exists a \u201cme\u201d who knows of the horrific and of the ecstatic?\u201d Of course, our traditions have their answers, expressed in a metaphorical language. Those traditions don\u2019t offer scientific language. Those traditions attempt an answer to the question of why. They term the narrating self \u201csoul\u201d. In what used to be called Christendom, there existed a belief in the great chain of being, rocks on the bottom, vegetation a bit above that, animals a bit higher up. On the top of that cosmology were humans. Humans knew that they existed. Humans were fully conscious because they possessed self-awareness. Humans were believed to have souls. No mere animal could be believed to possess self-awareness; and dogs, horses, goats didn\u2019t go to heaven even though such creatures in heaven might be the only reason to want to go there. Animals don\u2019t have souls according to that chain of beliefs. Today the predominant belief among philosophers and scientists is that consciousness is partitioned. Consciousness is believed to exist by degrees in organisms generally. But in that belief system, human consciousness is the most developed. Human consciousness is the most developed because humans have self-awareness. That chimpanzees know they exist should have falsified that belief. It didn\u2019t. Instead, the predominant idea is that self-awareness came to mind, emerged over time as a resultant. Those are beliefs at this point are not verified by scientific experience, neither in principle nor by a demonstration of just how it is that a thing could be aware of its own existence. That a thing became aware of its existence is a belief. When science produces some thing out of whole cloth that can self-report from a test tube, then they won\u2019t just have a belief, they will have evidence for their belief. At this point, there is no direct evidence that self-awareness is a product of anything. It may well have just been there from the beginning as an ingredient necessary for life to form. (I will return to an in principle argument that says how it is that personal identity must have been physically present in order for life to have formed.) So what would it matter if all that changes does so because of the operation of a computer simulation? That wouldn\u2019t mean you are a product of that computer simulation. At core, you never change. Only the whats of your existence would be the product of a computer simulation as hypothesized. Perception itself gives a representation of an objective reality. Perception itself produces what is in effect a simulation. Information from perception is received discrete, so it can be thought of as binary. So what? It is a fact that no one knows how it came to be that you are there to watch the show, and to participate in the spectacle upon the stage. No one can show or explain in principle that you must be a simulation of some kind too. Your \u201cI\u201d-ness exists. Is it real. Yep. Here\u2019s how to come to that conclusion. We can deduce in principle and from a datum that your \u201cI\u201d-ness, you know, a little ole \u201cme\u201d, is an objective fact, just as much a fact as is the universe itself. Maybe more so because you while alive are an invariant presence right there in the audience, watching the show upon the stage. The universe is change and we know we die. That we die is a fact. We will be annihilated or we will change. Anyone who claims to have that final answer is a zealot or a dogmatist, that is, just a bag of wind blowing hot air. A Datum: at core, consciousness is comprised of a knower and the known, an observer and the observed, the spectator and the spectacle. We perceive our body as variable. Yet the perception of our body is always by a reference to our \u201cI\u201d-ness. Our \u201cI\u201d-ness is what neuroscience terms the narrative self. The narrative self is our knowing that we exist as a distinct simple sameness, a perfect identity always equal to itself. The quale of that continuous self does not change over the course of our lifetime. We know ourselves concomitantly as the observer and the observed. It is a datum that we are conscious and that consciousness is at core comprised by two contradictory senses of self, one invariant, the other variable (maturing). A principle: motion is a relation. It takes at least one other object from which to measure change, that other object being a stationary (or presumed stationary) point of reference. A Deduction from a self-evident and a principle: our \u201cI\u201d-ness is an object that is stationary. From that stationary point of reference, life\u2019s regulatory processes measure the motion of sensory signals. Those signals in turn are produced by a stimulation from an objective reality. Absented \u201cI\u201d-ness, variable sensory signals could not be measured as change, and hence, would have no meaning. Our stream of \u201cconsciousness\u201d is a reference frame for a continuity, for an \u201cI\u201d-ness observing as if from the audience in a theater. Only from that continuity\u2019s distinct vantage point can all the flux upon the stage be discerned . \u201cI\u201d-ness is a second object, that object an invariant. Perception is of objects in motion. Those objects include our maturing body. By the principle that motion is a relation, \u201cI\u201d-ness must from physics be considered just as much of a physical object as anything else that \u201cI\u201d-ness perceives. We know we exist, we don\u2019t need to perceive the bare fact that we exist. We just know it, directly know it. We perceive our body\u2019s existence like any thing else, as though our body were upon a stage. Our body is variable, \u201cI\u201d-ness is not variable. The knower, the observing self, is as real and substantive as anything else that we don\u2019t know of directly. We know we exist, we know that directly. The whats of our existence are instead perceived, are known from the five senses. Interpreted variation is a product of our body\u2019s perceptual mechanisms. Those mechanisms prepare a \u201cReport of Variation\u201d. That report is our stream of awareness. That report includes our body\u2019s actions along with the actions of other bodily objects. But the receiver of that report? There is nothing variable in our knowing that we exist as a distinct simple identity, a simple sameness, always equal to itself. The principle that motion is a relation establishes \u201cI\u201d-ness as substantive just like any thing else. Of course, in the external world, in res extensa, science just looks for new facts where their predictions fail. A woman predicted that a galaxy\u2019s gravitational center should in theory be at a particular point in that galaxy. When that prediction failed, over and over, science inferred that an object existed that exerted a gravitational force sufficient to place a galaxy\u2019s gravitational center at a point science didn\u2019t expect. They call that object dark matter, and dark matter is real. Nothing would be \u2018real\u2019 in consciousness without an \u201cI\u201d-ness in there as a sort point from which perception renders meanings from variable sensory signals. The laws of motion tells us that. Those core meanings we share with any other organism, organisms that have to be self-aware in principle in order for any organism to behave intelligently, in order to behave in a way that avoids entropic doom. Or avoids getting eaten. A rock doesn\u2019t have a free will in that sense. Organisms do. It is from a long chain of organisms that the human body evolved. What did not evolve was \u201cI\u201d-ness, life wouldn\u2019t exist without an invariant little person within it. Life first and foremost works to preserve the \u201cyou\u201d within it. The survival instinct\u2019s focus is on the body, and to that instincts matters only the \u201cI\u201d-ness within. Life seeks to conserve that quantity of energy that is the you that you have recognized yourself to be since you first recognized yourself as a reflection in a rain puddle or a mirror. Ants seem to recognize themselves in mirrors too. How complicated is an ant compared to a human? Yet \u201cI\u201d-ness beholds itself in an ant\u2019s mirror just like you behold yourself in a mirror. That is the narrative that science will embrace and embroider because science allows facts to be formed of a datum and a principle. Who cares if it is a simulation, you aren\u2019t. All that we perceive will pass away, and what remains is a continuance of living soul, the only soul that seems to matter, natures most treasured possession through all the generations since the beginning of life. Each individual organism matters most to its own nature. But to nature as a whole, it may seem we don\u2019t matter at all. That \u201cI\u201d-ness, soul, is real, we know that now, from a datum and a principle. Objectively. Reasonably. If it means anything to not be alive, we cannot know it from the scientific method. What\u2019s life? It isn\u2019t just variation of atoms. Our \u201cI\u201d-ness doesn\u2019t vary, so life is more than variation of atoms. From physicist Richard Feynman in a lecture to his students (Atoms in Motion): If instead of arranging the atoms in some definite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrangement which is always different from place to place, with different kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thing might behave? Is it possible that that \u201cthing\u201d walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms in a very complex arrangement, such that the shear complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are merely a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one end to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror. We can now affirm in our scientific descriptions of the world that we are not merely a pile of atoms because a pile of atoms, without \u201cI\u201d-ness, is just a repetition from one end to the other with none of the possibilities that exist within you as you behold yourself in a mirror. We make choices from a vantage point that a mere atom can\u2019t. Footnotes [1] Philosopher Daniel Robinson makes the distinction between that we exist and the whats of our existence here. ",
