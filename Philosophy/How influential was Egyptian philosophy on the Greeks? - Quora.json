            "answer_text": "They didn\u2019t go to study in Egypt, but the first Greek philosophers were undoubtedly influenced by Egyptian mathematicians and philosophers and acknowledged as much. It\u2019s important to remember that in the ancient world Greeks did not only live in what is now Greece - they settled everywhere, including quite a few places in Egypt, so quite a few ancient Egyptian philosophers were probably Greek. Your friend lists the philosophers in the wrong order - Pythagoras - who did visit Egypt and may have studied with Egyptian philosophers - died before Socrates was born and Plato and Aristotle, the first philosophers whose work survives in large parts, were a generation later and studied earlier Greek philosophers without bothering with Egyptian philosophy, even if they could have come across it. The reason ancient Egyptian philosophy isn\u2019t much mentioned is because hardly any of it survived. Not much early Greek - preSocratic - philosophy survives either. Most of what there is consists of fragments and short passages quoted by later philosophers. There\u2019s a book by Jonathan Barnes, Early Greek Philosophy, containing translations of nearly all that is extant with a commentary, and that\u2019s about 330 pages long. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear friend, your question has alot to do with my life\u2019s research as a painter, and a Greek, on cultural identity. SO I hope you find my answer interesting. First of all I would like to comment on some of the presupositions of your question. You presuppose that greek culture is european. Are you sure that\u2019s true? You also presuppose that roots and early influences define a culture. Which is what your real question should be. It\u2019s not your fault of course, it is a very strong misconception that is rampant in the west, so strong it is seldomly questioned and is the cause of the previous beleif that greek culture is western. But greek culture and greek philosophers did not infuence the west only, the influence is strong in the east as well. The persian philosopher Avikenna was an Aristotelian scholar and Sufi mystical schools are basicly platonic, to name a few. Not to mention the influence that Alexander the great\u2019s empire had to the east that reached as far as india. Ancient greek medicine is still practised in some of these areas. So if your thesis is true, since east and west have a common root or influence they must be the same. But this is obviously NOT the case. You would get more accurate results however in determining cultural identity if you focused more on the FRUITS and less on the ROOTS. So yes Plato, Solon and Pythagoras are noted to have studied in Egypt (not Socratis or Aristotle though) but even if all the greek philosophers HAD studied in Egypt as your friend thinks, it wouldn\u2019t prove anything as far as cultural identity goes. And the same goes for the Eurocentric question since greek culture is not western nor Eastern. This last statement will probably shock many people, but this is what the study of the FRUIT show without a shadow of a doubt. Lets take the art these cultures produce for example. The art does NOT LIE, but you must understand it\u2019s language. Are you familiar with Plato\u2019s analogy of the devided line? Have you noticed that Egyptian, African and Eastern art focuses more on the abstract and geometric? Well if you see in that a beleif that the Eternal is the real reality, according to Plato you would be correct. Now lets visit the real origins of western culture: The renaissance. Do you notice how the focus here is on the visual sences? Again if you see in that the beleif that the world of time and history is the real reality\u2026according to plato you would be right again. Now look at an Orthodox Icon (look at a Panselinos Icon for example), it merges these two worlds together: the geometric eternal with the temporality of the sences, it does what Hellenistic portraiture does, but in a more apparent way. The Orthodox peoples and states of today are the real inheriters of this merging of the Eternal and Temporal but because of western colonialism haven\u2019t managed yet to express it in a coherent cultural form. And part of this colonial ideology is the beleif that the ROOT is what defines a culture. I hope this helped. ",

That doesn\u2019t mean there has been no influence whatsoever, but the afrocentric claim the Classical Greek culture is entirely derived from Egyptian has been dismissed, and your friend isn\u2019t even paraphrasing the hypothesis correctly. The actual \u201cBlack Athena\u201d hypothesis rests on a lot of skimpy evidence, such as some Greek writers revering Egypt for being an older civilization, and superficial similarities between the Greek and Egyptian religions (when the Greek religion can more accurately be traced to Proto-Indo-European, not Afro-Semitic).
