            "answer_text": "Science has not replaced philosophy. However, many philosophers have made themselves obsolete by sticking to outdated versions of science, and many of those who remain are essentially scientists, whether they call themselves that or not. It's nearly impossible to talk about \"philosophy\" as a whole because the term is both all-encompassing and vague. The name literally means \"the love of wisdom\" and can apply to practically any human endeavor that involves thinking. \"Science\", as we think of it, was once the sub-branch of philosophy that dealt with nature. Mathematics, rhetoric, language, law, medicine, psychology, economics, etc. were once the domain of people who styled themselves solely as \"philosophers\". What we call \"philosophy\" today is what's left after carving away the other things. Much of what remains involves the human mind, areas that science has made poor inroads into because it's so difficult. Science is nowhere near removing philosophers as philosophers from those domains. One key branch is ethics, and while science isn't completely silent on ethical matters, its contributions are primitive. Mostly, when people say \"philosophy\", they mean \"metaphysics\". Scientists have been trying to trump metaphysics for a couple of centuries, with mixed success. The path is to come up with a purely logical, rigorous set of rules: these are the things that absolutely predict the universe. How you organize them is your own damn problem, since they're all equivalent to us scientists. Unfortunately, that's turned out to be harder than expected. Revolutions in both logic and the structure of physics have conspired to trump efforts just when they thought they were getting close. However, those revolutions should shake philosophy as well, and philosophers who have failed to roll with those punches are, to be blunt, a waste of space. Quantum mechanics has entirely done away with any metaphysics that still starts with exact simultaneous position and momentum, and philosophers pursuing metaphysics that relies on that are wasting their time. You can no longer do metaphysics without studying quantum mechanics; your intuitive notions of space and time are quite simply false. You can profitably ponder the differences between our intuitive notion of space against the quantum one, but if you can't do quantum physics, nothing you have to say on the subject is of the least interest. In that sense, science can be said to have replaced philosophy. At least, much pre-20th century philosophy can be said to be useless except as a historical artifact, and philosophers who still pursue it that way are not good philosophers. But science has not yet trumped metaphysics, and good philosophers have been able to pursue new avenues of metaphysics. Unfortunately, it's harder when you can't rely on your intuitions, and most of those philosophers have to be physicists as well. ",

            "answer_text": "One must only recall that what we call science today used to be called natural philosophy. Our privileging of science comes primarily from its technological utility, from which our lives, throughout recent centuries, have been transformed into what we experience now, which has become better faster than ever before in human history.  We must note, however, that science itself has its foundation in philosophy, not merely because science used to be a part of philosophy, but science itself is buttressed by philosophical assumptions. For example, science assumes a minimal of what Hume called the uniformity of nature. Science assumes that objectivity, and the consistency from which, is better than the shifting nature of subjectivity. Science assumes that external, material life is superior to internal life, to the extent that psychology is now mostly the study of chemicals, and we now treat depression sometimes as if it were a matter only, or mostly, of chemistry.  Science may therefore be seen as a specialized, very useful philosophy; and it is not so that philosophy has been replaced by science, for they are not two different entities in the first place.  Let us also note Bertrand Russell's statement that science is for what we know and philosophy is what we cannot. There are simply answers we cannot reach through science, not because of science's weakness but because science is a tool used for specific objects and problems, and for objects and problems of other kinds, we have other philosophies, other modes of loving wisdom.

For instance, the philosophical question of \u201cWhat makes humans different than animals?\u201d can be answered by many different scientific solutions, including the study of anthropology, the study of biology, the examination of DNA, the study of language, the study of logic, the study of the use of tools, and so on. However, the philosophical question of \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d can never be answered by science because science cannot answer the question \u201cWhy?\u201d. Science can produce technology and weapons, but philosophy asks the question, \u201cWhy use this technology?\u201d or \u201cWhy choose this weapon?\u201d Philosophy is the grandfather of science and technology but is also the judge and jury about what forms of technology and science are permissible by society. Philosophy asks questions and science answers questions. When science answers questions philosophy changes the rules. When philosophy asks new questions science tries to answer, but in some cases philosophical arguments remain intentionally ambiguous and elusive to scientific exploration. They will both always seek to check each other\u2019s last word on any subject. ",

The last chapter of Brief History of Time is sensible on philosophy's relation to physics at present though perhaps Hawking later contradicted himself, leading to his proclamation that philosophy is dead: How are philosophers reacting to Stephen Hawking's proclamation that, \"...philosophy is dead\"? With some relevant answers.  More connected questions and answers: Why do many people believe things based on faith rather than due to the Scientific Method? Will there ever come a time when we only base our beliefs on rational processes? Dan Hore's answer to Why is consciousness so poorly defined? I've just posted some links that address the philosophy in relation to science, though philosophy is obviously wider than that.  (The Vienna Circle wished to lay claim to all of it, of course.)

What would \u201ca not wasted, a meaningful life\u201d come to?\u201d Those are meta-physical questions. Metaphysics is not about the meaning of space and time and causality only. It is as well about the meaning of good and evil and the meaning of life and etc.. I am a physicist myself, so I am not in any way \u201cagainst\u201d QM or RT. But scientific problems are not the core problems of philosophy anymore \u2014 if they have ever been that.

Thus philosophy CANNOT be replaced by any science, since they are almost completely independent fields of study. ",

To say, \"I\u2019ll apply what I know regardless of the outcome\" is to take absolutely no responsibility for your actions. I don\u2019t want to be associated with that sort of science.\" Bill Mollison Now it is true that he said ethics rather than philosophy, but where do we derive ethics if not philosophy and religion? Similar things have been said about religion as well. \"Even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determines the goal, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up. But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion. To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith. The situation may be expressed by an image: science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\" Einstein Again this is not precisely philosophy, but all three, ethics, philosophy, and religion are kissing cousins. So I would conclude NO. ",

Prior to that, educated philosophers could deduce things about the natural world that scientists could later test. But quantum mechanics is utterly, fundamentally counter-intuitive, no philosopher could have ever come up with it, yet experiments in quantum mechanics have proven that it is accurate to an extraordinary degree. Since the scientific method has crystallised, discovery has accelerated massively. Philosophy is not fit for this task. There is still a place for philosophy, but it is not the realm of science. A philosopher cannot participate here without also being trained in science (and this can be a potent combination). As it is, the public find the modern contributions of science to be a lot more compelling than the modern contributions of philosophy. I'm not sure they are wrong to do so. ",

Science deals with systematic study of a system and it provides a digestible picture of reality for our imaginations with evidence on observable phenomenons. And Science does give indisputable mathematical facts where as philosophers can never fully agree on anything completely. Replacing philosophy would be a strong claim however because science seeks guidance from philosophy (or atleast is bound by ethics today), and philosophy seeks firmer grounds in scientific methods and as both are admittedly on their own ways to find the truth about universe and existence. I personally think they would go hand in hand in a perfect world. But well I can be wrong and we don't live in a perfect world. ",

There's a lot of jostling for status where both sides tend to feel that they're capable of encompassing the other. But they're both wrong. In general, scientific and philosophical knowledge complement each other well. Update : On the question of why we hear more from scientists than philosophers, you have to remember that philosophy, just like science, has been \"professionalized\" in the 20th century. It has become more academic and specialized and, like science, more abstruse. I won't say it's become more abstract because it's been pretty damned abstract for two and a half millennia.  There are philosophy popularisers, the way there are science popularisers. Jostein Gaarder was pretty hyped a few years ago. John Gray, Daniel Dennett, A C Greyling, Slavoj Zizek etc. all write accessible philosophy. And the 20th century saw everyone from Bertrand Russell to Karl Popper to Isiah Berlin to Michel Foucault to John Rawls and Robert Nozick write philosophy which captured the  popular imagination. ",

One primary answer as to why scientists are on the public stage more than philosophers may be cultural. Science may be seen as giving concrete answers, while philosophy may be seen as unable to. This may be true in practice (science, after all, has experimental evidence), but society can often take these to extremes and bring in scientists to answer questions that do not, or even cannot, have scientifically valid answers (we often ask scientists to be speculative, or even answer questions on ethics, god, or other concepts we don't/can't experimentally verify).  A recent NPR show brought philosophers on to ask their views on topics, for the very reason that philosophers are hardly ever in the public sphere. The result was that the problem was deemed very complex and complicated and could have many potential answers. In reality, most of the problems we have in society are complex problems that require great reasoning to analyze thoroughly, but people don't have time for this and concrete answers are great for artificially quelling cognitive dissonance.  If we wanted to take the cognitive dissonance quelling route, we could consult an authority figure or take a poll, and just accept their conclusions as true.  Through public misconceptions of science, many people view science as giving absolute answers to questions (Yes, that exists, or No, it does not), when in reality, science provides evidence to support claims/hypotheses (it does not \"prove\" them in any absolute sense). While science can arguably provide highly concrete answers to many questions, no scientific answer is absolute, and many many many questions are not yet, or may never be, answerable by science (What is my purpose? - Maybe there is no purpose, but you do an experiment to show me that...). However, with experimental and verifiable evidence, or with an authority figure of high intellectual regard, many in the public may not feel they need to understand all the complexities and logic behind a concept to believe in its veracity; despite many popular concepts in science requiring extraordinary knowledge bases to truly understand. Bowing to authorities with greater expertise can be a highly beneficial practice when the authority is correct and when the question is answered by the proper authority (should a geneticist be telling me about ethics?).  With philosophy, it is a field of pure logic and reasoning, and it is logic and reasoning that is required to understand philosophical concepts (there are few authoritative sources or \"overwhelming evidence\" for people to fall on and quell that mental dissonance). Philosophers ask people to think and often conclusions for complex problems are varied. Busy/concerned people may not want to here that there are numerous potential answers to their questions or concerns. These people want single, direct answers (who doesn't?), which an overstating of science's power can falsely provide them, with the assurance from evidence, a consensus, and esteemed authority figures. Good scientists, however, know science is not so clear cut, but they are arguably better at publicly supporting their conclusions that philosophers are (that was experimental evidence is for). ",
