            "answer_text": "It depends on how you look at it. There are several ways to end up with Stoic ethics, of varying compatibility or closeness with nihilism. (Stoic physics, which assume divinity, contradict existential nihilism). Traditional Stoicism (as its modern practitioners call it) is derived from the idea of a universal, providential Reason\u2014the Logos. This involves the hypothesis that the entire Universe is a conscious being. Traditional Stoics, when they say \u201cLive according to Nature\u201d, mean this Divine Reason by Nature, and from there, they get the idea that Virtue (living in accordance with reason) is the sole good, because our reason is related to the Divine Reason\u2014a piece of the divine within us. This version of Stoicism is directly in conflict with (existential or moral) nihilism; it claims the existence of divinity, which implies fundamental meaning (contradictory to existential nihilism) and absolute morality (contradictory to moral nihilism). In addition, the optimistic view that Fate can do you no harm is derived from the idea of a benevolent Fate, which is, again, contradictory with existential nihilism. Ideal Nature: one can also take Nature to mean the individual\u2019s ideal nature, which would mean in this case rationality and altruism, and derive Stoicism from there. In this case, there is no need for a Divine Reason, only our own, so there is no reliance on a special metaphysical character of the Universe. This does not conflict with existential nihilism as it does not make any assumptions concerning meaning and the nature of the Universe. It may conflict with moral nihilism, as one could argue for universal morality on the basis of a shared ideal nature; however, this can also be taken to simply be a good idea, in which case Stoicism of this version is fully compatible with both. (I am both a Stoic in this sense and consider nihilism to be accurate). Practicality: one can derive the general ideas of Stoicism simply from practicality. Epictetus makes a good point in the first passage of Enchiridion: if you bind yourself to any material outcomes, you can\u2019t truly be free. The combination of virtue ethics with Stoic indifference to fate provides a powerful armor against the chaos of life, and this alone is a strong argument for its practice. Ideas concerning practicality in no way conflict with nihilism, or much else for that matter. This version is clearly compatible. So in short: traditional Stoicism is incompatible and therefore distant from nihilism; Stoicism derived from ideal nature is compatible and can be close to nihilism; Stoicism derived from practicality is compatible and can be close to nihilism (and, if you\u2019ve deriving your ethics from practicality alone, probably is).

Any moral system that you can adapt to conform with this restriction is therefore compatible; the only thing you can't do is claim that your moral system is anything more than an instrumental human construct.
