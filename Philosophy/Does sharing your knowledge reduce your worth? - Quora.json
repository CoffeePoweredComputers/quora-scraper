            "answer_text": "I don't think so. In fact I think just the opposite of it that, sharing knowledge increases your worth. Think of all the great men and women in the past. Think of all the great deeds they did and the knowledge they gained and shared and the pinnacles of success they attained henceforth. Be it Albert Einstein (physicist), Benjamin Franklin, Valmiki (Indian poet), Chanakya, and countless many, all of them gained knowledge and shared it onto the world to be enlightened by the great truths they learned and shared it for the very sake and enlightenment of the world. Just imagine if the great scientists and researchers kept their knowledge private. Would you be enjoying the same pleasures and marvels of technology had they not shared their knowledge with the world? Would man could ever step foot on moon had the one's with great knowledge regarding it didn't share it with the rest?  Each man passes on his knowledge, his wisdom to another and that's how the chain propagates. Sharing is fun! Teaches us a lot.. and as a channel in India named SabTV says, \"Asli mazaa sab ke saath aata hai! (Real fun is experienced with everyone!)\" So sharing is good. Share! Spread knowledge. Spread Love. Spread Care. Make world a better place to live in. :) Give someone a reason to be thankful to you for your contribution. :) Cheers! ",
