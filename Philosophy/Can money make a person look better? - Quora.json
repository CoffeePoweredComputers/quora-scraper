            "answer_text": "Does money really makes you look attractive ? The answer is both yes and no . lemme explain this by an example . When you see a total stranger you make a general opinion ( NOT JUDGING ) about that person . There s generally two phases Materialistic stuffs - lets face it , yes materialistic things are pretty attractive one can pretend to be a saint but well we all know the truth . You can t deny the fact .Non-materialistic stuffs - u know there are other stuffs which are equally important like -- If you are wearing gucci heels and walking like a drunk penguin then buddy idk about you but i really dont find it attractive lol. ( how you carry yourself) -If your drive is Audi ( for ex) and as soon as you walk out of it you are treating your subordinates like shit and acting like a stupid brat , trust me buddy its a serious no no . ( how you treat others ) -Being a snob is never attractive . -Money is okay , but as soon as you open your mouth the only thing you talk is bullshit then umm , i dont think so your money is gonna make you look \u201cattractive\u201d . ( shitty perspective) You see my point , money is a necessity and it makes you look attractive but if you dont have general etiquettes or are not a nice person then all the money in this world is not gonna make you look attractive or the only thing thats gonna attract is fake people which is , i guess a loss in long terms .

Our primordial instincts still force us to believe that the most physically fit is the most attractive as a potential mate, but in modern society, this is not usually the case. ",

For some it can directly control how one feels for another if they're looking for a marriage with that partner as they'd look to have a mortgage, cars and children. Being married to a partner who has a significant lower wage than you can limit you're success in life due to the lack of opportunities in which you can gain, such as owning two cars or your own house, which is a good reason why some may seek a relationship with a partner because they see a strong and reliable future in which they can more freely pick their choices in life and earn for their wants.
