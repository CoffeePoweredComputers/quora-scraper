            "answer_text": "No not at all. Stoic people are resilient which is good. Another tendency is that they don't show emotions, which is a disadvantage and advantage in different situations. This tendency may work against them in social situations. This tendency may help them in catastrophic situations. Stoicism is a defense mechanism. But can it help them stay strong, if they want to committ suicide, yes! Can it help them cope with crippling anxiety and depression? Yes! Can it help them conquer their fears and take risks? Yes! Can it help them be a more disciplined person? Yes! Can it help them avoid complaining? Yes! It's not wrong. It's a way of life. A lifestyle. A stoic person does not care about their own feelings. They don't care if somebody else hurts their feelings. They don't care if they feel rage. They don't care if they themselves feel depressed. They do the necessary work and deal with their responsibilities, regardless if feel like they don't want to. They do what they need to do regardless if they feel like being lazy. That is a stoic queen\u2026.! Stoics don't do revenge because they are kind people that don't feel rage against other people. Stoics don't pity other people or have any feelings against people. Stoics don't react to mean insults that's because the stoic knows that the world is harsh as it always was. By ignoring negativity, the stoic remains once again positive. They are true warrior queens. Stoics don't care about other people's feelings. This can be a downside in many situations. However, it is good to never be too emotionally involved with somebody. People expect other people to care for them and that's wrong because never expect anything from anybody, that would be selfish. Even people that show feelings or care about other people's feelings can be bullies. Notice how the caring mommy can put down her kids and be overprotective which puts down the kids in the real world because they are left naive to such dangers. Notice how people that are emotional seem very happy but emotional gratification is a selfish indulgence when taken too far. Stoics don't go to parties, which may make them seem like party poopers, but stoics don't live for such selfish pleasures. Are you more selfish by partying or not partying? Exactly. Partying is more selfish than not doing so. Notice how emotional people complain and show their negative feelings like sadness and anger and irritation. Stoics reject such negativity which puts them in the higher seat. Stoics don't indulge in worldly pleasure and they don't complain in pain. Stoics are queens. You may think emotional people are LESS selfish but they too, hurt other people's feelings. Everybody has done it before. The person that expects you to care about them, don't really care about you. It's a one sided relationship. Are babies selfish? Yes, except babies are an exception, they are helpless, it's okay for babies to be selfish. There are clingy relationships where one person doesn't believe the other person 'cares' out of insecurity and clingy people are not only insecure but selfish and toxic people. Stoic people however, don't fall for these people and stoic people are never clingy or emotionally toxic people. Stoic people are SANE people that are emotionally stable. Stoic people are mature about their own emotional needs and respect everyone else's. Stoic people will at times not show their affections. That means the person who feels unloved should suck it up and deal with it because that person clearly isn't showing affection either. If you feel unloved, then ask your stoic partner for sex, gifts, etc. You should never expect somebody to love you, especially if you don't even show that love to them. Some people are so emotionally attached that it's not only immature and too trusting but a little childish because one day that emotional attachment WILL be broken and that person will be broken as hell. Never become too emotionally invested, it's selfish and risky, that's why stoics stay on the safe side. Stoics aren't emotionally attached which is good because love hurts. Somebody you love either dies or hurts you. Love will break the heart so then afterwards the person is wise and less trusting. A stoic person will never go to these extremes and never waste time being broken. Is the stoic person emotionally detached? Yes. Stoic people run the risk of being emotionally isolated. Humans are social brings and we thrive on affection and love, and not in complete isolation. So the stoic person will have problems in love and the stoic person wants it that way because stocism is a lifestyle, it's a choice. As long as the stoic person, finds social support, the stoic person can socially survive. The social world will be hard on the stoic person. Because the social world thrives on emotion and the stoic person is already closed off. I'd say the only downside of being stoic is a risk for isolation and antisocial tendencies. Because of the emotional detachment. Isolation is dangerous. There might be friction in relationships too. But emotional detachment can be frightening. And it's a hard way to go. Stoicism is a hard lifestyle to follow by but a lot of men are stoic. A lot of men are emotionally detached. Stoicism shows that the logos side has been integrated which is good. Logic is the bestest friend of all. As long as stoic people develop their eros side, they can be in perfect balance. Society now a days cherishes masculinity. So it's good that these people have a stoic side to them. Stoicism helps enforce the masculinity. So anyone who acts masculine is stoic, which much of the world is masculine so that's good. Achieving goals in life is good and being stoic enforces masculinity. Stoicism can be a disadvantage or advantage but it seems like most people have already developed this attitude. People who do cross country and race do at times have a stoic attitude. People who are willing to take on challenges, might have a stoic attitude. Stoicism is common and stoicism can be healthy if not taken to an extreme. If I just apply stoicism in needed scenarios, but not use this attitude towards everything in life, it would be healthy stoicism. A healthy dose of stoicism is good while taken to extremes may not be. If you are stoic towards everything, you may come across as boring to the average person observing you. But there are of course, different aspects of the personality you can express besides stoicism that can compensate. A person may act stoic but show a sense of humor. A person may act stoic but be very sentimental. A person may act stoic and possess opposite personality traits that are more feminine. Maybe there is an extroverted stoic. It's not like a stoic person is just ONLY stoic, I'm sure there's more to this person. Stoicism is just a part of life because life is so demanding at times. Life is demanding for everyone, no joke. If you don't have stoicism, then how are you going to get your life together. If you don't have stoicism, how are you going to cope since life is demanding all the time? If you can't accept this trait in other people, take a look at yourself and how stoic you might seem too, accept that you may act stoic at times to get by so they may too. Life is hard, life is short and demanding as hell. Imagine you are in a scenario where you are going to die but nobody is around to help you. Not that nobody cares about you but since nobody is there, nobody can save you. In actuality, you are in that scenario everyday, you have to worry about your life. Nobody is going to supervise you for your entire life, you will literally be alone a lot of times in your life. Being alone means you will have to save yourself. Imagine! Imagine if there WERE people around to save you but they didn't. You cannot rely on 'people' to save you, what if they don't or can't or won't. You are in that scenario everyday. Let's say you ride an airplane with other passengers.\u2026.but if that thing crashes\u2026.then I'm pretty sure you are the only one saving yourself\u2026\u2026\u2026the truth is you have always been alone in your life and your life relies 99% on you! You have always been independent in your life and there's nothing nobody can do about it, it's on YOU! A part of life is being able to do this! It is being able to save yourself! A part of life..is sadly\u2026survival! You are all alone and 7.5 billion people have other worries than about a person like you. You might just have to worry about yourself, that's it! Besides nobody trusts you\u2026that's the way some relationships are. People simply do not trust each other so what's the point?? Even if you DO show emotions, people just don't trust you. Ever. It's your job to be your own hero and help yourself sometimes. Unless you want somebody to \u201chelp\u201d you and then they feel resentful for doing so. Nobody really wants to help you\u2026.it's a chore. We don't like helping people that do nothing. We don't like being someone else's slave or servant forever. Nobody wants to deal with your problems. You must become your own hero and save yourself and remain resilient about somethings. People get jealous and possessive, and they simply want to control. There are two types of people in a crowd: the leaders and the followers. Both seek control. Followers have free choice on who to vote for and leaders have much control. People in relationships may be possessive and may not trust you because they're the type of people who never do. People who are leaders have big responsibilities and must show people their credibility to be trusted. I personally am a person that stands up for things but I find myself resentful that everybody trusts me but I don't trust them or know who they are. I have to be the one to get myself out there so people trust me, and even if they do, they never seem to do the same so I can't trust them. They have full power to criticize my leadership. People want to control because they need reassurance for their insecurities. People want to control so they don't feel insecure about themselves. The illusion of control makes a person feel less insecure. Nobody wants to feel insecure or like a loser. Even so, people might want to control you just because they are insecure about your existence. Popular people make some people insecure. It's a question of who dominates and has the most power. Don't mess with people's insecurity. Never. They'll act like they possess you because they're so damn insecure about you and mostly themselves. There is so much corruption in the world and negative things and problems that never get solved. Your own insecurities can ONLY be solved by you! And don't you dare project them on me because I'm dealing with the worse of all insecurities\u2026my insecurities!!!! Nobody wants to deal with your insecurities. And people want to act better than you. Nobody has sympathy for scared people\u2026..nobody has respect for those kinds of people. Just be stoic already, save yourself and by being stoic you solve many of your problems, you refuse to show cowardly feelings. Stoicism is a mark of character. I sincerely do not like complaining, rambling, possessive, jealous behaviors. Whose not a stoic?? Am I right, we are all strong and we all stay alive. If you're saying that stoicism is wrong, you've got a lot of people you should be arguing with! People simply don't trust you if you have an extremely high self image, rather they just get jealous and insecure around your presence. People don't respect people with low self esteem and do not like doing all the dirty work and efforts for things. I don't like being the only one holding the conversation and although, I love encouraging people and lifting them up, it would be useless if they don't support themselves. If they can't inspire themselves to keep a confident self image, then they'll never know their potential. I don't really trust people with low self esteem either, that means they are insecure. When encountering all people, people with a too high or low self image are plain insecure. Insecure people are in ways not that trustworthy. Everybody is sick and tired of insecurity and fear. Stoicism keeps a healthy self image. It is refusing to complain, vent or rant and about solving problems not waiting on them. Stoicism is enduring hardships without being negative about it. It is enduring the challenges and hardships of life. Some people don't endure life which means they refuse responsibilities, dwell in misery because they want to be the martyr and create negative self fulfilling prophecies, they give up too fast and too quickly, they let negative thoughts interrupt, they don't embrace challenges\u2026. Like this sounds like a FIXED mindset. Anybody can do that, and a positive self image can create a nasty shadow. Sometimes the only solution to a problem is to deal with it and endure it. Resilience is a strong character trait so is PERSERVERANCE. Time will pass and before you know it you can go to sleep again\u2026.before you know it the pain will be over. Stay patient about life. Dont overreact to it because my boy\u2026.you got a LONG life to live\u2026.everyday will pass as quick as the last one\u2026.time tests your endurance, your PERSERVERANCE, your strength. Time is the rule of life, so follow it. Know that time is only time so if you have a 30 minute run, just try to get through it and know that time will pass and the run will be over. It'll all be over soon, just stay patient. You've got a lifetime of pain ahead of you\u2026and things only get worse if you don't solve them now. Solve your problems now because it only gets worse. Do your homework now or else you'll have to do more tommorrow. Overall stoicism is a coping strategy that will make your life positive. We all know love hurts, the world is evil and pain is life. Stoicism reduces stress on a significant level. Stoicism does not mean bottling up your emotions, not to that extreme. Also it's possible to show an interest in people while being stoic. Stoicism means shunning all the negativity and ignoring it. It could also mean shunning positivity and ignoring that too. I generally see stoicism as a good thing though. Sometimes not complaining or venting is unhealthy, where do these negative feelings go? Stoicism could mean numbing yourself so you don't feel any pain. I'm confused. I'm pretty sure a lot of people are stoic to get to the successful they have reached through work and struggle. To improve yourself a lot of life is going to be hard so you could call it an attitude, a lifestyle, a personality trait, etc but it's all good and the world doesn't care about stoic people. The bottom line is that yes stoicism has its weaknesses and strengths like I just described above and it's not a matter of right/wrong. There is nothing wrong about stoicism because it's not an action like murder but it's just an idea with strengths and weaknesses. It's not morally right or wrong like murder is, it's just an idea with downsides and upsides. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s different flavours of stoic personality. My grandmother was an English stoic born 1900. She did what she had to do, never complained about it. She rarely smiled, never cried. She was very wise in her decisions as to what she had to do were. When people wronged her, she would simply tell them no, that doesn\u2019t work for me, without anger. She was in a car accident in 1970, she was stuck in a wheelchair, and she asked the doctor when she would be able to walk again. He said \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you will never walk again.\u201d She got up and walked out of his office. When I was 4 my grandfather passed. She came to our house, I asked where he was, and she said, \u201cHe\u2019s in a better place.\u201d I was excited about that and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go see him!\u201d She looked at me, smiled one of the very few smiles I remember, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t be in such a hurry.\u201d My mother is a Canadian stoic born 1935. She also did what she had to do. She rarely complained about it. She\u2019s very eager to please, often very friendly. She taught Kindergarten for most of 30 years, and to make it easier for the kids to communicate with her, she spent half the day on her knees. It damaged her knees, but she sucked up the pain because she believed that her students deserved a teacher who would do their job to the best of their ability, not just in the most comfortable manner. As a result she had double knee replacement surgery, and she walked out of the hospital the day after. Sometimes she allows her eagerness to please other people to feel like a trap - when their demands are unreasonable, she struggles to put herself first. Sometimes she cries before deciding one way or another. My grandmother was obviously more of a stoic than my mother is. Some people would say that needing to cry as part of the decision making process is \u201cwrong\u201d. Others would say that my grandmother not crying when she was telling us that her husband had passed was \u201cwrong\u201d. Most people would prefer spend time with my mother than my grandmother because she\u2019s cheerful and engaging. If you were shareholder of a major corporation though, you\u2019d probably prefer my grandmother as CEO, because you\u2019d like someone who doesn\u2019t struggle to say no to unreasonable demands. I don\u2019t think the stoic aspects of their personality make either of them more or less right or wrong. They both have different ways of coping with hardships and making decisions, and I\u2019m equally proud of both of them. If someone told me they were \u201cwrong\u201d because they\u2019re stoic, I would remind them that these women, who they think were \u201cwrong\u201d, have been very productive members of society, hurt no-one, and would not have judged them so harshly. Perhaps they should take a moment to reconsider whether these women have done anything to deserve their mal judgement. ",
