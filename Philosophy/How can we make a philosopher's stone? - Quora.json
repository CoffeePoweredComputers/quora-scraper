            "answer_text": "Philosophers\u2019 stone is a natural thing. We cannot make it. Without the help of a hen (mother), we cannot do anything with eggs. We have only to wait until natural process and get a pair of chicks and grow them. After growing chicks into hen and cock, some people COOK and eat them. Here, in this figure of speech, the hints are, Philosophers stone is a natural product, born of a father (Sun) and mother (Moon), it is like a womb within the mother\u2019s body, that can give birth to a male or female, as per the excessive love of father or mother on his/her better half,  These chicks are properly grown and tactfully allowed for perfect marriage that is, cooked into elixir of Gods and consumed by Philosophers. Eating chicken will hike our body heat an related symptoms. All Greek Gods have done this. Ancient, Sumerians, Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, and in short, all gods have researched this when they attempted to achieve divinity. Hindism has got more clues, that is why Hindu gods stand or sit on sacred lotus, that blossoms amidst water. All religions purify human with water, The great Tamil Siddha Thitumoolar, says that, \u201cThe blessed ones will worship Siva with flower and water and thereby get his blessings (divinity)\u201d. \u201c\u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bc2\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1, \u0ba8\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b89\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1, \u0b85\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b85\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0b85\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe \u0ba8\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd\u201d Also, the great poet Thiruvalluvar said, that, \u201cThose who mixed with the one who settled upon the sacred flower will experience longer life (longevity and immortality too) on earth\u201d \u201c\u0bae\u0bb2\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0b8f\u0b95\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0b9f\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bae\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0ba8\u0bc0\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb4\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd\u201d So we cannot make Philosophers\u2019 stone. Note: The first line itself is the answer. Then why I wrote a big answer? Because, This is a subject forbidden by saints and seers as per the instruction (they mention so) of Siva the copy-write owner of recipe for ambrosia, though this was invented by Subramanyar, his disciple. But, there are some serious seekers who may be benefited by the hints given in this answer. That is why I have not deleted this answer. Why I use 2 languages? Because, English has a treasure of information on all subjects, translated by their original providers. Again, Tamil has some rare definitions not available in other later found languages, however dear they are to their users. ",

            "answer_text": "Early writings of the philosopher\u2019s stone say it is an alchemical object. Many of the later writings on the philosopher\u2019s stone say that it is an idea, a concept, and that possessing it somehow gives immortality to the holder. I have a few ideas here, if you care to read them, I have copied them from an answer I posted to another Quora question on the philosopher\u2019s stone. Note that I am writing this from the Western, Christian perspective, and I regret I am not expert on the other theologies of the world. Indra, with his vajra lightning bolt was the Hindu equivalent to the Roman deity Jupiter, with his lightning bolt. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I will point out a few things from alchemy. These facts may seem unrelated, but bear with me. In \u201cLe Sphere de Monde\u201d by Oronce Fine, 1549, the four elements of alchemy are shown. Each element corresponded with a time of year and a planet and a place in the sky and a body humor. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 In the East is Spring, planet Jupiter, body humor Blood, and element Air. This makes a person sanguine (bloody minded) and jovial (Jove-like, or like Jupiter). In the North is Summer, planets Sun and Mars, body humor Green Bile, and element Fire. This makes a person choleric (hot tempered) and martial (Mars-like, or warlike). In the West is Fall, planet Saturn, body humor Black Bile, and element Earth. This makes a person melancholy (black tempered) and saturnine (slow, like planet Saturn, and gloomy). In the South is Winter, planets Moon and Venus, body humor Phlegm, and element Water. This makes a person phlegmatic (cold and calm). \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Sir Isaac Newton would have had access to Fine\u2019s work at university. Sir Isaac Newton studied and practiced alchemy, and wrote many thousands of words on his numerous alchemical experiments. Sir Isaac Newton studied astronomy, and made great breakthroughs, including developing calculus to describe how the planets move. Sir Isaac Newton was fascinated by the Bible, teaching himself Greek and Hebrew so he could study the books in the original languages. Sir Isaac Newton thought that he could decipher the meanings of God\u2019s words better than anyone else, that he had found secrets in the Bible not seen by others, this according to his own writings. Sir Isaac Newton would draw pictures of the Temple of Jerusalem compulsively while he presided over meetings of the Royal Society. Pages of his writings exist. Sir Isaac Newton was obsessed with learning more about alchemy, astronomy, the Bible, and the Temple of Jerusalem. Where do alchemy, astronomy, and the architecture of the Bible intersect ? Here is a thought. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. According to the Bible, the Temple in Jerusalem faced east, toward the rising sun. On interior walls were painted pictures of the twelve patriarchs of the twelve tribes. In some translations, these are the twelve angels of the twelve tribes. As the sun moves through the year, rays of sunlight aim north in summertime and south in wintertime, and drift across the face of a wall, like the face of a sun dial. In the Temple of Jerusalem, the shafts of sunlight would drift across the 12 faces of the 12 Patriarchs over various times of the year. In alchemy, Jupiter is in the East. Planet Jupiter takes 12 years to perform a revolution, dividing the sky into 12 parts. These 12 parts of the sky are called the houses of the zodiac. In Greek and Roman myth, Jupiter was king of the gods, designating a place in the sky to each of the 12 Olympian gods, each of the 12 great gods had a house or \u2018temple\u2019 in the sky.. Manilius, 1st century astronomer/poet lists the zodiac constellation that belonged to each of the 12 gods. The year and the face of a clock are divided into 12 parts because in Roman myth, the measures of time are taken by Jupiter, who takes them from his father Saturn, called Chronos in Greek, which means \u2018Time\u2019. So we are supposed to measure time by the movements of Jupiter, who divides time into 12 parts, not by Saturn, who divides things into 30 parts. (It takes 30 years for Saturn to perform a revolution.) Each of the Jewish tribes took turns serving at the Temple for one month out of the year. Lists of names of who served at which time of the year still exist. Possibly, as the sun fell across the face of the patriarch of a tribe, that tribe was designated to serve, although no source gives that much detail. As the sun shone across the courtyard in front of the Temple, it passed over the \u2018sea of bronze\u2019, a bronze cauldron held on the back of 12 bronze oxen, then shone onto the front of the Temple, the building with 12 paintings inside. The Romans said one of the names of the god who divides things into 12 parts, was Jove. The ancient Jews said one of the names of the god who divides things into 12 parts, was JHVH. Jewish letters had no vowels. The Romans said Jove appointed 12 great gods, the ancient Jews said JHVH appointed 12 tribal leaders, the Christians said Christ appointed 12 apostles. In alchemy, Jupiter, or Jove, was the planet of the East, where the open door of the Temple faced. The other three doors on the other three sides of the Temple were kept closed, only the door of the East was kept open, so the Lord could enter. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. In alchemy, blood flows down from that place in the sky, the spring time, which is element Air, and the humor is Blood. In Roman Mithraic stories, the blood which flows down in the taurobolium, the slaying of the Bull, and later, the slaying of the Ram, is purifying and fructifying, and washes a person clean of their sins. In modern Christianity, blood is said to flow down from heaven during the death of the son of god during the spring equinox, and this blood is purifying and fructifying, and washes a person clean of their sins. Taurus the Bull, and Aries the Ram both used to be the constellations of the spring time, the vernal equinox, and were the Bull and Ram slain in ancient Mithraic stories. Precession of the equinoxes caused Taurus and Aries to shift position in the sky. Pisces the Fish is now the constellation of the spring time, the vernal equinox. In alchemy, and in religious thought, blood flows down from the spring time, from that place in the sky. Blood used to flow from the Bull, and the Ram, but now flows down from the Fish. In modern Christianity, the first Sunday after the first full Moon after the spring equinox is Easter, the time of year when Christ shed his blood to rid mankind of sin. In Christian teaching, the lamb of god dies, and is reborn and rises again. The symbol of Christianity, the resurrected or risen Christ, is a fish, and the word \u2018IXTHOI\u2019, the Greek word for \u2018fish\u2019, was placed over Christ\u2019s head as a sign, according to the Bible. (The New Testament of the Bible was originally written in Greek. In later Latin translations of the Bible, this word becomes the letters INRI placed over Christ\u2019s head on a sign.) Christ was said to rise and sit on the right hand of god. In astronomy, when a constellation or planet rises up over the equator during the spring equinox, like Pisces the Fish, this is called entering into right hand ascension, or rising on the right hand. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 A lot of words so far, pointing out why a temple might face east, why the number 12 was important in that temple, and why a fish is symbol of Christianity, and why people might say blood flowed down from a time of year and a direction in the sky. What about stories of stones in all this ? The ancient priests of Jerusalem, according to the Bible, wore 12 stones on a breast plate, a different stone representing each of the 12 tribes. In the Bible, the city of God in heaven is said to have 12 gates made of 12 different stones. Christ, in the Bible, says to his 12 apostles he will build his temple upon an apostle who is a stone (Peter, or petra, means \u2018stone\u2019 in Greek). Even today, the tradition persists that each of the 12 months of the year are represented by a different stone, these are called \u2018birth stones\u2019 today, and are frequently purchased for a loved one to represent the month of their birth. Planet Jupiter is the planet that divides the sky into 12 parts with each revolution. Planet Jupiter was called Jove in Rome, and possibly called JHVH in Jerusalem. Planet Jupiter, seen as a god or angel of god, thus would be the \u2018god\u2019 behind the stones, the one responsible for placing the idea of 12 stones in the sky, for placing the 12 \u2018stone gates\u2019 in the sky. This idea of a \u2018stone\u2019 is not necessarily something that can be held in the hand, although you could purchase a birth stone, if you wished. This idea of \u2018stone\u2019 is in heaven, or in the ideas people have of heaven, passed down from truly ancient times. The idea exists independently, passing from person to person down through the millennia, the idea doesn\u2019t actually die, although the person holding the idea might die. Each generation will look up, again, and see that planet Jupiter divides the sky into twelve sections, regardless of where they are on the planet. In this sense, the stones are a bit immortal. In this sense, a philosophical sense, the stones exist and searching for them provides answers. In this sense, religion, philosophy, ancient astronomy, and alchemy are related, and can all be held in the palm of your hand as a small stone. ",
