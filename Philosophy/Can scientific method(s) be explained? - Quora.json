            "answer_text": "Sure. We start with ideas. We try them out. If they work, we keep them, write them down in books, teach them future generations. If an idea doesn\u2019t work, we toss it out and try some other idea. All that stuff you read about hypothesis, observation, theory, all that - those are just fancy elaborations of the basic idea. It\u2019s great to know the difference between a hypothesis, a theory, a law, what is a good process for gathering facts about the world, all that stuff. It\u2019s all just fine. But not if it causes you lose sight of the basic idea. We keep the stuff that works and throw out the stuff that doesn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Mostly we try to pretend we don\u2019t affect a measurement and at everyday scales of size that is pretty well true , for example a volt meter has very high impedance so that the sample is as small as possible and doesn\u2019t disturb the object under consideration. For quantum scales Schroedinger\u2019s equation seems to have come out of thin air, a gift of the gods. In astrophysics it seems there is a tendency to get what we start out/in with, our postulates and such like. both extremes, the very small and the very large, are works of art in progress akin to good music or pure poetry.

            "answer_text": "Scientists, unlike philosophers and theologians, know that we can\u2019t find valid explanations for how the natural world works just by arguing about it. Each argument has to be tested by looking at what is actually there. Form a hypothesis (ie a speculation) about some natural processMake predictions from your hypothesisObserve the natural world or experiments on itCompare the predictions of your hypothesis to the what you observeIf your explanation is more accurate than what went before, congratulations. If not, back to the drawing board.",
