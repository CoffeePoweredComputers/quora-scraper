            "answer_text": "The Backfire Effect Do you think debating is the best way to resolve an issue? Wrong! \u201cWhen your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger.\u201d     The effect has been demonstrated experimentally in psychological tests, where subjects are given data that either reinforces or goes against their existing biases - and in most cases people can be shown to increase their confidence in their prior position regardless of the evidence they were faced with. \"This is why hardcore doubters who believe Barack Obama was not born in the United States will never be satisfied with any amount of evidence put forth suggesting otherwise. When the Obama administration released his long-form birth certificate in April of 2011, the reaction from birthers was as the backfire effect predicts. They scrutinized the timing, the appearance, the format \u2013 they gathered together online and mocked it. They became even more certain of their beliefs than before. The same has been and will forever be true for any conspiracy theory or fringe belief. Contradictory evidence strengthens the position of the believer. It is seen as part of the conspiracy, and missing evidence is dismissed as part of the coverup. This helps explain how strange, ancient and kooky beliefs resist science, reason and reportage. It goes deeper though, because you don\u2019t see yourself as a kook. You don\u2019t think thunder is a deity going for a 7-10 split. You don\u2019t need special underwear to shield your libido from the gaze of the moon. Your beliefs are rational, logical and fact-based, right?\" In a pessimistic sense, this makes most refutations useless. So the next time you indulge in the following, think twice!
