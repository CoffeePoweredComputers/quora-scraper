            "answer_text": "One criticism is that the verification principle is itself not subject to verification. The verification principle asserts that any meaningful statement consists of logical connectives and sense data, or simply logic (tautology). E. G. \u201cJohn is eating.\u201d John is the subject, his existence can be verified, and he is eating,which also can be verified. The logical connective is \u201ca is in state b.\u201d This is the state of John eating. The sentence, \u201cthe only meaningful propositions are those that are logically true or those that can be verified by sense experience,\u201d is itself empirically unverifiable. ",
