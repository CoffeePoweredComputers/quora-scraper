            "answer_text": "The animal body has a brain which produces animal vigilance. Consciousness is a fancy word for animal vigilance. If something goes wrong with the brain, physical, chemical or emotional shock, the filter which keeps out irrelevant signals can fail and the brain can act somewhat like a radio receiver and receive signals from many sources. Mentally ill people often report they feel they are the victims of thoughts from other people and wrap their heads with aluminum foil, so sad. Consciousness cannot be transferred but signals can that account for all the stories we hear about people who undergo some kind of traumatic episode with memories from experiences they did not personally live through. Our animal instinct to survive no matter what tends to skew our ability to think rationally about this topic. Wishful thinking pollutes the field of inquiry. The conclusions which are being reported are absurd and bizarre. We\u2019ve been reading and hearing about people getting abducted by aliens, seeing visions during oxygen starved brain episodes. What we experience and how we remember those experiences are two different cognitive processes. We need to keep this in mind at all times when thinking about and discussing this topic or spend a whole lifetime going down one rabbit hole after another of distorted judgment due to wishful thinking.

            "answer_text": "Anil Seth answers a question about 4:08 into this Q&A. Can the brain support conscious subsystems?  Jung speculated that the ego was but one among other autonomous psychic complexes. Seth says there are suggestions that the brain supports conscious subsystems. In his talk to which the Q&A follows, Seth describes the brain predicting a narrative self into existence where the narrative self is our sense of being the same person throughout the course of our lives. Does the brain then predict into existence a distinct sense of self for each conscious subsystem? Or does the brain through predictive processes identify identities for conscious subsystems that are already there? A predictive brain is a brain that can make distinctions. We think of distinction making as a conscious processes. So does the \u201cbrain\u201d have distinct consciousness that is independent of ours? It takes an independent point of view from which distinctions can be made. Motion is a relation, objects are distinguished by their actions. Objects are not created by their actions. Objects just are. Objects are distinguished against a fixed point of reference within or outside of an object\u2019s reference frame. Our narrative self is a fixed point of reference in that it is a self that is sensed as a distinct continuing identity. Our stream of consciousness is a reference frame. Our distinctions of objects are made from a fixed point of observation. Objects in our stream of awareness are distinguished against the background of a fixed referential \u201cI\u201d-ness. So I don\u2019t think of consciousness as a transmission with the brain as a receiver, I think of the narrative self within consciousness as a separate object, not a transmission or a place holder predicted into existence by the brain. A brain\u2019s predictions are guesses about existent objects and their motion. Why would \u201cI\u201d-ness not also be an object in and of itself since everything else the brain makes predictions about are objects? The thing is, \u201cI\u201d-ness isn\u2019t in motion, is instead inertial, making those predictions possible according to the principle that motion is a relation. And since we can\u2019t visually see \u201cI\u201d-ness directly, the principle that motion is a relation is a reason by which we can infer \u201cI\u201d-ness\u2019 existence as an object, invariable while the body we see is variable. Note that all biological products are variable. How could it be, then, that our sense of being an \u201cI\u201d-ness is a persistent constant? Suggested is that \u201cI\u201d-ness is not a biological product. We have no point of awareness independent of our \u201cI\u201d-ness and consequently we cannot, as Max Planck phrased it, \u201cget behind consciousness.\u201d We have no object from which we could perceive whether \u201cI\u201d-ness is inertial for being at rest or in uniform rectilinear motion. Or do we? From the transcript of Jill Bolte Tayor\u2019s Ted Talk My Stroke of Insight: 14:06 When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality. Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. 15:25 But then I realized, \"But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana.\" And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Fundamentally, the universe may be a complementarity comprised of love and power. By the law of inertia, the idea that self is a construct is an absurdity. In love we see that which is behind our self and we become but a reflection of a deeper reality that cannot be described except as love. Certainly some have said so in the language that the West possesses: 1 Corinthians 13 New International Version (NIV) 13 If I speak in the tongues[a] of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,[b] but do not have love, I gain nothing. 4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. Just because the ancients didn\u2019t possess our scientific language doesn\u2019t mean they got it entirely wrong. What language does justice to ineffable Love? Once you have \u2018I\u201d-ness as an object by the law of inertia, then you have the unconscious as Jung\u2019s objective psyche. At that point, science from a foundation may root existence in Love by the laws of inertia and the principle that motion is a relation. I discuss distinctions as not possible except from a fixed point of reference. I discuss our narrative self as a constant only against which distinctions can be made according to the principle that motion is a relation. In his Q&A Seth acknowledges that there is no principle from which the existence of conscious subsystems can be deduced. The principle that motion is a relation is the missing principle. I discuss that in detail several places, most recently, here: Charles Wood's answer to What is the scientific consensus on Penrose and Hameroff's recent paper claiming that their Orch-OR theory is the best theory of consciousness proposed thus far?
