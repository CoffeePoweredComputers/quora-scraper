            "answer_text": "What are the limits of human consciousness? The question seems unclear, about what the questioner intends to ask, whether limit of Consciousness or the limitation of Consciousness. Crudely I may define it, which well versed people may edit. Generally Limit is the ultimate strength, capability or boundary beyond which the state or performance of the subject can\u2019t extend. Limitation is the condition or state of the subject that causes it or is responsible for the limit. Now let us come back to the subject of Consciousness. The limit of consciousness in 2 areas of its performance, which are intellectual or memory using, namely 1) Perception and 2) Responses. Everyone is perceiving and responding to situations with their own limits that aren\u2019t same, but are different. Bur the reason or cause of different limits in each person, is the limitation caused by fragmentation of Consciousness in each person. Present limited inaccurate, inappropriate and violent performance of the consciousness in human beings is due to the limitation caused by the fragmentation of consciousness. Further, having understood this logically, our inability to set right the present situation is also due to same cause or limitation, though in a lesser degree. Because it is the Consciousness alone, which can set right its maladies or damages. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. The question is very specifically about the limits of \u201chuman\u201d consciousness and not limits of consciousness. The two are very, very different from each other. The limits of human consciousness is \u201cthought\u201d or rather, the \u201creach of thought\u201d, and that covers intellect. That's because the human consciousness spans only upto and including the mental world, the fifth world of nature. Enlightenment (which can be alternately visualised as nirvana), takes consciousness beyond the field of human thought into something greater, vaster and incomprehensible by thought and unreachable by intellect. Beyond that, the limits strech into unimaginable levels, but all that is beyond human consciousness. But the question is not about that, as the question reads \u201cWhat is human consciousness\u2019s limits?\u201d ",
