            "answer_text": "Economies will always defy the Platonic attempts to hijack their complexity in theoretical cages. And because the complexity vastly exceeds the theoretical abilities of humans to be encapsulated in its entirety (which I suspect is a function of cognitive biases), the work to \u201cunderstand everything\u201d will always prove to be an elusive fruit. Like Mother Nature throwing everything into chaos in the physics departments right when the arrogance of physicists is at its high for everything is supposed to have been \u201cexplained\u201d, the complex collective breathing beasts called economies will always have the upper hand over humans\u2019 attempts at Platonifying it. I would say this is something that isn\u2019t a counter-intuitive economic fact, because it seems to be counter-intuitive to the economic academia as well. In fact it would be counter-intuitive to humans in general, as we all seem to be cognitively driven to always make neat and nice models, when the reality all around us is fuzzy. ",

            "answer_text": "Textbooks are full of lots of counterintuitive economic facts. The government\u2019s budget does not work like a household budget, for instance, and increasing immigration into a country does not imply that natives are being forced out of their jobs. My favorite economic fact, though, is that the more productive a part of the economy becomes, the less important its economic role becomes. Take farming, for instance. Farming has become vastly more productive since the 19th century, such that the amount of food per person has risen even as global population has soared. The effect of that growth is that almost no one works as a farmer and farming\u2019s share of GDP is tiny. Weirdly, it\u2019s the stuff that isn\u2019t very productive that becomes an economic bottleneck, soaking up lots of workers and accounting for a huge amount of GDP. Like medical care. ",
