            "answer_text": "Short answer: No, you don't have to be good at it, but you need to learn it. Long answer: Depending on your philosophical views. If you are a reductionist, certainly. If you believe in metaphysics, then it definitely won't hurt. I'm a philosophy major who has taken three semesters worth of higher mathematics and physics, and I'll be the first to admit that it isn't necessarily the most beneficial thing in regards to the specific field of philosophical history (theories made by others, etc.) but is very useful if you are wishing to be a better critical thinker. My nostrum has always been to take as wide of a variety of classes as possible, because the more I personally have learned about the universe around me as well as my own psychological underpinnings the more cognoscente and sound my theories become. Long story short: If you want to be a philosophy major, math isn't that important. However... If you want to be a philosopher, you need to understand as much about the universe as possible to take into account as many variables as you can imagine. I recommend political science (specifically political theory) classes, psychology classes, classes in religious studies, higher mathematics, advanced science classes (once again, theoretical and applied) history classes and maybe a few English classes, though you'll get plenty of writing experience and literature exposure just by taking your core philosophy classes. At the end of the day, being a philosopher means finding truth in the universe. Good luck in your endeavors, and if you are truly meant for the field it will certainly come naturally. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes i believe a philosopher must know mathematics.With Mathematics we try to explain the laws of the Universe .So a philsoher who wants to make a comment on the nature of the universe  must have sufficient understanding of how the universe works.Induction, deduction, abstraction and systems thinking exists in all domains and of course in Philosophy.I think that mathematical logic and set theory offers a philosopher a sound scientific base to analyze the arguments he wants to make.
