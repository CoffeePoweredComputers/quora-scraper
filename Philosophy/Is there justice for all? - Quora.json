            "answer_text": "yes There is a justice for all . On HIndu religion Perspective For every mistake there is a punishment. The amount of punishment varies from small to big. That is what you call it as karma. you will get he punishment today , tomorrow or forth coming days or even in your next birth But Karma stays. In the eye of God you can never escape. On Islam religion perspective, All your sins are recorded and mistakes are automatically recorded your eyes , hands and all the parts of your body will stand witness to the mistakes you did . After death you will be rise on the judgement day , Based on your good and bad deeds you will go to heaven or hell. I am great fan of Dr.Zakir he used to describe the court of allah. How allah can give punishment for a person who killed one person and a person who killed 1million. In the Human court maximum is life sentence one time . But in the court of almighty allah he gives the capital punishment for example the mighty allah sentence a person to put a person in to fire for 10,000 times. How is it possible because in first time he gets burned and die. The beauty of allah he gives the fresh skin and fresh blood and fresh life and pain. he can fire you create you and fire again. That is where justice arrive. Being born in india i am afraid of God\u2019s Judiciary rather than government, I strongly believe the is a justice for all.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",
