            "answer_text": "Personally I'm interested in electrical engineering (my major), mechanical engineering, civil engineering, architectural engineering, art, music(not country), and various science fields (like paleontology, geology, chemistry, biology, etc). My mother is interested in history and genealogy. My uncle, sitting across from me at the train station, is interested in linguistics, mathematics, and various cultures (like Poland, Germany, Peru, etc). In edition to the above, he has various other interests including philosophy, poltics, and space exploration. My mom puts hours into studying genealogy and we've even had family trips attending graveyards where my ancestors are buried. Academic is a broad term so maybe I listed too much, but my point being is there's a lot out there to be excited about and some of it probably won't be interesting to you. ",
