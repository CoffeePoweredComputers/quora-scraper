            "answer_text": "I would like to post an excerpt from The book \"The Wise Man's Fear\", by Patrick Rothfuss (an excellent novel by the way, I must recommend it). It's a story that touched me. Let me give some background, though I may do a poor job of it. The story is narrated by Shehyn, the leader of a school of martial arts which follows the path of the broken tree. There are many paths, but this is one of the oldest and more formal. The school is of the people of Ademre, whom I can only describe as having deep philosophical roots. They call their ideology the Lethani, and all Adem learn it, those of the school twice. This is the story of the nine-and-ninety tales. Of Aethe and the beginning of the Adem: \u201cThis is a story of years ago,\u201d Shehyn said formally. \u201cBefore this school. Before the path of the sword tree. Before any Adem knew of the Lethani. This is a story of the beginning of such things. \u201cThe first Adem school was not a school that taught sword-work. Surprisingly, it was founded by a man named Aethe who sought mastery over the arrow and the bow.\u201d Shehyn paused in her tale and gave a word of explanation. \u201cYou should know that in those days, use of the bow was very common. The skill of it was much prized. We were shepherds, and much set on by our enemies, and the bow was the best tool we had to defend ourselves.\u201d Shehyn leaned back in her chair and continued. \u201cAethe did not set out to found a school. There were no schools in those days. He merely sought to improve his skill. All his will he bent upon this, until he could shoot an apple from a tree one hundred feet away. Then he strove until he could shoot the wick of a burning candle. Soon the only target that challenged him was a piece of hanging silk blowing in the wind. Aethe strove until he could anticipate the turning of the wind, and once he had mastered this thing, he could not miss. \u201cStories of his talent spread, and others came to him. Among them was a young woman named Rethe. At first Aethe doubted she possessed the strength to draw the bow. But she was soon regarded as his finest student. \u201cAs I have said, this was long years and distant miles from where we sit. In those days, the Adem did not have the Lethani to guide us, and so it was a rough and bloody time. In those days it was not uncommon for one Adem to kill another out of pride, or from an argument, or as a proof of skill. \u201cSince Aethe was the greatest of archers, many challenged him. But a body is nothing of a target when one can strike silk blowing in the wind. Aethe slew them easily as cutting wheat. He took only a single arrow with him to a duel, and claimed if that single arrow was not enough, he deserved to be struck down. \u201cAethe grew older, and his fame spread. He put down roots and began the first of the Adem schools. Years passed, and he trained many Adem to be deadly as knives. It became well known that if you gave Aethe\u2019s students three arrows and three coins, your three worst enemies would never bother you again. \u201cSo the school grew rich and famous and proud. And so did Aethe. \u201cIt was then that Rethe came to him. Rethe, his best student. Rethe who stood nearest his ear and closest to his heart. \u201cRethe spoke to Aethe, and they disagreed. Then they argued. Then they shouted loud enough that all the school could hear it through the thick stone walls. \u201cAnd at the end of it, Rethe challenged Aethe to a duel. Aethe accepted, and it was known that the winner would control the school from that day forth. \u201cAs the challenged, Aethe chose his place first. He chose to stand among a grove of young and swaying trees that gave him shifting cover. Normally he would not bother with precautions such as this, but Rethe was his finest student, and she could read the wind just as well as he. He took with him his bow of horn. He took with him his sharp and single arrow. \u201cThen Rethe chose her place to stand. She walked to the top of a high hill, her outline clear against the naked sky. She carried neither bow nor arrow. And when she reached the top of the hill, she sat calmly on the ground. This was perhaps the oddest thing of all, as Aethe was known to sometimes strike a foe through the leg rather than kill them. \u201cAethe saw his student do this, and he was filled with anger. Aethe took his single arrow and fitted it to his bow. Aethe drew the string against his ear. The string Rethe had made for him, woven from the long, strong strands of her own hair.\u201d Shehyn met my eye. \u201cFull of anger, Aethe shot his arrow. It struck Rethe like a thunderbolt. Here.\u201d She pointed with two fingers at the inner curve of her left breast. \u201cStill seated, arrow sprouting from her chest, Rethe drew a long ribbon of white silk from beneath her shirt. She took a white feather from the arrow\u2019s fletching, dipped it in her blood, and wrote four lines of poetry. \u201cThen Rethe held the ribbon aloft for a long moment, waiting as the wind pulled first one way, then another. Then Rethe loosed it, the silk twisting through the air, rising and falling on the breeze. The ribbon twisted in the wind, wove its way through the trees, and pressed itself firmly against Aethe\u2019s chest. \u201cIt read: Aethe, near my heart. Without vanity, the ribbon. Without duty, the wind. Without blood, the victory. Shehyn continued. \u201cOnly after Aethe read these lines did he recognize the deep wisdom his student possessed. He hurried to tend Rethe\u2019s wounds, but the head of the arrow was lodged too close to her heart to be removed. \u201cRethe lived only three days after that, with the grief-stricken Aethe tending her. He gave her control of the school, and listened to her words, all the while the head of the arrow riding close to her heart.  \u201cDuring those days, Rethe dictated nine-and-ninety stories, and Aethe wrote them down. These tales were the beginning of our understanding of the Lethani. They are the root of all Ademre.  \u201cLate in the third day Rethe finished telling the ninety-ninth story to Aethe, who now held himself to be his student\u2019s student. After Aethe finished writing, Rethe said to him, \u2018There is one final story, more important than all the rest, and that one shall be known when I awake.\u2019  \u201cThen Rethe closed her eyes and slept. And sleeping, she died.  \u201cAethe lived forty years after that, and it is said he never killed again. In the years that followed, he was often heard to say, \u2018I won the only duel I ever lost.\u2019  \u201cHe continued to run the school and train his students to be masters of the bow. But now he also trained them to be wise. He told them the nine-and-ninety tales, and thus it was the Lethani first came to be known by all Ademre. And that is how we came to be that which we are.\u201d ",
