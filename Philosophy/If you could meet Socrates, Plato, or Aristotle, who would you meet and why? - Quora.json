            "answer_text": "Hi there. The well known fact, the trio of philosophers Socrates, Plato, Aristotle are the all time great philosophers. And the amazing thing is Socrates is the teacher of Plato,Plato is the teacher of Aristotle. Coming to the question\u2026 I would prefer to meet Aristotle over Socrates,Plato because Aristotle made his thoughts and philosophies with respect to reality at that times. Whereas the other two great philosophers made their thoughts and philosophies were not with reality. Hope you are impressed with my answer.If you aren't feel free to message me. Have a nice day :) ",

            "answer_text": "Although Aristotle for me is the most influential philosopher regarding European thinking and science \u2013 as a personality he is much less interesting than Socrates or Plato. It is difficult to choose between those two, but probably I would take Plato, as I have spent much time of my life figuring out his thoughts many of which are quite strange and esoteric. ",
