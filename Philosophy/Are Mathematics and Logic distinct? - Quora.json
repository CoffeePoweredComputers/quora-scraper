            "answer_text": "Yes, mathematics and logic are distinct.  Logic is the subbranch of mathematics devoted to studying mathematics itself. \"Metamathematical\" concepts like axioms and proofs can be formalized within logic, and in theory we could reduce any mathematical statement to a long string of logical symbols, but you won't find many geometers or statisticians that think of themselves as logicians.

            "answer_text": "Yes they are distinct. Mathematical logic is an area of mathematics which studies the notions of proof, axioms, truth, etc and applies them to the rest of mathematics. Other mathematicians use this work indirectly, but when, say, a topologist is writing a proof, they don't directly use the work of logicians. Mathematics is logical, but mostly it's not Logic. Mathematical Logic is not the entirety of the study of Logic. Philosophers do their own thing. ",
