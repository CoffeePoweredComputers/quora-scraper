            "answer_text": "The answer to the question is almost too obvious. When you define a being as omnipotent, you make the answer \u201cyes\u201d automatically. Omnipotent = having all power. Having all power = able to do anything. Hence: Can \u201ca being who can do anything\u201d ... make itself omniscient (all-knowing)? Obviously, yes. Can \u201ca being who can do anything ... do X? (or Y? or Z?). Obviously, yes, no matter what X, Y or Z might be. Most religions believe that the Supreme Being (God) is both omnipotent and omniscient (all-knowing). ",
