            "answer_text": "There is no reason why it would be less cruel to eat the meat from a cow that died of old age (or \"natural causes\") when the causes may be what would cause illness in humans, and that old cow eventually died of a chronic illness that made her suffering more prolonged than a cap-bolt to the head. So, actually the whole concept would be the exact opposite. It would be much more ethical to take the meat from a steer that died very quickly and as a healthy animal than wait for a 20 year old cow to eventually die from old age or health conditions that come with old age. The quality of the meat from such a cow would be very poor as well, not nearly as good as from a finished 2 or 3 year old steer or heifer. The meat would be better off as dog meat than even ground beef for hamburger or sausage, but even if the meat from that old cow is still a health risk even for pets, it should better be discarded in a pit than even fed to pets a large majority of North Americans consider family.  As far as I'm aware, though, there aren't very many, if any, people who eat meat from cattle that have died of old age. If a cow that has been in the herd for a long period of time and has achieved an emotional attachment with her human caretakers, there isn't really a valid reason why they would harvest meat from her when she was more like a \"pet\" or \"family\" and deserves a burial rather than conversion of meat for the freezer.

            "answer_text": "In the societies that I am aware of, it is not normal to eat animals that die of things unknown. An animal presumed to have died of natural causes, including old age, could also be due to illness that can lead to transmission of infectious disease to any unfortunate consumer. The older the animal the higher the risk of it being infected and the chance of getting people sick. It is normal to bleed the blood of animals to be consumed, and a dead animal cannot be bled. Also, it would be difficult to have the carcasses inspected by professionals if we were to go around scavenging for meat.  If the concern is about the well-being of food animals, then we have the choice to abstain from eating meat, but those who want to eat it would be better off not reverting to being scavengers.  Humans most likely started out by eating meat left by other carnivorous predators, but being the intelligent animals that we are, we quickly found out that getting fresh meat, and knowing the source was the way to go. I don't see that we will go back to waiting around for some poor pig or cow to die of old age before we eat it.  If I felt so strongly about animal well-being I would be the first to stop eating meat, but would find it repulsive to start cutting meat from a dead animal and not knowing the cause of death. I just don't like or need meat that badly. ",

When something dies of natural causes bacteria invades it's bloodstream. With a pumping heart that blood is drained quickly. Without a pumping heart it drains by gravity, leaving A LOT behind. This bacteria quickly invades the meat. Not only does it leave an unappetizing taste, it leaves serious concerns for your health. Within 4 hrs the carcass is unusable, 2 hrs on a hot day. Within that time frame the animal will go \u201cbone sour\u201d which is also a horrendous odor. Gut bacteria will also invade the meat within that time frame. If you have constant visual and physical contact with the animal, it is possible to feed this carcass to an animal with a higher stomach acid content than we have, but it would be considered unsafe for us, will all our anti-acids that we take.

Do you think an older steer will not have similar age related issues?  Im sure the steer does not have the option of hip replacement surgery or anti-inflammation medicines. Dying a long slow death so someone can eat you without muddying their hands seems far more cruel than the current option.  ",
