            "answer_text": "Well for me life otherwise is meaningless and purposeless if not channelized into the right direction in the sense the direction in which true humanity can be explored and while exploring the known, one reaches the realm of the unknown where the existence of one individual is just a bubble in a vast continuum. So the existence of an individual is nothing but that small bubble rising from that infinite and again going back to its source thus leading to this idea or reality that there is no such thing as an individual existence but a tiny instance of that infinite consciousness- this is the reality and realizing this reality relieves us from the pain of life, spares us from the sorrows and mundanes of life, gives us a more powerful, yet abstract, yet a thousand times stronger reason to live and a stronger vigor to know the real \u2018I\u2019, beyond this illusive \u2018I\u2019 which we believe to be true. Otherwise the existence of each human is no different from that of a dog, worse, dog is not aware of all these but we have the capacity to be aware of our true selves yet still we choose to be ignorant and so it is like choosing the path of thorns where in each step, each moment we die and again we relive and so on and so forth. The real equation of life is incomprehensible and inexplicable apparently because all the variable values do not fit in owing to our limited knowledge of the vastness of our real existence but knowing that we are wrong gives us a far greater insight into venturing into what the reality is. It requires contemplation, and courage and faith and the most amazing part of all these is that it has nothing to do with religion, it is a concept just like quantum theory or Automata theory or any theoretical discussion which can be materialized. So realizing one\u2019s true self is the one and only purpose that bestows the true meaning of life. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there is. Life is meaningful, when you live to the fullest. Pursue your own dream and give back to society with whatever knowledge that you've gained. Life is not meant to be wasted in living someone else's dream. Constantly trying to achieve someone else's target. Constantly trying to get approved by someone so much, that you forget, \u201cwho you are\u201d. Life has meaning only when, you go back to bed without any regrets, everyday. And live each day only to make those marks, which you would like to remember when you'll die. As steve jobs would quote it: \u201c Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by the dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinion drown out your own inner voice. And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition\u201d Hence, when it comes to having some meaning in life, we all should have our own definition. ",
