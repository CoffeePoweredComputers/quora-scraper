            "answer_text": "When you have a thought. It's not a thought. It's an inspiration! Inspiration is a gift. Thoughts are those gifts that infuse your future to allow success. So many people have ignored the 'thought' that could have catapulted them into to new life. That inspiration is like fire in the blood. It's like \"Wow, Yes! I'm going to ... \" and then time takes it's time and ... the ...fuse... burns ...into .......nothing ... so does the thought. When a thought excites you and burns within, don't waste time analysing it. Just make your progress. And don't stop. Your instinct is at work and your instinct is never wrong.

            "answer_text": "A good balance between thinking and doing is advisable. Sometimes we overthink things but don't do anything. A lean approach in which an initial version of an idea is developed (a minimum viable product or service) will help to turn thoughts into initial and developed ideas. ",
