            "answer_text": "I've actually observed this phenomenon in aviation safety through a number of accident and incident scenarios.  Here's a link to an interesting essay on that domain: The Peltzman effects in Safety? Relying on high-tech gadgets?  What is human factors safety in aviation?.  Knowing that it has a name is prompting me to look into it further and to do some thinking about it in the context of unmanned aviation. The latter is a possible area of concern because of something I might decide to name after myself (why should Peltzman have all the fun?).  Nah, he was there first -- call this \"Farrier's Corollary to the Peltzman Effect.\"  To wit: \"A lack of personal risk resulting from a hazard tends to reduce the likelihood that the hazard itself will be deliberately avoided.\" You read it here first. Here's the rub.  Unmanned aviation represents a newly affordable and more broadly accessible means of obtaining an aerial perspective on something.  The reason it's cheaper and readily accessible is because it doesn't require an aircraft big enough, complex enough, reliable enough and safe enough to carry a human occupant.  Bonus: since a pilot's life isn't at risk based on what's done with the unmanned aircraft, it's tempting to put the unmanned aircraft into situations and domains where it's at greater risk... including in the path of manned aircraft performing other flying activities, or over the heads of an unsuspecting public.   So, unmanned aircraft pilots can do things with unmanned aircraft that would be unthinkable with manned aircraft (in many cases because it would be stupid or dangerous to do so), but also such that people on the ground or manned aircraft can be put at risk by the unmanned aircraft's operation without risk to the unmanned aircraft pilot.  In other words, a UA pilot can go out and do things inherently dangerous to others without incurring personal risk.  They can act less cautiously not because of safety precautions, but because of personal distance from a threat that negates the need for safety precautions. ",
