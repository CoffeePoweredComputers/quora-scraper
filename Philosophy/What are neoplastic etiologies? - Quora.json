            "answer_text": "Neoplastic etiology sounds like a code word of some sort, but Neo can easily crack this one for us. Something of a neoplastic etiology arises as a result of a benign tumor or cancer. Here's why. Neoplasia is broken down like this: 'neo-' means new and '-plasia' refers to the formation or development of something. In other words, the new formation or development of benign or malignant (cancerous) cells and/or tissues. In effect, neoplasia refers to a benign or cancerous tumor. Tumor is a word that refers to a swelling of some sort. However, the word tumor is nowadays used to refer to a specific swelling, a benign or malignant growth (lump). That being said, keep in mind that not all cancers have lumps and bumps associated with them, but they still fall under the term 'neoplasia' nonetheless. Etiology refers to the cause of a disease.
