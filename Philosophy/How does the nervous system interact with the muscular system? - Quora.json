            "answer_text": "The nervous system interacts with the skeletal muscles via many pathways, both reflex and voluntary. Let us deal with just one set of muscles (calf muscles) in your lower leg. When you stretch those muscles, there are sensors (called spindles) in the muscles, which sense this stretch. This sensory signal is transmitted to motoneurons in the spinal cord, motoneurons are excited, send signals to the calf muscle. Calf muscles are excited and contract. This is the simplest reflex in the body, called monosynaptic reflex. There are more complex pathways for reflex control of muscles. Next, we can talk about simple reaction to the stretch. I can say to you, \u201cWhen I stretch your muscle, stand up as fast as possible\u201d. When the muscle is stretched, information from the spindles goes to your brain via the spinal cord and the thalamus; motor cortex of your brain sends a message down to the motoneurons of many muscles in the spinal cord via corticospinal pathway. These muscles when excited by their respective motoneurons will contract and you will stand up. As a child, when your teacher counted 1\u20132\u20133, and you ran. In that case your hearing excited the appropriate parts of the brain via the brainstem and the thalamus. Processed information was sent to the motor cortex. Motor cortex sent commands down to the spinal cord, and out to the muscles for running. During all this time, the cerebellum was in communication with the motor areas of the brain and receiving information from the sensors via the spinal cord. In short, all sensory inputs to the brain integrate, send information to the motor cortex. Motor commands then descend to the motoneurons in the spinal cord (or brain stem). The cerebellum is intricately involved with the sensory information from the spinal cord, sends information to the motor areas of the brain, and receives a copy of the motor commands from the motor cortex. Another structure of the brain involved with movement are basal ganglia. Like the cerebellum, basal ganglia are involved in control of movement, though they do not receive any sensory information directly from the spinal cord. ",

            "answer_text": "Somatosensory neurons carry signals about what is going on out in the body to the spinal cord. That signal may activate a reflex response or it may be relayed into the brain for further processing. If a motor response is needed, the brain sends signals back down the spinal cord directed to the location of the desired muscles. The ultimate effect of this signalling is that acetylcholine is released onto the muscle fibers, which targets nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and this opens ion channels that cause the muscles to contract. I could go into a lot more detail about this, but it looks to me like you just want a general overview of how this works. ",

            "answer_text": "Neurons don\u2019t just communicate with other neurons. They can also communicate with muscles, vasculature, and glands, among other things. To communicate with muscles, nerves synapse at a neuromuscular junction (NMJ), and tell the muscle to contract by communicating with neurotransmitters, most notably acetylcholine, in the same way they\u2019d communicate via synapse with other neurons. Binding of a sufficient level of acetylcholine (Ach) makes the muscle cell temporarily more permeable to sodium (Na+). Once a certain threshold of Na+ depolarizes the cell, just like with a neuron, the muscle generates an action potential which results in the contraction of the muscle cell. At the end of the day, the brain only tells the body to do two things: twitch and secrete. ",
