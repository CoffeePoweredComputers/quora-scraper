            "answer_text": "Most of our day\u2019s happiness/misery is NOT controlled by us. It depends on the external things rather than our own ability to control it. For a child, the happiness/misery lies is getting/losing a chocolate. For an adult, the happiness lies in the promotions, salary, beautiful_spouse, house, money. If we don\u2019t get those when we expect, we become sad. For elderly, the happiness lies in getting attention/care from children. Elaborating \u2026 As an adult, we have went past our childhood. We are pretty sure that \u201cchocolate\u201d is not the source of happiness. It is the temporary illusion for the child who thinks that chocolate is all he needs to be happy. Hence, if the child gets too attached/addicted to chocolate, he ends up having bad teeth. Although, tasting it makes the child happy, but getting \u201cattached/addicted\u201d to it costs him. Let him try to get the chocolate, but if he fails, he should not keep crying about it. The sad part is as we grow, the \u201cchocolate\u201d gets replaced by something else, but in most of us, the desrire of getting it desperately, attaches us so much that we become slave of it, and lose control of our own happiness/misery. Hence, Philosophy teaches us how to be master of our own emotions, no matter what are the external conditions. It liberates us from all the things we try to cling to, depend on, attach to, in order to be happy. Therefore, rather than learning things the hard way, we can try to learn from scholars, who have put their ideas/experiences in the form of philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "QUES-So what are some great examples of philosophy in daily life that would make one want to study it seriously?.. ANS-Listen, it totally depends on the society where you live your age grp and your friend circle\u2026.. (1)-SOCIETY- Most fucked up thing which actually trams your mind.People dont know the actual amount if labour required but they do know how to insult and make anyone drown in the greater depth of depression.What they knw is to compare one kid with other without knwing thier IQ and learning capability.Our society dont have any base ,its all rotten ,but but but thiers a thing if you can convert that dippresion into Motivation ,then you can easily knw the way to get diverted towards study .Take thier each comment as your easly available way of finding motivation (without wasting any mb on youtube) . (2)FRIEND CIRCLE- Literally this is the best thing any one could get.Assume that in your friend circle thier is a discussion going on some topic but you dont knw what that topic actually elaborates ,this acts as a motivation because this will let you to study and read that topic so that you wont feel any shame during group discussion.Else if your grp is that kind which surround themself with discussions on girls addiction and abuses then i can even help you but you have to call me for that \u2026inbox me your number.but instant advice is to leave that grp as fastly as you can. (3)AGE GRP- Yes well love to elaborate this vastly but on long answers my upvotes atio will decrease(matter of fact yes i am hungry for upvotes) .So for me my love life was my motivation.thier was a girl she rejected my proposal just because the second proposal she got was frm a topper and after then i nvr set back and kept evolving\u2026so this was me when i was in class 8th if you are younger than me then concentrate on your study because it wiil lead you to luxurious life mainly cars and if you are elder than me then do study bcz it will let you to get a beautiful wife \u2026jst kidding study bcz it is the thng which will help you . No friends,No family ,No gf is permanent but your knowledge is actually it will give you a proper payback. Study as much as you can because no one wants to be unsuccessful,set your goal and do labour according to it with honesty\u2026 All the best for your future life\u2026 THANKU MAYANK ",
