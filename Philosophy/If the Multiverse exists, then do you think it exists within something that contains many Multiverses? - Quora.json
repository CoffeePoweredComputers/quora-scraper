            "answer_text": "Yes. Based upon the constraints of evolving causality. Largely independent systems can coexist in the same overall causal structure; both in parallel and sequentially. Parallel Multiverses can be in any number, limited by the total size of the causal space. Within each parallel universe is the potential for any number of Sequential Multiverses. Most likely we live within a Sequential Multiverse where our physics constants are slowly evolving. This is evidenced by the Expanding Universe not being blown apart like shrapnel from a point in space. Instead, everything in the universe is moving apart from every other object. As physics constants change, mostly together, our observations do not seem consistent. The Big Bang becomes a slowly changing process. CERN extra dimensions particles, are tiny examples of massive conversions taking place in Black Holes: converting matter into extra dimensions. We will eventually evolve into an alternate dimension. Entropy an indication of those causal changes. In any closed or infinite evolving causal space, no matter how complex, eventually everything closely repeats, and after evolving through incredible numbers of alternate dimensions (evolving physics constants with different values), we exactly repeat. Trying to see another dimension is like trying to see Dark Energy. The Sequential Multiverse. ",

            "answer_text": "And therein lies the problem. The single multiverse was basically theorized to avoid the theological implications of the big bang (a beginning to the universe requires a sufficient, external, and personal cause). It does so by suggesting there is a \u201cbigger picture\u201d of a multiverse machine spitting out countless universes, each one different from the others, such that eventually every conceivable variable will be realized, which means \u201cwe\u201d were ultimately inevitable. But the problem is that the single multiverse theory cannot be falsified, and it also violates ockham\u2019s razor where the simplest solution to a problem is preferred. Plus it never ends. You may as well suggest that there is a multiverse producing multiverses that produce multiverses that produced a single multiverse that produced the universe we currently inhabit. If there is a multiverse producing multiverses it would only magnify the ockham\u2019s razor problem, and it also would have to account for why each multiverse is different and not the same as all the others. Who is keeping track? The simplest solution to the universe is, \u201cIn the beginning, God created\u2026\u201d. But the God doing the creations would have to exist outside of time, space and energy/matter; would have to be sufficiently powerful; sufficiently wise; moral (to account for objective morality); conscious (to account for consciousness); eternal, a valid source of information (to account for the information encoded in DNA for example), and personal, which includes having the ability to \u201cdecide\u201d. And all of those traits are descriptive of the God of the Bible. So the answer to your questions ends at \u201cIf the mulitverse exists\u2026\u201d. It most likely doesn\u2019t. IMHO of course. ",

            "answer_text": "Like, submultiverses? Possible. Actually I know an example; Kingdom Hearts is a videogame series about a multiverse. Each Disney movie has its own floating island. The Knightmare Before Christmas is itself a movie about more than one world. To represent this, Holloween Town is on the top of the island and Christmas Town is on the botton. Technically the movie also has the Real World and it strongly implies that each holiday has its own world and we actually see the Easter Bunny, but just having 2 worlds on 1 island was enough for 1 videogame. So, that\u2019s a submultiverse. At this point the multiverse is pretty much theoretical if not just hypothetical, so I have no idea how to map it. But if you could map it, I suppose different world would be devided by proximity like countries on Earth are.  DC seems to have devided the multiverse into spheres. Also, notice that very few of the numbered DC universes are more than 2 didgets whereas very few of the Marvel universes seem to be below 3 didgets. This sort of implies that all of them run along the same numbered universe system, but also means Earth 616, the Ultimate universe, Marvel Noir etc are all in an area of the multiverse even further from Earth 1 than the Overvoid.
