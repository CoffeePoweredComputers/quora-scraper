            "answer_text": "You have to understand eninem isn't your normal rapper like so many legends and others mentioned. The biggest shock was how he has become so big not rapping about the same topics as everybody else girls and bling every song, cool music . Thing about eminem is his raps usually go over peoples heads, use of multi syllables and methaphors etc. Another rapper from Detroit mentioned how he has a hard time understanding what eminem is saying , his verses is so clever he would be mentioning a mayor in his rap and nobody but maybe a legend or companies that analyze lyrics would notice, the companies that analyze eminem would go \u201che is refering to\u201dperfect example, some years ago he did a bet cypher , right before he dropped the mic he said a few bars..people at the show you could hear were laughing people posted wtf was that? however, if you looked at the analytics he was referring to somebody or something every verse. Eminem's vocabulary is insane ,he doesnt do like lil wayne, where he makes up words yet people ignore it cause it sounds good, flows well lol. Yeah we are in a generation where people have a need to be cool blast music in the streets sag their pants etc. Eminem doesn't make cool music..eminem now raps about Donald Trump,racism, NRA, hunger, world peace, terrorist, tragedies etc. That doesn't originate well with people. Just think the majority of people who wrote off revival didn't listen to it, saw track list and was like h*ll no! Trash lol. Em attacked the new generation for making rap a joke, not their fault, it is the fans, they love the same tired stuff every song,so they can blast in the streets and Bob theur heads, artist is giving the people what they want. people love what is simple and easy.

            "answer_text": "There are two types of Eminem dislikers (a diluted version of \u201chaters\u201d ah ha ha) One are the usual nuts who don\u2019t like anything rap. Forget them. The others don\u2019t like his penchant for shock and offense. Some of his lyrics about r*pe, domestic assault and violent misogyny and homophobia can be upsetting, even if he\u2019s just joking. He hasn\u2019t matured too much in that regard; the lines about Tyler and Ariana Grande were understandable for a young shock rapper but egregious for a 40+yo. I\u2019m personally a fan of Eminem but I admit that some of his work hasn\u2019t aged too well. I also am annoyed at the fact he hasn\u2019t lived up the potential of MMLP2 in recent years. He\u2019s trying to be a troll when he is capable of something much more than that and a lot of that has to do with his toxic fanbase. There\u2019s also a debate about his white privilege but to be fair to him he sort of owned up to it and deliberately avoided pop singles on his debut so it\u2019s not really something he can help. I think when people argue with stans we tend to overdo it and attack the artist themselves for stuff that isn\u2019t their fault (Kanye, BTS, rap boomers, rock boomers etc etc etc). ",

            "answer_text": "There could be several reasons: 1. The people who hate him don't listen to the words or don't bother to listen to the message. 2. Also a lot dismiss him because of his choice of words (he does use the F bomb quite a bit). 3. Many just dislike him because it's rap music, because they dislike the style. 4. Most don'tunderstand him and they only hear whatothers say about him. ",

And if you just don\u2019t like hip hop then you might not like him but he is more then just hip hop he is a product and a symbol to many. And if people can\u2019t relate to his struggles then they may shy away from him. ",
