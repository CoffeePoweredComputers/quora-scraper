Mathematics and Logic are nothing but conceptual things. They are essentially independent of the universe except, perhaps, a universe is required for conscious beings to dream up concepts. (The concepts may have physical reality in the brains of the conscious being, but those are representations of the concepts and not the concepts themselves.) Incidentally, very solid physical things such as rocks and tables are actually concepts as well. The reality that exists is some swirl of quantum fields whose interactions we describe as a \"rock\" or a \"table\". Mind you, if a rock hits you on the head I am happy to accept that it \"really exists\" [math]\\ddot\\smallsmile[/math] ",

The Big Bang itself could be the effect of something else. At best, we can think of logic as a byproduct of billions of years of natural selection over the entire biosphere on Earth. Presumably, the Earth itself is distant effect of the Big Bang, so logic can be regarded also as an effect of the Big Bang. Same thing for mathematics. However, this is all highly speculative. The Big Bang is merely the most plausible scenario given the empirical evidence available. A pinch of salt is required here. ",

According to some Multiverse Theories 'anything that can happen does happen'. I cannot think of a reason why this should not include alternative 'logic' and alternative 'mathematics'. I believe that both were discovered rather than created so they were an inherent part of everything from the beginning. From my viewpoint I cannot comprehend an alternative 'logic' or an alternative 'mathematics' but we should not allow our prejudices to cloud our science 'theory' judgment. ",
