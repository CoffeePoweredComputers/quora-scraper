            "answer_text": "Fear. I was once in a situation where the boss treated the employees really bad. After a long time we finally had a meeting with all the chiefs of the sections and concluded in unison that we would report to the board of directors. We all knew exactly what was wrong and how to bring the story without bringing the company in discredit. It was not like we were whistle blowing or something like that. Just an attempt to straighten up the situation. Next day already I found out that suddenly I stood alone: nobody had the guts to really act upon our words. Well, why? I guess they feared to endanger their position, they were quite comfortable with that and though they knew that a lot of the other employees really had big troubles with the leadership (it was more than once people even cried when they told me their story confidentially in my office), they chose for their own comfort instead of straighten up the injustice done to their subordinates. So they feared for their position. And fear in this case led to selfishness. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s called lust, the all devouring enemy of the world. Arjuna asks: O descendant of Vrsni, by what is one impelled to sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force? \u2014Bg 3.36 Krishna says: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world. \u2014Bg 3.37 Srila Prabhupada explains: When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for Krishna is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment. The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position. This inquiry is the beginning of the Vedanta-sutras, wherein it is said, athato brahma jijnasa: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in Srimad-Bhagavatam as janmady asya yato 'nvayad itaratas ca, or, \"The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman.\" Therefore the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into Krishna consciousness -- or, in other words, desiring everything for Krishna -- then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanuman, the great servitor of Lord Rama, exhibited his wrath by burning the golden city of Ravana, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the Lord. Here also, in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in Krishna consciousness, become our friends instead of our enemies.  ",

We only the to do this things that provide us pleasure and relaxes us but believe me nothing great in life can be achieved by such an approach. We should just ask ourselves before doing anything that why do we wanna do it? Is it really worth it? And trust me if your inner voice tells you that it is then rest assured that the thing you are doing is gonna take you a long way and that you will enjoy doing it for every single moment Thanks for reading.

We also have a soul (or the flesh) that wants what it wants even if it is the wrong thing to do. And God gave us the gift of free choice. So ultimately it is up to us rather we do what is right or wrong. Our heart (our spirit) knows what is right and desires to do what is right but our flesh (our soul or our sinful desires) wants to do what it wants to do and the two are always at war with each other. We have to ask for God\u2019s strength to choose to do the right thing. The enemy (the devil) will also try to convince you to do the wrong thing because he wants to destroy our lives. He is the one at work in our mind when the thoughts of doing what we know we shouldn\u2019t do keep running threw our mind. ",
