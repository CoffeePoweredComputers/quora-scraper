Originally Answered: Is Pi truly infinite, or is it a finite number so big we can't understand it? It is none of those things. It can\u2019t be infinite, it has a value between 3 and 4. That means it isn\u2019t \u2018big\u2019 either. It is very easily understood. It is the ratio of diameter to circumference in a circle. That goes back to the very earliest days of mathematics. If you can define it drawing in sand with a stick, it\u2019s easy.  The only infinite thing about pi it is its decimal expansion. But that is trivial. It s just another way of saying it is irrational. It can\u2019t be expressed as a ratio of two integers, no matter how large we make them. But so what? The arithmetical numbers are based on integers. In our definition of pi we have a very precise definition of the number as a ratio of two things. But only one of those can be exactly represented as an integer. The diameter is a straight line. It can be measured. The circumference is a circle, and can\u2019t. Imagine measuring a large circle by stepping round it with a straight ruler. You get an approximate value. But if your ruler is half the length, you get a better approximation, slightly bigger. But at every step, no matter how short you make the ruler, the length along the arc is always, always slightly longer than the measurement, because it bows away from the straight edge. Pi is the ratio of a number that can be measured as an integer, and a different sort of number that can\u2019t. That is why we call it irrational. That is why the decimal expansion never ends. Each digit we add is another, shorter, ruler zooming in, and another instance of the arc being longer than the chord formed by the ruler. We never get to a point where the circumference doesn\u2019t bulge out from the straight edge, so we never get to stop trying. But pi still exists. It is precisely the same in every circle, anywhere. Just because it can\u2019t be written in the only number system we use for calculation does not mean there is anything odd about it, beyond that simple geometric property of a circle. That can be explained drawing pictures in the sand with a stick. ",

            "answer_text": "This question could be answered better by a math professor, which I am not. The Wikipedia article on pi says that it has an infinite number of digits in its decimal representation (and I think the same is true if you use base 2, base 8, or base 16). But as a computer programmer, I would look at the practical implications. An article on \"arbitrary-precision arithmetic\" describes how programmers seek to maximize the precision available on a computer. The idea of infinite progressions is interesting. One experience I had with an infinite progression was in writing a program to solve the \"two trains and a fly\" puzzle the hard way. The puzzle is that two trains on the same track 100 km apart head toward each other, with each going 50 km/h. At the same, a fly going 75 km/h goes back and forth between the two until they hit. The question is \"How far does the fly travel?\" The easy solution is to say that the fly goes 75 km because the two trains will hit each other in one hour. I found that if I programmed a loop using double-precision floating point variables to calculate each trip of the fly, I got the right answer on my PC -- probably because the rounding worked out. In real life, however, it occurred to me that the fly would be squashed once the separation distance became smaller than the fly -- which is long before you reach the limits of computer precision. Conceptually, it seems to me that infinite calculations of precision should be different from infinite counts of real things. After all, a circle has definite dimensions that we can see, and we all know that the fly cannot survive, despite the mathematically infinite number of trips. But, for example, the infinite count of prime numbers seems like a different concept. Maybe it's just a shortcoming of my education. Edit after noticing the question about 22/7: No, pi is an irrational number that is not the same as 22/7. In Java, I\u2019ve read that you should use Math.PI to maximize your precision. ",
